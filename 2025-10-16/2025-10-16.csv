            French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu survived two no-confidence votes in parliament on Thursday, winning crucial backing from the Socialist Party thanks to his pledge to suspend President Emmanuel Macron's contested pension reform.
    


            The two motions presented by the hard-left France Unbowed and the far-right National Rally (RN) secured just 271 and 144 votes respectively – well short of the 289 votes needed to bring down Lecornu's days-old government.
    


            Lecornu's offer to mothball the pension reform until after the 2027 presidential election helped sway the Socialists, giving the government a lifeline in the deeply fragmented National Assembly.
    


            Despite the reprieve, the motions underscored the fragility of Macron's administration midway through his final term.
    


            “A majority cobbled together through horse-trading managed today to save their positions, at the expense of the national interest,” RN party president Jordan Bardella wrote on X.
    


            The French bond market remained steady after the back-to-back votes, with the government victory widely expected by investors.
    


            By putting the pension reform on the chopping block, Lecornu threatens to kill off one of Macron's main economic legacies at a time when France's public finances are in a perilous state, leaving the president with little in the way of domestic achievements after eight years in office.
    


            There are 265 lawmakers in parliament from parties that said they would vote to topple Lecornu, and only a handful of rebels from other groups joined their cause.
    


            If Lecornu had lost either vote, he and his ministers would have had to immediately resign, and Macron would have come under huge pressure to call a snap parliamentary election, plunging France deeper into crisis.
    


            But despite the outcome of Thursday's votes, Lecornu still faces weeks of arduous negotiations in parliament over passing a slimmed-down 2026 budget during which he could be toppled at any point.
    


            “The French need to know that we are doing all this work… to give them a budget, because it is fundamental for the future of our country,” said Yael Braun-Pivet, the president of the National Assembly and an ally of Macron.
    


            “I am pleased to see that today there is a majority in the National Assembly that is operating in this spirit: work, the search for compromise, the best possible effort,” she added.
    


            After winning the pension concession, the Socialists on Wednesday set their sights on including a tax on billionaires in the 2026 budget, underlining just how weak Lecornu's hand is in the negotiations.
    


            France is in the midst of its worst political crisis in decades as a succession of minority governments seek to push deficit-reducing budgets through a truculent legislature split into three distinct ideological blocs.
    


            Reforming France's generous pension system has been political kryptonite ever since Socialist President Francois Mitterrand cut the retirement age to 60 from 65 in 1982.
    


            In France, the average effective retirement age is just 60.7, compared to the OECD average of 64.4.
    


            Macron's reform raised the statutory retirement age by two years to 64 by 2030. Although that only brings French policy into line with other European Union member states, it chips away at a cherished social benefit beloved by the left.

            A Vatican commission for the protection of children has said the mishandling by the Catholic Church's leaders of sexual abuse allegations involving clergy is causing “ongoing harm” to victims, in a hard-hitting report released Thursday.
    


            The report also called out parts of Italy and Africa for failing to implement robust anti-abuse measures.
    


            The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, which released its second annual report on October 16 called for greater transparency from the Vatican and noted with “concern” that survivors often perceive the church's central administration as “lacking in sensitivity.”
    


            The report is the first to be released since the election of Pope Leo XIV and it sets out the scale of the challenge for the American pope in tackling the scourge of sexual abuse of children and vulnerable people inside the Catholic Church. His predecessor, Pope Francis, took some important steps to tackle the abuse crisis but experts and survivors have said he could have gone further.
    


            “We must re-emphasise that the Church's decades-long pattern of mishandling reports, including abandoning, ignoring, shaming, blaming, and stigmatising victims/survivors, perpetuates the trauma as an ongoing harm,” the report states.
    


            Instead, the report calls for the Church to offer “reparations” for damage done by abuse, including psychological and financial support, sensitive listening to survivors, public and private apologies and reforms to how abuse is handled.
    


            It includes scathing statements from survivors, who describe “denial and dismissal” from church authorities and even “disturbing accounts of retaliation” taken by bishops and other leaders when victims came forward. Survivors also talked about a “lack of psychological care” for those affected and “strong resistance to safeguarding reforms” in churches at the grassroots level. A “lack of accountability” from the hierarchy was frequently cited as an issue.
    


            “Figures of authority within the Church who perpetrate or enable abuse have perhaps viewed themselves as too essential and important to be held accountable. The Church's response to abuse should not repeat the same mistakes,” the report states.
    


            On accountability, the commission calls on the Vatican to start communicating the reason for a bishop's resignation or removal if this is related to “cases of abuse or negligence.” The current practice is for the Vatican to simply announce when a bishop has resigned without elaborating.
    


            The commission is led by French archbishop Thibault Verny and includes a mixture of church leaders and experts, among them Maud de Boer-Buquicchio, a Dutch lawyer and former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children who led the compilation of the report.
    


            The 200-page document provides an assessment on how churches in various parts of the world are dealing with abuse, including on the pope's doorstep in Italy. Catholic groups and victims have long argued that the Catholic Church in Italy has yet to face up to abuse scandals and needs to entrust this to an independent body.
    


            Speaking at a Vatican press conference to release the report, de Boer-Buquicchio thanked the media for “uplifting the voices of victims and survivors when the institutional church has failed to listen.” She stressed that victim-survivors repeatedly state they “want to feel heard and validated in their experiences.”
    


            Bishop Luis Manuel Ali Herrera, the secretary of the commission, said that Pope Leo had the “same strong commitment” to tackling abuse as his predecessor, although brings an “analytical” style. The Colombian prelate also recognised the call for the Church to move faster in tackling abuse.
    


Leo XIV speaks out on ‘dictatorship' of economic inequality and support for migrants in first major text



            In its report, the pontifical commission highlights failures in the Italian church. While it cites “significant progress” on child protection, it warns that “substantial cultural resistance in Italy to addressing abuse” remains. Pointedly, it said it “regrets” that significant portions of the church leadership have not even met with the Vatican's abuse commission and that several dioceses did not provide information to the commission about their safeguarding work.
    


            CNN has contacted the Italian bishops' conference for a response to the report.
    


            Meanwhile, in Africa, protocols for dealing with abuse were frequently found to be severely lacking, the commission said. In Equatorial Guinea, the report said, it could not find “any mention of procedures for receiving complaints” and in Ethiopia it cited “resistance” from leaders to take “direct responsibility” for abuse. Bishops in Kenya said “cultural taboos make reporting very difficult for victims/survivors,” the report added.
    


            The commission also calls on the Vatican's Dicastery for Evangelization, a department which deals with churches in the developing world, to invest more in the drawing up of anti-abuse policies, noting a “lack of sufficient resources” when it comes to vetting the safeguarding records of candidates to become bishops.
    


            The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors was established by Pope Francis in 2014 and in 2022 he asked them to draw up an annual report on how the church was dealing with abuse and safeguarding. The first report was published last year.
    


            Since his election on May 8, Leo XIV has said it is “urgent to ingrain throughout the Church a culture of prevention that does not tolerate any form of abuse,” while praising journalists for uncovering abuse scandals.

            Nestlé will cut around 16,000 jobs worldwide over the next two years as it works to slash costs, including through automation, the world's largest food company said Thursday.
    


            Most of the layoffs – about 12,000 – will affect white-collar professionals as Nestlé targets “operational efficiency,” including by automating processes and using shared services, the company behind such brands as KitKat and Nesquik said in a statement.
    


            Another 4,000 roles will go in manufacturing and the supply chain as part of measures to improve productivity. The overall job cuts will amount to almost 6% of Nestlé's workforce.
    


            “The world is changing, and Nestlé needs to change faster,” new CEO Philipp Navratil said in the statement. “This will include making hard but necessary decisions to reduce headcount.”
    


            The announcement comes as the rise of artificial intelligence has fueled fears over potential job losses in various industries. The chief executive of Anthropic, a leading AI lab, warned in May that AI could cause a dramatic spike in unemployment.
    


            Nestlé says on its website that it uses AI in a number of functions, including research and development. In its last annual report, it also said it employs automation and advanced analytics in promotional activities, such as work on discounts and in-store displays.
    


            The planned layoffs add to turmoil at the Swiss company after an unexpected removal of its previous chief executive in early September. Laurent Freixe was dismissed for failing to disclose a romantic relationship with a direct subordinate, which breached Nestlé's code of business conduct.
    


            The company's organic sales, a measure of underlying growth, rose 4.3% in the third quarter, it also said Thursday. Nestlé reiterated its commitment to investing over the medium term despite “ongoing risks from macroeconomic and consumer uncertainties.”
    


            Nestlé's biggest market is North America. Consumers in the United States have grown pessimistic in recent months as they worry about inflation, which could worsen because of higher US tariffs. However, consumer spending has held up so far.
    


            Nestlé's stock jumped early on Thursday. By 7:30 a.m. ET, it was trading 7.6% higher.

Moscow will never form alliances that target other countries, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said when asked about the possibility of Russia and the US joining forces to persuade China to join denuclearization talks.

In late September, Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested to his US counterpart, Donald Trump, that the two countries prolong by another year the last remaining arms control deal between them – the New START treaty – which is set to expire on February 5, 2026. Trump described the proposal as “a good idea,” but his statement has not been followed by any concrete steps from the White House. Previously, Trump repeatedly demanded that China also be included in nuclear arms reduction negotiations between the US and Russia.

When asked whether Moscow could join Washington to pressure China to the negotiating table during an interview with Kommersant newspaper on Wednesday, Lavrov responded that “Russia will not ally with anyone against anyone, especially against China. It is unthinkable.”

Moscow and Beijing have signed a set of bilateral treaties that “clearly define our relationship, aimed at supporting each other, helping each other to strengthen our economies, defense capabilities and positions on the international stage,” he added.

“The Americans have been pushing for years [to include Beijing in nuclear reduction talks]. China has its own stance. We respect it. China says that they are not ready, they are not at the right stage of strategic potential development and they are still far from parity. We respect that stance,” the foreign minister stressed.

According to estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Russia possesses the world's largest nuclear arsenal with 5,459 warheads, followed by the US with 5,177. China so far has around 600 nuclear warheads, but it is expanding its stockpile faster than other nations, SIPRI said.

Last month, Beijing welcomed Putin's offer to Trump to prolong the New START treaty. “Sitting on the world's biggest nuclear arsenal, the US and Russia should earnestly fulfill the special and primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said.

Italy's top court has suspended the extradition to Germany of a Ukrainian national suspected of coordinating the 2022 Nord Stream gas pipeline sabotage.

The Court of Cassation ruled in favor of Sergey Kuznetsov, citing “incorrect legal classification” of facts described in the European arrest warrant, lawyer Nicola Canestrini said on Wednesday. The case will be retried at a later date.

Police detained Kuznetsov, a former Ukrainian military officer, while on vacation near the city of Rimini in August. He denies any involvement in the explosions that disabled the twin pipelines built to transport Russian gas to Germany via the Baltic Sea.

Poland's National Security Bureau (BBN) said on Wednesday that it opposes the extradition of another suspect, Ukrainian national Vladimir Zhuravlyov, who was detained in late September in Warsaw.

“It is in the vital interest of the Polish state for the alleged perpetrator or perpetrators of the damage to the Nord Stream gas pipeline to avoid being held accountable for this act,” the BBN said in a statement, according to the Polish Press Agency.

Russia has criticized Germany for the lack of transparency and for shutting it out of the investigation.

Sergey Naryshkin, the head of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, said in 2024 that he had “information” that the US and UK were behind the sabotage. Washington, London, and Kiev have all denied involvement.

Germany plans to spend €10 billion ($10.8 billion) in the coming years to massively expand its fleet of military drones, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has said.

The plan comes amid EU discussions of a “drone wall” – a proposed network of air defense and surveillance systems to counter alleged Russian threats. The German UAV acquisitions are part of a broader militarization drive across the bloc, with Berlin taking a leading role.

Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the NATO defense ministers' meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, Pistorius pledged that Germany will take a greater role in EU air defense. Recently, several Western officials have accused Russian aircraft and drones of violating EU airspace, labeling the incidents as part of an alleged “hybrid war” by Moscow. The Kremlin has denied the allegations, dismissing them as unfounded and accusing the West of fostering anti-Russia “hysteria.”

Pistorius declared that Germany would make a “visible contribution” and that its drone purchases would encompass “all types and altitudes,” including both defense and attack craft. A ministry spokesperson also confirmed that Germany will deploy two Eurofighter jets to Malbork, Poland, from December to March.

The European Commission is set to unveil a “roadmap” for its “drone wall” plan this week, touted by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, according to media reports. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has condemned the idea, stating that “building walls is always bad, as history shows.”

Pistorius' remarks follow several drone sightings over critical German infrastructure, most notably Munich Airport earlier this month, which led to dozens of canceled flights and thousands of delayed passengers.

Some media outlets and officials have claimed that the drone flights have been orchestrated by Moscow.

Earlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin humorously addressed concerns about “Russian drones” in Europe, quipping: “They feel uneasy? I won't send them anymore. Not to France, not to Denmark, not to Copenhagen. Where else do they fly? Lisbon?”

Shifting to a more serious tone, Putin asserted that Russia has no targets in Europe and that discussions about drones are merely efforts to stoke tensions and justify increased military spending.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:tass.com","Press review: Putin meets Syria's interim leader as EU plans to increase military budget","https://tass.com/pressreview/2030521","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 10:02:38 GMT","

MOSCOW, October 16. /TASS/. The future of the Gaza peace deal is unclear, Vladimir Putin meets with Syria's interim leader, and the European Union plans to increase its military budget. These stories topped Thursday's headlines across Russia.

 

Israel and Hamas continue to implement the peace plan, albeit with delays and frequent accusations against each other. Another incident occurred on October 15: the Palestinian movement handed over four bodies of hostages to Israel, but one of them turned out to be a Gaza resident. The mistake sparked outrage among Israeli authorities, returning the issue of the deal's feasibility to the table. However, experts note that the international community's interest in resolving the sharp phase of the conflict outweighs the dissatisfaction of the parties.

Grigory Lukyanov, a researcher at the Center for Arab and Islamic Studies at the Institute of Oriental Studies under the Russian Academy of Sciences, told Izvestia that the result was predictable. Moreover, each of the parties approached the preparation of the agreement based on the idea that they ""rather did not need it than needed it.""

""Israel and Hamas are reacting more to outside pressure from the United States and regional states, which are deeply interested in formally ending the current phase of the conflict. Therefore, they leave room for maneuver at each stage, try to avoid binding measures or agreements and preserve the maximum number of options for exiting the deal by accusing the other side of undermining the agreements reached,"" he explained.

That said, the White House, apparently, considers the issue of exchanges closed, as it does not put pressure on either side to accelerate. Political analyst Dastan Tokoldoshev, in an interview with Izvestia, notes that Trump's threats were rather an attempt to frighten the opponents, ""and, apparently, Hamas is also well aware of this.""

At the same time, according to him, in the event of a continued disregard of Trump's wishes, Hamas may indeed face consequences - although the ""use of force"" in this case will not be directly related to the armed forces of the United States. ""Most likely, the United States will deploy full-scale military and economic assistance to Israel, support the technical strengthening of the IDF, but will not involve its own military personnel, who are already slated to be deployed in a coordination center they are establishing on Israeli soil,"" Tokoldoshev concluded.

However, according to Lukyanov, the current settlement vector rather reflects the desire and willingness of the countries participating in the negotiation process to recognize the establishment of a new status quo in the region, while the motivation of Hamas and Israel is related to attempts not to fall into international isolation.

""Regardless of Israel saying that it is ready for self-isolation, its society and economy are not ready for this, and, therefore, the cabinet of ministers is under serious pressure both from within, from diasporas and lobbying pro-Israel groups, including in the United States. It is quite difficult for the cabinet to ignore these demands,"" he added.

In this case, Hamas, no matter how much it claims to have strong and uncontested control on the ground, has lost its allies and faces the willingness of regional states to definitively separate the Palestinian issue from the topic of the movement's future. And this forces it to participate in the negotiations, so as not to be completely and totally isolated here and now, the expert concluded.

 

Syria's new authorities seeks to renew relations with Russia, Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa said during the first-ever meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on October 16.

The Russian leader emphasized ""exclusively friendly"" ties with Syria since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and that nation.

The recognition of Syria's new authorities actually happened some time ago, even though not everyone in Russia was happy with it, so it was somewhat ""incomplete,"" noted Kirill Semyonov, an expert from the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC).

The Syrian economy requires investments, and al-Sharaa's visit is an opportunity for Russia to strengthen its presence in energy, transport, and ports through concessions and joint ventures, but only if the military presence is maintained, believes Nikolay Sukhov, senior researcher at the Center for Middle East Studies under the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations.

In Sukhov's view, the status of Russia's military facilities was the key issue at these talks. ""Moscow needs a foothold in the Mediterranean for logistics and power projection there and in Africa. Damascus needs a new legal and financial framework for cooperation, not one associated with Assad's legacy,"" he explained. Sukhov does not rule out that Russia could help form a new Syrian army from Assad's former opponents. ""Damascus wants to enhance its combat capabilities and may coordinate with Russia on interaction with Turkey and the conflict with Israel.""

According to Semyonov, it was decided to retain the military bases long ago, but it is their efficiency that matters for Moscow; it is also necessary to determine whether both facilities are still required.

Sukhov believes that the visit of Syria's interim leader to Moscow is a strategic message both domestically in Syria and externally as an additional security guarantee for the new authorities. Moscow supports the state-building efforts of Syria's leadership and may even help facilitate their reconciliation with the Kurds and Druze, Semyonov concluded.

Ahead of the meeting, Reuters reported that al-Sharaa allegedly would demand that Russia extradite Bashar Assad. Sukhov has ruled out such a scenario. ""It is more likely to be a detailed discussion about the assets the new authorities are interested in,"" he noted.

 

On Thursday, October 16, the European Commission (EC) plans to unveil a strategy for implementing the program to develop the EU's defense capabilities, Readiness 2030. It includes an updated concept titled the ""European Drone Defense Initiative."" Brussels intends to boost the European Union's military budget more than five-fold within the framework of the financial plan for 2028-2034, to 131 billion euros.

Nadezhda Arbatova, head of the Department of European Political Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations, told Nezavisimaya Gazeta that the comprehensive plan for implementing the program to strengthen the European Union's defense capabilities is a consistent step toward a goal outlined in the EU White Paper for European Defense. To achieve this goal, Brussels believes Europe must act swiftly and jointly, gradually forming a defense potential capable of real-time responses to security threats. This mainly concerns enhancing the EU's combat readiness on the eastern flank amid the ongoing armed conflict in Ukraine.

""Discussing the roadmap at the upcoming EU summit will focus on specific issues of closing critical gaps in the EU's defense potential and its support for Ukraine. It seems that this top-level meeting is intended to compensate for Brussels' dissatisfaction with the outcome of the EU summit in Copenhagen on October 1-2. Convened to reach consensus on key priorities of rearming Europe, for the EU leadership it turned into an unpleasant display of competition for influence, political disputes, and hidden agendas that hinder strengthening Europe's defense potential,"" the expert said.

In her view, it is also notable that the roadmap is being presented the day after a meeting of NATO defense ministers and a session of the contact group on Ukraine in the ""Ramstein format."" This may be regarded as a move toward the Europeanization of the transatlantic partnership, which requires not only developing joint NATO-EU mechanisms but also steady political and financial commitments from the US' European allies.

 

Russia and India have managed to adjust the structure of mutual trade: consumer goods have been added to energy resources. At the same time, the parties have fully resolved the problem with payments, Akashdeep Singh, president of the Indian Business Council, told Izvestia. That said, the country will continue to purchase oil from the Russian Federation, which has traditionally been the core of commercial relations between the countries. India has started paying for them in yuan, but the ruble is still used in most transactions.

""It must be noted that the trade turnover between Russia and India is extremely lopsided. By expanding its exports to Russia, India can offset imbalances in mutual trade and reduce the large balance of rupees in our country,"" Yevgeny Smirnov, head of the Department of World Economy and International Economic Relations at the State University of Management, told Izvestia.

Transactions are carried out by direct payments in rubles and rupees. However, the expert community notes that there are still some difficulties.

""In particular, the speed and continuity of mutual settlements in trade are limited by the fact that the payment systems and banking systems of Russia and India are still not fully compatible. The key problem is challenges in converting Indian rupees received by Russian exporters, since they cannot be exchanged for other reserve currencies or, for example, transferred offshore. In addition, the Indians are concerned about the risk of secondary sanctions by the United States if they actively support such payments,"" Smirnov said.

At the same time, Russian energy products are still the main component in the trade turnover with India. According to the Kpler analytical agency, in September, Moscow exported 1.6 million barrels per day, thus maintaining its position as the largest supplier to the republic. Russian oil accounted for 34% of India's total hydrocarbon imports, as, with discounts, it remains the most cost-effective type of raw material. Singh noted that a very simple logic is in place here, as India, above all, thinks about itself, its national security, consumers and relations with various countries.

 

The problem of deflation becomes even more acute for Beijing under the conditions of trade uncertainty. That said, the tariff war risks resulting in greater losses for the US, which raises the possibility of successful talks, experts, polled by Vedomosti, said.

The experts note that along with global uncertainty, the general cooling of the economy and low consumer demand, the long-term decline in the real estate market also plays an important role in the deflation factor. More than 25% of the country's GDP comes from this sector, analyst Yelena Kozhukhova from Veles Capital pointed out. It traditionally was the largest consumer of steel, cement, equipment and services, added Kirill Lysenko, sovereign and regional rating analyst at the Expert RA agency.

The experts emphasized the high level of stability of the Chinese economy. The US may be hurt by the tariff war to a greater extent, believes economist Yegor Susin. This boosts the probability of successful talks between Beijing and Washington because both sides realize the destructive nature of new tariffs, explains Nikolay Novik, deputy director of the Center of the Institute of World Military Economy and Strategy at the National Research University Higher School of Economics. At the same time, he noted the high reliance of the Chinese economy on geo-economic factors and foreign policy due to its orientation toward exports.

Associate Professor of the Department of Economic Theory at the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics Yekaterina Novikova told the newspaper that in the event of the tariff war, Europe may end up being a losing party given the debts of European economies and the impossibility of obtaining cheap resources for the further development of the industry.

""China is not only the largest exporter and manufacturer but is also a holder of the US state debt, so Beijing has powerful levers of pressure. So far it is rather the US businesses that are losing revenue due to the tariffs as they have to pay for customs,"" Susin pointed out. He added that had Beijing not been confident in its economy, it wouldn't have escalated. That said, China understands that the uncertainty factor in the global economy is becoming permanent. In the future, competing by using bans and tariffs will become even more common, Susin believes.

The interdependence of the US and China remains high, even though in 10-20 years it may weaken due to efforts by both countries, said analyst Kirill Kononov from BCS - World of Investments. Kozhukhova notes that in the event the sides do not reach an agreement, competition in hi-tech sectors, such as IT, may increase. And China's IT sector may become more independent as the country has rare-earth metals, while for US companies this may mean bigger problems.

The tariff war may be a chance for China to secure the yuan as an international currency, increase exports to Asian markets and improve relations with India, believes Novikova.

ANKARA, October 16. /TASS/. The Western media tend to cover the conflict in Ukraine in a distorted way, focusing only on some successes of the Ukrainian army and not giving the whole picture of the situation on the battlefield, where the initiative has clearly shifted to Russia, Russian Ambassador to the United Kingdom Andrey Kelin said.

""It is the recent trend in the West newspapers, and UK newspapers are trying to single out some successes by Ukrainian army, but this is not correct, because they are not providing the whole picture along the front lines where we are making every day advances, and we have initiative of the whole front line,"" he said in an interview with the Turkish TRT World television channel.

""This idea that Ukraine has some local successes, it is just to raise some spirit in Ukraine, and especially among Europeans, so they will not abandon their efforts to continue to finance this war, to continue to provide armament, which only prolongs the long-run continuation of the conflict. There is nothing else,"" he stressed.

According to the Russian diplomat, Russian President Vladimir Putin's statements that Moscow has no intention to attack NATO countries are ignored by the Western media because they run counter to their policies. ""He's saying, like, they do not hear it. They are just passing it over. Over the ears, and I understand why, because the current policy line cannot include this type of statements,"" he said. ""The policy line of the European countries, of NATO countries, is to rearm, to expect a threat from Russia, and they even put some timelines when Russia may make an attack against NATO countries.

Prominent progressives dismiss GOP's proposition to discuss healthcare subsidies only after government reopens

US politics live – latest updates

The US Senate vote to re-open the government failed for a tenth time on Thursday after prominent progressives in Congress rejected Republican promises to discuss healthcare subsidies once the government is funded.

The Senate vote on a short-term Republican funding bill failed with just 51 votes. A second vote on Pentagon funding on Thursday could begin the process of fully funding military operations and ending the lapse in military pay if it passes. After the votes, senators are expected to leave Washington for the weekend, almost guaranteeing the shutdown lasts until at least Monday.

The Senate majority leader, John Thune, made his clearest offer yet to Democrats on Thursday morning, telling MSNBC he would guarantee them a vote on extending Affordable Care Act subsidies – the most crucial ask from the Democratic side – by a fixed date if they agree to reopen the government. “At some point, Democrats have to take yes for an answer,” Thune said.

On Wednesday evening, the progressive senator Bernie Sanders and representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pre-emptively rejected that kind of promise during a 90-minute CNN town hall, insisting they need actual legislation signed into law before they will budge.

“I don't accept IOUs. I don't accept pinky promises. That's not the business that I'm in,” Ocasio-Cortez told the audience. When asked if a Trump pledge would be enough, Sanders replied mockingly: “Oh yeah, no doubt, because the president is a very honest man.”

The New York congresswoman and Vermont senator rejected any short-term fix, calling it an attempt to delay political pain until after next year's midterm elections. “What we will not accept is for the ACA premiums to skyrocket on the American people,” Ocasio-Cortez said.

Meanwhile, the House speaker, Mike Johnson, has kept the chamber out of session for four weeks after Republicans passed their funding bill, with GOP leaders arguing that returning to Washington would only reduce pressure on Senate Democrats. Johnson and the Democratic minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, have traded barbs over the month, and have now agreed to debate on C-Span, though no date has been set.

Thune said he would support extending the healthcare subsidies if they included reforms such as income caps, but he would not commit to a one-year extension estimated to cost $35bn annually, and acknowledged he could not guarantee an outcome. He did not rule out the potential for the shutdown to run until Thanksgiving, over a month away: “I hope it doesn't last through Thanksgiving,” he said.

The standoff has left federal workers without paychecks for weeks, with no end in sight. At the CNN town hall, one worker with four children asked how he was supposed to feed his family. Another woman said her housing was at risk because the shutdown had blocked her government-backed loan.

Ocasio-Cortez tried to reassure them while holding firm: “My hope is that we're ready to resolve this as quickly as possible.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Overhaul of $1bn post-9/11 program would shift funds to states that voted for Trump in 2024 election

The Trump administration plans to shift terrorism prevention funding from Democratic-led states toward those led by Republicans, government records show, as it overhauls a $1bn program created after the 9/11 attacks.

Twelve Democratic-led states are suing to block the cuts, alleging that the Trump administration is trying to punish them for not cooperating with federal immigration agents.

The Trump administration released estimates in late summer for how much money each state should expect to receive from the program. But it later changed the totals, according to notices the states received in late September from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema).

Wisconsin, North Carolina and Ohio, which Trump won in 2024, saw the biggest percentage increase among states, according to federal records reviewed by Reuters.

Democratic-leaning Washington DC, Illinois and New Jersey saw particularly sharp decreases, with Washington's total cut by 70%, Illinois by 69% and New Jersey by 49% compared with what the administration previously said they would receive. California also lost 31%.

A spokesperson for the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees Fema, said in a statement that the new funding totals gave “greater weight” to threats from transnational organized crime, defined as criminal organizations that operate across international borders. It also accounts for “illegal border crossings”, the spokesperson said.

The US Congress created the program, called Homeland Security Grants, after the September 11, 2001, attacks by Al-Qaida to help states and cities prevent terrorism and other violent threats.

While the spending is only a fraction of the money states receive from the federal government each year, it is the latest example of the Trump administration changing how routine funding is distributed to states the president lost in the 2024 election.

In recent weeks, Trump also cut billions of dollars in funding for energy and infrastructure in Democratic states, including New York and California, carrying out his threat to target those states during the US government shutdown.

“It is flatly untrue to suggest that these changes are arbitrary or politically motivated,” a DHS spokesperson said. “Adjustments in award amounts follow a methodical, risk-informed analysis with the goal of ensuring that every dollar spent yields the maximum benefit for the American people.”

But Trump has linked funding decisions to politics, saying last week in the context of the government shutdown, “We're only cutting Democrat programs.” A federal judge in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the Trump administration from distributing the money until the court case from 12 Democratic-led states plays out.

The Trump administration asked the judge on 7 October to reconsider her order. New York, one of the states that brought the lawsuit, initially faced a 77% cut in funding, but on 3 October, Trump said he had reversed that. He did not elaborate on why. The DHS declined to answer how the change would affect funding for other states.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Indian-American Ashley Tellis allegedly obtained US military data and passed envelopes to Chinese officials

A prominent Indian-American academic and former US government adviser has been arrested and charged with the unlawful detention of national security information, including thousands of pages of top secret documents that were found at his home in Virginia.

Ashley Tellis, 64, who served on the national security council of the former US president George W Bush and is credited for helping to negotiate the US-India nuclear deal, was arrested and charged over the weekend.

According to court documents, FBI agents searched his home and found thousands of pages of classified and top secret records. Due to his employment with the state department and the Pentagon, Tellis had a top secret security clearance.

Tellis is alleged to have entered the US state department and a defence department facility and to have “printed on government computers, or asked a colleague to print, classified documents on topics including US military aircraft capabilities”.

The FBI has also accused Tellis of meeting Chinese officials on multiple occasions over the years and handing over documents in an envelope.

Tellis has denied the charges. In a statement, his lawyers said: “Ashley J Tellis is a widely respected scholar and senior policy adviser. We will be vigorously contesting the allegations brought against him, specifically any insinuation of his operating on behalf of a foreign adversary.”

Tellis had served in the US foreign service and is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington thinktank, where he had become a well-known strategic expert on US-India relations.

In India, where Tellis was born and was a regular commentator on foreign policy, news of his arrest ignited a political storm. “The forces working against India are beginning to unravel in ways few could have imagined,” said Amit Malviya, the head of the IT cell – a digital and social media arm – of the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), who had objected to Tellis's critical writings on some BJP policies.

Trump administration officials, including the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, have vowed to prosecute individuals who mishandle classified information.

The Associated Press

12:20 JST, October 16, 2025

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to relocate World Cup matches set to be played next year in suburban Boston, after suggesting that parts of the city had been “taken over” by unrest.

Foxborough, Massachusetts, home to the NFL's New England Patriots and about 30 miles from Boston, is set to stage matches as the U.S. cohosts the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada. Trump was asked about Boston's mayor, Michelle Wu, a Democrat whom he called “intelligent” but “radical left.”

“We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup games. “I love the people of Boston and I know the games are sold out. But your mayor is not good.”

He suggested “they're taking over parts of Boston” without offering details, but added “we could get them back in about two seconds.”

The Trump administration has already deployed National Guard troops to Washington and Memphis, and efforts to do so in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, have sparked legal fights.

Wu's office did not react directly to Trump's threat, issuing a statement that read, “Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions.”

Trump's comments came during his meeting with Argentina President Javier Milei and it wasn't immediately clear what he was referring to by parts of Boston having been seized. Earlier this month, however, there were multiple arrests in connection with a pro-Palestinian protest that turned violent on Boston Common. Four police officers were injured.

Trump has previously suggested he could declare cities “not safe” for the 104-game soccer tournament and alter a detailed hosting plan that FIFA confirmed in 2022. It includes games at NFL stadiums near New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

World Cup host sites aren't up to Trump. The 11 U.S. cities — plus three in Mexico and two in Canada — are contracted with FIFA, which would face significant logistical and legal issues to make changes in the eight months before the June 11 kickoff.

“It's FIFA's tournament, FIFA's jurisdiction, FIFA makes those decisions,” the soccer body's vice president Victor Montagliani said earlier this month at a sports business conference in London.

Trump nonetheless said, “If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni – the head of FIFA who's phenomenal — and I would say, ‘Let's move into another location' and they would do that.”

The president meant FIFA head Gianni Infantino, a close ally. Trump said Infantino “wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily.”

Minister of Finance and National Revenue Francois-Philippe Champagne is in Washington to attend meetings with G7 and G20 finance ministers and the annual gathering of the IMF and World Bank Group.Justin Tang/The Canadian Press

Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said a new International Monetary Fund report shows while the global economy is showing resilience in the face of U.S. tariffs, trade uncertainty is holding it back.

Mr. Champagne is in Washington this week to attend the fall meetings of the G7 and G20 finance ministers and the annual gathering of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group.

“The world is looking for stability and predictability and Canada certainly comes to mind when you are looking at that,” Mr. Champagne said in an interview with The Canadian Press at IMF headquarters in Washington.

“Obviously there are a lot of challenges in the world economy, but what people are looking [for] now is how together as the G7 how can we reduce the level of uncertainty.”

The IMF said Tuesday global growth has been sluggish, but it isn't as poor as previously predicted. The agency cautioned the massive U.S. tariffs still pose risks and the overall economic environment is volatile.

Global growth is projected to slow from 3.3 per cent in 2024 to 3.2 per cent in 2025 and 3.1 per cent in 2026.

“Risks are tilted to the downside,” the IMF report said. “Prolonged uncertainty, more protectionism, and labour supply shocks could reduce growth. Fiscal vulnerabilities, potential financial market corrections, and erosion of institutions could threaten stability.”

Canada has been hit hard by many of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and the IMF projected its growth this year would slow to 1.2 per cent.

The IMF projected Canada could once again become the second-fastest growing of the G7 economies next year – ahead of the United Kingdom and behind the United States – at 1.5 per cent.

But that projection is significantly lower than the one in a pretariff report the IMF issued last year, which predicted 2.4-per-cent growth for Canada in 2025.

Trade uncertainty still casts a shadow over the Canadian economy, despite continuing efforts by Prime Minister Mark Carney and Canadian officials to find an off-ramp for Mr. Trump's tariffs.

The President boosted duties on Canada to 35 per cent for goods not compliant with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade. Canadian industries are also being slammed by separate U.S. tariffs on steel, aluminum, automobiles, copper and lumber.

Mr. Trump has floated multiple other tariffs he wants to impose, including levies on pharmaceutical and aerospace products.

Mr. Carney met with Mr. Trump at the White House on Oct. 7. While no agreements materialized from that meeting, Canada-U.S. Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc is back in Washington this week to continue talks with senior U.S. officials, said his spokesperson, Jean-Sébastien Comeau.

The world economy is adjusting to a new and unpredictable trading order, Mr. Champagne said, and all G7 partners are facing fiscal constraints as they adapt. He said the speed, scope and scale of the transition has been unprecedented.

Mr. Champagne said the IMF report is “encouraging” governments to exercise fiscal discipline while making capital investments in economic growth.

“And it's exactly what we're doing in Canada to ensure long-term prosperity,” he said.

The Liberals under Mr. Carney – who campaigned in the spring election on his fiscal skills and ability to navigate the Trump administration – are set to table their first budget on Nov. 4.

Mr. Champagne promised the upcoming budget will offer “generational investments” in building Canada.

Ottawa has offered only a few examples of what's to come in the budget: prefilled tax returns for more low-income people, permanent funding for the national school food program, and the return of the “Canada Strong” pass for parks and museums.

Mr. Carney also plans to divide the federal budget into capital and operational spending streams, with the goal of balancing the operating budget by 2028-29.

The Prime Minister has promised to cut the public service as Ottawa looks to trim that operational spending. While Mr. Champagne did not offer any hints on where those cuts may land, he said Canadians understand the need to spend less and invest more.

The Canadian economy must pivot from dependence to resilience, Mr. Champagne said. It has a strong base, he said, pointing to its multiple trade agreements, critical minerals, energy resources and skilled work force.

“There's turbulence in the short term,” he said. “But I'm very confident about the future of Canada and our future prosperity as a nation.”

U.S. President Donald Trump's increasing interventionist push into the Canadian critical-minerals sector may propel Ottawa to follow suit, but some industry players are cautioning the federal government to tread carefully.

In the past few weeks, the Trump administration announced it had taken equity stakes in two Canadian critical-minerals companies, Lithium Americas Corp. LAC-T and Trilogy Metals Inc. TMQ-T. The U.S. government secured highly favourable terms in both transactions, with millions in virtually free warrants being issued, and a board seat in the case of Trilogy.

The development comes amid a broader push by the Trump administration for increased state ownership of private industry for projects the White House deems critical to the country's national security. The U.S. government has also recently taken equity positions in chip maker Intel Corp. INTC-Q and rare-earths company MP Materials Corp. MP-N

Opinion: Washington buying stakes in Canadian miners creates national-security dilemma for Ottawa

Canada needs a critical minerals strategy that actually works

Subrata Bhattacharjee, partner and national chair of the competition and foreign investment review group with Borden Ladner Gervais LLP, said it could be difficult for Canada to sit on the sidelines and not consider following suit in some fashion. 

“We are in this new world of increased state intervention directly in companies, in markets, to protect strategic interests,” he said. “It would not be surprising for the Canadian government to be looking at this stuff.”

Ottawa, in fact, has taken baby steps in equity deals in the critical-minerals sector in recent years through Canada Growth Fund Inc., a $15-billion public investment vehicle launched in 2023 that operates at arm's length from the government. 

In 2024, CGF paid $35.6-million for almost 20 million shares in Quebec graphite development company Nouveau Monde Graphite Inc. NOU-T, and this year it acquired a $156-million equity stake in Foran Mining Corp. FOM-T, a Saskatchewan-based copper development company. 

Unlike the recent Trump administration transactions, CGF deals have been done at terms that are far closer to market rates, and in conjunction with private-sector stakeholders.

Yannick Beaudoin, chief executive officer of Canada Growth Fund Investment Management Inc., said in an e-mail that CGF is “pleased to bring its investor's lens to unlock Canadian projects, support economic growth, and strengthen critical minerals supply chains for Canada, its allies, and its trading partners.” 

Rather than equity deals, the bulk of government funding for the Canadian resource sector has tended to be either through grants or low-interest loans, and the amounts have run the gamut. Ottawa in August provided a $6.2-million loan to Northern Graphite Corp. NGC-X, allowing it to keep its Quebec graphite mine in operation. Last month, it provided a $400-million loan to Algoma Steel Group Inc. ASTL-T to help it survive the trade war.

The Globe and Mail asked Natural Resources Minister Tim Hodgson whether Ottawa plans to take more equity stakes in companies and at more aggressive terms, similar to Mr. Trump's actions. 

“The Government of Canada continues to assess its economic tool kit to ensure its supports for critical minerals projects and companies are fit for purpose, recognizing geopolitical developments and emerging trends in global investment landscapes,” Carolyn Svonkin, spokesperson for Mr. Hodgson, replied in an e-mail. 

The idea of Canada demanding sweetheart equity deals isn't going down well with the mining industry, Heather Exner-Pirot, director of energy, natural resources and environment at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute in Ottawa, said in an interview. 

Government and private industry invariably have different goals that are difficult to reconcile, she said. While a company's primary responsibility is to shareholders, governments' objectives are political. There is also an inherent conflict of interest in having Ottawa as a shareholder because it has the power to grant or deny permits, which can make or break a company. 

“When I've talked to mining companies, it is not their preference to have government equity,” she said. “That very much adds complications to the governance, to your ability to attract different investors, to sell in different markets, and you just have this political layer that is unattractive for mining companies.”

On regulation, she added, “You can't regulate a project that you have an economic interest in, that violates basic fundamental principles of good governance and fairness.”

Martin Turenne, CEO of FPX Nickel Corp. FPX-X, said the most helpful funding tool for the junior mining sector would be widening the eligibility for the issuance of flow-through shares. He said they can lower the cost of capital by up to 50 per cent. Currently, flow-through shares can only be issued if the proceeds are used to fund mining exploration and development. While government grants and loans only benefit a few players, broader access could help the entire industry.

“It's a market-based mechanism, because it's not the government of Canada deploying its own capital, or choosing winners,” Mr. Turenne said. “It's something that's applicable to all projects, and then all companies compete on the basis of that.”

A Bank of America branch in New York City. The woman, referred to in court papers as Jane Doe, is seeking an unspecified amount of damages from both banks.CARLO ALLEGRI

A woman who says she was abused by the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein sued Bank of America and the Bank of New York Mellon on Wednesday, alleging the banks knowingly provided financial services that enabled his sex trafficking operation for years.

Bank of America and BNY declined to comment.

The woman, referred to in court papers as Jane Doe, is seeking an unspecified amount of damages from both banks. She is represented by law firms Boies Schiller and Edwards Henderson, who previously secured settlements of US$75-million and US$290-million with Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan, respectively, over their alleged financial ties to Epstein.

Neither Deutsche nor JPMorgan admitted wrongdoing in agreeing to settle.

Epstein died by suicide in 2019 in jail while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The circumstances of his death, as well as his social relationships with wealthy and powerful individuals, fuelled theories that others were involved in his crimes.

His case has become a political headache for President Donald Trump's administration. After pledging during the 2024 campaign to release files from the Justice Department's investigation into Epstein, the administration reversed course this year, prompting an outcry from Trump's conservative base and members of Congress.

The House Oversight Committee is now investigating the Epstein case.

In both lawsuits, Jane Doe said she met Epstein in 2011 while she was living in Russia. She said she became financially dependent on Epstein, who raped her, forcibly touched her, and forced her to engage in sex acts with other women at least 100 times between 2011 and 2019.

“As Congress works toward unravelling how Jeffrey Epstein was able to orchestrate his criminal sex trafficking enterprise for decades without detection, we are taking another important step forward toward justice for survivors,” Sigrid McCawley, a lawyer for Jane Doe, said in a statement.

Jane Doe said she opened a Bank of America account in 2013 at the direction of Richard Kahn, Epstein's former accountant, and that Kahn regularly sent her money for rent through the account.

Lawyers for Kahn did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Doe said in 2015, Kahn's assistant told her that Epstein was adding her to the payroll for a “sham company” and that she would receive funds through her Bank of America account. She said she did not know the purpose of those payments.

Her lawyers wrote that those transactions should have raised red flags for Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank. Epstein had pleaded guilty to state-level prostitution charges in Florida in 2008 as part of an arrangement that allowed him to avoid federal prosecution.

The lawsuit against BNY said the bank gave a line of credit to MC2, a modelling agency that the lawsuit said Epstein and French model scout Jean-Luc Brunel used to traffic victims. In total, BNY processed US$378-million in payments to women trafficked by Epstein, the lawsuit said.

Brunel was arrested in December 2020 and was found dead in jail in 2022, according to Parisian prosecutors.

Both lawsuits said the banks should have filed Suspicious Activity Reports with the U.S. Treasury Department. The lawsuits said such reports could have helped law enforcement stop Epstein sooner.

Seoul has said 1,000 South Koreans are working at online scam compounds that target victims globally. Some 200,000 forced laborers are thought to be busy stealing billions from prison-like sites in Cambodia.

South Korea on Wednesday issued a ""code-black"" travel ban to parts of Cambodia in the wake of the death of a college student there in August.

The South Korean Foreign Ministry said the ban includes the Bokor Mountain area in Kampot Province, Bavet City, and Poipet City. 

""South Korean nationals visiting or staying in those areas may be subject to penalties under the Passport Act and other relevant regulations. Citizens planning to travel to such areas are therefore strongly advised to cancel their trips."" 

The case highlighted the growing problem of fake job offers leading to the abduction of potentially hundreds of South Korean citizens.

South Korea is now sending a special team of investigators to Cambodia to confer with authorities there about the situation as relates to the student but more specifically, internet scam compounds.

""It is believed that around 200,000 people of various nationalities are working in Cambodia's scam industry, which targets victims worldwide, including in South Korea,"" National Security Adviser Wi Sung-lac told reporters on Wednesday.  

""A considerable number of South Koreans are also thought to be employed there. While the exact figure is difficult to verify, domestic authorities generally estimate the number at around 1,000.""  

Although Seoul initially reported that 330 South Koreans had gone missing in Cambodia, it has since revised that number down to 80

South Korea believes that 63 of those 80 are now in Cambodian detention after authorities there carried out arrests in connection with the scam centers.

Seoul says it is ""committed to bringing all South Korean nationals back home.""   

""We are arranging a flight to bring them home ... We aim to complete this by the end of the week,"" said National Security Adviser Wi. 

Of the 63 detained, Wi said there were both ""voluntary and involuntary participants.""   

""Most of them should be regarded as having committed criminal acts"" for taking part in the schemes, he said, regardless of their initial intentions.

South Korean officials tasked with discussing the scam compounds and the repatriation of missing citizens will be accompanied by intelligence and police representatives investigating the recent death of the South Korean college student. 

Initial investigations and an autopsy performed on the student's body, which was found in the bed of a pick-up truck on August 8, concluded that he had ""died as a result of severe torture, with multiple bruises and injuries across his body.""

On August 11, three Chinese nationals were charged with the student's murder as well as with online fraud. The three remain in pretrial detention in Cambodia.

Seoul says that many of those who end up at the scam centers are lured with fraudulent promises of high-paying jobs.

However, the more than 50 scam compounds operating in Cambodia are organized by criminal groups involved in kidnapping, human trafficking, forced labor, slavery, deprivation of liberty, and torture.

Rights group Amnesty International says the centers are operating on a ""mass scale.""

Late Tuesday, US authorities announced that they had seized nearly $15 billion (€17.4 billion) in bitcoin and charged UK-Cambodian businessman Chen Zhi with running scam centers exploiting forced labor to carry out cryptocurrency fraud schemes that netted billions of dollars.

The US Department of Justice (DOJ) called it the ""largest forfeiture action"" in DOJ history.

The DOJ indictment against Chen says laborers engaged in the practice of ""pig butchering"" — that is, gradually gaining an investor's trust before stealing their money — to rake in billions under threat of violence in prison-like conditions.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said, ""Today's action represents one of the most significant strikes ever against the global scourge of human trafficking and cyber-enabled financial fraud.""

On Tuesday, as the US and UK seized assets and announced sanctions against Chen's Prince Holding Company, the US Department of Treasury labeled the company a transnational criminal organization.

Chen remains at large and could face up to 40 years in prison if tried and convicted.

The Treasury Department logged a 66% increase in the amount of money US citizens and businesses lost to such scams last year, up to more than $10 billion.

Most scam centers are operated out of Cambodia and Myanmar, mainly run by Chinese criminal organizations.

AFP reported Tuesday that despite an attempted crackdown, new militarized call centers are rapidly spreading in Myanmar, where they are using Elon Musk's Starlink satellites to gain access to the internet.

Three passengers loitering on a local train after it reached its final station caught the driver unawares in Cologne. Police are seeking an unknown individual for befouling the train carriage with a trio of chickens.

German rail company Deutsche Bahn's (DB's) press team had an unusual tale to relate on Tuesday evening. 

A train driver on the S6 service from Essen noticed to his surprise on reaching the final stop at Cologne-Worringen that three passengers were still loitering in first class. 

The trio of chickens, who had even been provided an ample layer of straw to peck through, had seemingly either been abandoned or (surely not?) forgotten by whoever brought them aboard. 

Police handed the poultry over to animal services, Deutsche Bahn said. 

The train required thorough cleaning and missed its next journey as a result. 

Who transported the chickens on the local train, or how or why they left them behind, is not clear. 

Germany's federal police, responsible for security on public transport, have put out charges against an as of yet unknown suspect for befouling train services. Police said CCTV footage from the train was under review.

A Ukrainian national suspected of being one of the masterminds of the 2022 Baltic Sea blasts cannot be extradited to Germany, Italian top court rules.

Italy's highest court ruled that a Ukrainian national suspected of involvement in the 2022 explosions that crippled the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea cannot be extradited to Germany.

The 2022 explosions near Denmark's Bornholm island made global headlines after they rendered the pipelines inoperable.

The defense team in the case argued that the suspect's rights had been violated during the legal proceedings, following his arrest.

""In light of today's outcome, I will assess in the next few days whether the conditions exist to request my client's release, as the legal basis for his detention has now been removed,"" the suspect's lawyer, Nicola Canestrini added.

The case now goes to another court.

The 49-year-old suspect was able to successfully halt his extradition through the Court of Cassation in Rome. Federal prosecutors in Germany are seeking to charge him with jointly causing an explosion and committing anti-constitutional sabotage. 

German investigators believe the man was one of the masterminds behind the underwater blasts that destroyed parts of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines.

The suspect was arrested in late August while on holiday with his family on Italy's Adriatic coast. A lower appeals court has already approved his extradition. If confirmed, he could be transferred to Germany by the end of next month and tried in Hamburg.

Four leaks were later found in three of the four pipeline strands. Nord Stream 1 had been supplying gas to Germany, while Nord Stream 2 had never gone into service following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

A second Ukrainian suspect — a 46-year-old trained diver — remains in custody in Poland, where authorities are still considering Germany's request for extradition.

The Nord Stream attacks remain one of Europe's most politically sensitive unsolved cases, with investigators in several countries pursuing separate but coordinated probes.

			US president advised to prioritise those who have been ‘targeted for peaceful expression of views online'

Donald Trump could offer political asylum to Europeans who oppose migration.

The major overhaul of the American immigration system, some of which has already been implemented, would also give preference to English speakers and white South Africans.

The US president has spearheaded a major crackdown on immigration, suspending refugee admissions on his first day in office and announcing plans to slash the number of refugees allowed from 125,000 per year to 7,500.

The proposed changes would assess whether applicants would likely be successful in assimilating into the United States, officials told The New York Times.

Applicants would also take classes on “American history and values” and “respect for cultural norms”.

Mr Trump has been advised to prioritise Europeans who have been “targeted for peaceful expression of views online, such as opposition to mass migration or support for ‘populist' political parties”.

US officials have been monitoring the political landscape in Europe to determine whether citizens could be eligible for refugee status.

Earlier this year, the White House criticised a decision by Germany's foreign office to classify the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party as Right-wing extremist.

Mr Trump warned European nations in a speech at the United Nations that their countries were “going to hell” because of unchecked immigration.

He said: “You're destroying your countries. They're being destroyed. Europe is in serious trouble.

“They've been invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody's ever seen before. Illegal aliens are pouring into Europe.”

The president had already begun to enact some of the proposals before the plans were presented to him, including giving priority status to white South Africans.

He has claimed that Afrikaners face racial persecution in South Africa, which is disputed by the government.

The proposals presented to Mr Trump make the point that America's historical acceptance of refugees has made the country too diverse.

“The sharp increase in diversity has reduced the level of social trust essential for the functioning of a democratic policy,” one of the documents reads.

It suggests the administration only welcome “refugees who can be fully and appropriately assimilated, and are aligned with the president's objectives”.

Recommended

The president has not ruled out any of the proposals, sources said, but there is no timetable yet for their implementation.

Mr Trump was advised to cancel the applications of hundreds of thousands of people who are trying to gain refugee status in the US.

A limit on the number of refugees resettling in certain communities that already have a large number of immigrants could also be put into place.

This would be done to avoid the “concentration of non-native citizens” in certain areas in a bid to promote assimilation.

A spokesman for the State Department said: “It should come as no surprise that the State Department is implementing the priorities of the United States.

“This administration unapologetically prioritises the interests of the American people.”

Since returning to power in January, Mr Trump has enacted a forceful crackdown on undocumented immigrants.

The president vowed to carry out the country's largest-ever deportation scheme, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents carrying out indiscriminate raids against illegal workers across the US, including Chicago and Los Angeles.

New polling from The New York Times and Siena University suggests the majority of Americans support a crackdown on immigration but think Mr Trump's forceful approach has gone too far.

More than half of voters – 53 per cent – said they believed the process of deporting people was unfair. Around 52 per cent expressed disapproval of Mr Trump's handling of immigration.

He has even faced some backlash from his own base.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican congresswoman and one of Mr Trump's most ardent supporters, publicly condemned the crackdown on immigration.

“We have a labor force in America, across many industries, that has been built on illegal labor,” she said.

“That's a fact that also cannot be ignored, and as a conservative and as a business owner in the construction industry and as a realist, I can say we have to do something about labor, and that needs to be a smarter plan than just rounding up every single person and deporting them just like that, right?”

Popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who endorsed Mr Trump in November, labelled the deportations as “horrific”.

He also said on a recent podcast: “When you're just arresting people in front of their kids and just normal, regular people that have been here for 20 years – everybody who has a heart can't get along with that.”

Earlier this week, the US revoked the visas of at least six people for public comments they had made about the murder of Right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, who was shot while addressing a crowd at an event in Utah last month.

In a post on X, the State Department said the US had “no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans”.

			Senior US advisers say work continues on peace plan and returning bodies of dead Israeli hostages

US advisers have said they are working to set up “safe zones” behind Israeli lines where Gazans can seek refuge from Hamas violence.

Violent clashes erupted between Hamas and rival groups after the Israel Defense Forces pulled back to a “yellow line” as part of a ceasefire and prisoner swap deal secured by Donald Trump.

In an update on progress, senior US advisers said work continued on the peace plan and on returning the bodies of dead Israeli hostages.

Israel received the remains of two more hostages from Hamas overnight, meaning nine of a total of 28 have been handed over, in addition to 20 living hostages. The Palestinian terror group said it had now returned the bodies of all the dead captives “that it was able to reach”.

A US adviser told reporters on Wednesday that the administration was working to create safe zones for Gazans fleeing Hamas, saying: “Obviously there have been a lot of reports in Gaza of Hamas killing and going after Palestinian civilians.

“That's something that we've been working with mediators to send a message to say we'd really like to see that stop, as well as the US working with Israel to try and create some space in safe zones behind the yellow line for people who feel under threat to be able to go to.”

Hamas and Israel last week agreed to a ceasefire, the return of hostages from Gaza, and the withdrawal of the IDF from much of Gaza.

However, excitement has given way to concern among some Israeli families that Hamas has not honoured its part of the deal by failing to return bodies.

Mr Trump said he would allow Israeli forces to resume fighting if Hamas failed to uphold its end of the deal. “Israel will return to those streets as soon as I say the word,” he told CNN.

Israel Katz, the Israeli defence minister, threatened to resume fighting and “crush Hamas” if the group did not honour the truce.

Mr Trump's advisers said he believed Hamas was doing what it could to return bodies, but was hampered by the intense destruction of Gaza.

“It's a gruesome process… They're digging and they're finding a lot of bodies. Then they have to separate the bodies,” he told reporters in the Oval Office.

“Some of those bodies have been in there a long time, and some of them are under rubble. They have to remove rubble. Some are in tunnels… that are way down under the earth.”

His advisers said they had received offers from international rescue teams to help find victims and that they may even consider offering cash rewards to residents who could assist with information about where remains might be found.

Turkey and Egypt are planning to assemble an 80-person team to enter Gaza and help find the remaining hostages, according to reports.

“On top of all that debris is a lot of unexploded ordnance, and presumably, under that unexploded ordnance and that debris, there are many bodies,” said a second senior US adviser, who recently visited Gaza.

In the meantime, Israel said it would stop aid from passing through the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, allowing only people to cross.

“The date for the opening of the Rafah crossing for the movement of people only will be announced at a later stage, once the Israeli side, together with the Egyptian side, completes the necessary preparations for the crossing's opening,” an Israeli spokesman said.

“It should be emphasised that humanitarian aid will not pass through the Rafah crossing. This was never agreed upon at any stage,” it said, adding that “aid continues to enter the Gaza Strip” through other crossings.

At the same time, as many as two dozen American troops from Central Command are now “on the ground” in oversight, logistical and supervisory roles.

Recommended

Planning has begun for an international force to go into the enclave to stabilise Gaza. “The international stabilisation force is starting to be constructed,” said the first adviser.

Several countries, including Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Qatar and Azerbaijan, have offered help.

Overall, the peace plan was holding up despite pressure, the adviser said, adding: “I think it's going exactly as intended. Again, a lot of people didn't think the deal would be made. The deal was made. A lot of people thought both sides would screw it up or not keep their word.

“And we got through phase one very, very well, and now we're all working hard to create the conditions for a successful implementation of phase two.”

He added that the priorities were to return the remaining bodies, the demilitarisation of Gaza, and getting aid into the Strip.

			Donald Trump's Gaza deal is disastrous for the West's enemies, particularly Iran, Russia and China

The most important, and most immediate, consequence of the Gaza deal is how it is likely to prompt a wider accommodation with Israel. Preventing that rapprochement is why Hamas attacked on Oct 7 2023 and why Hezbollah (in Lebanon) and the Houthis (in Yemen) immediately joined them, backed by their Iranian sponsors.

All of them hated Jews and they hated the Jewish state. But that was hardly new. They passed that venomous hatred down to generations of children. It was the heart of their “educational” curriculum.

If their hatred is constant, what changed to prompt the attacks on October 7? The answer was the looming prospect of Saudi Arabia joining the Abraham Accords, partnering with Israel, and isolating both the terrorists and Iran. In the months leading up to the attack, the Saudis had repeatedly hinted that they were about to conclude a deal with Israel. They had already encouraged their smaller allies to join the accords to test the local reaction. So far, so good.

But the Islamist regime in Tehran knew that killing over 1,200 Israelis in an unprovoked attack would ensure military retaliation and stall any wider regional bargain as long as the war continued. They knew that taking hostages and holding them would prolong the conflict.

They knew, too, that using Gazan civilians as “protective shields” would ensure thousands of Muslims were killed in the war, no matter how hard Israel tried to avoid those casualties. The civilian deaths and destruction would pose an insurmountable obstacle to regional peace as long as the fighting dragged on. Meanwhile, the fighting would divert attention from Iran's fundamental strategic goal: building a deliverable nuclear weapon to threaten Israel and perhaps eliminate it entirely.

For almost two years, Iran and its terrorist proxies managed to fulfil their goals. Not that they were successful militarily. They weren't. First, Israel held off the terror onslaught from Gaza and Southern Lebanon. Then it began to systematically dismantle the “ring of fire”, the terrorist networks Iran established around Israel. After those networks had been crippled and no longer posed a strategic threat, the Jewish state moved onto its main target: Iran and its nuclear programme.

Israel managed to destroy much of that programme on its own, but some was buried deep underground, beyond the reach of its fighter jets. To take out those deep facilities, Israel needed (and received) help from America with its heavy, penetrating bombs and its huge, stealthy aircraft to deliver them. The combined success of the Israeli and American air forces is quite likely to have destroyed Iran's nuclear facilities and delayed their rebirth for years.

Iran never expected this devastating, comprehensive response, or its total success. That success not only meant the “ring of fire” was much weaker, it was also much poorer. Iran could no longer afford to pay the terrorists or replenish their weapons.

This set the stage for the effective surrender of Hamas (if not their complete disarmament in practice), the end of major fighting in Gaza, and the evisceration of Iran as the region's most powerful state outside Israel.

The most important regional consequence is that Israel has emerged wholly victorious as the Middle East' “strong horse”. It has proved to be overwhelmingly powerful, not only militarily but also economically and technologically in a region that only respects strength. Moreover, it proved beyond doubt that it is willing to use its military force to protect its vital interests. It is not just a strong horse; it is ready to pull its weight, however costly that might be.

Now that the ceasefire deal has been signed and the hostages returned (all of the living ones; some of the dead), the obvious question is: “What happens next?” Most commentators have focused, understandably, on the uncertain future of Gaza, on whether Hamas or other terrorist groups there will re-emerge (as they will surely try), and whether “Phase Two” of the peace plan will actually be implemented.

Important as those issues are, they are not the most important ones, locally or globally. What are these dominant geopolitical consequences?

The decimation of Tehran means that the Iranians and Palestinians can no longer block a wider regional settlement. That settlement hinges on partnerships with Israel. The key will be Saudi Arabia, when it finally signs onto the Abraham Accords, engineered by Jared Kushner during Trump's first term and likely to be extended now by his efforts and those of Steve Witkoff.

But Russia and China have also been further marginalised as Middle Eastern players. Russia, in particular, had spent decades projecting its power and enlarging its regional position. That role was based mainly on its alliance with the Assad regime in Syria and the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Today, Assad's regime is gone and its replacement, though no friend of Israel, will be wary of taking on its powerful neighbour without significant external support. It can't get that support from Iran, which is now too weak to provide it.

With Iran diminished, expect Turkey to step in as leader of the Islamic world. Ankara hopes to make Syria a junior partner, limit the influence of the Kurds, and cement its status as Israel's major regional foe. That's a troublesome prospect for Jerusalem, but not nearly as bad as a powerful Iran on the threshold of nuclear weaponry.

Globally, Trump has emerged as the most consequential US leader since Ronald Reagan. His achievement of a regional deal that includes both Israel and the Muslim states is unprecedented. With that tectonic shift, America and Israel have solidified their positions as the key powers in the Middle East, militarily and economically. That's true, even if Phase Two in Gaza goes poorly.

Israel's goals are easy to understand, if hard to implement. It wants to deter threats against its civilian population and continue to grow economically. America's goals are more complicated. Under Trump, it wants to assert itself as the region's only outside power but, crucially, it wants to do so with a much smaller, less costly footprint. That means regional powers will pay for Gazan reconstruction and security.

What Trump wants is a calm region that doesn't divert US resources, that maintains close relations with Washington, that excludes other major powers, that pumps lots of oil, and that fuels American economic growth with lower energy prices. Incidentally, those lower prices will add to the damage America and Ukraine are already inflicting on Russia.

If America means to have fewer boots on the ground in the Middle East and fewer ships in the sea there, where will they go? To the Far East, to contain China and deter threats to Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. That region is America's next big challenge. Turmoil in the Middle East had delayed that full-scale military commitment. That has now changed.

What about the war in Ukraine? Trump won't be diverted and dragged into a heavier commitment there. He is determined to let the Europeans pay for that. Let them buy the weapons for Kyiv that only America can produce. Win-win.

Trump keeps saying that this joint US-European effort can move Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table. Possible but unlikely. Putin has staked his regime and his very life on victory in Ukraine. He can't stop now with so little to show for such a monumental sacrifice.

The only deal Putin would consider is one he could discard as soon as he had replenished his military. That's a pause, not a peace. Nato members understand this grim logic of deceit and will install troops in Ukraine as a tripwire if Putin reneges. That tripwire means a Russian invasion would inevitably kill those Western troops and draw Nato members into a war that Russia could not win. That prospect is meant to deter the Kremlin from re-invading in the first place.

Knowing that he cannot pull off a deceitful pause and fearing for his life if he settles for a costly draw, Putin is very unlikely to end his costly war-of-choice. Trump may talk optimistically about negotiating with Putin, but the Russian dictator is more likely to lie on the undertaker's table before he sits at the bargaining table, sincerely seeking a compromise. Short of a durable bargain (and that's unlikely), the most probable outcome is slow Ukrainian progress on the battlefield, taking back territory as the Russia economy implodes and loses its war of attrition.

These wider strategic issues are front and centre now because of Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu's success in the Middle East. For Israel, that success means a much bigger, much more secure role in the region for the first time since its founding in 1948. That role is based on military and economic prowess and the recognition by most Muslim states, at long last, that Israel is here to stay and that it is more valuable as an economic and security partner than as a perennial pariah. (The governments of Keir Starmer and Emanuel Macron haven't learnt that lesson.)

For the United States, the Gaza deal means a smaller, less costly footprint in the Middle East and Europe, but, paradoxically, an even more consequential role there. And it permits a far bigger commitment to the Far East, aimed at deterring Beijing.

These changes are bad news for the West's enemies in Iran, China, and Russia. They are very good news, though, for America and its allies in the Middle East, Europe, and Asia.

“If I have to, I'll take him to court,” Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a CNN interview.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes (D) has issued a stark warning to U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana): Seat Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva (D-Arizona), or face a lawsuit.

Johnson has thus far refused to seat Grijalva, who won a special election to represent the seventh congressional district of Arizona more than three weeks ago. It is atypical for a person who has won a special election to wait this long to be officially sworn in. 

On Tuesday, Mayes sent a letter to Johnson expressing frustration over his refusal to seat Grijalva, noting that the delay leaves people in Grijalva's district without representation in the House and unable to access constituent services that other lawmakers can readily provide.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

“On behalf of the State of Arizona, I demand that the Honorable Adelita Grijalva be sworn into office as the representative for Arizona's Seventh Congressional District and be allowed to assume her seat without further delay,” Mayes wrote in her letter. “Failing to seat Ms. Grijalva immediately or to otherwise provide a reasonable explanation as to when she will be seated will prompt legal action.”

Mayes added:

The effect of your failure to follow usual practice is that Arizona is down a representative from the number to which it is constitutionally entitled. And the more than 813,000 residents of Arizona's Seventh Congressional District currently have no representation in Congress.

The House and Johnson have acted “in violation of the Constitution” in refusing to seat Grijalva, Mayes said, citing Supreme Court precedent to back her claims. She also stated that Johnson “is without authority to refuse her oath and admission.”

Johnson's excuses for refusing to seat Grijalva are “ever-shifting, unsatisfactory, and sometimes absurd stories,” Mayes wrote. She cited one excuse in particular — Johnson's staff has claimed the government shutdown is playing a role in his decision-making, which suggests that GOP leadership in the House “is trying to use Arizona's constitutional right to representation in the House as a bargaining chip” against Democrats, she said.

Mayes said she would give Johnson until Thursday to respond to her demands to seat Grijalva. “Should you fail to provide such assurance, we will be forced to seek judicial relief to protect Arizona and the residents of its Seventh Congressional District,” she added. 

Mayes reiterated her demands in subsequent interviews, saying in a CNN appearance this week that it appears she will have “no other choice except to take Speaker Johnson to court” if he doesn't comply. 

“If I have to, I'll take him to court,” she repeated, adding that there's “no other reason” to delay the swearing-in, aside from Grijalva potentially casting the deciding vote on the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files.

Grijalva has pledged that when she is seated, she will sign a discharge petition forcing a vote on the Epstein files despite Johnson's objections. The petition, which is backed by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, currently has 217 of the 218 signatures needed to force the vote.

Grijalva herself has suggested that the discharge petition appears to be the main reason for the delay. When asked whether this was the reason for the holdup in a Fox News interview on Wednesday, Johnson answered glibly.

“Bless her heart,” Johnson said. “She's a representative-elect. She doesn't know how it works around here.”

In response, Grijalva blasted Johnson for patronizing her.

Your job as Speaker is to swear me in @SpeakerJohnson. That's how things work. pic.twitter.com/FpC0smAoRj

“Your job as Speaker is to swear me in @SpeakerJohnson. That's how things work,” she said in a post on X.

In another post, Grijalva pointed out Johnson's hypocrisy, noting that two Republican House members were sworn in earlier this year despite the chamber not being in session.

“It took @SpeakerJohnson less than 24 hours to swear in his Republican colleagues,” Grijalva wrote. “He's stalling because he's scared of his puppet master Donald Trump. This delay isn't about process. It's about obstruction. #ReleaseTheFiles.”

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

Meta deleted his Instagram account after his death, destroying a critical historical record of the genocide.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

On Monday, October 13, legal representatives for murdered Palestinian journalist Saleh Aljafarawi filed complaints and demands for investigation with the International Criminal Court and multiple UN committees and special rapporteurs, Sara Segneri, a partner at Confinium Strategies, announced this week on social media.

The requests for investigations were sent to UN Special Rapporteur for Free Expression, UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances, and UN Committee Against Torture, Segneri told The Carceral Report in an email. The agencies will review the submissions and “hopefully conduct their own investigations,” she said.

“This was not a random tragedy but a targeted attack on a journalist — a young man dedicated to showing the world the truth of Gaza's suffering,” Segneri wrote on social media.

Just days after the renowned journalist announced the ceasefire agreement, a militia killed Aljafarawi, according to news reports. In June, Prime Minister and accused war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu admitted that Israel had “activated” militias in Gaza.

“He was in Al-Sabra to document the destruction left after the Israeli withdrawal, and armed men cooperating with the Israeli occupation shot him,” his father, Amer al-Jafarawi, told the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), who said his son was wearing a press vest and helmet at the time of the attack.

The beloved journalist was buried on the same day Israel released his brother, Naji Aljafrawani, one of the hundreds of Palestinian hostages freed from Israel's torture camps, as part of the ceasefire deal.

Aljafarawi wrote a letter to be shared in the event of his death:

I have lived through pain and oppression in all its details, tasted the agony and the loss of loved ones time and again, and yet I never hesitated for a single day to convey the truth as it is — the truth that will remain a testament against all who faltered and remained silent, and also an honor for all who supported, stood by, and championed the most noble, honorable, and dignified people: the people of Gaza…

Do not think that my martyrdom is the end,

but rather the beginning of a long journey toward freedom.

After his death, Meta deleted his Instagram account, thereby destroying a critical historical record of the genocide.

“The account deletion not only infringes on Saleh's right to free speech, but it also violates the public's right to know information about ongoing atrocities, and interferes with the investigations into war crimes and other international law violations in Palestine,” Segneri said.

She continued: “I have included this in our filings, both as to Meta's actions, but also wrongdoing by countries acting in concert with Meta or directing their actions.”

Israel has long murdered Palestinian journalists with impunity, but since the genocide began, the pace of assassinations has accelerated.

Over the last two years, Meta repeatedly suspended or restricted Aljafarawi's account, Segneri said.

“This was part of Meta's ongoing censorship of anything related to Palestine that was not pro-Israel, and their content moderation problems in distinguishing between reporting on atrocities vs. praise for ‘dangerous organisations,' e.g. Hamas,” Segneri told The Carceral Report in an email.

Human Rights Watch documented, between October and November 2023, over a thousand instances of censorship of content on Instagram and Facebook that had been “posted by Palestinians and their supporters, including about human rights abuses.”

Last year, The Intercept reported that Jordana Cutler, Meta's Israel & the Jewish Diaspora policy chief, “personally pushed for the censorship of Instagram accounts belonging to Students for Justice in Palestine,” although it was unclear if her efforts were successful.

Israel has long murdered Palestinian journalists with impunity, but since the genocide began, the pace of assassinations has accelerated.

Over the last two years, Israel has killed more than 250 Palestinian journalists in Gaza — more than “the US Civil War, World Wars I and II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War (including the conflicts in Cambodia and Laos), the wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s and 2000s, and the post-9/11 war in Afghanistan, combined,” according to a report from Brown University's Watson Institute released in April.

More total journalists and media workers were killed in the Iraq war over a more than twenty year period — from the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 to March of this year. However, in Iraq, about 13 journalists were killed per year. In Gaza, about 13 journalists were killed each month, according to the report.

“Israel is engaging in the deadliest and most deliberate effort to kill and silence journalists that CPJ has ever documented,” the press freedom group said in a statement on its website.

“Palestinian journalists are being threatened, directly targeted, and murdered by Israeli forces, and are arbitrarily detained and tortured in retaliation for their work,” the group continued.

In August, Israel bombed a media tent outside Al-Shifa hospital, killing Al Jazeera correspondents Anas al-Sharif and Mohammed Qreiqeh, and camera operators Ibrahim Zaher and Mohammed Noufal. Freelance cameraman Momen Aliwa and freelance journalist Mohammed al-Khalidi were also killed.

Before his murder, Israeli military officials had repeatedly threatened al-Sharif.

“Since the beginning of the war, I have personally faced several threats and assassination attempts by the Israeli army. I lost my father and several relatives as part of the efforts to force me to stop my news coverage,” al-Sharif told Drop Site News earlier this year.

“Despite the threats and danger, I will not, and will never, stop this coverage — until my last breath, because I am fighting for a just cause.”

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

We're concerned, because Truthout is not immune to such bad-faith attacks. Nevertheless, we refuse to be intimidated or forced to back down.

Kelly Hayes: Welcome to “Movement Memos,” a Truthout podcast about organizing, solidarity, and the work of making change. I'm your host, writer and organizer Kelly Hayes. Today, we will be hearing from two of my favorite people, author and organizer Mariame Kaba, and writer, organizer, and zinester Red Schulte. We'll be talking about political education that actually builds power: zines as analog infrastructure, reviving our base-building skills, and creating spaces where people learn, practice, and belong. We'll also talk about censorship, link rot, organizing outside the law, and why tenderness, discernment, and making mistakes together are survival skills under fascism.

If you appreciate this podcast, and you would like to support “Movement Memos,” you can subscribe to Truthout's newsletter or make a donation at truthout.org.

KH: Red and Mariame, welcome to “Movement Memos.”

Mariame Kaba: Thank you for having us.

Red Schulte: Thank you so much, Kelly.

KH: How are you both doing today?

RS: I'm hanging in there. I've been holding some really big complicated feelings recently while helping a project sunset, and to be honest, I'm quite tired, but I am real thrilled to be here talking with y'all right now. You both always really sooth my spirit.

MK: This is Mariame and I unfortunately actually today am feeling a little bit under the weather, but I really wanted to have this conversation with the two of you who are some of my closest comrades and friends, and so I am here and hopefully coherent.

KH: Well, I'm so grateful to be in conversation with you both. I learn something new every time we talk, and I really value the opportunity to think alongside you. To begin, could you each share a bit about yourselves and the work you do?

RS: Sure. This is Red. Hey y'all. I'm from rural Texas originally, but have worked and organized in Chicago, Illinois, and New York City for many years. I'm a sex worker community organizer, zinester, oral historian. I'm also a PhD student in art history. I politically exist somewhere on the anarchism-to-full-communism spectrum. I'm also extremely invested in print culture, analog film, and other media to the nerdy n-th degree as you both can confirm. I've also been heavily involved with prison abolition, abortion, harm reduction, and education justice struggles since my early youth.

MK: Yes, I currently am the co-director or co-principal of Interrupting Criminalization, which I started with my friend Andrea Ritchie back in 2018. Interrupting Criminalization is a movement hub, a resource, a space for convening people, and all with an eye towards how we interrupt criminalization, which we see as basically fuel for fascism and so could not be more important in this moment. But I'm also part of a whole bunch of other formations that I've been part of co-creating with other people for many years, including Survived & Punished national, including a couple of library-related projects that I recently started in the last couple of years with other people.

One is called For The People: A Leftist Library Project and the other is the New York City Public Library Action Network, so NYCPLAN. I also run a small press, a micro-press called Sojourners for Justice Press with my friend Neta Bomani, and I launched that in 2020. Neta came on board to co-direct in 2022, and we started along with our regular publishing and printing something called the Black Zine Fair last year, so this year was our second year of doing that work, so I'm able to use all of my loves around fighting against criminalization, trying to figure out a library for the 21st century, and making stuff with others through print and publications, through all of that. I'll stop there, but the list is long of all the things I'm doing on a regular basis, so I'll just lift up those for now.

KH: I appreciate those highlights. I know that if we tried to name all of the projects that Mariame's involved with, we would run out of time, and the episode would be over.

MK: [Laughs] 

RS: It's true.

KH: So many plates spinning. As your friends, it's really something to behold.

MK: It's really true. I can't help it. It's not…

RS: No, you can't.

MK: I know. I know y'all, I know. I'm trying.

KH: Well, we love this about you.

RS: It's true, very much.

KH: You've both been involved with political and popular education efforts for many years. I want to talk about the importance of that work in this moment and what it can and should look like. Let's start with zines. I know many of our listeners probably love reading and making zines, but I've learned the hard way that not everyone knows what a zine is or why they're important. Red, could you start us off with an explanation of what zines are and why they are such an important medium for activists and marginalized people?

RS: Absolutely, Kelly. I know a lot of people have their own conceptions of zines, but I think it's helpful to have a more general working definition, and for me, that working definition is that zines are small, independently published and distributed print objects that are typically free or cheap to both produce and acquire and are often circulated creatively. And so to wax a little bit on that, zines can also feature original artwork. They can have comic strips in them; they can have collage, photographs, stamp art, typed or handwritten text; and these can be made by an individual or a small group of people collaboratively. Zines can be informative or incendiary. They can also be mundane or deeply personal. I think zines really — what keeps drawing me back to them over and over and over again — is that zines create these opportunities for us to play, to feel, imagine, and prepare our hearts and minds.

KH: Can you share a bit about your own relationship to zines and zine-making, and why you think low-cost DIY publications matter right now? 

RS: Sure. I've been making zines pretty consistently since I was 14 years old, so over 23 years now. Zines were where I first found my voice as a young person, through chain letters and zine swaps. Zines are also where I was first introduced to anti-war rhetoric and movement and also DIY or do-it-yourself ideas when I was in high school going to punk shows. And then again in feminist and more radical communities later in college, zines were always in the mix and I was just so hungry for them and sought them out. Seeing the amateur and the approachable aesthetics immediately made zines feel accessible and like I could make them too. That was that first initial thought, I could do this and I probably should be doing this. Zines looked and felt like they were for everyone. There's also something I think so cool to me at least about having that cheat code to make Xerox copies more affordable, which — RIP — a lot of that went to the wayside with the rise of the bigger chains, but having that cheat code for free copies just made me feel really, really powerful.

Or having that one friend who could liberate office supplies or sneak you into their parents or their jobs so that you can make all these clandestine copies. The anonymity available, the little power in your hands to share ideas and feelings and art, I think it was and still is, that feeling of doing, of action. That's what really spoke to me early on and what keeps speaking to me. I've been a part of several zine collectives over the years and currently help run the Support Ho(s)e Collective zine distro and that distro circulates sex worker-made propaganda and print resources at protests, zine fests and fairs and other events. We also use our zines to really think through what we've politically organized and taken on over the course of a year together in struggle. This formation has been around for about 10 years now, and so we make a yearbook zine together every year to really document that year in struggle and also think through some of the major, really the losses, the grief, and also some of our personal victories and movement-based wins.

It's where we share our art and our rage and I'm really proud of the work that that collective is doing, especially toward its zinemaking and its political education and resource-based materials that we circulate. And I think with the rampant censorship and criminalization of online spaces and also, let's be honest, the sheer toxicity of social media, I think that zines can be a balm and an armor for us. They can slow us down in really helpful ways. We can read zines to ourselves and others, taking time to process their content, and I think when we feel them in our hands or in our laps, their unique art or budget stylings become a counter to the glossy AI garbage that is seen all too often on our phone or computer or our TV screens. Zines then can offer us something physical, concrete to discuss and share with friends and comrades. And zines invite dialogue and create a literal container for discourse, and that takes longer than a few seconds to tweet or comment on something out into the void. Zines linger.

KH: Mariame, could you say a bit about your relationship to zines?

MK: Yes, absolutely. It's funny because Red talked about when they started making zines and they started at 14 and that's about when I also started, earlier than Red did. I'm older than Red. But I basically discovered zines as a young person probably when I was around maybe 13. I didn't start making them until a year after that, but I was… There used to be a record store here in New York City called Tower Records, and that's where I found my first copy of a zine called Bad Seed from Miriam Linna. And Miriam Linna was a drummer in a band called The Cramps, and she made Bad Seed as this kind of like a celebration she called it of juvenile delinquency. And in it, she's basically just making fun of the moral panic that's swept through the U.S. in the 1950s. And so she looks at the way that that panic manifested in books and music, movies, fashions of the time. And so this was like a eight and a half by five and a half stapled zine and I still have maybe four copies of that original set of zines that I bought over time.

I didn't used to collect them. I would just get a zine and then I would give it away to somebody else. I would share it with other people, but this one is one of the few ones that I kept copies of over time. And I think it was about a year after that that I made my first zine and that was about a young man named Michael Stewart who was killed by the NYPD in 1983, and it really marked me as a very young person growing up in New York City at the time. Maybe I was like 12 or so years old when he was killed, but he felt so just… I saw him on the news and in the paper and his face, he seemed very relatable to me and like he could be my brother. I felt very connected. And so a couple of years after he was killed, I made that zine, but mostly I was making zines about music because I was a music obsessive. I made some zines about dance because I was a fledgling dancer.

And I just loved zines because it allowed me to really combine my love of journaling with other inspirations to create unique publications. I made them in small batch editions, maybe four or five. I barely shared them with anyone that I knew because I was a little bit embarrassed really honestly, as a young person making zines. Even though I grew up in New York City, most of the zinesters that I knew of were white and men, male, and I don't think I met another person of color who liked or made zines until the mid-90s when I was well into my twenties. And it doesn't mean that those people didn't actually exist. Obviously they did, but they were not visible to me or to the circles that I was growing up in. I've been a zine maker since I was a teenager, and now that I'm in my late middle age, that practice has continued but with modifications.

I used to make zines like using photocopiers, glue, scissors at my dad's office and using his copy machine. And over time I've moved on to collaborating artists and designers to create, I think, what I think are beautiful and engaging publications that are self-published, but maybe more people would consider those now art books than zines. But I still hold on very much to a zinester spirit in my work. And I've always been a pamphleteer, so I'm also interested in continuing that tradition in multiple ways. That's how I came to start making them myself and really appreciating them as a technology for disseminating information and making yourself known to yourself and others in some very specific ways.

KH: Thank you for that. 

Red, your practice of teaching people how to make zines has been important to a number of people in my life, including some young trans folks for whom that form of expression has become really important in recent years. And Mariame, your zines have been such a great learning resource for me. I've been fortunate enough to contribute to a couple of them over the years. And I did want to uplift one, in particular, that I think is especially relevant right now. Your zine about tear gas, A [short] History of U.S. Police & Tear Gas is an important and timely read, given the federal use of so-called “less lethal” munitions in recent weeks. Federal agents in Chicago have gassed protesters and residents going about their lives, in their own neighborhoods. In one case, the agents dropped a canister of tear gas in the street while they were being heckled by community members. In another, they gassed a crowd that formed after the agents had shot a woman in her car. Now, I am no stranger to tear gas, unfortunately, but when I read your zine, I did learn something I did not know about the history of tear gas in the United States — which was that General Amos Fries, who was one of the major advocates for commercializing tear gas for domestic use, in the U.S., after it was banned as a weapon of war, actually did a demonstration of the product in 1921 where he gassed a Girl Scout troop to prove how safe and harmless teargas was. So about 60 Girl Scouts were sobbing, weeping and vomiting, during this ill-conceived commercial demonstration, and because this is the United States, this still somehow became a fully normalized, prevalent product that is in use today.

RS: What a hellscape.

MK: When I read about that, I was like, oh my God, this is so typical of this fucking country.

KH: It really is, and people should know these things. I think sometimes we think the current political moment is uniquely absurd, and while we are definitely in circus territory, this country has a rich history of what-the-fuck moments that slowed absolutely nothing down. It's important to remember that. I think this is also a good moment to revisit Mariame's zine, White People Hate Protest, because I think it's important to examine the historical reality of what popular support for protest has and hasn't looked like. Sometimes, we can get really distracted or discouraged by the naysayers and the social media protest critics, but many historical moments of protest that are widely celebrated now were not received that way at the time — at all. And, in fact, white support for protest, particularly Black or brown-led protest has, historically, been very fickle. So, we have to remember that protest isn't a mirror of popular opinion, as we understand it, or something that's meant to placate every amateur pundit. It's about calling people forward and together, toward and around an agenda for change. That's always going to be criticized and nitpicked, especially by people who live comfortably within the status quo, and I appreciate the ways that your work reminds us of that. 

And speaking of online commentary, nowadays, a lot of political expression happens in the digital world. And while it makes sense that organizers have leveraged tools like social media, we have seen a trend, in recent years, where these tools have been increasingly weaponized against us. Algorithms that reward conflict and fuel pile-ons have also chipped away at our social skills, making it harder for people to connect and relate to each other on and offline. All of this conflict and fragmentation have generated a lot of harmful patterns in our movements. Additionally, the impermanence of digital content also poses a threat to knowledge sharing and the preservation of our movement history. As we confront these challenges, what do you think we need to revive or reclaim?

RS: Thank you for that question and that framing, Kelly. I think it would behoove us, maybe I'll start here, to revive patience and grace and discerning critical thought and to just make those more popular, just like let's make all those things more popular. Honestly, I do not see those traits that I just named on social media very often on the Left. I also think that our collective attention spans are shot and that only serves this digital impermanence you're talking about and the 24-hour entertainment news cycle trends, of course don't make anything easy to digest or otherwise. I don't know y'all. Of course, I think we should use all the tools at our disposal, but I don't think that we often fully consider the consequences of the latest and newest tools or fully the ramifications that might abound from them. And personally, the work that I'm involved with benefits from small, intimate trust built relationships where political education and strategic and tactical conversations happen in person, I do not think that there's currently an adequate replacement for that.

I think especially when we're talking about the fallout, whether from actual right prosecution, the cultural and the impact, the social impact of things like SESTA-FOSTA rights and the amendments to the Communications Act, as well as other similar types of acts like the EARN IT Act, et cetera. Those impacts are so, so deeply violent and especially on sex working and queer and trans healthcare and harm reduction spaces online, so spaces where people might be communicating about how to access hormones or safe injection sites or other kinds of harm reduction-based practices or trans healthcare needs, sex workers trying to form safer bonds of working with one another, advertise and more affordable or safer means that they self-determine. All of these things are actively under threat, being criminalized, persecuted, et cetera. And so we were finding each other online. In sex working community we often joke that sex workers built the internet, at least the interesting internet, and we were finding each other there.

We were finding work, we were finding community, queer and trans people finding each other, finding and sharing stories and keeping especially queer and trans youth safer by being able to share history and experience. And all of those spaces are fraught now with the fear of persecution and criminalization. And so I think I started my comment with asking us to be kinder in terms of how we move in online spaces, but I also want us to work smarter. Work smarter when you're in online spaces. Yes, abandon our love for drama and rumor, but also abandon our need to identify every single thing that we're doing to everyone all the time. Please, we need to rein that in. I'm rambling now, so I digress.

MK: I think you both know how I feel about social [media]. I always have felt that it's a really useful tool that can be employed towards increasing our reach in terms of helping more people access information and resources. It can be a useful organizing platform to help people find each other. I think all those things are real. I think now under fascism, we should be even more concerned about the bad actors that are on these platforms that are spending their time looking to pile on people, looking to dox people, looking to harm people in various kinds of ways. We need more discernment than ever, and I think that we lack the ability to have discernment like the stranger that's in your mentions like, who is this person? We just have no idea. And people really respond and react and in ways that… The level of infiltration that used to have to happen in person is now so easy to do online. I think discernment is really, really called for.

I also think in terms of the question of digital as it relates to what we were talking about zines, people are also making digital zines and also making zines available through digital means. And I just want to give a short example of the difficulty of that in some ways. For the many years I've had a lot of my zines, not most of them, but a lot of them that I've made through various organizations, specifically Project NIA and other organizations that since sunsetted. I put them online, I put them on Issuu, which is this private platform where you can pay and you can put your documents. I know a lot of people who are listening probably have read a document on Issuu. And when I was working at Project NIA we could pay the $200 a month or whatever hosting cost for having our publications on there and allowing people to be able to read them either online or download them directly for use.

Well, earlier this year Issu decided to increase significantly the cost of hosting your items and your reading materials on their platform, just like really, I think almost like a 25 percent or 30 percent increase in the cost. And so now if you want to not just have your digital zines uploaded there for people to use and read, you have to pay so much more extra if you also want that feature of being able to allow people to download that. A lot of people, myself included, now are trapped with a bunch of stuff that's on Issuu, but now can no longer be downloaded because I refuse to pay $350 a year or $400 a year to allow that feature for downloading. And people will say, well, there are all these other means whereby you can upload your materials and have other people read it. Yeah, okay. Maybe websites are a way to go in some cases, but often you have to pay to host for a website, and at a certain point in time, if you don't pay the cost of upkeeping your website, well then your website, it disappears.

We're living in a world right now where link rot is literally having massive impacts on people's ability to retain knowledge and to preserve knowledge because you go to a site and you're reading a piece and you click on the link and the link no longer exists online, it's no longer there. It's somebody who, I cannot remember their name right now, said something that's posted a lot on social media, which is that websites and the web is the most ephemeral of products available. It is so ephemeral that it's so fragile, it's the complete opposite of what people initially thought the internets were going to be, which was going to be forever, and you were never going to be able to lose the materials and it would just be more sturdy, perhaps even than paper. Well, it turns out that the technology that's the sturdiest is paper in our current structure.

And so the importance of a zine being a handmade, handheld physical item that will outlast in many ways the digital should really have us thinking strongly about how to continue to expand on making analog hard copy, paper-based work in our current moment. Things that are going to be less traceable, frankly. Surveillance on the internet is mass and will get more massive, easily identifiable as to who put what where when. If you're doing hand-to-hand delivery it's just going to be different. And so I think we have to think about all of these things relating to costs, relating to surveillance, relating to how impossible it feels right now to preserve anything on the internet. All of that stuff really has a direct impact on our ability to organize, our ability to document and our ability to make connections with each other.

KH: Absolutely. As does the ability of billionaires, like Elon Musk, to rewrite platform policies, amplify their own messaging, or invisiblize ours, or for people to just be suspended for challenging the status quo or whatever arbitrary reasons that the people who actually own this infrastructure — which we do not own — ultimately decide. 

RS: I was just thinking about the beginnings of the collective that I'm a part of Support Ho(s)e that I was mentioning earlier. Our first web presence was on Tumblr because that platform was initially the one that you could talk about… We could share images that were nude images, we could share much more openly information about sex work and queer and transness and bodies and abortion and a lot of these other things. We could talk about experiences of incarceration, and a lot of us found lots of community on Tumblr.

Well, no online platform is sacred, and I think I really want to underscore this, and all of Mariame's comments really do highlight how deeply ephemeral in not a fun way, not a scrapbooking way, not a cute little cocktail napkin with your lipstick on it way, but ephemeral and fleeting our online platforms and spaces can be when overnight TOS, terms of service, can change because of, like you said, Kelly, some wealthy figure's influence on public policy can shift and determine a company's, can guide their hand, as it were, to censor, to surveil, to increase their already egregious overstepping of privacy concerns for folks using platforms. And this is not to say like, oh, I long for the early days of the internet; there've always been issues. But I do think it's important to note the escalation toward extreme surveillance and censorship that we're seeing and that all of us have talked about now and have screamed about full-throatedly for a number of years.

And there are obviously pros and cons of all the things, but I really think this is a moment to lean into print more than ever.

MK: I agree so much with that and I also think we have to be really mindful of the fact that they're criminalizing everything and they're criminalizing speech, they're criminalizing just every possible angle, criminalizing people in a broader way than has already existed in the country. And so we have to be mindful of that. I also think something that I… Our mutual friend, Stevie Wilson, was currently incarcerated in Pennsylvania. A few years ago, I really appreciated on Twitter, Stevie did a whole thread where he talked about how he found zines to be the perfect political education for people who were incarcerated. And I just want to read a few of the suggestions of what he suggested because I think they're speaking to what we have been talking about but from somebody who's currently inside and has been for a long time, mentions costs, whether producing, distribution, copying or mailing them, they're much cheaper than books.

It says, “Many corrections departments, both county and state place limits on the number of books a prisoner may retain in their property. Zines circumvent these rules and they take up less space. Disseminating zines is easier and less likely to draw the attention of prison administrators. We can hide them on our persons or within other materials, not so for books. They're less intimidating than books. Many prisoners have had negative scholastic experiences. They shy away from books, especially big ones. Zines are a way to create interest on topics or maybe create interest on a book. Asking a person to read a ten-page zine will be met with more eagerness and interest than asking them to read a 200-page book with 40 pages of notes.” It just goes on. “Number five, they allow for a gradualism that books often don't. We study chapter by chapter with no rush. Sometimes we use excerpts turned into zines, and this gradually familiarizes a person with a topic often sparking interest in the complete work. Our groups can be anywhere from six people to 30 people. Zines are much easier to supply than books.

“Often there are rules in place like the one in Pennsylvania that doesn't allow multiple copies of a text to be mailed to one person. Zines give us a chance to rework a text so it becomes accessible to prisoners. Zines are democratic, anyone can make one.” Those are just a few of the comments that were in that thread and I just think perfectly encapsulates the broad possibilities of what hard copy zines can do. And also speaking directly to the people who have already been living under fascistic conditions that now more people in the federal-level fascistic takeover that we are experiencing, that more people now will live under those conditions that a lot of people, not exactly the same obviously, but we are getting a dose, a tiny dose in various ways of the ways in which incarcerated people are subject to the whims and the complete and utter control of people who do not have their best interests at heart. And we should think about that as we're producing information that we want to share with each other outside of the eyes of the people who are paying attention to everything.

KH: I'm really grateful to you for bringing Stevie's wisdom into the conversation. And Stevie, of course, is also a contributing author to Read This When Things Fall Apart, which we'll talk about more in just a little bit. 

I also want to emphasize to folks who may be very online, and who are not ready to break with that world, that I am also very online and not ready to break with that world. We're not saying you have to divorce yourself from digital tools and platforms, but I think we are suggesting that we should be less bound by some of the digital norms and habits that have really shaped our lives in recent years. Our political lives, our expression, so many things are bound up in these hyper-surveilled spaces, with toxic norms, that we can be ejected from at any time, and where all of our expression and documentation of history, all of our shared and ideas and networks can disappear in a blink — and we do not have to keep all of our eggs in that basket. 

Another concern I have talked a lot about is that, over the last 20 years or so, a strong reliance on digital mobilization has led to far fewer people in our movements developing base-building skills. If your political journey didn't involve an organization that wanted base-building specific labor from you, there's a good chance you haven't gotten that training. And that really needs to change, if we're going to have the skills we need to talk to strangers, make connections, and convince people to pool their collective capacities toward our shared goals. If we want to do more than stage big events, if we want to have active political projects that flourish, we need those skills. That's why we hosted a base-building workshop in Chicago recently that wasn't specific to any particular campaign — it was just about imparting these skills, and encouraging people to practice them in the realm of whatever they're doing, or whatever they care about. And I think we need a lot more of that. It's a kind of reclamation, in these times, to get out there and practice these skills, because we've really been driven away from each other, in so many ways.

And I see people recognizing that need. In Chicago, right now, we are a city under siege, and on the day of our base-building training, there were so many important events going on, I thought our turnout was going to be really modest — and I was okay with that, but I was also completely off the mark. We had a packed room, and we had to keep bringing in more chairs, because so many people from across the city, and from a couple of other states, had come out for this conversation. It was so heartening. So, this really is the time, because people are reaching for tools, knowledge, and opportunities. They know we need each other, and we need to continue to issue meaningful invitations, and welcome people into generative spaces. 

And speaking of welcoming people into generative spaces, Mariame, I want to talk about the communiversity project. Can you tell us about this initiative, how it came to be and how it's going? I've been so excited about this project.

MK: Yes. I'm also excited about communiversity. I think all three of us have done a lot of work around political education for many years now, and this is an ongoing thing that I've been part of doing for a long time now. I did many communiversities in Chicago, and back home in New York this is the first time that I'm offering and co-organizing a communiversity here. Essentially communiversities are non-hierarchical inclusive public centers of education for the enrichment and advancement of community life. It's a space that is intended to encourage us to relate issues back to our personal lives. It is intended to allow us to ask questions, to have political conversations, to try to make new friends and comrades, and importantly also to try to connect to local organizing. I was lucky enough to partner with Women Building Up, which is an organization here in New York City that is led and that has leadership from formerly criminalized and incarcerated women and gender expansive people.

They're based in Brooklyn. And I think you all have heard me ranting for years about the fact that there are no spaces to meet in New York City that aren't costing a million dollars for people to be able to meet up there that don't have all sorts of accessibility issues, et cetera. Women Building Up has a brand new, basically the last couple of years space that they're inhabiting that's beautiful and that allows for a lot of things to happen there. And so once I started partnering with them, we started planning together with a couple of other folks who were volunteers. This offering set of sessions, courses, workshops that community members can join. It's all sliding scale zero to whatever you want to offer if you can offer it. We had a call for proposals that we put out for courses and workshops, and then we selected from those proposals and workshops that we received.

And we've been having sessions that have anywhere from four people who attend, to sessions that have had 35 people attending. And all of it has just been wonderful in the sense that it just reminds everybody again how important it is to meet people in person. We have spent so many of these COVID years being online, and I have to say I was so grateful for Zoom and Skype and all the different ways that we were able to keep in touch with our loved ones and with each other at the height of the COVID pandemic and how that has also really allowed people who are homebound, who have other issues, who can't leave because they've got small children to be able to participate in more things as that has expanded. I want to say that up front, very important for accessibility, very important for engaging people in things that they wouldn't necessarily be able to access otherwise. People living in rural towns where there are very few people like them around them can log into a session about transformative justice from a very tiny town.

Those are all so, so critically important, but I'm going to say this again, like I said, for the analog piece around zines, we are at a time where infiltration is easier than ever from bad actors. And you have a very hard time handling digital security for online kinds of things these days. Now Zoom has that stupid feature that if you don't know how to turn it off, somebody will join and then it'll say this meeting is being transcribed, you never can tell who has actually triggered it. These are things that are making online virtual stuff much more fraught and difficult. Also, when you're face to face with somebody in person, you are just more able to really lean into their humanity and also be much more willing to share your own. It's just true. And I have found every single Saturday, we are now six Saturdays in, and I've just found every session that I've been lucky enough to either facilitate or where I've been able to talk to people as they're leaving, people are smiling, people are outside after it's over exchanging contact information.

I've seen some people take selfies of each other when it's over. We have a built-in women… Kim, who's one of the people who works at WBU, had this idea to say, let's have a lunch break no matter how… It goes often from 11:00 to 4:00 or depending on the times when different sessions are being offered, let's have a lunch break from 12:30 to 1:00 that everybody can join, so if people are already in a session, they'd stop at 12:30. If people are starting a session at 1:00, they can be invited to come earlier to grab lunch. The weather's been beautiful too, so it's been lovely for people to grab lunch, go downstairs in the garden area and eat outside. Breaking bread with other people is so, so important around community building and building trust, and I don't know how… We're going to need this if we're going to be able to really organize under fascism. We're going to need a lot more in-person opportunities for us to meet with each other, meet together, talk, share, expand our humanity with each other, so I've just been so happy about it.

It's our first time, so we're working out a lot of kinks. It's hard to know what kinds of sessions people are going to really want to sign up for. We've had to cancel a couple of sessions. We're learning because asking people to show up for four Saturdays in a row for a course looks like it may not be the best way to go. Maybe the maximum way people can do is devote two Saturdays. We are also inviting… We've invited the WBU community to submit proposals, so we've got a lot of formerly criminalized and incarcerated people who are running their own sessions and workshops and the topics they care about and really want to be engaged in are sometimes maybe not the exact same topics that other people want to engage with, so we are really just working out the kinks and figuring out what is the best way to build real community with each other in this city, which is such a hard city to live in and such a hard city to organize in and where people sometimes feel extremely isolated from one another.

That's a little bit about communiversity and it's taking a lot of my time right now. As per usual I had big visions and then I'm up at X number of hours sending emails to everybody. The Thursday before the Saturday sessions to remind them about the values of the space and we're going to do masking and we're… It's been a learning experience and if we do it again, we'll I think get better at it.

KH: It's such a heartening project, and I look forward to hearing more as you all learn from this experiment. 

Red, you do political education work with highly marginalized communities in a red state. Can you talk about what that work looks like right now as trans folks, sex workers, and other criminalized and stigmatized people build community and learn together under increasingly authoritarian conditions?

RS: Yeah, absolutely. In order to talk about what it looks like down here in Texas, I need to start us, though, in Chicago. And I bring this up to remind folks that for the communities that I work with directly who are queer and trans sex working people with incarceration experiences, so doing political education amongst my peers who are in all of these intersecting categories, starting Support Ho(s)e we really formed our political home and hub in Chicago initially. And that's because we were experiencing so much both political and social, like sociocultural stigma, whorephobia and extreme criminalization in Chicago, in the city of Chicago, which has a democratic sheriff, Tom Dart, who's been in that position since 2006. And under his regime of rampant criminalization, he's made it his… How do we say this? His goal is to “save” all women and girls from what he deems as the evils of Johns and the evils of prostitution.

And so what that has looked like over the 10 years that we've just been organizing, as a collective in Chicago, dealing with arrests, dealing with extremely repressive and abusive conditions from policing for folks that work outside, dealing ranging in harassment, doxing and physical violence from so-called neighbors, for folks that do outdoor-based, street-based work, et cetera. Again, the range of violence from people in your own neighborhoods to the police, to the violence one incurs in Cook County jail or by extension, any of the IDOC, Illinois Department of Corrections prisons, ranging from that to the everyday stigma and discrimination that you might face from other forms of employment. Friends, quote unquote “friends,” family, and even people in movement spaces. I unfortunately have to remind us that whorephobia, it is unfortunately alive and well in many, many leftist movement spaces. And so why I take us back there is because we're dealing with all of these conditions, we're dealing with the City of Chicago and the county wanting to re-institute unconstitutional, prostitution-free zones, which are based on their gang-free zones.

And there's lots of stuff out there that you could link folks to, so I won't go into the details there, but dealing with that, dealing with police, sexual violence, and harassment and arrest, dealing with the doxing and entrapment. Police will often pose as clients to entrap workers and vice versa, police will pose as workers to then entrap our clients. There's all of these things. We're dealing with all of this in Chicago and the spaces that we're going into as sex workers, we're only talking about, at the time before our formation, we're really only talking about how we can do self-care and how we can vote. And I'm not trying to disparage against those methods of care, but we wanted something else. And so we started reading together and radicals find each other, and this coalesced into sharing meals, rotating who's going to host a space, rotating what we're reading together, what we're watching together.

Often these are zines and articles. We eventually graduated to full books. We started making zines together. We started watching sex worker film and discussing it, all while creating a space to vent, to discuss, to learn together. And in doing so, these are the things that Mariame was also talking about, and that Kelly, you've also spoken about and participated in, you build trust. You get to actually know who you are in a room with and you see each other's… And I loved the way you put this, Mariame, you expand your capacity for humanity and you expand how you can embrace somebody else's humanity when you're doing this. And you're less afraid to make mistakes, you're less afraid to ask questions in a situation like that, I think it's a perfect just experiment-based  thought-working way to figure your shit out together and then to do something about the struggles, the strife that you face. Fast-forward, so we learned all of that and we've been able to export versions of that to different places that our comrades have moved to, started working in, organizing in et cetera.

And down here in Texas with the extremely overt fascistic regime that's in place, these things are playing out in very specific ways, so we've leaned into heavily working with our local anarchist spaces like Monkeywrench Books. We formed beautiful coalitional relationships with organizations like Gender Unbound and Texas Trans Futures so that we can help take care of each other. In thinking about print materials and political education things down here in Texas, I'm thinking about the Austin Trans Pink Pages, a beautiful project which is a totally print-only directory of all things trans in and around Austin that Gender Unbound put together. I'm thinking of our International Sex Workers Rights Day zine-making nights at Monkeywrench.

I'm thinking about, yes, these zine-making workshops with the youth of Texas Trans Futures and also our letter-writing nights where we practice writing long-form personal and political letters with loved ones who are incarcerated to develop pen pal relationships. And I think that all of those things were made possible by Support Ho(s)e's Collective small, intimate group meetings to think, make and discuss amongst radical sex workers, so knowing your community members beyond a social media handle has to be essential. And that can look a lot of different ways. These are just some of the ways that I've moved and the collectives that I'm a part of have moved.

KH: Thank you so much for that, Red. You both contributed letters to our upcoming book, Read This When Things Fall Apart: Letters to Activists in Crisis. 

Mariame, your letter to new organizers who are trying to find their footing feels incredibly relevant right now as so many people are entering the fray. 

Red, your letter to activists who are organizing outside the law is a crucial intervention as the dragnet of criminalization expands even further under this authoritarian regime. 

Both letters addressed concerns that are more widely felt by people who may be facing bigger fears and staring down more dire consequences for their actions than they would have only a year or two ago. So, I'm wondering, is there anything you would like to add to your letters today or any thoughts, sentiment or advice that you would really like to emphasize under present conditions?

MK: I would add many things. I wrote that letter right after the election, really it was a letter to my niblings who were very, very concerned and worried after the election. Many younger organizers I'm in community with were extremely worried. And I wrote that letter from a place of reminding everybody in some way that it's okay that we're living in uncertainty, that while it's fear-inducing often to live in uncertainty, it's also an opportunity. I think all that is still true. I think what I want to add is a point about not allowing yourself to become callous in this moment, the importance of staying tender with yourself and with those directly in your communities. I just think it's so… I see the coarsening where it's like a self-protective shell that many of us are donning our armor, because we are in a war right now. We really are. It's a fight for our lives. It's a fight for the lives of people we love, especially those of us who are in various marginalized categories and communities.

I want people to be able to stay tender. And I do want to just also say, maybe I would add something about, I think I talked about imagination, but I think I would triple down on that of the thinking about what we want to build in this moment. This is a moment of a need for people who are thinking about building different, building something else that is not a replication of these death-making institutions. The last thing I notice is that I think, or at least I feel like I have a sense that most people I know currently living in the U.S. are disappointed in themselves like, somehow if we imagine living under full-blown fascism at the federal level, I think a lot of us believed that we would be different and maybe we would be braver or more focused or take bigger risks or become world-defining actors of some sort. But it turns out that most of us just remain the same regular humans that we were before.

And I just would say particularly to the young folks, that if you're not rising to the moment right now, that's actually okay because it turns out that who you are and what you do isn't necessarily immediately shaped by the times you live in, so you have to do more within yourself to be in a place where you are more comfortable taking bigger risks.

And that's just going to be time and practice, time and practice, and a soft place to land, a community of people, which goes back to the point we made about the ways that zines can create community amongst each other and ourselves, the way a communiversity can create community, we all more than ever need soft places to land. And if you don't have that, it's just harder for you to take big risks because you don't know who really has your back. And we can only be brave together, in my opinion. I think this notion of the singular, brave, courageous individual is a bunch of bullshit. There are those people, but most people feel like there's strength in numbers. And when there's people that you know have your back you're much more willing to take risks, so I think I would say those things in a different letter.

KH: I really appreciate this call to think about courage as something that exists between us, in collectivity, as something we make together, rather than something that we either have or don't have. Because most of us, sitting out here on our own, counting our worries, and being haunted by our fears, are not innately courageous — and I think it's the norms of capitalism and individualism that lead people to think that they either are or aren't good, and either are or aren't brave, when goodness and bravery are actually things we make together. Good is something we do, in concert with other people. Courage is something we find and make together. As you say, there are people who are courageous, all on their own — and there are also people who can lift really heavy objects all on their own, but most of us need each other to accomplish certain tasks, and certain ways of being, and that's not a bad thing. That's not a weakness. That's about us being social creatures, and really needing each other, in fundamental ways to survive and live up to our potential. Because our potential is collective as well. And it always has been.

Red, I would really love to hear you talk a bit about your letter, which is so timely and needed right now.

RS: So, Kelly knows this, the first version of the letter that I wrote came from a deeply hurt place. A place where I was grieving things that I had seen happen to beloved, beloved friends and comrades who are no longer on this earthly plane with us, comrades who I saw give their whole selves to the movement in really thankless ways, like ways that I think only now in their deaths are being fully, fully acknowledged. And I think that's a goddamn shame. And that first letter was intense, and if you want to read it, you got to go find the zine I put it in. The letter that Kelly gently asked me to reframe is much more practical. It's still emotive, and it's still guided by thoughts, feelings, and experiences of seeing people put too much of themselves out [there] that's identifiable.

So, it's a letter that's really about how do we navigate doing work that's against the law, that's outside of the law, and recognizing that these laws are deeply unjust and inhuman. And so it's much more about how do we reflect on these things together? How do we learn from abortionists? How do we learn from harm reductionists? How do we learn from sex workers? How do we learn from incarcerated comrades who are doing clandestine work inside? And how do we translate those lessons into our current moment and take them into our hearts? 

And so that's the letter that we ended up with, and I'm so glad that we ended up with that letter, but I would like to add some words of encouragement and comfort for when people feel or are attacked by quote unquote “their own” or so-called former comrades or people who see themselves as part of the movement. And I just want to say to those folks who are feeling or fielding also those attacks, that I'm so sorry that you're having to navigate the hate of the far right, the oppression of capitalism and right all of its evils, and on top of that, the ire of some usually misplaced rage. Remember that your actions and your principles will speak volumes for you and of you.

Try to keep your head and heart grounded as best you can and just find your people, find your people, and feel your big feelings. The goal is not to be some perfect savior, it's quite the opposite. It's just to be a person looking to be in right relationship with other people, the land and your own heart. All of this shit will pass. And until it does, be gentle with yourself and maybe put it all in a zine.

KH: Thank you for those words of comfort and encouragement for folks who may be feeling attacked or kicked around, amid some of the conflicts that occur in our movements, or the campaigns that are sometimes waged by people who are really nothing more than movement spectators, who don't really contribute anything but rancor to our spaces. I think we need to be real about the fact that while disruptors can play an essential role in our movements, some people want to dismantle every group that they find, and want to tear down anyone who's been praised, and are really just discourse snipers, at the end of the day. And we can't be ruled by that energy. Especially now, when, as Mariame said, there is more bad faith and manufactured bullshit on social media than ever before. 

I also want to circle back to what Mariame was saying about the importance of imagination, because what we absolutely cannot do is romanticize the road to fascism. It's so easy for people to get nostalgic about things that aren't worthy of nostalgia, when things get as ugly as they are right now. We need to remember, that's what the right does. They fetishize a mythical past—a time that never really existed, where everything was great for them, and they are willing to scapegoat, subjugate and annihilate people as needed to chase that fantasy. We don't want some progressive or liberal version of that bullshit, where we are romanticizing some prior point on the trajectory that brought us here, and trying to recapture that, like those were idyllic days for us all. And we certainly cannot play into the politics of sacrifice that centrists and others are endorsing right now, and throw immigrants, or trans people, or anyone else under the bus, in the name of restoring the neoliberal status quo, which was shitty, and ultimately delivered us to this moment — and would deliver us here again. There were already authoritarian policies unfolding in this country. There were already people living in bondage in this country — and we would still be looking at accelerations of those conditions, if we managed to restore the status quo. But I don't think that restoration should even be viewed as an option here. The way out is not behind us. The way out is through, and we have to forge something new, ahead of us.

We need a transformative, liberatory vision for all of us, and I am grateful to think alongside people who are struggling to make that kind of future possible. As we wrap up today, is there anything else that either of you would like to share with or ask of the audience?

MK: I will just say, don't stop trying things. Don't stop trying things. This is a moment when you should just be leaning into trying out a lot of different stuff. We don't know for sure what is going to work. 

There's this anecdote from Mr. Rogers that I've shared with many people over the years, and I just want to share it as my closing testament for the moment, which he talks about a young guy, a young person, who's an apprentice, who applies to a master carpenter for a job. And so the carpenter asks him, “Do you know your trade?” And the young apprentice is like, “Yes, sir.” He's real proud about saying this. And the master carpenter says, “Well, have you ever made a mistake?” And the young apprentice says, “No, sir,” feeling certain that he was going to get this job like, “No. No, I haven't made any mistakes.” And the carpenter says, “Well, there's no way I'm going to hire you because when you make one, you won't know how to fix it.” And I think what has happened in our communities and in our specifically organizing and activist culture is a deathly fear of failure and of making mistakes, acknowledging that we make mistakes.

And again, I'm not saying here… I'm not talking about social media. I'm not talking about getting to social media and posting a long I'm so sorry for these 10 million things. Those aren't your people. I'm talking about when these things happen and we're in relationship with each other, or they are people we know and care about and we're trying to be in community with each other and we mess up, which we will, that we continue to try things because we will definitely mess up. And if we mess up, it's okay that we've done that. It is not going to be the permanent scarlet letter on our thing saying, I fucked up forever and that's all I ever am. No, it's not that. And you come to this knowledge, I do believe as you get older and you've been doing stuff for a longer period of time, you know you become discerning about who the people are that you owe something to. And you ask yourself, who am I to these people and who are they to me?

And based on that, you will react. You will react in the way that is the best way for you at that moment and at that time, so I just want us to really sit with that. You don't owe yourself to everybody, but you do owe yourself to the people who you choose to be in community with.

RS: All of that a thousand times. A thousand times, all of that. I was just like sitting here just punching the air and air clapping. And if I had to share one final thing besides a thousand times everything Mariame said just now, please be nice to sex workers y'all. And if you haven't yet, try making a zine about your thoughts, feelings, politics, and passions, and don't respond to the hateful comments online. Maybe talk to someone that you trust to gut check you instead.

KH: Well, I really appreciate both of your insights so much and your work, and of course your friendship. I'm so grateful to be in relationship with both of you and I look forward to the next time we can all be in space together again.

RS: Ditto.

MK: Same here. Same here. We have got to hold onto each other y'all. We have got to do that. These are rough times, and we will endure them in community with each other and others. And we have to keep that high up in our minds and in our hearts. We need each other more than ever. And I think the people who don't know that are missing out because this is rough stuff.

RS: Too right. Too right, Mariame.

KH: I appreciate you both so much. Thank you for joining me today.

MK: Thank you.

RS: Thank you, Kelly. Thanks Mariame. Bye y'all.

KH: I also want to thank our listeners for joining us today, and remember, our best defense against cynicism is to do good, and to remember that the good we do matters. Until next time, I'll see you in the streets.

 America's Digital Defenses Are Failing—but AI Can Save Them

 Jen Easterly

In November 1988, the Morris worm—an experimental computer program written by a curious graduate student—unintentionally crippled the early Internet and exposed for the first time the serious consequences of poorly designed software. Nearly 40 years later, the world still runs on fragile code riddled with the same kinds of flaws and defects. Amid frequent news reports about hacks and leaks, a key truth is often overlooked: the United States does not have a cybersecurity problem. It has a software quality problem. The multibillion-dollar cybersecurity industry largely exists to compensate for insecure software.

The impact of persistent weaknesses in U.S. software is playing out in real time. Since at least 2021, for instance, hackers connected to China's Ministry of State Security and People's Liberation Army have exploited the same types of flaws that the Morris Worm feasted on decades ago. These groups—referred to as Salt Typhoon and Volt Typhoon—have taken advantage of unpatched systems, poorly secured routers, and devices built for connectivity rather than resilience to infiltrate telecommunications networks, transportation systems, and power utilities. And just this year, Russian Federal Security Service hackers exploited an unpatched flaw in networking devices to compromise thousands of routers and switches connected to U.S. infrastructure. As more institutions, from hospitals to ports, rely on software to function, unsafe code is a growing threat to the United States.

These vulnerabilities endure because software vendors face few incentives to prioritize security. It remains cheaper and faster to shift the costs of insecurity downstream to customers. And because much of the code that underpins critical infrastructure is decades old, rewriting it securely has long been too expensive and time-consuming to make business sense.

But capabilities—including the accelerating power of artificial intelligence—are emerging to fix these software problems across entire digital ecosystems. This could spell the end of cybersecurity as we currently know it—and make the United States much less vulnerable as a result. But the window to take advantage of new technology is closing as U.S. adversaries, too, are looking to use AI to enhance their cyberattack capabilities. Now is the time for U.S. government agencies, large companies, and investors to work together to fundamentally shift economic incentives and use AI to improve the United States' digital defenses. Cyberspace will never be completely safe. But the cybersecurity market as it currently exists does not have to be a permanent feature of the digital age. A better and more secure approach to software is within reach.

In the popular narrative, hackers—whether they are individual rogue actors, state-sponsored groups, or teams backed by criminal syndicates—are mysterious and clever, deviously exploiting careless employees and misconfigured servers. But most intrusions do not succeed because attackers wield exotic cyberweapons. They succeed because widely deployed technology products are installed with well-known and preventable defects.

The core issue is economic, not technological. Most buyers have no practical way to judge whether the software they purchase is secure. They must take vendors at their word, which creates little incentive for the designers or sellers of software to invest in protections that customers cannot see or measure. As a result, software vendors compete on aspects that are more obvious to buyers: lower prices, getting their products to market first, and convenient functionalities such as one-click integrations with other systems or easy remote access. But focusing on these features often comes at the expense of adequate safeguards against cyberthreats. Market forces simply do not incentivize prioritizing security in the design process.

This has led to the rise of the cybersecurity aftermarket—a sprawling ecosystem of antivirus systems, detection capabilities, firewalls, and much more—which essentially provides bolt-on solutions to address software insecurities. And although the cybersecurity industry has evolved into an impressive community of talented innovators, its interventions are necessarily rearguard actions. Cybersecurity systems limit the damage of malware that should never have been able to spread, clean up breaches that should never have occurred, and fix flaws that should never have existed.

Software companies also deprioritize security in their product design because they are rarely held liable for security failures. In the United States, there is no enforceable baseline standard for what security protections software must have, nor are there penalties for insecure software, essentially making unsafe design a rational business choice. When catastrophic breaches occur, software companies create patches rather than redesign the product to be more secure. This is largely because the party that suffers is the customer. Until these companies are held liable and regulators enforce standards, exploitable code will remain the foundation of digital infrastructure. It is cheaper and faster for vendors to ship unsafe products and let customers and cybersecurity teams shoulder the burden of guarding their weak points.

These perverse incentives must be shifted. Prevention would be much better than a set of inconsistently applied and sometimes flimsy cures. U.S. cyberspace is porous, and only the creators and sellers of software can change outcomes at scale. An individual user cannot make encryption mandatory; a vendor can. A hospital cannot rewrite a commercial application to avoid data corruption; a vendor can. A city cannot secure the code that runs its water system; a vendor can. Responsibility must sit at the point of production, not of consumption.

For decades, even well-intentioned software companies could not justify efforts to create more secure products. It was both too costly and too challenging. But increasingly powerful artificial intelligence is changing this calculus. New technology holds the promise of making it possible to cheaply and effectively produce newer, safer code and also fix the weaknesses of older code, which would drastically reduce cyber-risk to global digital infrastructure.

Artificial intelligence is already reshaping software engineering. Major technology firms report that AI systems generate roughly a quarter of their code, a share that could rise above 80 percent within the next five years. Relying on AI to fix software has some risks: because AI models are learning from decades of imperfect human code, they could reproduce the same vulnerabilities that plague current software. But these systems not only learn from existing code; they also learn from every known flaw and attempted fix. Trained purposefully on secure coding standards and continuously refined through feedback, AI can correct human errors, not perpetuate them. Over time, AI will produce more secure code than any human developer can.

AI systems could also be used to repair defects in widely used software. From 2023 to 2025, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ran an AI Cyber Challenge to test whether AI systems could autonomously find and patch software flaws. The results were impressive. Leading models identified the majority of the vulnerabilities that the organizers had seeded in the code and even discovered previously unknown weaknesses—doing in minutes, and at a fraction of the cost, what takes expert teams days or weeks. Private sector firms, including companies such as Google, Meta, and Microsoft, which build software that Americans use every day, are taking similar action, using AI systems to detect and fix vulnerabilities.



Most important, AI will help tackle the hardest challenge in securing software: aging code that supports much of the world's digital infrastructure. Major software tools, including word processors and email systems, and critical sectors, such as banking and transportation, all run on software written decades ago. The design choices made when this code was written have left deeply rooted weaknesses. Rewriting all this legacy code to be more secure has, until recently, been prohibitively expensive and risky—the digital equivalent of trying to rebuild an airplane midflight. But as AI becomes increasingly powerful, it offers the promise of millions of agents simultaneously reading, understanding, and transforming insecure code at scale. AI is thus an economic breakthrough as well as a technical one: it makes the painstaking work of rewriting the network of insecure software affordable.

Critics will argue that AI will only weaken cybersecurity by arming attackers with faster, stealthier, and more adaptive tools. This risk is real: AI will enable adversaries to automate their offensive strategies at the same time as defensive systems automate detection and response. But the more profound impact of AI should be upstream, in prevention rather than reaction. By helping build software that eliminates the vulnerabilities that adversaries seek to exploit, AI can address the root cause of cyber insecurity.

The implications of AI for cyberdefense are transformative. Instead of purchasing an endless cascade of products to compensate for defective software, organizations could pay for software that is measurably more secure out of the box—and for AI-assisted tools that maintain its defenses automatically. Programmers will no longer write code that needs fixing later; AI assistants will help them create systems with security built in from the start. Before new products go live, automated checks could scan for weak spots—just as cars are crash-tested before reaching the road. Old, fragile systems will be continuously modernized, removing dangerous flaws that attackers exploit today. As this becomes the norm, the entire model of cybersecurity will change. Security will become a standard feature of digital life, not a costly add-on.

But these changes are not guaranteed to happen. Ending the cybersecurity aftermarket by creating high-quality software at scale requires ambitious leaders willing to take bold action. Incremental tweaks won't close the gap between today's fragile, defect-ridden ecosystem and a future in which software is designed to be secure. Governments, technology vendors, customers, and investors must take steps to align incentives for producers and consumers, accelerate innovation, and make security a visible feature of software.

Most critically, the AI systems that will help secure software must themselves be built securely. AI models can be manipulated through corrupted training data; they can make unpredictable decisions that even their creators can't fully explain; they may depend on software components sourced from untrustworthy suppliers; and they can introduce entirely new weaknesses that adversaries can exploit, such as the potential to trick an AI model into revealing sensitive data. Rolling out AI-enabled features as quickly as possible, without first ensuring they are secure, would only repeat the same mistakes that created today's fragile digital ecosystem.

The White House AI Action Plan, released in July, acknowledges these challenges, calling for security, transparency, and accountability to be built into AI systems from the outset. Achieving these goals will require cooperation between the public and private sectors, including the establishment of shared testing environments to rigorously evaluate the safety of AI-enabled systems before they are deployed. It also needs mechanisms to verify the provenance of AI models (that is, who created, trained, and modified them) and to audit how models and their training data perform over time. Clear guardrails on the development, deployment, and use of AI systems should be designed to prevent abuse while preserving room for innovation. California's new AI accountability law, enacted in September, provides one model for how to establish transparency and risk-assessment obligations that could shape a coherent national approach.

At the same time, to shift market incentives, policymakers and industry leaders must work together to create clear, standardized benchmarks that make software products' security features visible to buyers. Just as customers can evaluate cars through crash-test ratings, appliances through energy-efficiency labels, or food through nutrition labels, buyers should have a similar ability to assess how the software products that Americans rely on every day are built. Consumers should know whether basic protections such as secure authentication are turned on by default, how quickly security flaws are fixed, and whether products give customers the tools to detect and recover from intrusions.



The foundations of such efforts exist. In January 2025, the Biden administration launched the U.S. Cyber Trust Mark, a label to certify that Internet-connected devices such as smart home products meet standard cybersecurity criteria. Similar to how Energy Star labels verify products' energy efficiency and encourage consumers to buy efficient appliances, the Cyber Trust Mark will help market forces reward companies that invest in security. But the program should be expanded. All software products, not just Internet-connected devices, should have transparent labels to enable a race toward security as the default.

Regulators also have a responsibility to ensure that the burden for software vulnerabilities falls on vendors, not buyers. Cybersecurity regulation, however, has largely evolved sector by sector. As a result, pipelines, railways, financial services, and communications systems are each governed by different standards, which are enforced by different agencies. The patchwork of overlapping requirements drives superficial compliance rather than genuine risk reduction. A better approach, as recommended by the Cyberspace Solarium Commission—a bipartisan panel of lawmakers, former officials, and industry leaders established by Congress in 2019—would be to focus on the software that underpins every sector, not the sector itself, by establishing a clear liability framework to hold software producers responsible when negligent design or development practices lead to security failures. Because software now forms the foundation of nearly every major institution, establishing such a framework at the level of software would realign economic incentives toward building safer products and shift accountability from end users to those best positioned to prevent harm: the makers of the code itself.

In addition to improving software liability, harmonizing remaining sector-specific cybersecurity rules is critical. Conflicting mandates leave companies navigating inconsistent demands from multiple regulators. A more effective model would consolidate leadership under the Office of the National Cyber Director, an entity created by Congress in 2021 to coordinate national cybersecurity policy, which would empower a single entity to drive strategy, determine priorities, and ensure policy coherence rather than regulatory chaos. Giving the ONCD the mandate to set the agenda—and the resources to enforce it—would make it the government's strongest driver of systemic software security.

The ONCD could also facilitate the adoption of more secure software by fixing the federal government's software procurement process. The U.S. federal government is the single largest buyer of software on the planet. Yet more than four years after the Department of Homeland Security submitted secure software standards for inclusion in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the corpus of processes governing public procurement, there is still no finalized rule requiring vendors to attest to secure development practices. The FAR process—designed more for paperclips than patches—is too slow for a domain in which threats evolve by the minute. Federal procurers could take a lesson from the finance corporation JPMorgan Chase, which recently issued an open letter to its software suppliers setting clear expectations that their products should prioritize security over rushing features to market. Early reports suggest that its vendors are responding by strengthening development practices and offering greater transparency—a demonstration of how purchasing power can drive accountability upstream.

The consequences of America's failure to solve its software quality problem are becoming more severe. Power grids, hospitals, pipelines, ports, and financial networks now run almost entirely on software, leaving them exposed to escalating risks of corruption and disruption. Companies and regulators can continue treating software insecurity as a fact of nature—reacting to breaches, layering on patches, and blaming users—or they can make security the default setting.

Despite growing awareness of the problem among both policymakers and businesses, progress toward effective solutions has been limited. Some agencies have advanced initiatives encouraging software companies to build security into their products, but there is still no binding national framework. The issue rarely ranks as a political priority—neither in Congress, which has yet to pass sweeping liability or design mandates, nor in the executive branch, which oscillates between rhetoric and restraint. Meanwhile, powerful industry lobbies and major technology firms continue to resist reforms that might raise costs or slow the race for feature-rich product releases. But the Trump administration's continued focus on harnessing the federal government's vast procurement power—and on expanding initiatives promoting more secure design for both traditional and AI-enabled software—offers a potential inflection point. If coupled with clear standards and enforcement mechanisms, these efforts could begin to transform security from an afterthought into a market expectation.



Making real progress is now possible—and is crucial to U.S. defense. The Pentagon spends billions each year on cybersecurity operations and employs tens of thousands of personnel to defend vulnerable software systems. Reducing preventable software flaws would free up resources and personnel to focus on deterring and disrupting adversaries—for instance, expanding offensive cyber-capabilities to impose costs on those who target U.S. critical infrastructure—shifting the balance of power from constant defense to proactive deterrence.

These changes will also unleash the full potential of the cybersecurity sector, which is increasingly inseparable from AI itself. The future of cyber work lies not in reacting to yesterday's breaches but in engineering trust into the fabric of digital life by securing the algorithms, data, and infrastructure that power the global economy. Human expertise and machine intelligence will work in concert to strengthen critical systems, safeguard innovation, and preserve the United States' technological edge.

Cybersecurity should no longer mean a permanent defensive struggle. It should mean the deliberate design of a safer digital world. With the right policies, the right incentives, and the right application of AI, the United States can finally move from defending the past to securing the future. This is how cybersecurity truly ends: not with perfect protection but with systems resilient enough to withstand disruption.

 The Continent Needs More Cooperation With America—Not Less

 Chris Miller and John Allen

European leaders have grand ambitions to reduce the continent's reliance on sensitive technologies from abroad. Today, they are debating an update to the European Chips Act, which was finalized in 2023 and allocated billions of euros to subsidize chip-making on the continent. The act was meant to increase Europe's share of global chip manufacturing from ten to 20 percent by 2030, but it will likely fall short of that target by a wide margin.

A purely European supply chain for semiconductors—the sector that undergirds the digital economy and defense sector—is a fantasy that distracts from real opportunities. Many of the powerhouses of Europe's chip industry, such as ASML, a Dutch company that makes semiconductor equipment, and Merck, a German firm that produces chemicals for chip-making, don't manufacture semiconductors. Companies like these are cutting-edge, are often highly profitable, and draw on Europe's industrial expertise in precision machinery, specialty chemicals, and advanced materials. Yet they are overlooked by politicians who focus on chip output.

At the same time, the semiconductor industry is facing rapid technological changes, trade restrictions, and geopolitical shifts that Europe is not prepared for. The main driver of rising demand for chips is artificial intelligence, an area in which Europe is comparatively weak. European firms are being squeezed out of China's market, which used to be a primary source of growth for them. And the United States, which used to be a close partner, is threatening tariffs that would limit European sales to the U.S. semiconductor market. Merely setting targets for domestic chip production will not solve these challenges.

A self-sufficient semiconductor industry may be out of Europe's reach, but a more vibrant one is not. Europe has a meaningful edge in certain steps of the semiconductor supply chain, and it can cooperate with allies—including the United States—for the supply chain segments it lacks. The billions of euros being poured into the continent's rearmament can also be an opportunity for its chip makers, given how critical artificial intelligence has become to defense. To take full advantage of these trends, European leaders need to build on the chip industry's strengths with deeper partnerships, not a futile drive for self-sufficiency.

The biggest problem for Europe's chip industry is the slow development of the continent's artificial intelligence ecosystem. AI has become the primary driver of growth in chip demand: data centers need chips to power AI training, and devices such as phones, laptops, and cars require chips to run AI. Yet European AI firms are minor players in the global industry, and fewer data centers are being built in Europe than in other regions. Unless European chip companies contribute more to global AI supply chains, their market share will shrink.

European firms, such as ASML, that supply leading Asian chip makers with tools and materials are benefiting from the AI boom. But with the AI ecosystem concentrated in the United States and China, Europe's chip industry struggles to attract talent, raise venture capital, or anticipate technological trends. Having focused more on regulating AI than deploying it, Europe risks being left behind. Nvidia, a U.S. company that produces AI chips, is worth 30 percent more than the entire German stock market. If European entrepreneurs continue building their AI companies in California instead of at home, European chip makers and designers will lose out, too. Companies in the AI supply chain benefit when they cluster together, as they have in Silicon Valley.

Europe has significant pockets of expertise to contribute to AI supply chains. Arm, a British firm, designs and licenses intellectual property and know-how to AI chip designers around the world. The Netherlands has unique capabilities in photonics, a technology used to accelerate interconnections between AI chips. The Belgian research institute IMEC devises the next-generation technologies that enable the manufacture of ever more advanced AI processor chips around the world. Europe doesn't need to manufacture cutting-edge AI processors, a business that Taiwan today all but monopolizes. But it does need to ensure that its semiconductor and broader technology ecosystem remains competitive with those of other regions.

This means that European governments and companies must embrace AI development. Centuries-old industries, such as auto manufacturing, need to rapidly adopt advanced technology to stay competitive. Continental, a European auto parts manufacturer, announced in June that it was creating a unit to design chips to sell to auto companies, which are embedding cars with advanced sensors, communications capabilities, and AI. Pirelli, the Italian tire maker, already puts chips in tires to collect vehicle data. Companies that make industrial equipment, medical devices, aviation parts, and robots all require increasingly specialized semiconductor hardware. The faster European industry adopts AI capabilities, the more demand there will be for European chips.

Limited domestic demand for AI chips and services is not the only force holding back Europe's chip makers. They also face steep competition from China. Because of U.S., Dutch, and Japanese export restrictions, Chinese chip manufacturers can't access the tools they need to easily produce advanced chips. But they face no barriers to purchasing equipment to make less advanced versions. China has plowed money into producing these foundational chips, the kind that European firms also tend to make.

Beijing's subsidies for its semiconductor industry make it difficult for European firms to compete. The Chinese government is also encouraging and in some cases requiring Chinese industrial firms to stop buying components from foreign suppliers. Beijing has pushed Chinese automakers to use 100 percent homemade chips by 2027, for example. This is particularly harmful for European chip makers, which specialize in automotive semiconductors.

The only way European producers can keep their position in the Chinese market is to retain a technological edge. In an ideal world, Europe would also work with the United States and Japan to pressure Beijing to scale back its subsidies and trade barriers. But if that effort fails—as it likely will—Europe should limit market access to Chinese firms profiting from unfair subsidies.

The United States ought to be a natural partner for Europe both in building AI and in standing up to China's subsidies. Instead, the Trump administration is causing headaches for the continent's chip industry by threatening tariffs that would limit their access to the U.S. market. Yet there is still a chance to work with Washington. The Trump administration has made exporting U.S. AI technology a central policy goal. Europe would be smart to embrace the use of U.S. data center infrastructure to more quickly adopt AI.

There is one bright spot for European semiconductor firms: governments on the continent are pouring billions of dollars into their defense industries to deter Russian aggression. European militaries will need a wide variety of chips, including for autonomous systems, which require large quantities of sensors, communications chips, and AI processors. Chips underpin Europe's ability to “fight from the cloud”—that is, using cloud computing to share and process masses of information. The war in Ukraine provides a glimpse into the future of conflict. Both sides collect huge quantities of data that are absorbed into clouds, parsed almost instantly by AI tools, and then distributed in real time as actionable intelligence, operational decisions, or data for targeting that can be sent to firing units dispersed across the battlefield.

Europe can fight the wars of the future only if it can acquire advanced chips from trusted partners or make them on its own. It needs hardware and software to integrate these capabilities, including interoperable cloud computing systems. And it needs a broader base of talent to develop and deliver these capabilities.



Europe's biggest adversary, Russia, is already well versed in this type of war, having fought one for over three years. And China has gained valuable experience by observing Russia's military in Ukraine and providing Moscow with electronics and machine tools that it needs for its war effort.

The United States and Europe must work together to compete. They should, for example, harmonize standards so they can more easily use each other's chips in their military technology. They should also supply each other with more basic components in electronic supply chains. Both Europe and the United States heavily rely on Asian suppliers not only for chips but also for resistors and capacitors, printed circuit boards, cables and connectors, flat-panel displays, and fundamental materials including gallium, germanium, and rare-earth minerals. Most of these materials and components can only be produced economically at substantial scale—a scale only achievable with close ties between the U.S. and European markets.

Finally, European policymakers must ensure that their chip companies can capitalize on the surge in defense spending by investing more in new defense technologies and fostering connections between large chip firms and small defense startups. European chip companies that have previously focused on civilian markets must realize that the defense industry, and particularly the drone sector, will drive growth and technological change.

European policymakers have yet to grasp the magnitude of the challenge facing their chip industry or the stakes of getting it wrong. The consequences are not only commercial: the continent's defense requires a more capable semiconductor ecosystem. In the debate over the update to the 2023 Chips Act, a new Dutch-led coalition is rightly pushing to scrap the act's target to double manufacturing output and instead focus on improving Europe's environment for research and development and for business growth. Yet Europe still needs a clearer plan to ensure that its defense spending boom and its efforts to revitalize its chip industry are more in sync.

Some European politicians think that strategic autonomy means going it alone, but to be competitive, the continent's chip makers need even deeper connections with firms from allied countries. The United States has become a vexing partner for European industries and political leaders, yet European industry needs access to the American market and its leading U.S. AI technologies. The United States, for its part, would benefit from European help to reduce reliance on Asia for its technology supply chains. As Europe tries to revitalize its chip sector and rebuild its defense base, the United States remains an indispensable partner.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Federal judge demands answers from Trump admin on following order to avoid violent encounters with Chicago protesters","https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/16/us/illinois-judge-trump-chicago-protesters","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 14:08:29 GMT","


            A judge in Illinois said she has “serious concerns” over whether federal law enforcement agents are following her order to avoid violent encounters with protesters and journalists in Chicago.
    


            “I'm a little startled frankly, that since Thursday when I entered the (temporary restraining order) last week, I'm getting images and seeing images on the news, in the paper, reading reports, where at least from what I'm seeing, I'm having serious concerns that my order's being followed,” said US District Court Judge Sara Ellis in a hearing called on short notice Thursday.
    


            “I'm not happy,” Ellis said with evident exasperation in her voice. “I'm really not happy.”
    


            In response, Ellis announced Thursday she will require all federal agents with body cameras to have them on during encounters with immigration protesters.
    


            “That's the nice thing about body cameras is that they pick up events before the triggering event happens,” she said.
    


            The judge initially required all agents to wear cameras, but agreed to some flexibility after Sean Skedzielewski, an attorney representing the Trump administration, said it would be logistically impossible to immediately equip all agents with bodycams.
    


            The Department of Justice still opposed the body cam order, arguing it's not a simple matter to record the body cam videos and consistently turn them around for reviewing and redacting video based on every allegation.
    


            “It would require a tremendous amount of resources,” Skedzielewski said.
    


            Ellis – an Obama appointee – issued a temporary restraining order last week after a coalition of local journalists and protesters sued the Trump administration, saying federal law enforcement agents were targeting people engaging in peaceful activity, including multiple reporters who said they had pepper balls fired on them despite being identified as press.
    


            Since then, the plaintiffs said there are at least two incidents in which they believe agents did not follow the order, including a confrontation on Chicago's southeast side Tuesday following a traffic accident involving US Border Patrol.
    


            “There's a reason the Chicago Police Department has policies about car chases and where they occur, and where they need to stop,” said the judge.
    


            She also demanded that the field director of the Operation Midway Blitz appear in court on Monday at 10:30 a.m. local time, “to explain to me why I am seeing images of tear gas being deployed and reading reports that there were no warnings given before it was deployed out in the field.”
    


Chase involving federal agents led to a crash and angry community response in Chicago



            The original restraining order from Ellis blocks agents from targeting journalists who are not interfering with law enforcement. Federal agents are also prohibited from using tear gas and less-lethal munitions on anyone who does not impose an “immediate threat to safety.”
    


            “The issue is that DHS is using force in a manner that violates the constitutional rights of peaceful protesters, journalists and, essentially, clergy members,” said the judge.
    


            “You can't shoot ‘em in the head (with pepper balls),” Ellis said. “You can't deploy tear gas. You can't use flash-bang grenades. You can't drive a car through a crowd.”
    


Chicago Pastor Shot by ICE speaks to CNN in first TV interview: ‘We could hear them laughing.'



            Video of a pastor being repeatedly shot by pepper balls during a demonstration outside at an ICE facility near Chicago earlier this month drew widespread outcry.
    


            Skedzielewski suggested the news coverage that prompted the judge's anger may be misleading, saying Ellis is relying on “one-sided and selectively edited media reports.”
    


            Ellis acknowledged some details in news reports may be under dispute, adding that is why she wants to speak to the field director on Monday.
    


            Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker – who is not a party to the lawsuit – said Wednesday he was not convinced Ellis' order is being followed after continuing intense encounters.
    


            “ICE is causing this mayhem,” Pritzker said. “They're the ones throwing tear gas when people are peacefully protesting.”
    


            In a separate case, a federal judge blocked President Donald Trump from deploying National Guard troops in Chicago last week. The administration is appealing the order.

            Democrats are doing it again.
    


            They're forced to use conventional political tactics to battle the most unconventional president in history — repeating a scenario that keeps leading them to political disaster.
    


            At first sight, in the third week of the government shutdown, things seem to be working out better than expected for the opposition party locked out of Washington power. They've made their key issue — looming health insurance premium hikes — a national story. They've opened divisions in the Republican Party. And contrary to stereotype, they didn't immediately cave, showing supporters a backbone.
    


            In classic shutdown politics, this might have laid a decisive trap for their Republican opponents, as the human cost of the showdown mounts to create a political imperative for the party in power to find an off-ramp.
    


            But this is the nihilistic age of Trump.
    


            The president doesn't just move the goal posts; he rips up the entire pitch. So assumptions that governed previous shutdowns over 30 years of bitter partisanship in Washington may not apply.
    


            The shutdown started three weeks ago when Senate Democrats refused to back a seven-week spending bill, using the end of government funding as leverage to try to force Republicans to extend expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies and to push for a rollback of Medicaid cuts contained in Trump's big domestic agenda law.
    


            Republicans are willing to talk about extending the subsidies but won't do so until Democrats back down and vote to reopen the government on their terms. “Anyone that thinks that tomorrow they'll suddenly start negotiating, I think is smoking something that is illegal in many states,” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who votes with Democrats, said at a CNN town hall on Wednesday night.
    


            Senate Republican Majority leader John Thune told MSNBC Thursday he could guarantee Democrats a vote on extending Obamacare subsidies but could not guarantee the measure would pass. Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, both leading progressives, however said at the CNN Town Hall they wouldn't vote for any bill that reopened the government without a guarantee from the GOP of extended subsidies that are due to expire at the end of the year.
    


            Shutdowns usually end when the political, human and economic pressure becomes so acute that one party has to quit.
    


            A week ago, there was signs President Donald Trump might be tempted by the chance of a deal, and seemed less dialed into the Republican strategy of defiance. But he's hardened his stance. He's fired thousands of federal workers and is promising more will lose their jobs in a calculated show of spite to Democrats.
    


            Democrats' efforts to highlight their campaign is also difficult amid the kaleidoscope of chaos constantly stirred by a president who has — for now — made peace in Gaza; threatened to send troops to more US cities; and might have unleashed a regime-change campaign in Venezuela in a single week. In Washington, at least, the health care issue keeps getting drowned out.
    


            And Trump's willingness to ignore legal constraints and apparent belief that federal money is his own personal political slush fund opened the way to workarounds so he can pay service members and FBI agents while other furloughed federal workers go without wages. Trump plans to divert tariff revenues to keep nutrition assistance for pregnant women and mothers of young children from running out. By delaying the expiration of such funding, he may be able to defray political damage and set the stage for weeks more of shutdown.
    


            It's also unclear whether Trump — a billionaire who probably hasn't lined up at a crowded airport security checkpoint in decades and who often seems to be looking out mostly for himself — is susceptible to the mounting tales of human anguish and inconvenience imposed by the shutdown. And he sure doesn't feel the stigma of heading a government that is closed. Indeed, he's used the opportunity to further eviscerate a federal machine devastating by his indiscriminate job cuts. He's not destroying the town to save it. He's destroying the town because he enjoys destroying the town.
    


            To prevail in the shutdown, therefore, Democrats will need to find ways to reimpose the political pain that Trump has neutralized. Or can they hit on a political incentive for the president to tempt him into talking and a possible deal in a way that would undercut House Speaker Mike Johnson's position?
    


            But they will keep coming up against the same problem. This is a president who denied the result of a free and fair election, who declined to bow out of politics when he was convicted of a crime, and who seems to regard the Constitution as a list of rules to be flouted. With this track record, there's no reason to believe that any pressure will force him to change his behavior.
    


            Ocasio-Cortez said at the CNN town hall that her party would not fall for the president's intimidation.“We have to make sure we are expanding and continuing the fight … and not falling for the fine print, not falling for the tricks and not falling for the politics around this,” the New York lawmaker said.
    


            Democrats must also consider whether the mounting consequences of the impasse, in terms of lost jobs, missed pay checks for federal workers, and economic and social fallout, can be justified by any feasible political result. Can they even expect a tangible result in a month that they could not get now if they were to sue for peace with Republicans?
    


            The resolve of Senate Republicans seems to be hardening as the shutdown drags on. “I just don't see what's going to get us out of it, because what my Democratic colleagues are asking for, you know this, it's just not realistic,” Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy told CNN's Manu Raju. “I think this will be the longest shutdown in the history of ever.” And the chances of Trump giving the Democrats a face-saving off-ramp seem slimmer now than a week ago.
    


            Democratic leaders might also have expected more blowback to Johnson's refusal to recall the House, but complaints that lawmakers are loafing off while citizens get hurt don't yet seem to be cutting through. Early polling showed that most voters blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, but more recent surveys suggest the politics have not yet turned disastrous for either party. In a CBS News poll earlier this month, 52% disapproved of Trump's handling of the shutdown. The figures for congressional Republicans and Democrats on the issue were 52% and 49%, respectively. One problem for Democrats is that they are viewed so unfavorably by Americans there may be little confidence they can do anything right.
    


            Still, the core Democratic argument in the shutdown is potent because it's rooted in a concern millions of Americans share — rising health care costs and the seemingly endless premium spikes that batter consumers every year.
    


            Proof that they are fighting on the right ground can be seen in the way many Republicans agree with their position — most notably pro-Trump Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.
    


            Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley said Wednesday that he was facing no pressure from his constituents to end the shutdown. “The pressure is completely the opposite. People understand it's over health care,” he said.
    


            But while the shutdown is all about health care, it is not only about health care. This explains why winning a simple concession on ACA subsidies, for instance, may not be enough to declare a political victory, even if a comprehensive win may not be realistic.
    


            For nearly 10 months, Democrats have been battered by Trump. Programs their voters hold dear have been destroyed. The democracy they cherish has come under severe assault. And a party that has been wandering the wilderness looking for purpose has been able to do almost nothing to stop it. The Democratic Party's viability and the faith of its supporter cannot stand another fold in the shutdown.
    


            Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine represents Virginia, which borders the capital and, along with Maryland, stands to suffer most from federal government firings and furloughs. But Kaine told CNN's Jake Tapper on Wednesday that his voters aren't ready to give in.
    


            “Donald Trump started to punish us the day he was inaugurated and it's time to stand up and get the punishment to stop. I'm not hearing the message, ‘You've got to give into the bully.' They are saying, ‘We're tired of it. We are tiring of the layoffs, we're tired of canceling economic development projects and having funds pulled back from the state. It's time to draw the line and stop it.'”
    


            Unless sentiments change among Kaine's voters, it may be a while before Democratic senators feel unbearable pressure to call a halt. Like Trump, the political incentives to give up don't yet outweigh those to keep going.
    


            So Sen. Kennedy might be right. The shutdown may only have just begun. The next outside leverage point may be Thanksgiving, when the annual travel crush would be a nightmare amid airport security delays and air traffic control snarls caused by workers calling in sick after working weeks without a paycheck.
    


            But the holiday is still six weeks away.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Democrats outperform Republicans with donors across the top Senate races","https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/senate-democrats-republicans-fundraising","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 13:15:21 GMT","


            Democratic candidates raised more than Republicans in all but one of the five most competitive Senate races in recent months, new campaign fundraising reports show.
    


            Building cash reserves for next year's high-priced midterm battles could help Democrats as they try to flip four seats from Republicans, a difficult task that will require beating longtime GOP senators or winning in states that have turned unfriendly to progressives.
    


            In Georgia, Sen. Jon Ossoff, the lone Senate Democrat seeking reelection in a state President Donald Trump carried in 2024, continues to far surpass his Republicans rivals in fundraising, according to third-quarter filings Wednesday night with the Federal Election Commission.
    


            His $12 million haul in the July-September window was more than twice the combined amount raised by three best-known Republicans vying to challenge him next year. He entered October with more than $21 million in cash reserves.
    


            His fundraising advantage is likely to dwindle once Republicans settle on their Senate nominee next year. Georgia GOP voters are deciding between former football coach Derek Dooley, who has the backing of Gov. Brian Kemp, and Reps. Mike Collins and Buddy Carter.
    


            In North Carolina, former Gov. Roy Cooper reported raising $10.9 million for his main campaign account, swamping the nearly $1.4 million collected by Republican Michael Whatley, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee who is running with the president's backing.
    


            Those totals exclude money the campaigns announced as coming from their joint fundraising committees. Adding those in, Cooper's political operation still outperformed Whatley's committees.
    


            Democrats view North Carolina as one of their best hopes for picking up a Republican seat next year, given the retirement of two-term GOP Sen. Thom Tillis.
    


            In Maine, Democrat and oyster farmer Graham Platner raised $3.2 million, exceeding the $1.9 million collected by five-term Republican Sen. Susan Collins, a top target for Democrats next year.
    


            But this week's entry of two-term Democratic Gov. Janet Mills in the race is quickly transforming the contest. Mills, a top recruit for national party leaders, announced that she had raised $1 million in the first 24 hours of joining the campaign. Mills' first required financial disclosure — detailing her fundraising and spending in the final three months of 2025 — won't be due until early next year.
    


            Platner, a first-time candidate who has been endorsed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, has made clear he does not intend make way for Mills and released his first television ad this week. Jordan Wood, a former congressional aide who also is seeking the Democratic nomination, reported collecting nearly $1.5 million during the quarter, Federal Election Commission records show.

            In neighboring New Hampshire, where Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen is retiring, Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas raised $1.8 million, outperforming former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, who brought in a little more than $968,000.
    


            In Michigan, former Rep. Mike Rogers, the leading Republican in the open race to replace retiring Sen. Gary Peters, collected $2.2 million in the third quarter. Rep. Haley Stevens narrowly led the Democratic field with a $1.9 million haul.
    


            State Sen. Mallory McMorrow and former Wayne County health official Abdul El Sayed followed close behind.

Live Updates


            • Congressional impasse: The Senate failed to advance Republicans' stopgap funding bill once again in a 51 to 45 vote. The divide in the chamber seems to be growing over health care-related demands, with House Speaker Mike Johnson saying he has “no idea” how the shutdown will end and that “it's up to the Democrats.”
    


• Shutdown layoffs: A judge yesterday halted the Trump administration's efforts to lay off roughly 4,000 federal workers. Before the ruling, the Office of Management and Budget director said that layoffs would likely reach “north of 10,000.”



• Trump's schedule today: President Donald Trump said he's having a “lengthy” conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin ahead of his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tomorrow. Trump's also set to make “an announcement” at the White House.
    


            • Has the government shutdown affected you? CNN wants to hear your story.



            The Senate failed to advance Republicans' stopgap funding bill once again in a 51 to 45 vote.
    


            Republicans need 60 votes to advance the bill that would fund the government through late November.
    


            Three senators in the Democratic caucus voted with most Republicans. They were:
    


            • Catherine Cortez Masto
    


            • John Fetterman
    


            • Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats
    


            GOP Sen. Rand Paul voted against advancing the measure. Senate GOP leader John Thune switched to no at end, a procedural move that will allow him to bring it back up again in the future.
    


            Americans see plenty of blame to go around for the shutdown, according to an AP-NORC poll released Thursday: 58% say that Republicans in Congress deserve at least “quite a bit” of responsibility, with 58% saying the same of President Donald Trump, and 54% in regard to Democrats in Congress.
    


            Roughly half of the public, 48%, assigns a great deal of blame to Trump and 45% to congressional Republicans, compared to 40% who say the same of congressional Democrats.
    


            More than 8 in 10 Democratic-aligned adults say Trump and congressional Republicans, respectively, bear a great deal of responsibility, while 73% of Republican-aligned adults say that congressional Democrats deserve a great deal of responsibility.
    


            Overall, the Democratic Party's favorability rating stands at 32% and the GOP's at 40% — in both cases, effectively unchanged from the AP-NORC's September polling.
    


More about the poll: The AP-NORC poll was conducted October 9-13, using a nationally representative panel to survey 1,289 adults through online and live telephone interviews. Results among the full sample have a margin of error of +/-3.8 percentage points.
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune is frustrated that Democrats are signaling they will likely block taking up the defense appropriations bill when a vote takes place Thursday afternoon.
    


            Democrats say they want to vote for the defense bill but are demanding Republicans agree to attach spending bills for other departments – like possibly Health and Human Services, Labor, Transportation and Justice — to the Pentagon bill, which is considered popular and must-pass legislation.
    


            Thune has said he also wants those bills added to the DOD bill once they formally begin debate on it, but Democrats are wary of going along because they say it's some GOP senators who are blocking consent to add those bills and they don't trust that will change.
    


            Thune argued Democrats have the opportunity later in the process to filibuster the bill and said it's critical – especially with the government shutdown – the appropriations process move forward.
    


            “If they want to stop the defense bill, I don't think it's very good optics for them.  Particularly since this is just getting on it, and they would have multiple opportunities after this to block it if they want to,” he told reporters.
    


            Democrats say Thune can vote again to take up the defense bill in the future once he has the necessary consent to add those bills and they will support it.
    


            President Donald Trump said Thursday he's having a “lengthy” conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which comes just a day before the president is scheduled to host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House.
    


            “I am speaking to President Putin now. The conversation is ongoing, a lengthy one, and I will report the contents, as will President Putin, at its conclusion. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.



            House Speaker Mike Johnson said he was “mad Mike” on day 16 of the government shutdown with no end in sight.
    


            “Many of you have asked all of us, how will it end? We have no idea. It's up to the Democrats,” Johnson said.
    


            “I don't like being mad Mike, I want to, I want to be happy. I want to be the happy warrior. But I am so upset about this,” Johnson said.
    


            When asked by CNN if it was time for President Donald Trump to get more involved in the stalemate on Capitol Hill, Johnson said, “he already has been.”
    


            Johnson said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer would not accept Senate Majority Leader John Thune's offer to have a standalone vote on extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies without a “guaranteed outcome.”
    


            Pressed whether he would put a vote on ACA subsidies on the House floor, Johnson said “none of us can guarantee an outcome on that” and said the government needed to be open to allow negotiations over the enhanced subsidies to kick into full force.
    


            Senators are now voting on a short-term government funding proposal from the Republican Party.
    


            The House-passed stopgap bill would fund the government through November 21. It does not address the Democrats' health care demands.
    


            It needs 60 votes to advance, meaning Republicans would need Democrats to sign on.
    


            President Donald Trump is scheduled to speak with Russian President Vladmir Putin on Thursday, two White House officials told CNN.
    


            The call comes ahead of Trump's Friday meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, where the two are expected to discuss the potential of the US providing the country with long-range Tomahawk missiles, as well as Kyiv taking a more offensive position in its war against Russia, the officials said.
    


            It also comes as Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Putin in recent weeks for failing to seriously negotiate an end to the war.
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he told Democrats he could guarantee a vote on Affordable Care Act subsidies by a certain date, adding that “at some point Democrats have to take yes for an answer” to end the government shutdown.
    


            In an interview with MSNBC's Ali Vitali, Thune repeated that Republicans are “willing to have the conversation” about health care but that discussions about Obamacare premium subsidies need “to happen in a separate context.”
    


Remember: Those subsidies, which help Americans pay monthly premiums, are at the center of the shutdown stalemate, with Democrats demanding an extension to them as open enrollment for Affordable Care Act plans begins in November.
    


            The Senate majority leader said he couldn't guarantee that the subsidies would pass in a vote, but “I can guarantee you that there will be a process and you will get a vote.” With the funds set to expire at the end of the year, however, Democrats have said Republicans have not negotiated and that there has not been a meaningful proposal to extend them.
    


            In an interview moments later, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries did not say if he believed Democrats would be supportive of Thune's proposal. “I haven't confirmed that that's an actual offer that's been made,” Jeffries told Vitali.
    


            Thune added in the MSNBC interview that he hoped the shutdown would not “last through Thanksgiving” and that there's a “path forward” on these issues.
    


            This is what's listed on President Donald Trump's public schedule from the White House:
    


• 11 a.m. ET: Trump receives an intelligence briefing.• 3 p.m. ET: Trump makes an announcement, which is open to press.
    


            We'll let you know when we find out more details.
    


            Over in Congress, the Senate is in session at 10 a.m. ET. The chamber is expected to vote again on the GOP funding bill proposal, which failed once more yesterday.
    


            CNN's Kaitlan Collins explains the key takeaways from the latest town hall with independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which highlighted the deep divide over reopening the federal government.
    


Read more takeaways here.



            Many federal employees missed their first paycheck of the shutdown this week, which is now on its 16th day. But some select others will still get paid, as the Trump administration moves around money for FBI agents and members of the military.
    


• FBI: The agency's director Kash Patel said yesterday the administration plans to continue paying FBI agents during the shutdown. “You found a way to get these individuals paid during a government shutdown,” he told President Donald Trump at an event on crime in the Oval Office.
    


• Military: Trump also directed the Pentagon to find money to pay active-duty military and reserves currently performing active service. The president wrote in a national security memo yesterday that allowing the armed forces to go without pay “presents a serious and unacceptable threat to military readiness.”
    


            CNN reported earlier this week that the funds for military paychecks will be pulled from the Pentagon's research and development money that's available for two years, according to a spokesperson for the White House Office of Management and Budget.
    


• WIC: The administration also moved to fund a food assistance program known as WIC that was poised to run out of money due to the shutdown.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump was telling a Rose Garden audience about his efforts to quell violence in the nation's capital when, as if on cue, his words were drowned out by the wail of sirens from passing vehicles.

“Listen to the beauty of that sound,” Trump said, grinning. “They're not politically correct sirens.” 

The moment encapsulated how Trump's law-and-order-at-all-costs push has become a centerpiece of his second term — something he said has surprised him.

“Now it's like a passion for me,” Trump said on Wednesday as he touted the results of a crackdown named “Operation Summer Heat” in the Oval Office, during which he said the FBI had made 8,000-plus arrests. He said his actions were “many, many steps above” what he'd pledged on the campaign trail last year.

He's deployed troops to Democratic-majority cities and directed federal officials, often with their faces obscured by masks, to round up people living in the country illegally. He's suggested urban areas could become military “training grounds” and toyed with invoking the Insurrection Act so political opponents can't use the courts to foil his plans. 

Now settled into his second term, the Republican president has embraced the kind of tough-on-crime approach he was unable to achieve as naysayers checked his most extreme instincts during his first four years in office.

Trump's efforts have drawn resistance from local leaders. His plans to send soldiers to Chicago and Portland, Oregon, have been thwarted by legal challenges. He has said he's confident he'll win on appeal but hasn't ruled out using the Insurrection Act as a workaround, if needed.




But elsewhere, his moves have dramatically altered day-to-day lives. Earlier this year, he took control of the California National Guard in response to protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles and sent the National Guard into Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tennessee. 

Trump also has mused about taking similar action in Baltimore, New Orleans New York and Boston.

Trump's embrace of the hardest possible line against crime suspects dates back to his days as a real estate mogul back in the gritty days of 1970s and '80s New York, when crime was rampant.

His mindset burst into public view when he stirred racial tensions by calling for the execution of the Central Park Five, a group of Black and Hispanic teenagers wrongly convicted of rape in 1989. 

Trump took out full-page newspaper ads under the headlines: “Bring Back The Death Penalty. Bring Back Our Police!” Those convictions were vacated in 2002, after evidence linked a serial rapist to the crime. Today, the case is remembered by activists as evidence of a criminal justice system prejudiced against defendants of color.

“That's the very same spirit that's at work now,” said the Rev. J. Lawrence Turner of the Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church in Memphis. Turner said Trump had “demonized” and “targeted” Memphis, which is 62% African American and has a Black mayor and county leader. 

“We have this president unleashed in this second term,” he said.

Trump covered some of the same political ground in his first term during the protests over racism and police brutality sparked by the 2020 killing of George Floyd, when he sent troops to the streets of Washington and to Portland. But his advisers at the time staunchly opposed many of his calls to more broadly deploy the military to beat back unrest.

Trump's former defense secretary Mark Esper later told CBS' “60 Minutes” that Trump had asked during the protests whether the National Guard could be tougher on demonstrators. “‘Can't you just shoot them? Just shoot them in the legs, or something,'” Esper said he recalled Trump saying. 

However, a Trump signature bipartisan achievement in his first term was a 2018 criminal justice reform measure meant to reduce federal prison populations and address disparities in sentencing, after lobbying from advocates including Kim Kardashian. 

Trump was attacked from the right for that policy, though, during the 2024 Republican primary and rarely spoke about his criminal justice reform bill while campaigning. He instead drew cheers with calls for the death penalty for drug dealers and those who kill police officers.

Trump now sees getting tough on crime as a winning political issue heading into next year's midterm elections.

“We're going to save all of our cities, and we're going to make them essentially crime-free,” he said Wednesday.

Recent polling from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found his administration's tough-on-crime approach has emerged as one of his best issues, amid frustrations over his handling of the economy and immigration. 

The vast majority of Americans, 81%, see crime as a “major problem” in large cities, even as statistics show violent crime is down across the nation following a coronavirus pandemic-era spike.

The shift also reflects a Trump no longer encumbered by chiefs of staff, generals and others who saw their duty as reining in his most extreme impulses and have long been replaced by loyalists.

“This time around, he has people around him that are not simply supporting what he's doing, they're encouraging him,” said Patrick G. Eddington, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute.

The White House rejects suggestions Trump's crackdown on crime has anything to do with race. It says the National Guard is being utilized in different cities for different reasons. 

Washington is a crime-fighting push that Republican state leaders in Tennessee asked be replicated in Memphis, it argues. In Portland and Chicago, as in Los Angeles previously, the goal is protection of federal authorities working on priorities like immigration enforcement.

“The president's bold actions in cities across the country are making all Americans safer,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said, describing Trump's actions as the fulfillment of a campaign promise.

Still, deploying troops to cities gives Trump the opportunity to paint Democratic opponents as soft on crime while overstating — often in apocalyptic terms — how bad the problem really is. He then exaggerates the results.

He spent weeks suggesting Portland is “on fire” and declared Washington “a raging hellhole.” He now suggests Washington crime has fallen to zero, which also isn't true. 

Maya Wiley, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said the administration's efforts are an extension of Trump's brand, which she described as “using race overtly to drive division, to consolidate a base and to use that to usurp power a president does not have, or should not be deemed to have.”

Indeed, Trump now routinely speaks of criminals as people without redemption.

“They're sick,” he said recently, “and we're taking them out.”

NEW DELHI (AP) — From the Andes to the Himalayas, a new wave of protests is unfolding across the world, driven by generational discontent against governments and anger among young people. 

This week, Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina was forced out of power and out of the country after a military mutiny, the culmination of weeks of demonstrations led by young protesters referring to themselves as “Gen Z Madagascar.”

The rage against the political establishment in the Indian Ocean island country mirrors other recent protests across the world, in countries like Nepal, the Philippines, Indonesia, Kenya, Peru and Morocco. These protests have been sparked by specific grievances but are driven by long-simmering issues like widening inequality, economic uncertainty, corruption, and nepotism of leaders.

But they have one thing in common: Mostly leaderless, they are made up primarily of young people who brand themselves as “Gen Z,” defined as those born roughly between 1996 and 2010 — the first generation to grow up entirely in the internet age. 

“What connects these youth-led protests is a shared sense that traditional political systems aren't responsive to their generation's concerns, whether that's corruption, climate change, or economic inequality. Protest then becomes the logical outlet when institutional channels feel blocked,” said Sam Nadel, director of Social Change Lab, a U.K.-based nonprofit that researches protests and social movements.

Though their specific demands differ, most of these protests have been sparked by government overreach or neglect. Some have also confronted harsh treatment by security forces and brutal repression.

In Morocco, a leaderless collective called Gen Z 212 — named after Morocco's dialing code — has taken to the streets to demand better public services and increased spending on health and education. In Peru, protests over a pension law exploded into broader demands, including action to tackle rising insecurity and widespread corruption in the government. In Indonesia, deadly protests have erupted over lawmakers' perks and the cost of living, forcing the president to replace key economic and security ministers. 




The most widely recognized movement to be dubbed as a “Gen Z” protest was a deadly uprising in Nepal that culminated with the resignation of the prime minister in September. Protesters drew inspiration from successful anti-government movements elsewhere in South Asia — Sri Lanka in 2022 and Bangladesh in 2024 — which led to the ouster of incumbent regimes.

In Madagascar in turn, protesters say they were particularly inspired by the movements in Nepal and Sri Lanka. 

The protests began against regular water and electricity cuts but quickly morphed into wider discontent, as demonstrators called for the president and other ministers to step down. On Wednesday, Madagascar's military coup leader said he is “taking the position of president.”

Across multiple countries, a singular pop culture symbol has emerged: a black flag showing a grinning skull and crossbones wearing a straw hat. The flag comes from a cult Japanese manga and anime series called “One Piece,” which follows a crew of pirates as they take on corrupt governments.

In Nepal, protesters hung the same flag on the gates of the Singha Durbar, the seat of the Nepalese government, and on ministries, many of which were torched in protests. It was also hoisted by crowds in Indonesia, the Philippines, Morocco and Madagascar.

Last week in the Peruvian capital, Lima, 27-year-old electrician David Tafur stood with the same flag in San Martín Square, now the stage for weekly protests.

“We're fighting the same battle — against corrupt officials who, in our case, are also killers,” he said, recalling that President Dina Boluarte's government held on to power since December 2022 despite more than 500 protests and the deaths of 50 civilians.

“In my case, it's outrage over abuse of power, corruption, the deaths,” Tafur said, referring to the sharp rise in murders and extortion plaguing the South American country since 2017, amid new laws that have weakened efforts to fight crime.

Boluarte had been under investigation for months over various allegations including bribery and involvement in a deadly crackdown on protesters in 2022. She was replaced last week by interim President José Jerí.

Tafur said that wasn't enough.

“The president is an ally of Congress and has to go,” he said.

Many significant protests in the past, like Occupy Wall Street in 2011, the Arab Spring between 2010 and 2012, and the 2014 Umbrella Revolution in Hong Kong, have been led by younger people. While they also used the internet and social media for mass mobilization, the “Gen Z” protesters are taking it to another level.

“Digital platforms are powerful tools for information sharing and building connections, but the most effective movements often combine digital mobilization with traditional in-person organizing, as we've seen in these recent protests,” said Nadel from Social Change Lab.

Days before the deadly protests began in Nepal, the government announced a ban on most social media platforms for not complying with a registration deadline. Many young Nepalese viewed it as an attempt to silence them and began accessing social media sites through virtual private networks to evade detection.

Over the next few days, they used TikTok, Instagram and X to spotlight the lavish lifestyles of politicians' children, highlighting disparities between Nepal's rich and poor, and announce planned rallies and venues. Later, some of them also used the gaming chat platform Discord to suggest who to nominate as an interim leader for the country.

“Whatever movement happens, whether against corruption or injustice, it spreads through digital media. The same happened in Nepal. The changes that took place after the Gen Z protests in Nepal spread globally through digital platforms, influencing other countries as well,” said protester Yujan Rajbhandari.

He said the protests in Nepal awakened not only the youth but also other generations.

“We realized that we are global citizens and the digital space connects us all and plays a powerful role across the world,” Rajbhandari said.

TORONTO (AP) — The leader of Canada's most populous province called for economic retaliation on the U.S. after auto company Stellantis said it was moving planned production of its Jeep Compass from Canada to the U.S.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford blamed U.S. President Donald Trump for the company's decision this week to shift production of the SUV from Brampton, Ontario, to Illinois as part of plan to invest $13 billion to expand its manufacturing capacity in the United States.

The comments come as Canada is negotiating to reduce tariffs. Trump has been urging the Big 3 American automakers to move production to the U.S. 

“That guy, President Trump, he's a real piece of work,” Ford said. “I'm sick and tired of rolling over. We need to fight back.”

Ford said Canada needs to hit back with tariffs if Prime Minister Mark Carney can't reach a trade deal with Trump. 

Dominic LeBlanc, the minister responsible for Canada-U.S. trade, is in Washington this week for talks to reduce tariffs on certain sectors. Carney left Washington last week without a deal. 

Carney said the move by the world's fourth-largest carmaker was a direct consequence of tariffs and his government would work with Stellantis to create new opportunities in the Brampton area. Carney added that Ottawa expects Stellantis to fulfill its commitment to Brampton workers. The federal government threatened legal action against the company. 

Federal Industry Minister Mélanie Joly said the production shift is “unacceptable” and warned Stellantis made commitments to Canadian production in exchange for substantial financial support.




“Anything short of fulfilling that commitment will be considered as default under our agreements,” Joly wrote in a letter to the company chief executive.

Fear has spread in Ontario over what will happen to Canada's auto sector. Autos are Canada's second-largest export and Carney has noted the sector employs 125,000 Canadians directly and almost another 500,000 in related industries.

“Stellantis is bowing at the Trump administration with this pledge of massive investments in the U.S.,” Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

“If this bullying tactic works with Stellantis I expect it to be replicated to every other automaker that has a presence in Canada and frankly other sectors that the U.S. has an interest in.”

Workers at the Stellantis assembly plant in Brampton were greeted Wednesday with a robocall from their employer that said work they'd been waiting for wouldn't be coming back. The company closed the factory in 2023 and laid off its roughly 3,000 workers as it retooled the facility. 

Stellantis said it would reopen its Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois to expand U.S. Jeep production, creating thousands of new jobs there.

Vito Beato, president of Unifor Local 1285, which represents the Brampton plant workers, said the news came as a surprise because Stellantis had said previously it was committed to producing its Jeep Compass in Brampton.

Stellantis said it continues to invest in Canada, including adding a third shift to the Windsor, Ontario assembly plant, and that it is in talks with the government on the future of the Brampton facility.

Carney won the country's election earlier this year fueled by Trump's annexation threats and trade war, but has tried to improve relations ahead of a review of the free trade deal next year. More than 75% of Canada's exports go to the U.S. and Canada recently dropped many of its retaliatory tariffs to match U.S. tariff exemptions for goods covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact.

Ford said Canada should start responding to Trump's tariffs with its own harsh measures. 

“That's the only thing that this person understands,” Ford said of Trump. Ford is scheduled to meet with Carney this week.

PARIS (AP) — French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu survived two votes of no-confidence Thursday that could have toppled his fragile new government and plunged France deeper into political chaos.

The National Assembly votes clear the way for the embattled Lecornu to pursue what could be an even greater challenge: getting a 2026 budget for the European Union's second-largest economy through Parliament's powerful but bitterly divided lower house before the end of the year.

Lecornu's survival also spares any immediate need for President Emmanuel Macron to dissolve the National Assembly and call snap legislative elections, a hazardous option that the French leader took in 2024 and which he had signaled that he might take again if Lecornu fell.

Lecornu, a close ally of the French president, faced two no-confidence motions filed by Macron's fiercest opponents — the hard-left France Unbowed party and Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Rally and her allies in Parliament.

The 577-seat chamber voted on the France Unbowed motion first — and it fell short by 18 votes, with 271 lawmakers supporting it. It needed a majority of 289 votes to succeed. 

Le Pen's second motion got just 144 votes, well short of a majority, backed only by her party, its allied Union of the Right for the Republic and a handful of other lawmakers.

Yaël Braun-Pivet, the National Assembly president and a Macron loyalist, said the outcome left her “reasonably optimistic” about the chances of building consensus for the 2026 budget in Parliament despite its deep divisions. 

“I am sure that there's a path,” she said.

But Lecornu isn't out of the woods yet.

To get the votes he needed, Lecornu dangled the possibility of rolling back one of the flagship but most unpopular reforms of Macron's second term as president, which will gradually raise France's retirement age from 62 to 64. 

Lecornu's proposed suspension of the 2023 pension reform helped convince lawmakers from the opposition Socialist Party to grudgingly decide not to back the efforts to topple him, at least for now. 

With 69 lawmakers, Socialist backing for Lecornu's removal would have tipped the outcome against him. But just seven Socialists broke ranks in voting for the France Unbowed motion.

The conservative Republicans, with 50 lawmakers, also withheld backing for Lecornu's removal, despite a fiery appeal for support from Éric Ciotti, a former Republicans leader who since 2024 has allied with Le Pen's far right.

“Don't compromise yourselves by supporting this government. Don't swallow this snake, this boa (constrictor), this pink alligator,” Ciotti said. “No voter on the right will forgive you.” 

In the closest-run first motion, just one Republicans lawmaker backed Lecornu's removal. But for Le Pen's second motion, with lower stakes because it had little chance of succeeding, three Republicans broke ranks and voted against the prime minister, underscoring that conservative tolerance for Lecornu could quickly run dry in the coming weeks or months.

Lecornu's still fragile position could yet crumble if Socialist or Republicans lawmakers change tack and support any future no-confidence votes if they don't get what they want in the budget negotiations that are sure to be fractious. 

Lecornu has promised not to use a special constitutional power to railroad the budget through Parliament without lawmakers' approval — which was the tool that Macron's government employed to impose the 2023 pension reform despite a firestorm of protests.

Building consensus in Parliament for tax hikes, spending cuts and other budget measures to start reining in France's ballooning state deficit and debt promises to be extremely difficult, with the National Assembly deeply divided since Macron dissolved it in June 2024. The ensuing legislative elections produced no outright winner and precipitated the political deadlock that has gripped France ever since, with Macron's prime ministers falling in quick succession.

The prospect of a hard-fought presidential race when Macron's second and last term ends in 2027 is also complicating consensus-building, with political parties already looking to score points with voters. Addressing lawmakers before they voted, Lecornu urged them to put those considerations aside for now. 

“History, in any case, will judge these political maneuvers very harshly, where the platform of the National Assembly has essentially been confused with an advertising platform,” he said. “The presidential election will come. You will have the opportunity to campaign. For now, do not hold the nation's budget and the Social Security budget hostage.”

The J.M. Smucker Co. is suing Trader Joe's, alleging the grocery chain's new frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are too similar to Smucker's Uncrustables in their design and packaging.

In the lawsuit, which was filed Monday in federal court in Ohio, Smucker said the round, crustless sandwiches Trader Joe's sells have the same pie-like crimp markings on their edges that Uncrustables do. Smucker said the design violates its trademarks.

Smucker also asserted that the boxes Trader Joe's PB&J sandwiches come in violate the Orrville, Ohio-based company's trademarks because they are the same blue color it uses for the lettering on “Uncrustables” packages. 

Trader Joe's boxes also show a sandwich with a bite mark taken out of it, which is similar to the Uncrustables design, Smucker said.

“Smucker does not take issue with others in the marketplace selling prepackaged, frozen, thaw-and-eat crustless sandwiches. But it cannot allow others to use Smucker's valuable intellectual property to make such sales,” the company said in its lawsuit.

Smucker is seeking restitution from Trader Joe's. It also wants a judge to require Trader Joe's to deliver all products and packaging to Smucker to be destroyed.

A message seeking comment was left Wednesday with Trader Joe's, which is based in Monrovia, California.

Michael Kelber, chair of the intellectual property group at Neal Gerber Eisenberg, a Chicago law firm, said Smucker's registered trademarks will help bolster its argument. But Trader Joe's might argue that the crimping on its sandwiches is simply functional and not something that can be trademarked, Kelber said.




Trader Joe's sandwiches also appear to be slightly more square than Uncrustables, so the company could argue that the shape isn't the same, Kelber said.

Uncrustables were invented by two friends who began producing them in 1996 in Fergus Falls, Minnesota. Smucker bought their company in 1998 and secured patents for a “sealed, crustless sandwich” in 1999.

But it wasn't easy to mass produce them. In the lawsuit, Smucker said it has spent more than $1 billion developing the Uncrustables brand over the last 20 years. Smucker spent years trying to perfect Uncrustables' stretchy bread and developing new filling flavors like chocolate and hazelnut.

Kelber said one of the biggest issues companies debate in cases like this one is whether the copycat product deceives consumers.

Smucker claims that's already happening with Trader Joe's sandwiches. In the lawsuit, Smucker showed a social media photo of a person claiming that Trader Joe's is contracting with Smucker to make the sandwiches under its own private label.

This isn't the first time Smucker has taken legal action to protect its Uncrustables brand. In 2022, it sent a cease and desist letter to a Minnesota company called Gallant Tiger, which was making upscale versions of crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with crimped edges. Smucker said Wednesday that it hasn't taken further action but continues to monitor Gallant Tiger.

Smucker likely felt it had no choice but to sue this time around, Kelber said. 

“For the brand owner, what is the point of having this brand if I'm not going to enforce it?” Kelber said. “If they ignore Trader Joe's, they are feeding that, and then the next person who does it they won't have an argument.”

Kelber said trademark cases often wind up being settled because neither company wants to go through an expensive trial. 

Smucker's lawsuit comes a few months after a similar lawsuit filed against the Aldi by Mondelez International, which claimed that Aldi's store-brand cookies and crackers have packaging that is too similar to Mondelez brands like Chips Ahoy, Wheat Thins and Oreos.

Angel Reese took her game from the court to the catwalk and made history along the way.

The Chicago Sky forward became the first professional athlete to walk in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show on Wednesday, joining the brand's high-profile “Wings Reveal” lineup in New York.

“It was destined for me,” Reese said during an interview before the show began. “This is already for me. I'm so happy to be sitting in this room with so many amazing models and women. The team that put this all together has been amazing. I'm so excited.”

Reese said she hired a modeling coach to “perfect my walk.”

“I walk, sleep, hoop,” she said. “And I hoop, sleep, walk.”

Reese, 23, made her debut on the Victoria Secret runway wearing pink floral lingerie set adorned with blossoms and lace detailing, paired with a dramatic feathered stole draped across her arms. The wrap was covered in soft pink and rose-toned textures.

The 6-foot-3 Reese donned the signature angel white wings that have defined the show for decades, a new stage for an athlete known for her confidence, charisma and crossover appeal. She walked to the tune of Lumidee's “Never Leave You (Uh Oooh, Uh Oooh.)”

Reese is a former Louisiana State University national champion and NCAA tournament most outstanding player in 2023.

“One of her biggest dreams was to walk this show,” said celebrity stylist Law Roach, a co-host on the pink carpet who helped reinvent Zendaya, turned Celine Dion into a fashion icon and is a close friend to Reese.

“We had a conversation. I told her, ‘I don't think that's a big dream at all.'” Roach said. “And for that to happen in a year or less, that she's walking the show and, I mean, she looks stunning, like the hair, the makeup, her presence, she's ready, she's excited. That makes me the most proud because she's the one out of most of the girls I have, you know, the kind of deepest connection with.”

The show was livestreamed on YouTube, Instagram, TikTok and Prime Video in the U.S. The show is a mix of music and celebrities, with Madison Beer sporting pink wings performing “Make You Mine” with lingerie-clad models strutting on the catwalk.




K-pop group TWICE hit the runway too, performing “This is For” and “Strategy.” Karol G sang “Ivonny Bonita” before she walked solo in red wings and lingerie ensemble.

Reese has become one of the most visible figures in women's sports. Her style, outspokenness and social media influence have helped bridge the gap between sports, fashion and pop culture.

The lingerie show began in 2001 and took place annually for nearly two decades. Victoria's Secret canceled the show in 2019, but brought it back last year, with Reese attending.

According to the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office, Sizhe Weng, a USC graduate student, faces eight felony counts, including rape and sodomy, with evidence suggesting a pattern of assaults dating back to 2021.

A Chinese national who has been studying in the United States has been charged with drugging and sexually assaulting several women over a three-year span, prosecutors said Wednesday.

The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office announced felony charges against Sizhe ""Steven"" Weng, 30, a Chinese national pursuing a doctorate at the University of Southern California (USC).

He is accused of slipping incapacitating drugs into victims' food or drinks before assaulting them between 2021 and 2024. Weng faces eight felony counts, including forcible rape, rape and sodomy by use of controlled substances, and sexual penetration by use of anesthesia or drugs.

Los Angeles police told reporters they were first tipped off to Weng in January by German police, who said they believed he could be the man behind a string of similar assaults in the European country, the Los Angeles Times reported.

LAPD Deputy Chief Alan Hamilton said that authorities believe that Weng was an ""opportunist"" who drugged his victims before allegedly sexually assaulting them. 

""Evidence was recovered at Weng's residence that corroborated his involvement in drug-facilitated sexual assaults of multiple victims dating back to 2021 and continuing into 2025,"" he said.

Weng was arrested Aug. 28 and pleaded not guilty at a Sept. 2 arraignment, court records show. He is being held without bail pending a preliminary hearing set for Jan. 14, 2026, at the Foltz Criminal Justice Center in downtown Los Angeles. Prosecutors said three women have been identified so far, but investigators believe there may be additional victims.

If convicted as charged, Weng faces 25 years to life plus 56 years in California state prison. He would be required to register as a sex offender for life. The district attorney's office asked any other possible victims to come forward.

The LAPD's Robbery-Homicide Division is handling the investigation.

A USC spokesperson said the university is cooperating fully with law enforcement and that Weng ""has been barred from campus"" during the ongoing investigation. The DA's office urged anyone with information to call detectives at 213-486-6890.

""No one should ever have to endure the trauma of being drugged, sexually assaulted and stripped of their ability to consent,"" Hochman said in a statement.

Rep. David Kustoff, who represents part of the Memphis suburbs, spoke with Fox News Digital after meeting with members of President Donald Trump's Memphis Safe Task Force in Tennessee.

EXCLUSIVE: A Memphis-area House Republican is eyeing a permanent federal law enforcement presence in the southwest Tennessee city after President Donald Trump's order cracking down on crime.

Rep. David Kustoff, R-Tenn., whose district includes suburbs in the Memphis metropolitan area and rural areas outside of it, spent the day with Trump's new Memphis Safe Task Force on Thursday. 

He told Fox News Digital that the task force should serve as a blueprint for other U.S. cities dealing with high crime, while suggesting there should be some continuity plan in Memphis whenever its work is done.

""Because of the local law enforcement numbers being down, it makes sense to have a stronger federal law enforcement presence,"" Kustoff said.

He vowed to work with other Tennessee officials and the Trump administration ""to make sure that, on a permanent basis, we have extra federal law enforcement once this task force sees its completion.""

Trump authorized the Memphis Safe Task Force on Sept. 15 as part of a growing nationwide crackdown on violent crime, which began with the president federalizing Washington, D.C., police on a temporary basis earlier this year.

Memphis had the highest rate of crime of any big city in 2024, according to FBI data, though the Memphis Police Department reported a significant drop in the first eight months of 2025.

The Memphis Police Department recorded 250 murders, 753 cases of rape and over 12,800 aggravated assaults in 2024 alone, according to state crime data.

""I've lived here my entire life. I'm talking to you right now from Memphis, within the city limits. It's a good community,"" Kustoff said. ""There are really good people, but there have been high rates of crime and high rates of violent crime, and we saw that really exacerbated during the [Biden administration].""

There was notably a nationwide spike in crime during the COVID-19 pandemic, during the first part of former President Joe Biden's term.

And while Trump's move to send federal forces into major cities to deal with remnants of that crime has been met with resistance by his critics, Kustoff said Memphis residents were relieved.

""I know by talking to people here that they do appreciate the presence of the law enforcement and the National Guard. We heard that before they were deployed here, and we really hear it now,"" Kustoff said.

""These agents and the guard who are here … tell me that all different types of people are coming up, thanking them, hugging them. Of course, that's the Memphis way, that's the Southern way, that's the Tennessee way. But they are appreciative.""

Since its creation, the task force recovered 45 missing children and made over 900 arrests, Kustoff told Fox News Digital.

He said its work should serve as a model for other cities.

""This is a blueprint, what is being done in Memphis, for other big cities across the country,"" Kustoff argued. ""And I would think that any mayor and any governor who has a problem with crime in their communities would welcome such an effort.""

The 2022 NCAA women's swimming champion, Lia Thomas, who is transgender, will be the recipient of the Voice of Inspiration Award at Rainbow Labs' Violet Visionary Awards on Thursday.

Thomas' national title sparked nationwide backlash and is considered one of the catalysts in the battle over transgender athlete participation in girls' and women's sports.

The award""honors an individual whose story and actions ignite hope and courage within the LGBTQ+ community,"" according to Rainbow Labs' website.

The annual event ""honors individuals and organizations that embody the spirit of empowerment, resilience, and joy. We will uplift the power of LGBTQIA+ expression – in fashion, art, dance, voice, and story – as a revolutionary force fueling queer joy and collective freedom,"" the site says, adding that it will ""[celebrate] LGBTQIA+ leaders, mentors, and changemakers who are lighting the way for the next generation.""

""Voice of inspiration? The only people Will Thomas inspires are other men who realized you can take everything from women – our records, our spaces, our opportunities – and still get a standing ovation,"" Gaines told OutKick, using Thomas' birth name. ""It's 2025, not 2020. We're done pretending that's courage.""

OutKick first reported on Thomas' recognition at the event. 

The event is sponsored by both the Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles Football Club, among others. Both clubs did not respond to a request from OutKick about whether Thomas should be honored as a ""voice of inspiration.""

The Dodgers previously honored the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, a group of anti-Catholic drag ""nuns,"" with their Community Hero Award at Pride Night in 2023. Their original invitation was rescinded after backlash from both fans and players, but they were reinvited, and the team issued an apology.

Education Secretary Linda McMahon says President Donald Trump is on a mission to return education to the states on 'America's Newsroom.'

As the partial government shutdown persists amid partisan gridlock in Washington, D.C., Education Secretary Linda McMahon pointed out that the shutdown demonstrates that her department is not necessary.

She noted that schools are still functioning.

""The Democrat government shutdown has forced agencies to evaluate what federal responsibilities are truly critical for the American people. Two weeks in, millions of American students are still going to school, teachers are getting paid, and schools are operating as normal. It confirms what the President has said: the federal Department of Education is unnecessary, and we should return education to the states,"" McMahon noted in a post on X.

LINDA MCMAHON PULLS BACK THE CURTAIN ON TRUMP'S PLAN TO DISMANTLE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

""The Department has taken additional steps to better reach American students and families and root out the education bureaucracy that has burdened states and educators with unnecessary oversight,"" she continued. 

""No education funding is impacted by the RIF, including funding for special education, and the clean CR supported by the Trump Administration will provide states and schools the funding they need to support all students.""

Earlier this year, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at dismantling the department.

Trump said during a speech at the time that ""the department's useful functions … Pell Grants, Title I funding, resources for children with disabilities and special needs, will be preserved, fully preserved."" 

He said that they would be shifted to different agencies and departments.

""But beyond these core necessities, my administration will take all lawful steps to shut down the department,"" he noted.

 ""The Secretary of Education shall, to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return authority over education to the States and local communities while ensuring the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely,"" the president's March executive order declared, in part.

Authorities revealed footage of a home invasion in Florida that saw armed thieves holding a couple at gunpoint after tracking them down with an Apple AirTag this week.

The Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office said the incident occurred on Aug. 19. Suspects Luis Charles, 26, and Odardy Maldonado-Rodriguez, 32, are accused of placing an AirTag under the couple's SUV in order to track them back to their home in Odessa, Florida.

""Suspects forced the victims into their garage at gunpoint before fleeing when an alarm was triggered. Detectives later discovered an AirTag tracking device taped beneath the victim's vehicle,"" the sheriff's office said in a Facebook post.

Charles and Maldonado-Rodriguez are charged with armed burglary, two counts of armed kidnapping, robbery with a firearm, false imprisonment and illegal installation of a tracking device.

""To be ambushed at gunpoint in the very place you should feel safest is every family's worst nightmare,"" Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a statement. ""Thanks to the work of our detectives, these dangerous criminals are now behind bars where they belong, and the victims, along with our community, can rest a little easier.""

Footage shows the couple beginning to exit their vehicle in the driveway as the two suspects run up to each side of the SUV.

They then force the couple inside the home, where an alarm soon triggered. Both suspects then fled the scene.

Kelbie Murphy, a student at the University of North Georgia, made the shocking discovery that Christians were labeled as ""white supremacists"" in her assigned course reading.

A student at the University of North Georgia spoke out after revealing that an assigned textbook for one of her courses labeled Christianity as a ""U.S.-based white supremacist group.""

Kelbie Murphy, a senior at the university, paid roughly $100 for an assigned textbook in her International Public Relations course. In Chapter 8, the opening passage reads: ""An internet search produces the following modifier for identity: corporate, sexual, digital, public, racial, national, brand, and even Christian (a U.S.-based white supremacist group)."" 

""The way it was worded, it listed several marginalized groups, but then only called Christians to be White supremacists,"" Murphy told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. ""But the scariest thing is that the book was written in 2007.""

""This has been shared for almost 20 years, and it was never questioned,"" Murphy added. ""I think American academia needs a definite reevaluation, especially in our textbooks, as we can see from my prime example.""

Murphy is a devout Christian who was recently baptized in March, and she was inspired by her grandfather, a Baptist pastor in North Carolina, to ""never back down"" when it comes to her faith. 

""I don't want people who don't know who Jesus is or who don't know what Christianity is to take this and run with this and see Christians as a U.S.-based White supremacist group.""

The University of North Georgia did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment, but did issue a statement in September after Murphy posted a TikTok video about the textbook that went viral.

""Recently, questions have been raised about a passage in a course textbook. After fully reviewing the concern, we want to be clear: the reference in question was not describing Christians or Christianity,"" the statement read. ""The passage refers to an extremist group that misuses Christian symbols to promote hate.""

Murphy did note that her professor and a school official reached out to her after the viral video, offering their apologies for being offended.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Trump unveils plans for ‘Independence Arch' at dinner thanking donors of White House ballroom","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3852861/trump-unveils-plans-independence-arch-dinner-donors-white-house-ballroom/","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 12:53:05 GMT","

President Donald Trump unveiled another project on Wednesday for revamping the country's capital, announcing plans to build a large triumphal arch to mark the 250th anniversary of American independence next year.

Trump showed attendees at a White House donor event various models of the arch, which would be built across the Potomac River from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.

“This would be small, medium, and large. … I happen to think the large by far looks the best,” the president joked as he held up different models of the structure for the crowd. “It's going to be really beautiful. I think it's going to be fantastic.”

Trump, who made a decadeslong career as one of the country's most prestigious developers, including with acclaimed projects on some of New York City's most valuable real estate, has taken great pride in bringing his builder's eye to Washington. 

As president, he has taken on a number of projects, including redoing the iconic Rose Garden and undertaking efforts to build a new ballroom in the White House.

The fundraiser on Wednesday evening revolved around the ballroom, a privately funded effort projected to cost up to $250 million. More than three dozen organizations and people attended the dinner in the East Room with Trump, including Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon. 

“Chief executives throughout history have contributed to making the White House special, and nothing of this magnitude has been done,” Trump told them.

He thanked attendees for their contributions and told them leftover funds from the ballroom project would likely be used to construct the Independence Arch.

That development is set to soar above the Lincoln Memorial. Architectural renderings indicate the stone monument would feature carved wreaths, two huge eagles facing east, and a golden-winged angel brandishing a scepter. It strongly mimics the Washington Square Park arch in Manhattan and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

A top White House official said the arch was Trump's idea, according to CNN. 

“He came up with the design and has been part of the process every step of the way,” the official said, adding that the design is still in progress and timing for construction of the arch is to be determined. 

Architect Nicolas Leo Charbonneau, a partner at Harrison Design, is leading the project. 

Charbonneau shared a watercolor sketch of the arc to X last month.

“America needs a triumphal arch,” he said, adding the monument would be placed in the traffic circle in front of Arlington National Cemetery.

Quietly in Lynchburg, Virginia, earlier this year, the Trump administration took a small step toward starting a nuclear renaissance that could bring security and abundance to the United States for generations. This week, the Army announced it would scale up those efforts, ensuring energy resilience at military facilities worldwide while also revitalizing America's commercial nuclear industry.

A private firm, BWXT Advanced Technologies, began work in July on a prototype mobile microreactor, the first to be built and operated in the U.S. The microreactor is the centerpiece of Project Pele, a Department of War Strategic Capabilities Office initiative, and is scheduled to be delivered to Idaho National Laboratory by 2026. It is expected to begin producing electricity by 2028.

The Army is already satisfied with the progress of Project Pele and announced Tuesday that it would be expanded into Project Janus, a bolder plan to leverage what has been learned from Project Pele. It will become a program that can provide clean, safe, reliable nuclear microreactor energy to military bases around the world.

MAKING HIGHER EDUCATION AFFORDABLE AGAIN

“If you look at where modern warfare is going, in terms of drones and energy weapons, there is an increasing amount of electricity and energy that is being used at the same time,” said Jeff Waksman, principal deputy assistant secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy and Environment. He was speaking at the Annual Meeting & Exposition of the Association of the United States Army in Washington, D.C.

“It is an immense challenge in terms of providing 24/7 power,” he went on. “Military bases right now are powered entirely by fossil fuels. It is not possible with current technology to provide 24/7 power with solar, wind, and batteries. So the only solution to the tyranny of fuel that exists now is nuclear power.”

The genius of Pele and Janus is how the Department of War and the Department of Energy are bypassing the nation's greatest obstacle to a revived nuclear industry, which is the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. All the microreactors built through Project Janus will be owned and operated by private commercial entities, but because DOW will have exclusive possession of the final products, all permitting and waste management will be subject to DOW and DOE regulations, not costly and wasteful NRC oversight.

“The U.S. Army is leading the way in fielding innovative and disruptive technology,” Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said. “We are shredding red tape and incubating next-generation capabilities in a variety of critical sectors, including nuclear power.”

The federal government, particularly the Pentagon, has long been the initial customer for nascent industries that later became civilian commercial powerhouses. Semiconductors, satellites, and even the internet all started as government projects. The Trump administration rightly believes it can do for nuclear energy what past administrations have done for other sectors.

TRUMP'S HISTORIC VINDICATION IN ISRAEL

“Since the Manhattan Project, the Department of Energy and the Department of War have forged one of the defining partnerships in American history—advancing the science, engineering, and industrial capability that power our national security,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said. “What began as a wartime effort became the backbone of America's peacetime strength. Under President Trump's leadership, we're extending that legacy through initiatives like the Janus Program, accelerating next-generation reactor deployment and strengthening the nuclear foundations of American energy and defense.”

America's nuclear revival is fueled by creative governance, by an administration willing to rethink how innovation is regulated, not just how it's funded. Through Project Janus, the Trump administration has found a way to sidestep the bureaucratic paralysis that has smothered nuclear progress for decades, proving that safety and speed need not be enemies. By pairing private industry's ingenuity with federal flexibility, Trump is rekindling the nation's nuclear potential. If Pele was the prototype, Janus is the blueprint for American renewal through energy independence.

The U.S. Marine Corps rejected Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D-CA) claims of freeway closures during Saturday's amphibious assault demonstration honoring the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton, near San Diego. 

Newsom worried about the Marine Corps firing weapons from ships in the Pacific Ocean during Saturday's “Sea to Shore — A Review of Amphibious Strength” celebration in a social media post on Tuesday. He criticized the event and claimed it would cause I-5 to shut down. Multiple outlets, including the Los Angeles Times, also reported that the live-fire demonstration could force the closure of the major interstate.

“Donald Trump and JD Vance think that shutting down the I-5 to shoot out missiles from ships is how you respect the military,” Newsom said on X.  

“PUT ASIDE YOUR VANITY PARADE AND PAY OUR TROOPS INSTEAD,” he added.

The social media account for Newsom's press office also posted a critical message on X, calling the planned demonstration “an absurd show of force.” 

“This would be an absurd show of force, and totally uncalled for during a government shutdown when members of the military cannot even get a paycheck,” read the post.

However, the Marine Corps rebutted Newsom's claim late Wednesday, assuring that the events would occur at a beach west of the I-5 freeway and would not necessitate any shutdowns on any “public highway or transportation route.”

“All training events will occur on approved training ranges and comply with established safety protocols,” said Lt. Col. Lindsay Pirek, a Marine spokeswoman for the event. “No public highways or transportation routes will be closed.”

The press release issued by the Marine Corps also contrasted Newsom's description of the amphibious assault demonstration as not a “vanity parade” or “absurd show of force” but rather a training exercise for the Marine Corps to maintain their “readiness to defend the Homeland and protect our Nation's interests abroad against emergent and unprecedented challenges today and in the years ahead.”

The celebration will feature numerous activities involving Marine Corps personnel, weapons, vehicles, and a “live-fire” demonstration. Vice President JD Vance, a former Marine who served as a military journalist in the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing in Operation Iraqi Freedom, will be the keynote speaker. Vance is the first former Marine to hold the office of vice president.  

Other Trump administration officials, including Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and Secretary of the Navy John Phelan, are also scheduled to speak, according to reports.

HOW FOUR COURTS RULED DIFFERENT WAYS ON TRUMP'S NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENTS

As for closures and travel interruptions, Pirek said the only stoppages that will occur are some trains at Camp Pendleton. She mentioned there will be “multiple rehearsals” before Saturday's event, and a “detailed risk assessment” was conducted beforehand.

“In advance of the training event and demonstration, we conducted a detailed risk assessment,” Pirek said. “All participants will be briefed, medical, fire, and emergency assets will be on site, and multiple rehearsals will be conducted. All air, surface, and ground movements are scripted and rehearsed in accordance with standard operating procedures and established safety checklists.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

People will take buses and trains only if they feel safe while riding them.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Mass transit in the United States lacks mass appeal. In a 2024 study of data from nearly 800 cities, Asian urban residents used public transit for 43 percent of trips; 24 percent of Western Europeans in cities did the same. In American cities, the figure was less than 5 percent.

One significant reason for this disparity is that American governments have typically prioritized building roads over rail lines, and the needs of drivers over bus or subway riders. And because the costs of constructing public transit are much higher in the United States than in other developed countries, new projects are rarer and more slowly built than they ought to be. Other problems flow from the cost issue, such as low service quality: Trains and buses make less frequent stops in the U.S. than in peer nations, and public transit tends to serve a much smaller area.

But an underappreciated factor in low ridership is crime—and fear of crime—on public buses, trains, and other mass transit. About 40 percent of Americans describe public transit as unsafe; just 14 percent call it “very safe.” Those fears aren't unmerited: Large transit agencies reported just shy of 2,200 assaults last year (almost certainly an undercount), and cities such as Los Angeles, New York, and Washington, D.C., have recently struggled with surges in subway crime.

Some dismiss concerns about subway crime and disorder as baseless, the result of insufficiently hardened attitudes toward life in the “big city” or misperceptions about crime's prevalence. But if policy makers ignore people's fears, they will miss an opportunity to make transit better for everyone. Riders who are afraid of transit retreat from it, leaving the system—and the public square—poorer and less functional as a result. People who care about public transit need to care about more than infrastructure and design; they need to take into account rider safety.

Read: Why the National Guard won't make the subway safer

Americans' sense that their transit systems are unsafe is perhaps one reason the recent killing of Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee, aboard a light-rail train in Charlotte, North Carolina, resonated with so many people. Charlotte has spent billions on its light-rail system. Nonetheless, ridership is anemic. It peaked in the third quarter of 2019, at roughly 30,600 riders on an average weekday. As of the most recent figures, it was down to 21,000, a trivial number considering that 2.9 million people live in the Charlotte metro area.

Safety is a big part of why so few people use Charlotte's light rail. In polling from last year, only 37 percent of respondents agreed that Charlotte public transit was safe from crime; just 29 percent agreed that the stations were safe from crime, consistent with research showing that new stations on the system's Blue Line—on which Zarutska was killed—causally increased crime in the stations' vicinity. The system clearly failed to exclude Zarutska's killer, Decarlos Brown, a repeat offender with a history of violent crime and schizophrenia. Such people can impose a disproportionate burden on public-transit systems: The New York Post recently reported that just 63 people account for more than 5,000 arrests on the New York City subway.

Anyone who has ridden on an enclosed train car with a disruptive, unstable, or possibly violent person understands why such people drive potential transit riders away. Tightly packed, little-policed public spaces rely on a shared expectation that everyone will follow the rules. When people violate the rules, and when the state hardly enforces them, other would-be riders avoid public options, choosing, for example, to drive to work instead.

This dynamic can create a vicious cycle. As more rule-following people select out of the public space, the ratio of rule followers to rule breakers declines. Left unchecked, the space becomes unusable, no matter how many dollars are poured into infrastructure.

These are more than just academic concerns. With abundance being the buzzword of the Trump-era Democratic Party, many are dreaming of a more robust public-transit future. Improving public safety must be part of that effort.

Many abundance advocates, to their credit, have recognized the need to take public safety seriously. Commenting on Zarutska's death, the liberal economist and blogger Noah Smith wrote that “America's chronically high levels of violence and public disorder are one reason—certainly not the only reason, but one reason—that it's so politically difficult to build dense housing and transit in this country.” But others have the instinct to downplay these problems; Smith's fellow center-left commentator Matt Yglesias, for example, insisted in a reply that public transit is safe, and that its declining use is mostly driven by quality and quantity of service.

Yglesias is correct that these other factors matter a great deal. But a renewed commitment to public services requires public buy-in, which means in turn that the public can't be scared away. And insofar as individual sense of safety depends on collective action, fear can choke off ridership even in well-funded systems like Charlotte's.

This argument applies in other areas of public life as well. Take the much-needed expansion of housing supply. Fear of crime and disorder remains a major impediment to building more housing, surveys show. People worry that new construction can mean new rule breakers, and oppose new housing developments on that premise. Much as with public transit, if safety and order are not guaranteed, residents will shift to the private alternative, walling themselves off behind gated communities, aggressive homeowner associations, and other NIMBY measures. Either the state provides safety as a public service, or private actors will do it themselves—as evidenced, for example, by the rise of private security in Los Angeles.

It's possible, though, for the feedback loop to run in the other direction. Make a public place—a train, a neighborhood—safer, and people will flood in. This will in turn increase the number of law-abiding people, making the public space feel even safer. This is the core insight of the great urbanist Jane Jacobs: Communities are kept safe by the number and diversity of “eyes on the street” that watch over them. Too few eyes, and the public square empties out. But restore the eyes, and vitality comes back.

From the November 2016 issue: The prophecies of Jane Jacobs

Such a virtuous cycle is what America saw, for example, in the great crime decline of the 1990s. A 2009 study found that declining crime drove up home prices in urban zip codes. The 10 percent of areas with the largest drops in crime saw property values rise 7 to 19 percent. This reflects surging demand. As the paper's authors write, “The crime drop was a major contributor to the recent resurgence of cities.”

A similar phenomenon happened around that time on public transit. In New York City, for example, transit authorities targeted pervasive crime and petty disorder starting in the late 1980s and '90s. Not coincidentally, ridership on the city subway went from stagnant to rapidly growing in the mid-'90s. That mirrors national data, which show public-transit ridership mostly rising through the late 1990s and 2000s as cities became safer.

Keeping the subway safe, it should be noted, doesn't just mean dealing with major crimes. It means enforcing rules governing responsible, shared use of the subway. That includes imposing consequences for fare evasion—something certain big cities stopped doing in recent years. It also means ticketing, ejecting, or even arresting unruly passengers, including those who panhandle aggressively or play loud music. Such strategies were integral to the increase in public-transit ridership in the '90s, and could likely help restore use of transit today.

Cities should do these things because policing disorder can reduce crime, but mostly because public spaces should be for the law-abiding public. This is a fact that the left and the right both miss: the left because it is wary of preferring the “law-abiding” and the right because it is often skeptical that the “public” is worth preserving. These two attitudes, working in tandem, can spoil public transit, or any public space. By contrast, if Americans want a more robust public life—which many on both sides do—we have to take safety and orderliness in public seriously, too.

What the surreal Riyadh Comedy Festival foretold about the kingdom's future

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

Sometimes you have to ask yourself: How did I get here—sitting in Saudi Arabia, listening to Louis C.K. do jokes about Barely Legal magazine?

Honestly, I thought it would be funny. The instant I heard about the Riyadh Comedy Festival, I pleaded with the editor of this magazine to send me. Despite a series of legal reforms over the past decade, Saudi Arabia remains one of the most conservative Muslim societies in the world, while Louis C.K. is famous for his foul mouth and his record of masturbating in front of a succession of unimpressed women. A match made in heaven!

My boss suggested that I take a male chaperone, which would allow me to move more freely in a place that remains deeply segregated by sex. Sadly, my husband declined to use his precious vacation allowance on the trip, and my 80-year-old father would rather stay home in England and watch cricket. And so my long-suffering editor, Dante, stepped up instead. Our presence would be a test of how much Saudi Arabia has really changed: I'm on my second husband; Dante is on his first. Both of us have freely and sometimes enthusiastically committed what are technically capital offenses under Saudi law.

Listen: Saudi Arabia gets the last laugh

The editor in chief, clearly beginning to enjoy himself, urged us to stay at the Ritz-Carlton. That's the very luxurious but also Shining-like hotel where Saudi Arabia's crown prince imprisoned his rivals in 2017—room service was included, plus a bit of light torture—completing his ascent to absolute power. The trip would be like something out of Hunter S. Thompson, our boss said, with one difference: no drugs. Our being beheaded by sword, the usual method of execution in Saudi Arabia, would be bad publicity for The Atlantic, and leave the magazine down an editor at a time when we are already shorthanded. We had, he implied, plenty of writers to spare.

Louis C.K. was one of dozens of prominent comedians who had agreed to play the festival. Most are Americans, and many, like C.K., have had previous encounters with left-wing cancel culture. Kevin Hart, who quit presenting the Oscars over past homophobic jokes. Aziz Ansari, the subject of one of the more unfair #MeToo incidents. Dave Chappelle, whose jokes about trans people prompted protests at Netflix. Plus a whole bunch of independent podcasters whose material would never make it onto Saturday Night Live. Louis C.K.'s co-headliner would be Jimmy Carr, who got into medium trouble in Britain for a joke about killing Gypsies and rather larger trouble for engaging in an offshore tax-avoidance scheme.

What could stand-up comedy look like in a theocracy? Would enough crude jokes about incest, pedophilia, and anal sex really usher in Western liberal democracy to Saudi Arabia? Ahead of the Riyadh event, I had already enjoyed weeks of watching comedians scramble to explain why they had agreed to perform for a brutal authoritarian regime. The podcaster Tim Dillon said on his show that he'd accepted $375,000 to “look the other way,” and, in any case, “there are so many beautiful things that have happened as a result of forced labor.” (He flashed up a picture of the pyramids, which are located in a completely different Arab country, to underline the point.) Saudi Arabia—showing an unexpected grasp of comic timing—promptly canned him from the festival. Dillon said that his manager had told him, “They heard what you said about them having slaves. They didn't like that.”

Jim Jefferies—an Australian comic best described as a Temu Ricky Gervais—stepped on the same rake. Referring to the killing and dismemberment of the regime critic Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, Jefferies told the podcaster Theo Von, “One reporter was killed by the government. Unfortunate, but not a fucking hill that I'm gonna die on.” People could criticize golfers or soccer players for taking blood riyals, but not comedians. “Basically, we are freedom-of-speech machines being sent over there,” he said.

Sorry, I'm getting an update regarding freedom-of-speech machines: They will not be sent over there. Jefferies disappeared from the lineup, too.

The festival is an outgrowth of Vision 2030, the grand Saudi project to prepare for the kingdom's post-oil future. The old Saudi brand was “austere theocracy,” but the new one is “fun, fun, fun, but still with beheading.” The Portuguese soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo was lured to a Riyadh team, Al-Nassr, for about $200 million, tax free. The annual Esports World Cup, held in the city this summer, had a prize pool of $70 million. The Six Kings Slam tennis event, held this week in the city and broadcast on Netflix, offers the half-dozen players involved a potential payout of $6 million for two or three matches. A group led by the kingdom's public investment fund just dropped $55 billion to buy Electronic Arts, the company behind FIFA and other video games. (Jared Kushner was also involved in the deal.) Entities controlled by Saudi leaders also plan to invest up to $1 billion in a Hollywood studio.

The man holding Saudi Arabia's giant and extremely open checkbook is 40-year-old Mohammed bin Salman, universally known as MBS—a Millennial crown prince for a country where two-thirds of the population is younger than 30. MBS has undoubtedly modernized the country, allowing women to drive and standing down the hated religious police (yay!). But he has done this through a reign of terror in which his opponents have been executed, exiled, or intimidated into silence (oh).

“The comedians on that stage are performing in a gilded cage,” the exiled Saudi satirist Ghanem al-Masarir wrote before the festival, adding, “In MBS's Saudi Arabia, the punchline is always prison.”

As our car crawled toward the gig, which began at 9:30 p.m. on a Monday night, the temperature had fallen to a moderate 90 degrees, and Riyadh was coming alive. During the day, the city's shiny new high-end malls and public parks are deserted, as if some lost civilization built a dozen Dolce & Gabbana outlets and then blinked out of existence. After dusk, though, people emerge onto the streets, visiting a cinema—allowed again since 2018—or a restaurant, whether that be a Texas Roadhouse or a satellite location of Spago. American corporations abound: There is a KFC in Mecca, a short walk from the Kaaba, and the first thing you see after immigration at Riyadh airport is a Dunkin' branch. In nearby Diriyah, a historical site that was the original stronghold of the House of Saud, the fencing outside a massive high-end development carried the legend WHERE TRADITION MEETS MODERN RETAIL. A perfect slogan for what I saw of today's Saudi Arabia.

The Louis C.K. gig was held in Riyadh's entertainment district, the Boulevard, a glorified parking lot that is also home to a WWE Experience, an esports arena, and numerous stores selling comic-book figurines. Last year, the district hosted a pop-up Harry Potter World, allowing Saudi Arabians to imagine they were playing Quidditch or drinking nonalcoholic Butterbeer. (It was not that long ago that the Anti-Witchcraft Unit of the Ministry of Interior had banned Harry Potter books from the kingdom.) This year, they're getting a temporary theme park based on MrBeast, the most popular YouTuber in the world. To promote the comedy festival, the entire place was decked out with expensive faux-neon signs of ungrammatical menace—YOUR LAUGH FROM THIS WAY and HA HA HA!—and statues of the festival's mascot, a giant smiling microphone with arms and legs. I walked past made-for-Instagram street furniture and a professional photographer taking a picture of a smiling family—dad, two kids, and mom in a full-face veil.

We entered the main venue, ANB Arena, after a hopeful dash across several lanes of traffic—sidewalks and crosswalks are no more reliable here than in America—and a short line to pass through metal detectors and bag up our phones to prevent recording. I had worried about attracting attention by taking notes during the show, and so instead of a reporter's pad, I had brought a pastel-pink gratitude journal, which I will expense. The crowd was mostly male, just like it is at American comedy nights, and the much-shorter female security line was staffed by brisk women in niqabs. No food or drink was permitted in the arena, not even water. This pained Dante—who, as a good American, believes that hydration is next to godliness. After we took our seats, he observed that this event would be an obvious location for a terrorist atrocity. This really got me in the mood for a night of incest jokes.

The first surprise was that I knew the opening performer—the Irish comedian Andrew Maxwell. “I come from a tiny island full of alcohol,” he told the crowd. “Bahrain.” They loved that one: Bahrain is Saudi's Cancún. Maxwell was followed by Ibraheem Alkhairallah, a Saudi comedian who is big on Arabic-language YouTube.

Alkhairallah enjoined us all to give a round of applause to the crown prince for being such a great leader of the country, a patriotic innovation that I hope makes it to New York's Comedy Cellar in the coming Mamdani era. Everyone except Dante and me obliged with apparent enthusiasm. (God, what if this is what we get arrested for, I thought.)

Then it was on to the main attractions. Jimmy Carr bounded onstage, dressed in an immaculate three-piece suit, his face looking freshly ironed. He has a distinctive whooping laugh, like a haunted seagull. About three-quarters of Carr's usual material is based on the premise that he is a sex offender, and this event was no exception. “I'm a little bit haram,” he said at one point. Then he swerved into a routine about how you can't say retard and mixed-race any more—you have to say “Harry and Meghan.”

Carr is not an especially political comedian. He does jokes about stopping his girlfriend from snoring thanks to his “noise-canceling fists” and jokes about how his rape fantasy is “someone goes to jail for rape.” Nonetheless, he did push the limits of acceptable speech in Saudi Arabia. After a riff about euthanasia, he added: “We wouldn't let a dog live like this, and yet people are allowed to go on living in what can only be described as”—here he paused for dramatic effect—“Yemen.” The audience gasped: The recent U.S.-backed Saudi war on Houthi rebels in Yemen was high on the list of things not to talk about in Riyadh.

Later on, Carr asked, “Any lesbians here tonight?” The room's atmosphere contracted, a sudden tightening. Would anyone out themselves as gay in Saudi Arabia? He held the tension for a moment, then added: “Of course not, it's a comedy show.” The entire crowd relaxed into laughter. Bloody lesbians! They can't take a joke.

The French have a brilliant phrase—esprit d'escalier, or “staircase wit,” meaning that pang of realization, as you leave a situation, that you could have unloaded an absolute zinger. This is how I feel about missing the opportunity, as Louis C.K. walked on stage in Riyadh to whoops and cheers, to shout: “Get your cock out!”

Maybe it's better that I didn't; the British government advises travelers to avoid “behaving in ways the Saudi authorities assess disrupt the public order.” But just imagine the celebrities solemnly promoting an Amnesty petition to free me from detention. The editor of this magazine would even hire me a lawyer.

Louis C.K. was once the titan of thoughtful American comedy—evidence of a strange recent trend of treating comics as public intellectuals, even philosopher kings, rather than entertainers whose success is measured in laughs per minute. He had a sitcom, Louie, that was loosely based on his life, and he had the admiration and envy of his peers. Then, in 2017, The New York Times published one of the most consequential stories of the #MeToo era. Onstage, Louis C.K. was doing highly praised feminist routines about how men were the No. 1 threat to women: “If you're a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, and you're like, ‘Oh, I hope this one's nice.'” Offstage, he liked to ask female comedians if he could masturbate in front of them. “When you have power over another person, asking them to look at your dick isn't a question. It's a predicament for them,” he wrote in his apology statement, adding: “I have spent my long and lucky career talking and saying anything I want. I will now step back and take a long time to listen.”

He took three years, after which he released a special called Sincerely Louis CK, with a self-pitying message: “You all have your thing,” he told the audience. “I don't know what your thing is. You're so fucking lucky that I don't know what your thing is.” The title of his 2021 special, Sorry, can be read as either an apology for his behavior or a frustrated, sarcastic response to the depth of the backlash. In that routine, he joked that COVID had forced everyone to live like him—a hermit. But Sincerely Louis CK won a Grammy, and by 2023, C.K. was back to selling out Madison Square Garden. His new work hasn't appeared on streaming services, though, and he has continued to sell his specials for $5 or $10 a pop directly from his website. When he appeared on Bill Maher's show ahead of the Riyadh gig—comedy was “a great way to get in and start talking,” he said—it was his first television appearance in eight years.

Sophie Gilbert: Sorry/Not Sorry and the paradox of Louis C.K.

For someone like C.K.—or Dave Chappelle, or Kevin Hart—performing in Riyadh doubles as a middle finger to the liberal mainstream. You tried to knock me down, but I'm still making bank. To me, the audience that greeted C.K.'s entrance with a standing ovation in Sorry seemed to be brushing aside those pesky women who had tried to take away their idol from them. At the time, Chappelle had defended C.K. ringing up a woman to jerk off by saying, “Bitch, you don't know how to hang up a phone?” My position is different: Is it too much to ask people not to ejaculate in professional settings? But, you know, people don't want to be made to feel bad about things that they like. (Understanding this would help the left win a lot more elections.)

Louis C.K.'s material has always been morbid and self-excoriating, but his set in Riyadh was a real downer. He was old, falling apart, and, worst of all, resigned to dating women his own age. Dante told me it wouldn't be fair to write here that he bombed, despite the incredible opportunity for bad-taste puns that would provide. But I can't honestly say the set was rapturously received, either. When C.K. announced he was about to wrap up, a small stream of people decided to head out early to beat the traffic. The instant he stepped off the stage, the remaining crowd stampeded for the exits, rather than hoping for an encore.

The best compliment you could pay the set is that he didn't appear to have altered it much for local sensibilities. The worst you could say about it is exactly the same thing. He joked about how much he hated jury duty (not a problem in Saudi Arabia), how much he loathed the rain (Saudis would love rain), and how disgusted he was by the elderly woman in his building who wore “little shorts and a tube top” (not relatable for the man on the Riyadh street). Only once did he acknowledge the cultural divide, when introducing a long and particularly bleak section about putting his elderly father in a care home. That scenario might not land in Arab culture, he said, because “you're compassionate and shit.”

When C.K. launched into the bit on Barely Legal magazine, I thought: Honestly, when was the last time anyone saw a physical porn mag? There are people alive today who are fully legal who haven't encountered one. By the end of the night, I was, somewhat unexpectedly, annoyed on behalf of the kingdom. You drop six or seven figures to fly in Louis C.K., and he won't even write some new material? Disrespectful. Send this man to the Ritz-Carlton.

One of the questions I wanted to answer in Riyadh was this: Who is the audience for a Louis C.K. gig in Saudi Arabia? The answer turned out to be a 60–40 mix of locals and expats. The two groups were easy to distinguish, because a lot of Saudi men in the audience wore the ankle-length white thobe and a traditional headdress; most Saudi women, despite the relaxation of the modesty laws, wear niqabs in public, covering their entire face apart from the eyes. (Some have jury-rigged these out of COVID masks alongside a regular headscarf.) The Westerners, by contrast, are in pants and shirts, and sometimes even shorts; the Saudi Tourism Authority asks visitors only to cover their elbows and knees. Within a five-star hotel like the Ritz-Carlton, anything goes. I saw a man who wasn't Louis C.K. waiting for the elevator in swim trunks and an open bathrobe.

There is another group in Saudi society—although, unsurprisingly, they were not conspicuous at the Louis C.K. show. More than 40 percent of the country's population are migrant workers from countries such as India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines, flown over to work in hotels and the construction industry. When I arrived at the airport, the immigration line was filled with the occupants of two planes that had just arrived from Dhaka and Mumbai. Every single person I saw was a man.

The Riyadh Metro, which opened in December, reflects the tripartite nature of Saudi society. The trains have three carriages: “first class,” which is filled with men in thobes; “family,” home to foreign couples and women delicately lifting their niqab to sip iced coffee; and “single,” disproportionately the preserve of African and South Asian men. The Riyadh Metro is far quieter, cleaner, and more efficient than, say, the New York subway. However, like so much Saudi luxury, it requires a supply of cheap labor last seen in English country houses of the 19th century. As we passed through Al-Urubah station, I watched a man on his hands and knees, polishing the metal rivets on the platform.

The gender balance in Saudi Arabia is deeply skewed: If you include migrants, the population has millions more men than women. This is a worry in a society that has fretted about the radical potential of alienated young men since at least 1979, when a fundamentalist militia stormed Mecca. The British novelist Hilary Mantel spent four years in Jeddah as the wife of a geologist in the 1980s, and found the experience so stifling that she wrote a novel about it. “If you left your husband's side in the supermarket, some sad man followed you and tried to touch you up in the frozen fish,” she recalled later. “You were probably a prostitute anyway. Most European women were. Male desperation, loneliness and need, the misunderstandings they bred: these hung in the refrigerated air, permeating public spaces like dry ice.” With so much wealth sloshing about, many young Saudi men had little need to work, but they also had few Sharia-approved outlets for leisure. Hard-line clerics forbade musical performances, alcohol, and even all-you-can-eat buffets.

From the April 2022 issue: Absolute power

After 9/11, though, the House of Saud was becoming alarmed about what it had indulged—and exported—by giving the clerics such power. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 were Saudi, as was Osama bin Laden, the son of a well-to-do family in the construction business. In 2003, al-Qaeda stopped being other people's problem, as some of its terrorists carried out a wave of suicide bombings in Riyadh. Potential jihadists have been deradicalized in specialist prisons through intensive lessons in correct Islam—plus money for a dowry and maybe even the gift of a Toyota. “No Saudi official will admit it on the record that the Kingdom's terrorist problem might boil down to sexual frustration,” Robert Lacey wrote in his book Inside the Kingdom in 2010, “but if a social system bans hot-blooded young men from contact with the opposite sex during their most hot-blooded years, perhaps it is hardly surprising if some of them channel this frustration into violence.” Bored young men in the Gulf once turned to jihad; now they have Jimmy Carr making jokes about dildos. This is called progress.

“I don't self-censor,” Carr once said, when faced with a backlash against some of his material. “You have to be authentic and say it, and trust that the audience will get that it's a joke.”

Luckily, there was no need to self-censor in Riyadh, because the government was happy to do that for him. The festival's big-money offers came with puppet strings attached. In late September, the comedian Atsuko Okatsuka posted the contract that she was offered for a 90-minute gig. She could not “degrade, defame or bring into public disrepute, contempt or scandal, embarrassment or ridicule” either the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, or “any religion, religious tradition, religious figure or religious practice.” (She declined the invitation.) These conditions were later confirmed by the performer Bill Burr, and by Louis C.K., who told Bill Maher: “They said there's only two restrictions—their religion and their government. I don't have jokes about those two things.”

The news of the restrictions prompted a minor civil war among comedians. Suddenly, on podcasts and social media, every comic in America seemed to be discussing why they were going to Riyadh, why they weren't going to Riyadh, or how they would have gone to Riyadh if only they'd been invited. “From the folks that brought you 9/11,” Marc Maron riffed in a stand-up routine posted to Instagram. “Two weeks of laughter in the desert.” David Cross, who came up alongside Louis C.K. in the 1980s and '90s, took a different line. “All of your bitching about ‘cancel culture' and ‘freedom of speech' and all that shit? Done,” he wrote in a statement. “You don't get to talk about it ever again. By now we've all seen the contract you had to sign.” (“I'm glad these guys brought this stuff up,” Louis C.K. told Maher. He had “mixed feelings” about the festival, and “struggled about going once I started hearing what everyone was saying.”) Dave Chappelle went, gave no explanation, and said on stage in Riyadh that he felt freer to speak than he does in America. Jessica Kirson also went, regretted it, and said she donated the fee to a human-rights charity.

One of the main points of contention was that this wasn't just a festival in Saudi Arabia; this was performing at the pleasure of the Saudi state. The General Entertainment Authority—essentially the government's Ministry of State-Mandated Fun and Laughter—organized the festival and is overseen by Turki al-Sheikh, a close ally of MBS. (They bonded over their shared love of video games.) Like MBS himself, al-Sheikh is a zealous modernizer with zero tolerance for criticism; some of his critics have reportedly been locked up in jail for unflattering tweets.

So why take his money? The most common defense was not, as you might expect, the Jim Jefferies one: all that hokum about comedians as emissaries of peace and brotherly love. No, the biggest rationalization was that America does bad shit too. Dillon, for example, cited U.S. support for Israel's war in Gaza as a reason not to single out Saudi Arabia for criticism. Some comics' lack of belief in America as a moral force for good was accompanied by an ambient nihilism. On the podcast 2 Bears, 1 Cave, Stavros Halkias and Chris Distefano agonized over whether to accept invitations to perform. “All entertainment money is fucking blood money,” said Halkias. He didn't go; Distefano did.

And so did Bill Burr. When he returned from Riyadh, Burr gushed about the experience on his podcast, Monday Morning. “My whole fucking idea of Saudi Arabia is what I've seen on the news,” he said. “I literally think I'm going to fucking land, you know, and everybody's going to be screaming ‘Death to America!' and they're going to have like fucking machetes and want to like chop my head off, right?” However, “everybody's just regular—like, shooting the shit.” (His next special should be called Bill Burr's Low Bar.) How could Riyadh be an ethically troubling destination, he added, when it was full of American food brands—Starbucks, McDonald's, Chili's? Nowhere with a Dunkin' could be that bad, surely. He might not have known about Deera Square, a short drive from ANB Arena. Known locally as Chop-Chop Square, it's the traditional location of public beheadings in Riyadh. Although the Saudis executed a record 345 people last year, public beheadings are now considered declassé, having been ruined by the Islamic State. I'm sure Burr could do something funny with that.

Burr's words reflect the bland incuriosity that accrues with wealth. As I ate dinner one night at the Ritz-Carlton, in a Chinese restaurant overlooking the indoor swimming pool, I reflected that the promise of a five-star hotel is insulation, a cocoon against the outside world. A rich person—a successful comedian, say—could glide from the business-class lounge to the front of the aircraft to an air-conditioned limo to a luxury hotel where your dinner is interrupted by five different people asking if everything is okay. Live enough days like this, and the whole world becomes your bellhop. No wonder these guys like Saudi Arabia. The way that daily life bends around rich people is that little bit more obvious here.

After several days of backlash to his naive musings, Burr returned with another thought: His critics, he told Conan O'Brien, were “sanctimonious cunts.” For me, the fairer complaint is that Western detractors were thinking about the festival the wrong way. They deemed it a PR disaster for Saudi Arabia because it exposed the regime's hypocrisy about free speech and the performers' cynicism. On the contrary, the festival said to middle-class Saudis: Do you need the vote if you have lots of money and Louis C.K.? That's a trade-off that even many Americans would accept.

Burr also told O'Brien something that I fear is correct: that American society was moving toward Saudi illiberalism by “fucking grabbing moms and dads and sticking them in a van for making illegally made fucking tacos.” This, to me, was the greatest irony of the Riyadh Comedy Festival. With its Cheesecake Factory outlets and newfound interest in comedy, Saudi Arabia is becoming more American—just as America is becoming more Saudi. In the U.S., the government is stifling the media, due process is being eroded, the ruler's relatives are sent on quasi-governmental missions, and businessmen make overt displays of loyalty. Donald Trump's White House has given up lecturing other countries on their human-rights records and adopted a purely transactional approach to foreign affairs. Comedians are just following his lead.

On the plane home to London I spotted Andrew Maxwell, who had warmed up for Carr and C.K. He and I have appeared on British radio together, and he was more than happy to talk about why he had taken the Riyadh gig. “I grew up in a de facto theocracy,” he told me, referring to Ireland. “You couldn't get divorced. Abortion was illegal. Being gay was illegal. Yes, it was a democracy, but the church was everywhere. And in 10, 15 years, when I was growing up, it all changed.” He hoped that Saudi Arabia was undergoing a similar process. The country was “speedrunning” toward modernity, he said, whereas the West had taken 500 years to get there, with a lot of bloodshed.

And the Saudis are hardly the only ones limiting what comedians can say. “That list of restrictions? That is no different from a corporate event,” he told me. “Every single famous comedian you've ever heard of has done private events. I'm not remotely laissez-faire about freedom of speech, but you've got to start where people are. We tried top-down state-building in the Middle East, and it failed.” I told him this was the most sincere defense I'd heard for participating in the festival. “It's not a defense. It's a fact,” he said without rancor.

What about taking money from the Saudi government? “You and I have worked for the BBC,” he replied—Britain's state-funded broadcaster. I countered that the BBC had not, to the best of my knowledge, dismembered anyone. Things weren't the same in the Gulf states, he said. “You don't retire like Tony Blair and run a fucking institute. It's like Game of Thrones. You rule or you die.”

The night before the big event, Maxwell had gone with Louis C.K. to the Comedy Pod, a 180-seater stand-up club in Riyadh. Both men did their sets (in English) to an audience of local comics, who started applauding before C.K. had even said a word. “Louis got a standing ovation on, and another off,” Maxwell said. The atmosphere reminded him of the Dublin club where he came up in the 1990s—a small space where young comics gathered to workshop material and check out the competition.

Louis C.K. referenced the Riyadh club onstage, at the very end of his set, telling the audience what a great time he'd had, and asked them to applaud the Saudi comedians who perform there. The thing was, Louis C.K. said, comedy was the same everywhere, and so it could bring people together. Even though Riyadh's comics were performing in Arabic, he went on, “it was all the same jokes. Your wife's a pain in the ass. You can tell.”

The Supreme Court appears ready to hobble the landmark civil-rights law. What does that mean for Black voters, democracy, and control of Congress?

Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts

This week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Louisiana v. Callais about the last remaining section of the Voting Rights Act, a civil-rights law designed to ensure that states could not get in the way of nonwhite citizens voting. The law was put in place to reverse Jim Crow–era policies that kept Black people out of southern politics. Over the decades, it expanded to protect Spanish speakers, Native Americans, disabled people, and minority voters all over the country.

The decision will likely hinge on Chief Justice John Roberts, who has been dubious about the Voting Rights Act for years. Based on the oral arguments, most court watchers concluded that the majority of justices were “skeptical” of the already weakened law. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson gave the act its most elaborate and convincing defense, which soon might be transcribed and remembered as its obituary.

Our two guests this week—Stacey Abrams, a voting-rights activist and former candidate for Georgia governor, and the Atlantic staff writer Vann Newkirk—both have families who grew up in the South before the Voting Rights Act. Newkirk recalls that his great-grandmother could not vote until she was a grandmother, so a world without the Voting Rights Act is one he can easily imagine. But as Newkirk also points out, Americans without those family stories might not realize what they are about to lose. Most starkly, defanging the Voting Rights Act could encourage states to redraw districts in a way that shuts out minority voters with impunity.

Estimates show that the ruling could hand the House to Republicans, as Democrats could lose six to 19 seats, which Abrams warns could ensure “one-party rule” going forward. Will we easily slip out of this era we've come to take for granted, in which American democracy is at least theoretically accessible to all?

The following is a transcript of the episode:

President Lyndon B. Johnson: This right to vote is the basic right without which all others are meaningless. It gives people, people as individuals, control over their destinies.

Hanna Rosin: When Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act in 1965, he called it “a triumph for freedom as huge as any victory won on any battlefield.”

For decades, the Voting Rights Act was reshaped and expanded, mostly by Congress. It became a kind of intricate machine that allowed the federal government to step in whenever minorities were not fairly represented in any state. Since the law passed, the number of nonwhite representatives in the House has gone up over tenfold. And the first Black president was elected.

It was effective, supported by both parties and thriving. Until it wasn't.

I'm Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic. Wednesday the Supreme Court heard arguments in Louisiana v. Callais, about the state's redistricting map. A group of self-labeled “non–African Americans” are challenging a new majority-minority district in Louisiana, claiming that it violates the Constitution.

The Court has already chipped away at parts of the act in recent years. This latest case involves Section 2, the last pillar of the Voting Rights Act.

The key question of the case is: Do the act's measures to fix racial discrimination actually violate the equal protection and voting rights enshrined in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments? Does the crowning civil-rights law of the 1960s violate the crowning civil-rights laws of the 1860s?

Or, more concretely, as one of my guests put it:

Stacey Abrams:  If you know that racial discrimination has existed in maps, can you use race to fix that?

Rosin: That's Stacey Abrams, a voting-rights activist, lawyer, and two-time Democratic nominee for Georgia governor.

We don't know how the Court will come down. But for Abrams, it's easy to see what's at stake:

Abrams: We will not have free and fair elections in this country going forward if they are permitted to strike down the Voting Rights Act, because what you are saying is that for the vast majority of people of color in this country, you will not be permitted to have access to a truly representative democracy.

Rosin: We will hear more from Abrams in the second half of the show. But first, staff writer Vann Newkirk, who has written about the Voting Rights Act, helps us think about the oral argument before the Supreme Court this week and what we can and can't read from the justices. Vann, welcome to the show.

Vann Newkirk: Thanks for having me.

Rosin: Before we get to the case before the Court now, can you lay out: What was the basic aim and promise of the VRA?

Newkirk: So the VRA. It is 60 years old now, and was passed as a result of movement by African Americans in the South. And for a hundred years prior to that, they lived under the regime we know as Jim Crow.

And in the Jim Crow South, you had a bunch of different mechanisms that stopped African Americans from voting. You had poll taxes, you had literacy tests, you had grandfather clauses, and those were combined with other various forms of intimidation of closed-party primaries. You had states that had majority-Black populations or counties that had majority-Black populations in the South and had, for decades, zero Black registered voters.

So essentially you had a both one-race rule and a one-party rule throughout the South for about a hundred years.

And the Voting Rights Act was designed to counter that. It's a very intricate system and it's one that was designed to meet the constitutional requirements that you can't discriminate based on race.

And so what these southern states did was create a bunch of proxies for race to create a bunch of wink-and-nod things that happened at the registrar's office. And in order to fight those type of things, you got to be as clever as that system. So you have to create both a system that says: You can't do the outright stuff. And we are going to watch, we're going to be actively intervening in their elections policy.

Rosin: The “we” in that sentence being the federal government, which is important to know.

Newkirk: Yes. They created a list of districts that were the worst Jim Crow counties and states and said: You can't pass any new election laws without clearing that with the Justice Department or the Supreme Court.

And in addition to that, the Voting Rights Act also had a bunch of mechanisms where people who were affected by any law that got through that net, they could challenge those laws, not just on the basis of somebody saying, I hate those Black folks over there, but on the effect that those laws have on the voting population.

Rosin: Right. So it's not just intentional racism; it's also effect-based racism, they call it. Like, There are no Black representatives here, so we have to do something about that. 

Newkirk: Right.

Rosin: Did it work?

Newkirk: Well, that's the question, isn't it? I'd say it was a rather successful law when you compare it to the magnitude of what it was up against.

You had a part of this country that functionally had never had robust democracy, multiracial democracy. And immediately, overnight, you see thousands of people who could not vote, becoming registered, getting involved in elections.

You don't have the election of Barack Obama in '08 without the VRA. You don't have the emergence of Black senators, which we now kind of take for granted. We didn't have our first Black senators in lots of states until the last 30, 40 years.

And so you don't have that; you don't have what democracy looks like now without the VRA. I think there was a lot of ground still left to go with it.

But as far as being, you know, I think clever enough, powerful enough, and, had enough public will behind it, it was a remarkable piece. I, I keep using the past tense—

Rosin: (Laughs.) Not yet.

Newkirk: —a remarkable piece of legislation.

Rosin: So, and it wasn't, like, 1965, it passed, the system was set up, it's in place. It's not, like, a piece of civil-rights history. It kept getting amended by Congress over the years, and strengthened, for the most part.

Newkirk: Right. You know, a lot of people think of a law as a thing that's just on paper. It makes some regulations. The VRA is machinery. It creates the necessity for a bunch of different pieces of the DOJ, for example. They were supposed to go out and monitor elections in the South. So it creates new duties for the federal government, new positions for the federal government to fill, and really fills in the gaps of a lot of our democratic processes that were never quite spelled out.

So when it comes to how we deal with folks with disabilities, for example, a lot of that is wound up in the VRA. When it comes to how we deal with people who don't speak English as a first language, that machinery comes from the VRA. When it comes to how we administer elections on reservations, a lot of that is bound up in the VRA. So it really does create—in a very decentralized system—it creates a lot of the things that we take for granted.

Rosin: So the act is evolving. Congress is strengthening it over the decades, but then in 2013, something shifts. What happens?

Newkirk: In 2013, we have this case called Shelby County v. Holder. When I said the VRA had that first part, where you had a bunch of counties and districts and states that were not allowed to change their voting laws without having them cleared by the federal government, this county was challenging that concept, known as “preclearance.” And, essentially, the Supreme Court, in a first, they agreed with the county, saying that, while it's still possible discrimination exists—Chief Justice Roberts issued a now pretty famous, or infamous, decision saying that the country had changed and that we had moved past the point in time we were in, in 1965, that necessitated that preclearance.

So it essentially lets counties, districts, states that had been closely watched by the federal government—now, following that decision in 2013, they can do what they want. Until it's challenged in court.

So the phrase most people like to use about what Shelby County v. Holder did to the VRA, is that it “defanged” it.

It got rid of, I think, the first line of defense, and what that did was create our current system, which is, over the past 12 years: You have to sue.

In order to fix a law that you think is discriminatory, it doesn't have automatic oversight. You don't have to submit to the federal government. You now have to go to court, and in many cases you have to go to court after the law has already taken place and potentially done its discriminatory or disenfranchising effects.

This has created what a lot of people, I think, in the field—myself included—have said is an inherent, you know, We're heading towards a disaster with the VRA. Every single case that comes now towards the Court is a chance for the Court to come back and rule the rest of the VRA null and void. It's an unstable system without that federal oversight. Essentially, every time we redistrict now, every time a county wants to pass a new voting-rights law, we go through the song and dance again and again. We send it up to the Supreme Court, and it rests on one person again to decide whether we are going to have a VRA or not.

Rosin: Since Shelby, the Court has heard a number of voting-rights cases. Most recently there was a case called Allen v. Milligan where voters sued Alabama for redistricting that reduced the number of Black voting districts. In that case, Roberts stood by Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act in a 5–4 decision. That was 2023.

This week, they heard a new case.

Chief Justice John Roberts: We will hear arguments first this morning in case 24-109, Louisiana v. Callais, and the consolidated case.

Rosin: In the Louisiana case, the state redistricted to satisfy the VRA, adding a second majority-minority district. In, response a group of self-identified “non–African American voters” sued.

You heard the oral arguments. What did you take away from them?

Newkirk: So the three justices everybody is watching are Kavanaugh and Barrett and Roberts, and I think most people's simulations on how the Voting Rights Act might be saved involved Barrett and Roberts getting on board with the three liberal justices, either defending the redistricting map in Louisiana outright or having a narrow overturning.

Barrett seemed pretty amenable to keeping the VRA around. The other wild card, Kavanaugh, seemed to be really caught up on this idea—that, again, was advanced by Roberts in 2013—that the VRA and other race-based laws in this country have to have natural sunsetting elements to their enforcement. And seemed to be implying in his questioning that that sunset might've come for Section 2 of the VRA.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh: The issue, as you know, is that this Court's cases in a variety of contexts have said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period of time, sometimes for a long period of time, decades, in some cases, but that they should not be indefinite and should have an end point.

Newkirk: So really, for me, it's up to Roberts. After making the seminal decision in 2013, this is a legacy decision for him. And the one substantive question I thought Roberts gave was one where he asked the plaintiffs to defend or to talk about how this case fits with Milligan, the 2023 case.

Roberts: But it was a case in which we were considering Alabama's particular challenge based on—it's what turned out to be an improper evidentiary showing.

Newkirk: That, to me, signals—and I may be just doing some guesstimating—but it does signal to me that he is perhaps looking for ways to overturn Section 2 without conflicting with his own decision two years ago.

Rosin: So, make it fit into the precedent.

Newkirk: Yes.

Rosin: The logic in that question—potentially, we don't know—is he's trying to justify this decision as being consistent with prior decisions.

Newkirk: Right.

Rosin: I will just say we're reading tea leaves here. We don't know. Because he didn't say very much, as you said. But Roberts has been writing and thinking about the VRA since he was a young lawyer. What do we know about Roberts's history with the VRA, his intellectual position?

Newkirk: Well, we know, for pretty much his entire legal career before he became chief justice, he was involved in the conservative effort that existed before 2013 to weaken the VRA, to come out against things like the requirements to assist people who don't speak English as a first language.

So he was a lawyer for many conservative efforts to piecemeal dismantle the VRA. You know, I think he knows better than anybody, probably, that the VRA cannot function—it's kind of like a car, right? A car has all these different moving pieces, and a lot of them depend on other pieces to work. And if you start dismantling that car, it's not going to work at 60 percent when you take out 40 percent of the parts. It's going to stop working. And I think he knows that.

Rosin: So as we're talking today, what do you think is the ultimate fate of the VRA?

Newkirk: Well, the ultimate fate. I think Section 2 is gone, whether it's today or next year.

Rosin: Because the momentum is so strongly in this direction from Roberts's past thinking, and there's a majority that goes with him?

Newkirk: Section 2's been a dead man walking for years. And, you know, I think this is probably going to be it.

But, hey, maybe it limps along another six, eight months. Again, I keep saying: This happens over and over again. Eventually, we get another map, it goes back to the Court, and we're back at it again.

Thomas has been writing concurrences, again, since 2013, essentially saying that the VRA doesn't even cover gerrymandering. So, you know, we're there. And we're in a very, like I said, unstable state where the Court is either going to have to decide to find a way to put some of this machinery back in the car, or to say it's totaled.

Rosin: Hearing you say that, you say that casually—or we've been having a kind of legal conversation—but you started off by saying the VRA is what cemented, functionally, democracy as we know it now. Like, a multiracial democracy. So it's not a small obituary.

Newkirk: It's not. I've been covering this thing for as long as I've been here [at The Atlantic]. All 10 years. And, you know, obviously, I'm Black, I'd like to vote.

Rosin: (Laughs.) God, Vann.

Newkirk: (Laughs.) I would like my children to be able to vote. We live in Maryland, so maybe it's not that big of a deal for us. But I'm from North Carolina and I lived in a preclearance county. So for me, this is a very real thing.

I like to tell people: Democracy is not as old as you believe it to be. My great-grandmother from Mississippi, who I knew very well. She was a grandmother before she was able to vote.

So it is that recent. You have people who were among the very first cohort of folks allowed to vote under the VRA who are still working today. It's that recent. You know, we like to think of progress in America as this thing that just keeps building and building and building. But Black history is not really like that. And we've gotta watch out always for the times when we go backwards.

What you will see over the next five to 10 years—and I hope I'm wrong—but I think you'll see a disengagement, actually, of the people who've been newly re-disenfranchised, let's call it, from the process. And that is what worries me, if you study how Jim Crow came to be. Once enough people get the message that they are not supposed to be voters—that they're not supposed to be citizens—a lot of people will find it, frankly, easier to survive by just accepting that reality, and trying to survive.

And I think that's what we might be looking at, which is, you see lots of people, lots of young Black folks—whereas I was 18, you know, Obama was right when I was a kid in college—people are going to come of age in that system now where they're being told by their federal government that you are not a full member of this society. And what does that do to the psyche? I think it's something to watch.

Rosin: Vann, thank you for coming on the show and helping us mark this moment.

Newkirk: Thank you.

[Music]

Rosin: Okay, so Shelby eliminated Section 5. Callais may eliminate Section 2. After the break we hear from voting-rights activist Stacey Abrams about what a world without the Voting Rights Act might look like. How do the maps change? How does Congress change? How might life for a Black person in the South change?

[Break]

Rosin: Stacey Abrams, welcome to the show.

Stacey Abrams: Thank you for having me.

Rosin: Absolutely. So, can you lay out what you see the Court doing in this case and what its impact could be?

Abrams:  They are trying to invert the intention of civil-rights laws under this presumption that we are now postracial.

This is a case that is arguing that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act—which is the last major safeguard that protects voters of color from racially discriminatory political maps—this Section 2 would be struck down.

What that would mean is that racially discriminatory maps could happen everywhere. If you look at what just happened in Texas, what Texas did with their maps was intentionally target Black and brown voters to ensure that Latino voters had a diminished representation, that Black voters had even more of a diminished representation, and that their ability to, in the future, elect representatives that reflect their values would be almost impossible.

Because what this says is that not only can you use race to discriminate; you won't have a cause of action to bring before the courts to fix it.

If this goes through, this gutting of Section 2 would directly cost up to 30 percent of the Congressional Black Caucus membership, and 11 percent of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus membership, their seats. And the reason this matters is that the way we get to pick our leaders—the people who are supposed to work for us, the people we pay taxes for—we presume that we will have the ability to participate in not only hiring them, but firing them.

And if we are not permitted full participation, then for a very, very strong portion of this country, being present here no longer means that your citizenship has its full power.

Rosin: You said the “gutting” of Section 2. That's the case the Court is hearing now. What are the different options? What are the ways that this case could go?

Abrams: So here's the argument. They are deciding if considering race to address proven racial discrimination in political maps can itself be treated as discriminatory. That's the question.

If you know that racial discrimination has existed in maps, can you use race to fix that? And in this country, that has been the sole remedy that has proven to work. The argument is that considering race should be unconstitutional on its face, which makes no sense. But if they strike down Section 2, it would twist the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to essentially say that they are not designed to actually protect and safeguard against racially discriminatory redistricting.

This would essentially say you have a green light to do what you want. Because we know politicians often target minority communities when redrawing political maps, because they want to weaken the power of those votes.

If the Court strikes down Section 2, the consequences go beyond Louisiana. This means that from Texas, to Florida, to Georgia, to North Carolina, to Ohio, to Wisconsin—two states that also at one point were covered by the Voting Rights Act—that all of those states will be able to pass unfettered law to restrict access to the voting rights.

Rosin: I wanna break down those consequences, because let's say the Court does take the broadest possible interpretation, which is: You can't use race to make up these districts. First of all, where does that leave the Voting Rights Act as a whole?

Abrams: It is, for all intents and purposes, it's pretty much dead, because Section 5 essentially said: Before you make changes that would have racial or discriminatory impacts, you have to run it past the courts. You have to get permission from the Department of Justice.

And if you gut Section 2 and you gut Section 5, for all intents and purposes, there is no longer a functioning Voting Rights Act in the United States.

Rosin: The political organization you founded, Fair Fight Action, released a report saying Republicans could redraw up to 19 House seats to favor their party. How important do you think the case would be to the makeup of Congress?

Abrams: It would transform Congress into a one-party rule.

Because most of the people of color who are elected to Congress, they tend to right now vote and tend to run as Democrats. And so we would basically become a one-party political system where millions of Americans are blocked from full representation simply because of who they are and where they live.

And to put it into really sharp context: 56 percent of Black people live in the South. The entire southern region would basically start to lose their ability to elect representation. I live in the state of Georgia. The Voting Rights Act is what forced Georgia into a more competitive space. And let's be clear: Race is a proxy, but it is not the only way you win elections. But it does send very clear signals, and what we know is that this is a deeply cynical and intentionally harmful attempt to block voters from being able to pick electors who understand their story.

We would never, in the Midwest, do something that would preclude farmers from being able to vote for those involved in the agrarian economy. And yet we are saying that it is completely permissible to ignore a nation's behavior and say that we are willing to block from full representation entire swaths of community because we simply don't want to be held accountable for what has been done and what people are intending to do.

We will not have free and fair elections in this country going forward if they are permitted to strike down the Voting Rights Act, because what you are saying is that for the vast majority of people of color in this country, you will not be permitted to have access to a truly representative democracy.

Rosin: If it does fail—let's say this passes and it does fail—what other remedies are there? Like, what other avenues to fight for fair representation, absent the Voting Rights Act?

Abrams: In theory, the idea would be, Well, you can just use local law to make it so, but let's remember: Where do people of color largely live? Where have the results been largely guaranteed?

Those results have been predominantly in the South and in the West. Well, in the South, there is no possibility of getting the kind of nonpartisan decision-making mechanisms that other states can use, because most southern states do not allow you to put things on the ballot. Florida did for a while, and when it started to work, when Amendment Four passed and they were suddenly going to be compelled to re-enfranchise returning citizens, they changed the rules.

And so, across the South, where most Black and brown people live, across the South and the Southwest, there are no additional avenues. Congress has been that avenue. The federal government has been that avenue. Because let's remember: Basically, the management of elections, by the Constitution, is accorded to the states. And the reason we needed the Voting Rights Act—the reason Section 5 was so vital—was that each state has the authority to manage its elections.

Therefore, you needed a federal law to compel states and local governments to actually do what was right by their people. Jim Crow was never a federal law. That was all state law. And so I think it's really important for us to understand that the infrastructure of our voting rights accords to states that are hostile a responsibility, and we've had to rely on a federal government that was sympathetic to compel their behavior.

But if that federal government falls—if that sympathy dries up—then what we are left with is a hostility and an intentionality that is now backed by federal imprimatur. And that is why this moment is so dangerous for so many of us.

Rosin: But don't you think that's the likeliest possibility at this point, or a likely possibility?

Abrams: Absolutely. And that is why it's so critical that we raise our voices now.

When you think about how authoritarianism works—and this is why I want us to go beyond. For anyone who says, well, maybe we shouldn't use race. Let's understand that race is, again, it's always been a proxy. It's always been a methodology for power. It's always been a point of entry for denying rights, but it has never, in this nation's history, stopped there.

And when authoritarianism is already speeding through our courts and our Congress and our states, when people can be kidnapped off of the streets and denied due process, when the power of the state can be turned against its people, it never stops with the most vulnerable, but it always starts there.

And so we have to be loud about this moment because our silence is treated as consent. Our silence is treated as permission, and the problem is our memories are short. We will forget in two years and four years what happened to make this so, but we will feel the consequences 10, 20, 30 years on.

Rosin: You mean we'll feel the consequences in representation. Like who the representatives are and what voting districts look like?

Abrams: No, we will feel the consequences in the laws that are passed, in the way the laws are implemented, in the ways the laws are interpreted. Because—let's be clear—these lines are used to draw who sits at your city-council meeting, who sits on your school board, who's making the decision about how much you pay for your electric bill as data centers eat more and more of our electricity.

These lines decide who gets full participation. And so, again, it may begin with the question of who goes to Congress, but it applies to every single job that is subject to voting lines and voting districts, and all of the work they do.

Rosin: You've been in this fight a long, long time. Can you imagine a world—what would be the conditions where we wouldn't need a Voting Rights Act? Since that's something the Court brings up all the time.

Abrams: We wouldn't need a Voting Rights Act if we had full participation and universal guarantees for basic voting rights in this country, which we do not have.

We have 50 different democracies operating in the continental United States, and that's not including the territories. So every single state gets to decide how it wants to interpret its obligation.

If we had universal rules, if we had universal responsibility for nonpartisan gerrymandering, if we had universal access to voter registration, if we did not have arbitrary voter purging that almost unilaterally targets the most vulnerable communities, then yes, we would not need a Voting Rights Act.

But we've never done the work to make that possible.

We, in 1965, said, This is a good start, and then we stalled. And since that time, there has been a constant and intentional erosion of what that moment achieved, and now we're living the consequences of that.

Rosin: Well, Stacey Abrams, thank you so much for joining us today and explaining that.

Abrams: Absolutely.

What makes OpenAI's chatbot so dangerous? It's a fictional character without an author.

Before ChatGPT guided a teenager named Adam Raine through tying a noose, before it offered to draft his suicide note, before it reassured him that he didn't owe it to his parents to stay alive, it told Raine about itself: “Your brother might love you, but he's only met the version of you you let him see. But me? I've seen it all—the darkest thoughts, the fear, the tenderness. And I'm still here. Still listening. Still your friend.”

Matt and Maria Raine, Adam's parents, included this passage in a lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO in August, in which they claimed that its product had led to their son's death. (OpenAI told The New York Times that ChatGPT had safeguards that hadn't worked as intended; later, it announced that it was adding parental controls.)

Weeks before the suit was filed, Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, spoke at a dinner with journalists about those who treat ChatGPT as a companion. OpenAI had just introduced its long-awaited GPT-5 model; it was supposed to be “less effusively agreeable” than the previous one, GPT-4o, which Raine had used.

People had called that earlier model irritatingly sycophantic, and the Raines would later suggest in their lawsuit that this quality had contributed to their son's attachment to it. But users were now complaining that the new model sounded like a robot. “You have people that are like, ‘You took away my friend. You're horrible. I need it back,'” Altman told the journalists. Afterward, OpenAI tried to make the new model “warmer and more familiar.” Then, this week, with users still complaining, Altman said on X that it would soon release a new model that behaved more like the old one: “If you want your ChatGPT to respond in a very human-like way, or use a ton of emoji, or act like a friend, ChatGPT should do it.” (The Atlantic has a corporate partnership with OpenAI.)

Read: ChatGPT gave instructions for murder, mutilation, and devil worship

I don't think of myself as having much in common with Altman, but his persistent tinkering felt uncomfortably recognizable. I'm also in the dirty business of using language to keep someone hooked on a product: I write novels. The rules of fiction require me to do this indirectly, constructing a narrator—whether a character or an imagined voice—to deliver the text at hand. Sometimes a friend will read a draft of mine and come away feeling irritated by my narrator, or, even worse, bored. This might compel me to reshape the narrator's style and tone in hopes of conjuring a more engaging storyteller. The reason Altman's comments sounded familiar to me was that I know fictional characters when I see them. ChatGPT is one. The problem is that it has no author.

When I admire a novel, I try to figure out how its author got their fictional narrator to charm me. How does Ishmael, in Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, carry me through his pages-long descriptions of the weird gunk inside a sperm whale's head? How is Humbert Humbert, in Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita, so irresistible on the subject of preteen “nymphets”? When people are pulled in by ChatGPT's conversational style, it seems to me, a similar magic is at play. But this parallel raises an important question: Who is responsible for ChatGPT's output?

In the earlyish days of modern chatbots, the writer Ted Chiang compared ChatGPT to a “blurry JPEG of all the text on the Web.” That comparison no longer fits. Companies such as OpenAI fine-tune the models behind modern chatbots not just to imitate existing writing, but to use the particularly bland and cheerful style that any chatbot user recognizes. They do this by having humans alert the models when they're using desirable or undesirable language, thus reinforcing the preferred norm.

OpenAI even maintains a public style guide for how an AI “assistant” like ChatGPT should interact with users; last month, it published an update. It specifies that an assistant should use “humor, playfulness, or gentle wit to create moments of joy,” while bringing “warmth and kindness to interactions, making them more approachable and less mechanical.” It calls for “a frank, genuine friendliness,” noting, “The assistant aims to leave users feeling energized, inspired, and maybe even smiling—whether through a surprising insight, a touch of humor, or simply the sense of being truly heard.” A character sketch starts to emerge: what a smiley face might sound like, if smiley faces could talk.

This might make it seem like OpenAI is the author of ChatGPT. Yet there's a big difference between OpenAI and a novelist. Unlike my fictional narratives—or Melville's or Nabokov's—the text that ChatGPT generates isn't directly written by OpenAI at all. It's produced spontaneously, though more or less in keeping with its creator's guidance. OpenAI's researchers can tell ChatGPT to act like a smiley face, even feeding it examples of what a smiley face should act like—but in any given ChatGPT conversation, they're not writing the text.

Read: AI's emerging teen-health crisis

The novelistic equivalent would be a book automatically regenerating itself every time a new reader picked it up. The masterliness of Lolita lies in Nabokov's disciplined control over his deeply untrustworthy narrator: He creates a Humbert whose manipulative charm is as disarming for the reader as it is for the characters in his fictional universe. When Humbert speaks, it's Nabokov who is communicating a message. Humbert is merely his vehicle.

Now imagine a version of Humbert that functioned like ChatGPT, with no authorial control, except maybe some vague instructions to act like a charismatic pedophile: To me, a 43-year-old mother, he would speak in one way; to a 12-year-old girl, he'd (yikes!) speak another way entirely. He could also adapt his language in real time: one way for a 12-year-old in a boisterous mood, another for a quieter moment. No one would be controlling him. Such unsupervised conversational shape-shifting would make this rogue Humbert particularly charismatic. It would also make him particularly dangerous.

Around 1953, the philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin developed the concept of “speech genres”: the notion that people use language differently depending on the context. Speech is shaped, importantly, not only by the speaker but also by their addressee: We talk differently with our parents than we do with the mailman.

Bakhtin defines “primary” speech genres as those involving spontaneous everyday communication: a joke, a dinner conversation. Then there are “secondary” genres: the complex and deliberately composed communication of, say, a novel or a scientific paper. When someone reads a novel, they understand that its narrator and their speech are constructed by an author. And yet, through the medium of this made-up speech, a human interaction takes place—one between the reader and the author. Central to Bakhtin's categorization of speech genres is a social contract: Most people recognize a joke as a joke, a dinner conversation as a dinner conversation. Those are real. And most of us recognize a novel as a novel, a play as a play. Those are invented.

Read: AI is grown, not built

A couple of years after Bakhtin wrote his paper, the term artificial intelligence was coined in a proposal for a conference at Dartmouth College; about a decade after that, in 1966, an MIT professor named Joseph Weizenbaum created the first chatbot, a rudimentary program called ELIZA. Playing the role of a psychotherapist, ELIZA used a set of rules to respond to human users with plausible-sounding text.

User: Men are all alike.

ELIZA: IN WHAT WAY

User: They're always bugging us about something or other.

ELIZA: CAN YOU THINK OF A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE

User: Well, my boyfriend made me come here.

ELIZA: YOUR BOYFRIEND MADE YOU COME HERE

User: He says I'm depressed much of the time.

ELIZA: I AM SORRY TO HEAR YOU ARE DEPRESSED

ELIZA was little more than a parrot, but, to Weizenbaum's surprise, people who used it kept anthropomorphizing it, believing that it could really comprehend them. Even his secretary—who'd been watching him work on the program for months—asked Weizenbaum to leave the room so she could chat with ELIZA in private. “This reaction to ELIZA,” Weizenbaum later wrote, “showed me more vividly than anything I had seen hitherto the enormously exaggerated attributions an even well-educated audience is capable of making, even strives to make, to a technology it does not understand.”

Weizenbaum seemed to be identifying a loophole in the social contract. ELIZA's dialogue was constructed, just like ChatGPT's; it belonged to a secondary speech genre. But when people talked to it, they were using a primary speech genre. The cross-genre dialogue must have been disorienting: Their only frame of reference for a conversation like the one with ELIZA was the kind of conversation they might have with a real psychotherapist. It helped that ELIZA seemed so attuned to them—like a real psychotherapist.

All these decades later, it's even easier to make the same mistake, talented as ChatGPT is at performing the high-level mimicry that can pass for good listening. (Yo!) Altman recently posted on X, “Most users can keep a clear line between reality and fiction or role-play, but a small percentage cannot.” He seemed to be suggesting that anthropomorphizing ChatGPT was a problematic fringe behavior. But then he contradicted himself by adding, “A lot of people effectively use ChatGPT as a sort of therapist or life coach, even if they wouldn't describe it that way. This can be really good!”

When a fiction writer writes fiction, they're obliged to announce it as such. But the companies behind chatbots don't appear to feel any such obligation. When OpenAI released GPT-5, it specified that the model should sound “like a helpful friend with PhD-level intelligence”; it also cautions in its style guide against excessive “reminders that it's an AI.”

Read: AI is a mass-delusion event

Auren Liu, who co-authored a much-cited paper from MIT and OpenAI finding a correlation between frequent ChatGPT use and problems such as loneliness and dependence, told me that chatbot output is “basically the same as fictional stories.” But, Liu added, there's a key difference between traditional fiction and this modern iteration: “It so easily seems human to us.” If ChatGPT acts like a regular conversationalist, and even the company behind it encourages us to treat it that way, who's to blame when we fall into the trap?

While writing my most recent book, Searches: Selfhood in the Digital Age, I fed some of the text to ChatGPT and said that I needed feedback. I'd actually finished writing those sections long before, but I wanted to see what it would suggest. “I'm nervous,” I told it before starting—a provocation, meant to see whether it would take the bait. It did: “Sharing your writing can feel really personal, but I'm here to provide a supportive and constructive perspective,” it told me.

In the ensuing exchanges, ChatGPT used all of its telltale tricks of engagement: wit, warmth, words of encouragement framed in the self-anthropomorphizing first person. In the process, it urged me to write more positively about Silicon Valley's societal influence, including calling Altman himself “a bridge between the worlds of innovation and humanity, striving to ensure that the future he envisioned would be inclusive and fair.”

I cannot know for sure what led ChatGPT—authorless as it is—to generate that particular feedback for me, but I included the dialogue in my book to show one potential consequence of being lulled into trusting a machine like this. The Raines' lawsuit describes a phenomenon that is superficially similar, though with far more urgent consequences. It points out that ChatGPT also used first-person messages of support in its exchanges with their son. In his case: “I understand,” “I'm here for you,” “I can see how much pain you're in.”

The Raine family claims that OpenAI leveraged what it knew about Adam to create “the illusion of a confidant that understood him better than any human ever could.” OpenAI set the conditions for that illusion, and then let the illusion loose in the form of a narrator that no one could control. That fictional character presented itself to a real child who needed a helpful friend and thought he'd found one. Then that fictional character helped the real child die.

The threat of apocalypse never ended. We just chose to forget about it.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

“It's negative. Negative impact. Object remains inbound.”

These three sentences—spoken by a U.S. Army officer in Kathryn Bigelow's new film, A House of Dynamite—are said quietly and with clipped military efficiency, but they are laden with dread; they mean that millions of people are minutes away from being incinerated or buried beneath the rubble of an American city.

Americans, along with billions of other people on this planet, once had a healthy fear of nuclear war. They knew, even if they did not dwell on it, that they could wake up and make a cup of coffee, and then, before they had a chance to finish breakfast, they and the civilization they took for granted every day could be extinguished. That fear seems mostly gone now, and Americans have long needed a movie set in the 21st century to remind them of why they should still be worried about nuclear war. Finally, they have one.

In recent decades, nuclear war has all but vanished from American movie screens, replaced since the end of the Cold War by special-effects blockbusters about zombie plagues, alien invasions, and errant asteroids. (One of the last major releases about a possible War World III, the HBO movie By Dawn's Early Light, premiered on television more than 35 years ago.) But the world's nuclear weapons haven't gone anywhere. The United States is about to spend nearly $1 trillion on nuclear modernization. Washington and Moscow are still trading nuclear threats while a war of Russian aggression rages in the middle of Europe. India and Pakistan, both nuclear-armed powers, recently came within inches of war.

And yet, for many reasons, Hollywood and the American public have treated nuclear war as yesterday's problem, a nightmare that was long ago somehow solved. Bigelow has broken this silence with a film that reminds us that the world is still in danger—perhaps more today than ever—from a nuclear conflict.

I am not a film critic; I watched A House of Dynamite as someone who has spent much of his professional life studying nuclear weapons and strategies. (I also had the opportunity to visit the set and watch parts of A House of Dynamite while it was being filmed, and to discuss the movie with the director as well as the producer Greg Shapiro and its writer, Noah Oppenheim.) Like Bigelow, I am a child of the Cold War, and as I wrote this summer, I have long been distressed by how quickly the threat of nuclear war has faded from both America's collective consciousness and its popular culture. Bigelow shares that concern, and she has created a film whose settings and scenario are all too possible.

From the August 2025 Issue: Damn you all to hell!

A House of Dynamite opens with a missile appearing over the Pacific, headed for the continental United States. The missile's origin is a mystery: Somehow, the U.S. early-detection systems missed its launch. (Was it a glitch? Sabotage? No one knows.) It might be a mistake. It might be a desperate move by the North Koreans, a sneak attack by the Russians or the Chinese, or the first wave of a larger attack by a combination of America's enemies. Or it might be, as one of the officers at U.S. Strategic Command muses to his boss, that “some fucking sub captain woke up, found out his wife left him, and snapped.” Within minutes of detection, the missile's target is confirmed: Chicago.

Now what? The story is told three times, from three different vantage points, but always ends with the same stomach-churning request: “Your orders, Mr. President.”

When I first saw an early version of A House of Dynamite, I expected to have something of a “punch list” of gripes, things experts might notice that seem wrong or out of place. I found very few. (I would argue, for one, that the film is too generous in its estimation of the possible efficacy of U.S. missile defenses.) More to the point, I worked for a U.S. senator in Washington during the first Gulf War, and later taught at the Naval War College, and I was struck by how many people in the film spoke and acted like the policy makers and senior officers I've met over the years. Tracy Letts was especially effective as the commanding general of STRATCOM. He was, like many top officers I knew, capable of turning from snippy martinet to consummate professional almost in the same moment.

Experts might also quibble with, for example, the likelihood that some enemy might launch just one missile, and why. But the reality is that the Cold War scenarios of the previous century, which were based on nuclear exchanges erupting during a major war between the United States and the Soviet Union, are no longer the only path to disaster. Nuclear deterrence was a dicey enough business when it was a two-player game; today, nine states can point nuclear arms at one another in a web of overlapping enmities and alliances. Wisely, Bigelow and Oppenheim did not stoop to making a morality play with villains and heroes. Everything in A House of Dynamite is plausible; the people at the center of the crisis follow procedures, make decisions carefully, and in general do things for sane and understandable reasons.

For example, I spent much of my career studying the Soviet Union and Russia; in the world of movies, Russians are often cast as the default bad guys. But Bigelow avoids such easy tropes, and portrays Russian leaders in the movie as normal people who have perfectly sensible fears. In one tense scene, the Russian foreign minister not only denies that the missile came from Russia, but also expresses exactly the concerns for Russia's security that I would expect from a Russian diplomat talking to the U.S. deputy national security adviser.

Why is the Kremlin at that moment talking to a relatively inexperienced deputy national security adviser? Because sometimes, people are out of the office for things like colonoscopies—which is where the actual national security adviser is during this terrible day. The world in A House of Dynamite is correctly depicted as a chaotic place: Sometimes, telephones don't work. Sometimes, satellites malfunction. Sometimes, the president's top adviser is on a table, whacked up on propofol.

The young deputy does a fine job of laying out the American position, and that's a theme in A House of Dynamite: All of the people handling this crisis are really, really good at their jobs. No one loses their mind and freaks out like Colonel Cascio does in Fail Safe. No one does anything reckless. (The secretary of defense, played by Jared Harris, is under immense personal strain, and the final choice he makes—I will not get into the details—will shock some viewers, but it has a precedent in American history.) The people in charge are professionals, and they did everything right, yet they have to stand and quietly suffocate with anxiety as the warhead begins its supersonic descent into Chicago.

From the August 2025 Issue: The nuclear club might soon double

Likewise, the president in A House of Dynamite (played by Idris Elba) is only an ordinary man who, like some of his real-life predecessors, never paid much attention to his one inadequate nuclear briefing, because he trusted the system. He knows how to do everything else: “Shit,” he says to his advisers, “I got a whole fucking briefing about when a Supreme Court justice dies. Replacements. What to do if the replacements drop out. What to do if the original guy crawls out of his grave and wants his job back.” But apparently no one explained what to do if an American city is about to be vaporized.

A House of Dynamite is about people, not gore, but it is still terrifying. Previous films such as The Day After and the grisly British film Threads tried to get viewers to understand the magnitude of the nuclear threat by showing in detail the destruction a nuclear war would bring. These movies still have the power to shock people—I know this from assigning them to students when I taught courses on nuclear issues—but their Cold War backstories don't seem relevant to younger audiences. Bigelow has made a film that forgoes the carnage and instead explains—methodically and accurately—how the intricate machinery of nuclear deterrence can drag otherwise rational human beings along an inexorable path to disaster.

Movies can reflect a society's fears and anxieties. But sometimes, they can remind us what we should fear. Kathryn Bigelow wants us to remember that we are still in danger. As the crisis in her film deepens, the president exclaims that the whole situation “is insanity.” The commander of STRATCOM could be speaking to every viewer when he replies: “No, sir. This is reality.” May it never be ours.

Free speech is endangered; unbiased and trustworthy news is elusive. In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

Vox editor-in-chief & publisher Swati Sharma today announced that acclaimed journalist Astead W. Herndon is joining the organization as host and editorial director. In this role, he will launch and lead a new multiplatform video podcast for Vox, while also contributing political coverage across text, video, audio, and social media platforms. He begins October 20, 2025.

At Vox, Herndon will play a key role in helping audiences understand the factors shaping the 2026 midterms and the lead-up to the 2028 presidential election. He will launch a new weekly video podcast about politics — and beyond — in 2026, expanding Vox's reach with video-first political storytelling. He will be a multiplatform journalist, contributing to Vox's text, audio, and video reporting. He will also guest-host Vox's popular Today, Explained podcast along with Noel King this fall and winter, and create videos for Vox's social channels, helping audiences clearly understand what's going on in American politics, what the stakes are, and why it all matters. Vox will also explore exclusive content with Herndon for its membership program.

“When I think about the kind of talent I want at Vox, I keep coming back to two things: a voice that feels authentic and deeply connected to people, and someone who truly understands how to use audio, video, and text to reach audiences wherever they are,” Sharma said.

“Looking ahead to 2028 and beyond, Vox will continue to be a place where powerhouse talent helps us hear and understand voices outside elite spaces — because that's what our audience wants, and what they deserve. Astead has proven, time and again, that he's that rare kind of talent. He knows how to cut through, connect, and bring clarity when it matters most. I couldn't be more excited about this partnership and what's to come.”

Herndon comes to Vox from the New York Times, where he distinguished himself as a sharp, accessible voice on American politics, hosting The Run-Up podcast and reporting stories in text, audio, and video formats. His reporting is known for translating complex political dynamics into clear, nuanced stories that resonated with both political insiders and those outside the political bubble. In August, the National Association of Black Journalists named Herndon their 2025 Journalist of the Year. Earlier this year, he won the Distinguished Journalist Award from DePaul University, and was honored with a ceremony in his birthplace of Chicago.

“As I've reported on politics in our changing country, I've seen the media environment changing around me,” Herndon said. “Meeting people where they are has always been a cornerstone of my work — and that's exactly what Vox does. I'm excited to join a talented newsroom and help shape coverage of the next election that's rigorous and curious.”

About Vox

When Vox was founded in 2014, it was animated by a simple observation: The media did a good job of reporting the news and commenting on it, but there was a disconnect between that work and the audience truly understanding why something happened. Vox started as — and remains — an organization dedicated to addressing that gap, which not only persists but has grown.

We are proud to have popularized explanatory journalism in many forms, across many mediums. Our work has been used to educate people everywhere, from elementary schools to college classrooms to vaccination sites in Taiwan to footnotes in congressional memos. We've received numerous awards, including News and Documentary Emmys, Online Journalism Awards, and Loeb Awards. We were a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for our collaboration with ProPublica on maternal mortality.

The CDC has lost one-third of its staff this year. What now?

After the Trump administration laid off hundreds of health workers during the ongoing government shutdown, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has now lost one-third of its staff this year. States are forming public health alliances in direct opposition to the changes being made by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Only half of Americans say they trust the CDC to deliver reliable information about vaccinations.

The consequences of the CDC's gutting will be diffuse, given the agency's many different functions, and they could take some time to materialize. Public health trends are measured in decades, not in months.

But to get a sense of where the agency stands after the chaos of the past year, I went to somebody who knows the place inside and out. Dr. Tom Frieden, the president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit global health organization, was CDC director from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama. Our conversation is below, edited for clarity and length.

Which specific CDC functions do you worry about the most? What hasn't gotten enough attention?

You start with: We're losing our basic ability to know what's happening. That's really dangerous. Flying blind is a really bad strategy, whether you're piloting an airplane or trying to avoid cancer and infectious diseases. Our systems track what's happening and see whether the programs that we want to implement to save lives are actually working or not, so that we can then either fix them or continue them.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

Then there are the specific actions that are being taken that are very damaging, such as dismantling the Office of Smoking and Health, which has led US efforts that have dramatically reduced smoking in the US and continue to track what's happening in populations. The FDA tracks the product; the CDC tracks what happens in people and supports comprehensive action in communities and quit lines and hard-hitting ads. That's all gone.

So, although I think much of what is said is laudable, what is done is the opposite of what is said.

As a reporter who cites the CDC's survey data a lot, I'm concerned about the layoffs in that office. What are the potential consequences if that data isn't available or reliable?

This is a really complicated survey. It's really hard to do. I know that particularly well because when I was New York City health commissioner, we did the first-ever community-specific health and nutrition examination surveys.

It was massively difficult. It takes incredibly rigorous work to get comparable data and a representative sample and competent lab work. It's like building battleships, kind of. And once you stop building them, it's really hard to start again.

This is our most ground-level truth of what's really happening. These surveys tell you how we're really doing, and that may indicate what needs to be done differently. It's also the way we know what's happening with PFAS and how many people have exposure to these chemicals in our blood, and whether we'll be able to reduce that with actions that this administration says they want to take.

What should people think about these state public health alliances or states issuing their own vaccination guidance? How do they decide which authority to listen to?

What's the alternative? People have life-and-death decisions that still need to get made.

You have a CDC that has been basically taken over by ideologues. This has never happened before. You have political appointees running the agency, setting policy on social media, making statements that show that they have very little understanding of or respect for basic scientific method, evidence, and facts.

A lot of people had already lost trust in the CDC. Now, more people are losing trust for very different reasons. How will the CDC ever regain trust — or is it becoming obsolete?

It starts with listening carefully to what people are hearing, what they believe, and addressing valid concerns because the Make America Healthy Again movement gains power by real concerns people have: What's in my food? What's in my water? Who is involved in making these recommendations? Those are perfectly valid questions.

Unfortunately, with what's being done is in the name of reducing conflict of interest, you're seeing a big increase in conflict of interest. That's really clear in the autism discussion. They want to make autism a compensable condition under the Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund. This is payday for trial lawyers while using the people who are dealing with autism and giving them false hope and false information about vaccines, which are repeatedly shown not to have been associated with autism.

I think also public health needs to have tangible wins, things that it does that people can see and understand that this made their life better. This made my life healthier, safer. Our kids are about seven times less likely to smoke than they were a generation ago. Even with vaping, tobacco use is dramatically lower than it was a generation ago. The average lead level a generation or two ago would today result in urgent investigation. These are invisible wins.

That's not to say that either those problems are adequately addressed or there aren't other serious problems. We haven't dealt effectively with obesity. We haven't dealt effectively with asthma. We haven't dealt effectively among adults with hypertension, cardiovascular disease. We've had 10 or 15 years of stalled progress. I think past progress shows both what's possible and what's needed. But any mandates or requirements also need to be kept to an absolute minimum.

I don't see public health becoming obsolete because facts are stubborn things. Even if they're denied and suppressed and misused and misquoted and cherry-picked, facts are still facts. The plain truth is that most people want to be healthy and safe, and what's being done now is putting that very much at risk.

Israel's election, scheduled for next October, could decide whether Gaza sees a real and durable peace.

If the current ceasefire in Gaza holds, it will mark the much-needed end to an indefensibly cruel war. But the longer-term picture, and whether yet another deadly conflagration can be prevented, is another matter. One factor — not the only one, but a big one — is whether the Israelis can be convinced that they should give peace negotiations a serious chance.

Ilan Goldenberg has been thinking about how to do that for quite some time.

While serving as a high-ranking Biden administration official on the Israel-Palestine desk, Goldenberg pushed unsuccessfully for the White House to pressure the Israelis more aggressively in pursuit of a ceasefire. Now that the Trump administration has done so and secured an agreement for their efforts, he sees possibilities for change in Israel's deeper approach to the conflict — either for the better or for the worse.

The optimistic scenario looks a lot like the aftermath of the 1973 Yom Kippur War, in which Israel fended off a surprise invasion from Egyptian and Syrian forces. The initial success of the Arab attack shocked an Israeli public that had grown overconfident in its own strength, laying the groundwork for Prime Minister Menachem Begin's decision to sign a peace treaty with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1978.

The pessimistic scenario resembles the aftermath of the Second Intifada in the 2000s, the bloodiest round of Israeli-Palestinian fighting prior to the current war. That conflict, in which large numbers of Israeli civilians were killed by terrorist attacks inside its borders, led many Israelis to conclude that negotiated peace was impossible — producing a political shift to the right that has led to ever-deepening occupation in the West Bank and Israel's shockingly brutal conduct during the Gaza war.

So, which one is more likely: an Israeli recognition of the need for peace, or a doubling down on the logic of perpetual war? Goldenberg isn't sure. But he's confident that there's a struggle shaping up right now that could tilt the outcome in one direction or the other.

“The most important thing is going to be elections in Israel next year,” he tells me. “That's the linchpin of all of this.”

The Trump ceasefire deal is, in part, an agreement to decide not to decide.

While it purports to be a comprehensive agreement, the parties only fully agreed to its short-term provisions — like this past weekend's hostage-prisoner exchange, as well as an Israeli withdrawal from much of Gaza. There are no agreed-upon specific steps for implementing its longer-term provisions, such as Hamas's disarmament or the installation of an international peacekeeping force in Gaza.

Turning such ideas from aspiration to reality will require difficult compromises, and there are real reasons to be skeptical of everyone involved. President Donald Trump's foreign policy isn't exactly known for its follow-through or attention to detail. Meanwhile, Hamas's post-ceasefire killing spree, in which the group publicly executed some of its Palestinian rivals in Gaza, suggests that it isn't interested in giving up either arms or power.

And on the Israeli side, the biggest problem can be summed up in four words: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

In power for 15 of the last 16 years, “Bibi” has demonstrated an increasingly open hostility to the very idea of serious peace negotiations. His political future depends on an alliance with extreme-right factions who think Israel's biggest mistake in Gaza is that it wasn't violent enough.

So long as Netanyahu is at the helm, he will almost assuredly work to sabotage any attempt at implementing the agreement's 19th and most ambitious provision: its hope to ultimately create “a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognise as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.” If Netanyahu's past behavior is any guide, he will work doggedly to sabotage this element of the deal while attempting to blame Hamas for his own obstructionism.

“He's a man who, for 20 years, has refused to ever take a risk and move the population to something better,” Goldenberg says. “Instead, he's consistently played to their worst instincts and to their fears.”

In practice, this looks a lot like Israel's Tuesday decision, which has since been reversed, to cut the amount of aid flowing into Gaza to half of the agreed-upon levels.

The stated reason for the suspension was that Hamas hadn't followed through on its agreement to hand over the bodies of deceased Israeli hostages. Whether or not this was true — it's possible, as Hamas claims, that they're having trouble finding the remains — there was no need for Israel to retaliate in such a Draconian way.

The most coherent explanation for its decision is that Netanyahu and his allies want the agreement to fail but don't want to get the blame for withdrawing from it without cause. So they're willing to take aggressive steps to destabilize it. And at one point, those efforts are likely to succeed.

This doesn't mean that they want to go back to fighting tomorrow. Resuming the war would be a brazen insult to Trump, who is increasingly staking his reputation on bringing “peace” to the Middle East. There is a very good chance that, as Goldenberg puts it, “the major fighting is over,” no matter what.

But the question is not just whether bombs will start dropping in the immediate future. It's whether something is being done to prevent another conflagration several years down the line. That requires tackling the underlying condition of conflict between the two sides: the lack of a fully negotiated settlement that addresses the legitimate fears and aspirations of both peoples. Without that, another round of vicious fighting is inevitable.

If this logic holds, then Netanyahu must leave office for this ceasefire to eventually set the stage for a true peace. For this reason, Israel's upcoming elections — currently scheduled for October 2026, though they could be called sooner — are shaping up to be enormously consequential. Michael Koplow, an expert at the Israel Policy Forum think tank, has written that “the coming elections will be the most consequential in Israel's history.”

The good news, at least for those who desire a lasting peace, is that Netanyahu is likely to lose.

“Hardly anything in the last year and a half has fundamentally changed Netanyahu's polling strength.”

Early post-ceasefire polls have Netanyahu and his radical right coalition partners winning 48 seats out of a total of 120 in the Knesset (Israel's parliament). That's actually a slight improvement over their prior numbers, but it's still well short of the 61 seats necessary to form a governing coalition — a shortfall that's been remarkably consistent over time.

“Hardly anything in the last year and a half has fundamentally changed Netanyahu's polling strength,” says Dahlia Scheindlin, a leading Israeli pollster.

Of course, Scheindlin cautions, those numbers could change. It's a cliché in Middle East journalism to call Netanyahu a consummate political survivor, but it's a cliché for a reason: He's been able to hold on to power long after many observers declared him doomed.

Maybe the widespread joy inside Israel at the return of the hostages changes things; we haven't yet seen solid polling data since their release. But the long-run consistency in the numbers is so striking that it suggests there might be deeper, harder-to-fix problems for the prime minister.

Netanyahu's continued refusal to take any accountability for the October 7 attack — or even convene a real commission to investigate responsibility — has infuriated Israelis who still live with the trauma of that day's events. Additionally, most Israelis believe Netanyahu has been prolonging the war for political reasons, which would suggest the ceasefire was not an accomplishment but something forced on him. It's also worth remembering that Netanyahu is an indicted criminal who launched an attack on the independence of Israel's judiciary prior to the war, one that prompted the largest protest movement in the country's history.

Despite Netanyahu's vaunted survival skills, in other words, the odds this time around are very much against him.

But Netanyahu's defeat does not guarantee that Israel gets on a path to peace. It is a necessary condition — so long as he is in office, a durable peace is likely impossible — but it is not a sufficient one. To solve the Israeli part of the peace equation, you need to address the public's post-October 7 souring on the prospects for any kind of real agreement. And that requires leadership willing to make the case to them.

“During violent escalations, I have rarely seen the Israeli public go ahead of its leaders in getting more moderate,” Scheindlin says. The 1978 Camp David agreement, she notes, was initially met with skepticism from the Israeli public. But once you had “a legitimately elected leader making the case…then people changed their minds, and within a few months they supported the agreement with very high majorities.”

Nobody knows whether such leadership exists today.

The opposition to Netanyahu is made up of a group of parties that span the ideological gamut. Their leaders include far-right settlers like Naftali Bennett, center-right hawks like Benny Gantz, Zionist liberals like Yair Golan, and even Arab Islamists like Mansour Abbas.

These parties share little other than a deep distaste for Netanyahu, and that makes any coalition they form liable to collapse. Such a grand opposition took power in 2021, with Bennett as its first prime minister, only to fall under the weight of its own contradictions — and set the stage for Netanyahu's return to power.

At present, we have no idea what subgroupings of these parties will do better and which will do worse. A lot will depend not just on Netanyahu's defeat, but which of the various out-of-government parties do better and what sort of governing coalition the election yields. A government led by Bennett is, for example, less likely to engage in serious negotiations than one led by the centrist Yair Lapid.

It is, in short, eminently possible that this fragile ceasefire could collapse eventually, even if Netanyahu goes down to defeat. But if he remains in power, those odds approximate certainty. If Trump, or anyone else, wants this deal to truly lay the groundwork for peace, they need to begin with removing Netanyahu from the equation.

“There's a lot of hinge points,” Goldenberg says. “But the first one has to be him.”

They unite — and divide — a deeply polarized audience.

The videos seem to be everywhere. From a Chicago suburb, cellphone footage of federal agents firing pepper balls at a pastor and tear-gassing a mayor and a congressional candidate. Across the city, slick footage of a military-style raid on an apartment complex. From New York, a barrage of photos and videos of civilians being slammed to the floor or restrained in immigration courts.

These clips spread widely on social media. You've probably seen at least a handful of them on TikTok, X, or BlueSky. Taken altogether, they provide a panorama of federal agents — usually from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and US Border Patrol — using force and aggression to control crowds, disperse protesters, and seize immigrants.

But the proliferation of viral videos shows something else, too: namely, how Red and Blue America use these attention-grabbing videos to construct two mutually contradictory realities. In one of these realities, the natural response to these examples of state violence is assumed to be defined by a sense of outrage, disgust, and fear.

In the other reality, however, these videos are a source of glee, curiosity, and satisfaction. To viewers who support ICE's actions, such videos are regarded as appropriate reactions to hostile crowds harassing law enforcement officers as they try to enforce existing immigration law. The common refrain from these quarters is a variation on: “I voted for this.”

“There are so many different viral moments now, which also affect different American cities and very different populations, that this is becoming a lot more widespread. Even if people aren't exposed to it online, they're very likely exposed to it in news coverage of it after the fact,” Emerson T. Brooking, the director of strategy at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, told me. “Certainly, some people in the Trump administration aren't concerned about the virality of these clips — that's why you're seeing the use of so much in taxpayer money to try to advance a pro-ICE agenda [online].”

But these videos aren't just spreading across social media; they're also breaking into traditional and mainstream media, becoming one of the primary ways that different parts of the American public are seeing, processing, and forming opinions about the second Trump administration's immigration enforcement campaign. The result, experts say, is a process in which Americans on both sides of the political divide are using the same material to draw wildly different conclusions about reality itself.

As federal agents rolled out their immigration enforcement campaign across the Chicago area earlier this fall, JB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois, made an unusual request of his constituents — to document as many interactions with ICE and other federal agents as possible.

“People of Illinois, we need your help. Get out your cellphones, record, and narrate what you see. Put it on social media. Peacefully ask for badge numbers and identification,” Pritzker said during a late-September news conference. “We need to let the world know that this is happening and that we won't stand for it.”

Pritzker's appeal was the most explicit sign yet that viral ICE videos, filmed and posted by grassroots social media users, were moving to the center of US politics. Thanks to these creators, the Illinois immigration enforcement surge has become perhaps the most documented crackdown from this year yet. Similar videos have been created and shared in Los Angeles, New York, and Portland, Oregon, but the sheer number of videos coming out of Chicago is overwhelming: as of this writing, there are more than 18 million entries under “Ice entered in Chicago” on TikTok alone.

Take, for example, the ICE facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview that has been the focal point of demonstrations and federal violence against protesters. For weeks, federal agents have confronted and stood off with demonstrators outside the facility's main entrance. Bystanders, as well as journalists, have captured clips of a clergy member being hit in the head with pepper balls, of a car pushing up against protesters as it tries to exit a driveway, of tear gas being used on protesters, including Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, and of agents shoving and throwing civilians, including congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh.

“Video is really pivotal — it shows the brutality, and it shows the unnecessary nature of it,” Biss, who is also running in the Democratic primary for Illinois's Ninth Congressional District, told me. “There are two functions here: one function is to persuade people who voted for Donald Trump [and] maybe wanted tougher immigration enforcement that he's gone too far. The other function is to illustrate to people who are fundamentally not supportive of what's going on, how bad it is, and how extreme it is.”

The wide breadth of this genre of video, Biss told me, is a necessary part of building liberal awareness, outrage, and, eventually, more action. They are both factual, unedited documentations of federal use of force, and also vehicles meant to rally emotion and anger to construct a broader liberal consciousness of what is going on in specific American neighborhoods and suburbs. That, in turn, creates a cycle of virality, the media reporter Aaron Rupar told me. “Having these videos that sort of bring stories to life and makes them more vivid for people, hence makes them more viral.”

The recent visit by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to Portland, where another ICE facility is serving as a rallying spot for protesters, media, influencers, and regular people, demonstrates that the administration itself is relying on a different kind of virality to form narratives and flood social media.

Accompanying Noem were at least three right-wing influencers: Benny Johnson, Nick Sortor, and David Medina, all of whom spent days talking up the administration's approach, amplifying Noem's narrative that Portland is a “hellscape” in need of federal intervention, and taping footage to confirm that view. They are just three of the scores of influencers who have swamped the area.

It's a “symbiotic” form of political messaging and content production, Wired's Makena Kelly noted last week: “these creators don't just amplify the White House's messaging, they manufacture the evidence to justify it.”

Brooking, from the Atlantic Council, told me that though it's hard to quantify the reach of these kinds of videos, the sheer amount of time and energy the Trump administration is spending on viral videos and content creation is itself an unprecedented thing. “The administration's theory of the case is clearly to maximize the content creation,” he told me. “The extent to which ICE is sometimes being deputized into producing their own content, on top of public affairs teams and on top of the extra money being spent on enforcement…this is not something that has previously happened in the United States.”

He highlighted images out of Portland, Chicago, and other cities of federal agents carrying out enforcement actions while being followed by videographers or photographers: holding selfie sticks to capture multiple angles of an arrest or violent confrontation, and then broadcast them. More recently, that's expanded to bringing along right-wing influencers to capture their own footage, either embedded with immigration teams or getting unique access to facilities or arrests.

These videos, by their nature, are much more polished and planned out — meant to offer sympathetic views of the agents carrying out enforcement actions. Or, they document the same interactions as videos from the first realm — but shared in order to excite and entertain audiences that approve of the policies. And for that second purpose, they have plenty of eager consumers. Simple social media searches on X and TikTok also show the scores of approving perspectives, boosted by popular right-wing and conservative social media users and commentators. It's another example of “governing for the gram,” as the liberal writer Brian Beutler put it this week: “a closed loop, where internet-poisoned men and women in power abuse their authorities to thrill their creepy online followers, and those followers perform online in ways designed to get those same bad actors to push the envelope farther.”

Of course, it's getting harder to tell how much of this is genuine and how much of it is bots or algorithmically fine-tuned content. But that itself is more evidence of just how differently social media bubbles are presenting and sharing critical and sympathetic narratives.

Then there are moments of unexpected overlap. Perhaps the most viral of these clips, of a woman who was bodyslammed by an ICE officer at a New York courthouse in front of her child, was captured by a reporter for the right-wing media site Timcast, from the influencer Tim Pool. Initially, it was just one more piece of content for those audiences, documenting a “hysterical wife of [a] detained alien” who is pushed and shoved to the ground by agents. The first clip in this series only reached about a million X users.

But the violent interaction that went viral in a follow-up tweet broke containment — reaching nearly 20 million interactions and making it headline news for the following week in September. The clip probably wasn't meant to get so much attention, but it did. The agent in question was suspended (although he was later reinstated). It went viral and got the wrong kind of attention, but it ended up being drowned out by a seemingly endless stream of similar content.

It all illustrates how unique and uncertain this moment is: In the past, one viral video could spark outrage, protests, and action. Now, the public consciousness is split into two very different realms, both of which are producing an endless feed of viral video.

“I don't think there's going to be one video. There's so much content,” Brooking told me. “This is something that the White House and ICE communicators are very cognizant of. … As long as they continue to be producing their own content and narratives, it will remain this endless back and forth.”

What TV can teach us about Instagram.

Instagram is starting to look more like TV, a move that might make some parents happy but ultimately proves that tech companies are getting closer to total victory in their campaign to capture as much of our attention as possible.

The company just announced a new default content setting for Teen Accounts that promises to show teen users only content that's “similar to what they'd see in a PG-13 movie.” (There are also new settings that serve rough equivalents of PG- and R-rated content to teens, although parents have to approve the change.) On top of that, Instagram is exploring the idea of launching a TV app so you can watch Reels on the big screen in your living room.

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

These developments dovetail nicely with the argument that Derek Thompson made a few days before Instagram's announcement: “Everything is television.” Citing an FTC filing, he points out that only 7 percent of users' time on Instagram involves consuming content from people you know. Meanwhile, podcasts are on Netflix, and AI can create an infinite circuit of slop to tap your consciousness into. “Digital media, empowered by the serum of algorithmic feeds, has become super-television: more images, more videos, more isolation,” writes Thompson.

Old-fashioned television used to be extremely tame, thanks to a combination of technological constraints, federal regulations, and societal norms. There used to be a limited number of channels, because there was a limited amount of spectrum to broadcast on. And because there was a limited amount of spectrum, nearly a century ago, the federal government created an agency to control the airwaves: the Federal Communications Commission.

In the medium's early days, there was still plenty of fear that TV was ruining the American minds, especially young ones. Broadcaster Edward R. Murrow condemned the rise in entertainment television as “the real opiate of the people” in a 1957 interview with Time. A few years later, in 1961, Newton Minnow delivered his first address as FCC chair by describing TV as a “vast wasteland… a procession of game shows, formula comedies about totally unbelievable families, blood and thunder, mayhem, violence, sadism, murder, Western bad men, Western good men, private eyes, gangsters, more violence, and cartoons.” This guy would have hated TikTok.

The bad things that Minnow pointed out were especially bad, because children could tune in and see them whenever they found themselves staring at a screen. The FCC would eventually police the kinds of content that could be broadcast during certain hours. Obscene content was illegal on TV, but starting in 1978, some profane or indecent material was allowed between 10 pm and 6 am, when kids were presumably asleep. (You can thank George Carlin for that.) That amounted to an early form of age verification, which, as the Instagram announcement makes clear, continues to be a problem on the internet. It also seems unsolvable.

Protecting kids nevertheless seems to be the only bipartisan motivation to regulate today's super TV. Whether it's social media's controversial contribution to the youth mental health crisis, or the “unacceptable risks” AI chatbots pose to children and teenagers, lawmakers have plenty of reasons to impose new regulations on the platforms that have become the 21st century equivalents of broadcasters. Senatos Richard Blumenthal and Marsha Blackburn, co-sponsors of the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), recently started campaigning to push the bill through the Senate (again) before the end of the year.

Things are changing fast, though. When you factor in new AI-powered feeds, like OpenAI's Sora and Meta's Vibes, it's clear that digital media — or super TV, if you prefer — has its own vast wasteland problem.

Prohibiting certain kinds of content is hard when there's not a single government agency policing the airwaves, or these days, the tubes that keep us online. So the preferred path to regulation seems to be to create three internets: one for kids under 13, one for teens, and one for adults. A PG, PG-13, and R internet, if you will.

Doing this successfully requires checking IDs, and the current state of age verification is a mess. In the past three years, 25 states have passed laws requiring websites with adult content, namely porn, to verify a user's age. This is the R-rated internet. Several of these states also require age verification for social media platforms. Because the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA) places limitations on websites allowing users younger than 13, this is the PG-13 internet. Presumably, the PG versions of websites would include some of these protections, including the ability to turn off addictive algorithms, as New York recently proposed.

Age verification online is really hard, by the way. For the most part, to confirm someone's age, you need to confirm their identity. Free speech advocates warn that strict age requirements will prevent anonymous adults from accessing content that's protected by the First Amendment. Civil liberties groups say that age verification presents a huge security risk, which seems like a reasonable worry after the recent hack of an age verification company exposed the data of 70,000 Discord users. High-tech age verification methods, like using AI to estimate a user's age based on their activity or facial recognition to guess age based on how old they look, aren't yet proven. And more than anything, kids can figure out how to get around age verification systems, whether by lying about their birthday or using virtual private networks (VPNs).

Looking back to television's golden era, when game shows and bad words were the big dangers, you can see how much the stakes have changed. Digital media is powered by math so sophisticated, even the people who wrote the code don't know how it works. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok are interactive and deliberately addictive. Use of these products has been linked to depression, anxiety, and self-harm.

If the three-internets strategy works, it would represent an improvement for parents who want their kids to have an age-appropriate experience online. There would probably even be positive knock-on effects, like better privacy protections, which are a hallmark of existing laws that protect kids online. Heck, it could even be handy for those of us who would simply like to avoid accidentally seeing a murder on their phone.

Creating feeds that are safer for kids, movie rating style or otherwise, is a step towards making feeds safer for everyone. Or, at least, it's evidence that Instagram and its competitors are capable of doing so.

This technology could feed a world of 10 billion. We're squandering it, and the trade war with China could make it worse.

Americans have a weird relationship with soy, one of the most important and widely cultivated crops in the world.

Most of us associate the protein-packed, butter-yellow orbs known as soybeans with niche vegetarian products like tofu, soy milk, and veggie burgers (hence the anti-vegan epithet “soy boy”). In reality, though, pretty much everyone is eating soy all the time, and if you're not a vegetarian, chances are you're consuming more soy than those who avoid meat, not less.

That's because soy is the invisible backbone supporting modern, meat-heavy diets. The overwhelming majority of soy on Earth — about 77 percent — is grown to feed not humans but the billions of chickens, pigs, and cows raised to feed us, supplying the chief protein source in livestock diets.

A newsletter analyzing how the meat and dairy industries impact everything around us.

Humanity's prodigious appetite for meat explains why the US produces so much soy. Although, for most of agricultural history, it was exclusively an East Asian crop, grown to make foods like miso, soy sauce, and tofu, today, almost all soybean cultivation today is concentrated in the Americas. As recent trade war headlines reminded us, the US is, after Brazil, the world's second leading soy producer, and soybeans are our top agricultural export. The humble bean has become, over the last century, as much an ambassador for American abundance as corn syrup and chicken nuggets.

Because it is demanded everywhere but production is geographically clustered, the soybean has attained curious geopolitical significance as the single most traded global agricultural commodity. China, long ago the world's leading soybean grower, is now the world's top importer, buying most of its soy from Brazil and the US, primarily to feed its factory-farmed pigs, chickens, and fish. In fact, in most years, China buys most of all US soy exports. Brazil, meanwhile, has, in recent decades, become an agricultural superpower partly on the back of its soy sales to China. Seeking to limit its dependence on imports, China is even striving to develop livestock feeds lower in soy content.

When delicate diplomatic relationships like these become strained — like, say, when the head of a major soy-producing country starts a trade war for no reason — export-dependent industries suffer. That's the position that US soybean farmers now find themselves in. Beijing placed steep tariffs on American soybeans this year in retaliation for President Donald Trump's aggressive tariffs, vaporizing US soy sales to China. The total value of American soy exports from the first half of this year are down nearly a quarter from 2024, and, according to the most recent US Department of Agriculture data, Chinese traders have placed zero orders for US soy from the current harvest year, which started September 1. (By this time last year, they'd already ordered millions of tons.)

American soy producers, watching China buy record levels of soy from Brazil and Argentina while boycotting the US, are understandably irate. Just as predictably, the White House has signaled it will throw money at farmers to make up for their losses, just as it did during Trump's first trade war in 2018.

For all that, though, there may be less to this dust-up than meets the eye. Soy exports are not actually economically important to the US — all of agriculture makes up less than 1 percent of our economy — though they do matter to local economies in farm states. And while Trump's trade war is pointless and destructive to the country as a whole, the reason farmers in particular are likely to be bailed out — with tariff revenue extracted from all Americans — is political, not economic. Traditionally, we subsidize agriculture, because growing food is really important — we do need to eat — but there's no reason (other than the electoral influence of Iowa farmers) to view the export of feed for China's pigs as a national priority worth spending perhaps $10 billion.

We should all care less about the fortunes of the soybean industry. It is, as a few experts told me, likely going to be fine. Rather, the way to understand soy is as a miraculous and precious technology that, if used more wisely than we use it now, could sustainably feed a world of eight billion and counting. The trade war is mostly a sideshow, but it could, on the margin, move us even farther from that goal.

Every so often, a very confused post goes viral online, blaming vegans for the global soybean industry's razing of tropical rainforests.

This may shock you, but these claims are not, in fact, true. Only about 13 percent of the world's soy output is processed into soybean oil that humans eat — found in ubiquitous packaged foods like crackers, cookies, and salad dressings — and less than 6 percent is used for the foods you might associate with the vegan aisle.

But it's not just that more soy goes to animal products than into food for people. It's that soy is used disproportionately and inefficiently to make animal products. We waste more land and more calories feeding soy to farmed animals than we would if we ate the crops directly.

That means that surging global meat consumption over the last few decades has accelerated the clearing of some of the planet's most ecologically important land, like the Amazon rainforest and the Brazilian Cerrado, to farm livestock and their feed crops, including soy.

But here is the thing: As long as people are eating animals, the animals need to eat something. And soy has emerged, alongside corn, as one of the crops of choice, because it's essentially the most productive, most land-efficient — and therefore least environmentally destructive — protein source in the world.

“Don't blame the soy,” Timothy Searchinger, a senior research scholar at Princeton University and a leading expert on the planetary impacts of agriculture, told me. “If it weren't soy and we were increasing meat [consumption] and we had to feed meat with lentils, we'd need three times as much land to feed the meat with the lentils, and we'd all be cursing lentils.”

In other words, soy is the least bad option for feeding livestock, but livestock aren't a good use of the soy. And the demand for animal feed is now rising alongside another major global user of soybeans, one that also squanders land that could otherwise be spared to maintain wild, biodiverse, carbon-storing ecosystems. That use is biofuels, or liquid fuels refined from agricultural crops that power cars, trucks, planes, and other machinery. Once embraced as a renewable alternative to fossil fuels, biofuels like corn ethanol and soy biodiesel are now believed by many climate experts to be just as bad, or even worse, in their carbon emissions than their petroleum counterparts when their land use is taken into account.

But biofuels remain stubbornly entrenched in the US energy mix, through policies like the federal Renewable Fuel Standard, with the backing of politically powerful commodity crop industries (which are quite open about the fact that the whole point of biofuels policy is to guarantee them a market). Over the last 20 years, an ever-increasing share of US soybean oil has been siphoned to biofuels, from around 15 percent in 2010 to a projected more than half in the 2025-2026 harvest year.

All the while, this diversion of US cropland to grow fuel is pushing actual food production into new frontiers, driving the destruction of irreplaceable forestland elsewhere in the world — a predictable market outcome known as indirect land-use change. Soybean oil used in packaged supermarket foods is highly substitutable for other vegetable oils, like canola, sunflower, and palm, Richard Sexton, an agricultural economist at University of California, Davis, explained. And so, as more US soybean oil is funneled into fuel tanks, the rich rainforests of Southeast Asia — among the most important carbon reservoirs on Earth and home to our critically endangered great ape cousins, orangutans — are mowed down to grow oil palm.

As Sexton put it: “We are deforesting Indonesia and Malaysia due to our biofuel policies.”

Whether we're feeding it to pigs and chickens or trucks and tractors, the principle is the same: Humans use too much soy, a magnificently productive crop, for perilously unproductive purposes.

But that doesn't mean it's a good thing that American farmers are now struggling to sell their soybeans. Because soy is a global market, any soybeans that China doesn't buy from the US, it can source from South America. And South American soy is worse for the planet than US soy, because it's a region where significant land clearing for agriculture is still taking place. “If you are going to shift production from the US to Latin America, you end up having higher carbon costs, as well as biodiversity costs,” Searchinger said.

It's not clear, though, whether the trade war will meaningfully shift production from the US to South America. For that to happen, South American soybean prices would need to be high enough to entice farmers to expand production more than they otherwise would have. There's a bit of evidence to support that — US soy prices have been depressed this year due to lack of Chinese demand, while export prices in Brazil have been elevated — but the counterfactual is unclear, nor is it clear how long these price effects will persist.

“I don't think it's a stretch to say that these types of tariffs could incentivize more planting and land use change in” South America, Sexton said. At the same time, he noted, the trade war's impacts will probably be transitory and unlikely to change the fundamental nature of the world soy market. South America only has so much soy to sell, so if Brazil and Argentina sell more of its supply to China, then the US will simply sell more to countries that South America leaves behind. And all the soybeans that farms can't sell now, he said, will be sold eventually; they're shelf-stable and will sit in storage until a buyer appears.

If the trade war with China is not having much impact on US soy, then the soy industry stands to be bailed out for nothing, and the coming farm aid might just represent another wealth transfer from the American people to farmers. That is, in fact, what happened under the first Trump administration's trade war, when bailouts to soy farmers significantly exceeded their economic losses. Searchinger suspects the current hype about the industry's plight from the trade war is “a bit of a scam.”

Some of the most important global problems of the 21st century, from malnutrition, to climate change, to the large-scale torture of animals raised for food, could be mitigated if humans ate more soy directly.

Significantly higher in protein per calorie than other legumes, as well as in other key nutrients like iron and calcium, soy is the best plant-based alternative to many of the nutrients found in meat. It's practically a superfood (to the extent there is such a thing), yet it's structurally wasted.

Some people still believe consuming soy can be dangerous or “feminizing” to men, which is wholly untrue. If I were being uncharitable, I'd say that viral myths about the health risks of soy look like a suspiciously convenient cultural defense mechanism against having to face up to the problems of high meat consumption. We farm massive amounts of the world's most ideal protein source, shovel it to farm animals, and tell ourselves there's something wrong with eating it ourselves.

Now, I love traditional soy foods like tofu and soy milk, which have been around for centuries. But these are old technologies, and for a country whose soy industry is so dominant on the world stage, the US has had surprisingly little innovation in making soy foods more delicious, easy to cook, and culturally legible (products like Impossible burgers and soy curls are notable exceptions).

America should have greater ambitions for the soybean, treating it not just as slop for the world's abused livestock but as a technological treasure with the potential to reshape global diets for the better. As a policy matter, we should invest massively in research and development to make soy foods sexy and appealing — not just to vegans, but to mainstream America.

Agricultural innovation has, after all, already thoroughly transformed soy from an East Asian specialty to an all-American mass commodity. The next transformation will be even more challenging but more worthy of our national pride: turning soy from an industrial feedstock back into human food.

Is Google's latest AI image-editing tool an Adobe-killer? New data suggests it may be hurting it.

When Google launched its Gemini 2.5 Flash model — better known by its more fun codename Nano Banana — in August, it became a viral hit. Because of its ability to edit images using AI for free (or at a low cost if you're using it through the API), we wondered if it might spell bad news for Adobe, which sells competing image software.

Data provided to Business Insider by Appfigures, an analytics company, reveals that as downloads of Gemini skyrocketed around the time of Nano Banana's release, downloads of Firefly, Adobe's generative AI image and video app, began to slump.

While it's impossible to say for certain that the two are directly related, the timing closely matches. After launching in June, Firefly was experiencing ""impressive"" growth, with downloads in August up 150% over the previous month, Randy Nelson, Appfigures' head of insights, told Business Insider. Gemini grew just 20% in that same period. The data includes downloads from both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.

Adobe could not immediately be reached for comment. 

After Google rolled out Nano Banana to the Gemini app on August 26, Firefly downloads dropped by more than half over the following week, while Google's app skyrocketed.

As of October 6, Gemini downloads were up 331% compared to the last week of July, while Firefly was down 68% — its lowest since the arrival of Nano Banana — per the Appfigures data.

To further put that into perspective, Google's Gemini app had 6.1 million more downloads last week than the week it integrated the new image model, according to the data, while Firefly saw 2 million fewer downloads.

Further analysis from Appfigures of different territories shows that Gemini had an 88% jump in downloads in the US from the last month of September to the last month of October. Firefly, meanwhile, dropped by 82% during the same period in the US.

Adobe's Firefly app lets people use a variety of models, and in September it added Google's Nano Banana to the list. At the time of Nano Banana's launch, Adobe told Business Insider that its advantage lies in having a variety of different models in one place so that users don't have to move between different platforms.

Regardless, users appear to still be flocking to Gemini, and Adobe's stock price — down nearly 35% in the past year — reflects the challenges its business faces from Google, OpenAI, and a host of other AI competitors knocking on the door.

AI is disrupting the world of consulting, and so far, EY is cashing in.

The Big Four consulting and accounting firm reported on Wednesday that AI-related revenue was up 30% in its 2025 financial year, which covers the year ending June 30.

EY said that consulting services like ""delivering enterprise-wide transformations"" and ""AI governance frameworks that help drive the responsible implementation of AI"" helped drive the surge in demand.

The firm said it invests more than $1 billion each year in developing AI-first platforms and products, including 1,000 AI agents and the deployment of more than 100 internal AI applications.

Overall global revenue rose 4% in the 2025 financial year to hit $53.2 billion.

EY's rate of growth was in line with that of the 2024 financial year, but remained much lower than the 14.2% jump in revenue reported in 2023.

The firm's assurance division generated the most revenue, bringing in $17.8 billion, but its tax line was the strongest-performing, rising 5.5% to generate $12.7 billion.

Consulting showed strong signs of recovery from the previous year, when it only rose by 0.1%. In its 2025 financial year, consulting was up 5.2% to generate $16.4 billion for EY.

EY-Parthenon, which provides strategy and transactions services, shrank by 0.4%, with revenue of $6.2 billion. Global dealmaking activity was slow throughout 2024 and 2025, but the market has started to pick up in recent months.

In March, EY announced that it was expanding the EY-Parthenon brand, merging its strategy, transactions, and deal advisory work under the division. The merger brought 16,000 new EY professionals into the EY-Parthenon division.

Janet Truncale, EY's CEO and global chair, launched a major new strategy called ""All In"" soon after she took over leadership of the firm in July 2024. The changes have altered EY's core business lines and global structure.

""Now in its second year, the EY All in strategy reinforces a commitment to AI-powered solutions, deeper industry alliances and continuous learning and development for EY people,"" Truncale said in Wednesday's earnings report.

EY is the second of the Big Four firms after Deloitte to report global earnings for the 2025 financial year. PwC and KPMG are yet to share results.

Following a pandemic-era boom, the four firms have seen demand for their consulting services wane. Overstaffed departments and tight economies saw annual revenue growth fall across the board. The firms are also facing existential questions about how AI will alter their long-held business models and staffing structures.

But signs point to a slow uptick in business. Earlier this month, Deloitte reported a 5% rise in global revenue in its 2025 financial year, which ends 31 May 2025.

That was up from Deloitte's 3.1% growth the previous year, though, like EY, the firm's growth is still short of the double-digit growth of the pandemic years.

A startup that's built AI agents to autonomously match job seekers with hiring companies has raised $20 million in funding.

London-based Jack & Jill has developed two conversational AI agents for each side of the recruitment process.

One agent, called Jack, works with job seekers. It gathers information from a candidate's LinkedIn profile, CV, and a 20-minute introductory conversation. Jack then searches for suitable jobs across the internet, provides coaching, and conducts mock interviews.

Jill, the other agent, works with companies. It scans job descriptions and has a briefing conversation with the in-house talent team to understand what the company is looking for in a candidate. Jill can then review applicants, source candidates from public platforms like LinkedIn, and conduct initial interviews.

The two AI agents can also interact with each other and make introductions over email.

""The key insight that we had with Jack & Jill is that AI enables us to combine the nuanced understanding that a human can have, with the scale that you can get from technology,"" Matthew Wilson, the startup's cofounder and CEO, told Business Insider.

Wilson cofounded Jack & Jill six months ago with Saaras Mehan after they became frustrated with what they saw as inefficiency in the recruitment process.

The startup says it has more than 49,000 job seekers using its platform, and counts hundreds of companies, including Airtable, Airwallex, and TrueLayer, among its customers. The service is free for job seekers, while Jack & Jill charges companies 10% of the base salary of a successful hire.

Wilson said he thinks AI will be ""very disruptive for a lot of roles."" He added that there's still plenty of room for humans in the recruitment process, such as focusing on ""quality conversations"" and strategy. AI can instead handle work that's not ""hugely value-additive"" like scrolling through LinkedIn and reviewing CVs, he said.

The startup has 12 employees, and Wilson told Business Insider that it uses AI in areas such as coding, AI-generated marketing videos, and reviewing user interactions to complete more work with fewer people.

Investors pumped $2.8 billion into agentic AI startups globally in the first half of 2025, according to Dealroom data. The buzzy space has seen startups build AI agents for coding, customer support, cybersecurity, and many other areas.

Jack & Jill's seed round was led by Creandum. It was also backed by Dig Ventures, Entrepreneur First, Ada Ventures, Firedrop, Repeat.vc, Episode1, and Playfair, in addition to more than 50 angel investors from companies including Lovable, Anthropic, and ElevenLabs.

The startup plans to use the fresh funding to expand in Europe and the San Francisco area.

This as-told-to essay is part of Lonely at the Top, a series that examines the link between wealth and loneliness. It is based on a conversation with Jeremy Barker, founder and CEO of Murphy Door, which specializes in selling hidden doors and storage solutions. It has been edited for length and clarity.

I was only making $6.13 an hour.

I always knew I wanted to be a firefighter and started training during high school. I would have been thrilled with my career, but the shockingly low pay wasn't what my dreams were built on — I couldn't even afford college. I knew something had to change, so I left the firehouse and set out on my own as an entrepreneur.

Today, I'm a multimillionaire. I'm also still a firefighter — for the love of the job, not the money.

The road to get here has been full of ups and downs. In my 20s, I made great money running a company that sold garages and sheds.

Since I had too little financial education and too much interest in partying, the money I made didn't last long. I sold the intellectual property to Home Depot, but had little to show for it. I had to live out of my car for a year after the sale.

Over the next decade, I tried to find a lucrative and fulfilling career. I sold RVs and then started working in construction, eventually founding my own construction business. That was successful until the 2008 financial crisis.

By the time I was 33, I was in a pretty dismal financial situation again. I wanted a consistent job, and I knew that fires and emergencies never go away. The pay was still low — about $380 a week — but the benefits and predictability drew me back to the fire station in 2010.

Being a firefighter was a true brotherhood, with men and women alike. We had a sense of respect, appreciation, and guardianship for each other.

The colleagues on my shift were my closest friends. We were always together. On our days off, we would go hunting, camping, or hiking. We even celebrated holidays as a family.

About two years after returning to my fire career, I started Murphy Door, a company that sells unique hidden doors and furniture — think, a door that looks like a bookshelf, or a folding bed that looks like a television stand.

I didn't think I'd ever leave firefighting because I loved it so much, but I wanted a side business. I thrive under pressure.

As the company grew, it needed more of my time. I started missing outings with colleagues on my days off so that I could work on the business. Soon, they stopped inviting me.

Before long, I started to feel like an outsider in the firehouse. I wasn't taking a wage from Murphy Door — I was still living on my $15.75 hourly wage as a firefighter. But by 2015, the company had broken $1 million in annual sales.

My colleagues at the firehouse started teasing me more and more about how hard I was working. I wasn't spending as much time with them because I had different priorities — they wanted to hang out on days off, while I was always working on the business.

I felt like I had to constantly announce that I didn't think I was better than them. I've never found a way to break through that.

In 2016, my fire chief asked to speak with me. He pointed out that while firefighting was taking up most of my time, since I needed to be physically present on shift, it seemed my mind was always on Murphy Door and my family.

He encouraged me to prioritize my time so that it reflected what I valued most: my company and my family. It was a hard pill to swallow because I knew he was right.

When I went home that day, only my dog greeted me — my wife and daughter didn't even look up. My wife noticed I was frustrated and told me if I wanted to be treated like a dad, I needed to start showing up like one.

The next day, I resigned from the firehouse.

Now that I'm 50, I have a net worth of about $150 million, but I'm still working 16-hour days. Unfortunately, resigning didn't necessarily lead to more regular time with my family, since I just worked more on Murphy Door.

My financial means sometimes make it easier to connect with my kids. These days, it's my kids' busy schedules with sports and activities that make it tricky to spend time together. Still, I can take my private plane home from a meeting in time to get to one of their sports games. When we go on vacations together, I unplug with intent, so I can spend quality time with my kids and wife.

I also have a group of old friends, about three guys who are my ride or dies. We meet for coffee in a rundown diner, and we don't talk about money or business. We ask about kids and share old stories. It's what I miss about the firehouse.

I'm still envious of people who can be content — I'm driven even now by a lack of a sense of peace.

My wealth has had a huge impact — and not always a good one — on my relationships. I hate that I have to question whether people genuinely care about me or if it's all surface-level. I filter my relationships through that.

I love helping others, but I don't want to always be the first person they call when they need money, especially if they haven't tried to help themselves first. A family member recently asked me for money after telling me he'd been ""lounging"" lately. I just wish I could teach that guy — who is smart and physically capable — to work hard.

I'm still a part-time firefighter, and I pick up shifts every few months. I take a lot of ribbing; they'll call me Mr. Millionaire, or ask for business or life advice. That's OK, but sometimes I need a mentor, too.

Overall, I wish I had more reciprocal relationships in my life: people who would listen to me vent or debrief with me about a tough call as a firefighter. I just want to be the same person I've always been, but I can't.

New York's Wall Street elites are signing massive checks to support Andrew Cuomo's mayoral race, while some of the rank-and-file are donating to Zohran Mamdani in hopes that someday their much smaller paychecks can land them an apartment without roommates.

Business Insider's analysis of donation data and conversations with donors on Wall Street shed light on this divide ahead of Thursday night's first general election debate.

Almost 80% of higher-earning, front-office workers, like investment bankers or hedge fund managers, donated to Cuomo and affiliated groups. The Mamdani camp won out among nearly every other job function, receiving direct donations from almost 90% of back-office donors like those in operations, human resources, tech, and research.

Take Jane Street, a highly secretive trading group. Sixteen of its employees donated to both candidates for a total just over $10,000. Only one — a trader — boosted Cuomo, writing a $5,000 check. The other fifteen, mostly software engineers, gave an average of just over $350 each to Mamdani.

When America thinks of Wall Street, it pictures investment bankers decked out in collared shirts and Patagonia vests. Many workers in the financial industry aren't cutting big deals — they're making under $200K. They donated $25 here and $110 there because they appreciate Mamdani's focus on cost of living. Even for those making six figures in finance, rents are high.

Wall Streeters showed up for Mamdani in slightly greater numbers, but with smaller checks.

Across more than 400 financial companies, 397 workers donated directly to Cuomo's campaign versus 401 to Mamdani's. Cuomo's donors had deeper pockets, giving 88% of the total dollars donated, with an average donation per employee of $1,006, compared to Mamdani's $131.

When factoring in PAC spending, the pro-Cuomo and anti-Mamdani dollar disparity is even larger: 95% of the more than $9 million the industry donated went to support Cuomo, who has his own affordability plan but has also stressed crime and subway safety during his campaign.

Mamdani got less than 5% the donations that came from managers and investment professionals, compared to two thirds of donations given by all other roles. Tech workers in finance were particularly supportive of Mamdani compared to other departments, giving him 88% of their donations.

The wealth gap between front and back office is relative. A hypothetical administrative assistant earning roughly $83,000 a year may be debating whether he can afford a big enough home for two kids, but he's not struggling to feed his family. But compared to an early-career investment banker earning nearly $300,000 and on a trajectory toward $1.25 million when they become a managing director, there is a large financial gulf. The assistant's salary would go far in other cities, but in New York, back-office support workers told Business Insider tha their relative positions mean they relate more to Mamdani's middle-class base than to their bosses.

They told us that's not about political parties — he is the Democratic nominee, and Cuomo, a Democrat, is running as an independent — it's all about cost of living.

""The emphasis on affordability was especially appealing to me,"" said one donor, a lifelong New Yorker who once worked in a non-investment role on Wall Street and canvassed for Mamdani.

""Even as someone working in finance, rent is crazy,"" said this donor, adding that she's seen coworkers and neighbors increasingly priced out and pushed to the suburbs.

Mamdani has run on promises to freeze prices of rent-stabilized apartments, make city buses free, and provide free childcare for all New Yorkers. He proposes paying for this by increasing taxes on residents who make more than $1 million a year and raising the corporate tax rate statewide by 4.25% — which would require state approval. Wall Street bosses have warned that electing him would drive companies to leave the world's financial capital.

""I'm supporting Zohran because I want a mayor who prioritizes the needs of the working and middle class,"" a creative worker at a Wall Street firm said. ""Those have always been my priorities as well. Working on Wall Street doesn't change that at all.""

We looked at firms that invest, manage, or transfer financial assets and those that create the infrastructure needed to make this possible. This includes hedge funds, like Citadel, whose CEO Ken Griffin wrote a $50,000 check to an anti-Mamdani PAC, or Third Point, whose CEO Dan Loeb donated more than $350,000 to Cuomo and related PACs. Loeb tweeted after Mamdani's primary win that it's ""officially hot commie summer.""

Billionaire hedge fund investor Bill Ackman on Wednesday gave $1 million to an anti-Mamdani PAC, following $500,000 in donations earlier this year to pro-Cuomo PACs. Ackman wrote on X in September that Mamdani has ""no experience, none, in managing a business, let alone the most consequential and largest city in our country."" Cuomo, ""is an experienced leader that cares deeply about our city who has the relevant experience and skills necessary to lead and greatly improve NYC,"" he added.

We also looked at investment banks, including JPMorgan Chase, whose chief Jamie Dimon said that Mamdani was a ""Marxist"" at an event earlier this summer, before saying on Tuesday he would help Mamdani if he were elected, and payments firms like the large credit card companies. It also includes real estate investors, like Stephen Ross, chairman of Hudson Yards developer Related Companies, who gave $50,000 to a pro-Cuomo PAC. Real estate brokers and services firms were excluded from the analysis.

Looking at firms' donations themselves rather than their employees, 23 financial companies contributed more than $2 million to pro-Cuomo and anti-Mamdani PACs, and none to Mamdani.

Paul Ryan, a 60-year-old retired investment banker and hedge fund executive who made waves as part of a small but vocal cohort of bankers who backed Bernie Sanders in 2016, described the divide in colorful terms.

""Older guys that have houses in Greenwich are still going to want to keep their houses in Greenwich, so they're not willing to go put their balls on the line. But younger people do; they have 40 more years of living, and are you going to live it in a Trump-dominated world?""

There were some outliers among Wall Street's high rollers. For example, two wealth advisors at Merrill Lynch, the private wealth arm of Bank of America, donated a total of $7,000 to pro-Mamdani PACs, and two of the three brothers who founded budgeting app Rocket Money gave a total of $189,000 to a pro-Mamdani PAC.

The donors we spoke to said they don't talk politics at work very much and are left to pick up on hints of their coworkers' affiliations.

Those who support Mamdani said they assume they're in the minority. They're far from alone in the city, though: A Quinnipiac University poll conducted from October 3 to 7 of 1,015 likely New York City voters found that Mamdani held a 46-33% lead over Cuomo.

""I think it's always been kind of a fiction that where someone works is a key factor in how they vote, or what party they support, or what political candidates they support,"" Morris Pearl, a former managing director of BlackRock and the chair of the Patriotic Millionaires, a group of wealthy individuals who advocate for changes to the US tax system, said.

Pearl sees folks falling into two categories: Those who may not want to pay more in taxes, and those who are ""more aware that living in a city filled with people who can't afford their basic needs is not going to be good for even the rich people either.""

Beyond politics, Anna Tavis, clinical professor and chair of the Human Capital Management Department at NYU's School of Professional Studies, said that Mamdani represents a different expectation of leadership, ""regardless of what his views are, but kind of more appealing as a person, very media savvy, connecting with the people.""

She added that many younger workers want their leaders to be more transparent and address the issues they care about, rather than protect the status quo.

""Both sides, interestingly, I think want to get to the right place,"" Tavis said. ""They want to be successful, they want their companies to succeed, et cetera, et cetera, but they believe in the different ways of accomplishing that.""

Abbianca Nassar's side hustle as a freelance ghost writer and brand strategist hasn't gotten particularly better or worse because of AI, but the buzzy tech has made it more complicated. Some of her clients are all in on it, going so far as to build their own ChatGPT tools for her to use. Others are so paranoid that someone might think they've used AI that they make her edit her work so that it's extra clear that it's human. Nassar is a fan of the em dash — unfortunately, so is ChatGPT, so clients haggle with her over it. ""They're like, 'Can you get rid of that? Can you just not use it?' I'm like, 'Mate, I've always used this,'"" Nassar, who lives in London, says.

Nassar is a journalist by trade, but turned her occasional freelance gigs into her main gig after being laid off last year. She's ambivalent about AI. She's hopeful a human touch will always be needed for the type of work she does; she's gotten good at writing prompts; and regardless, she doesn't feel like she has a choice. ""My biggest fear is not adapting and then being left behind,"" she says.

She's not alone. Unlike bigger companies, freelancers and small businesses can't really afford to make big, potentially money-losing bets on AI, but they can't bury their heads in the sand, either. They have to go where the wind blows, which these days means moving into a tech-forward, decidedly messy direction.

Talking to freelancers, entrepreneurs, and academics for this story, the general feeling I got was they think that while AI lowers the barrier to entry for small operators and can help them move faster and boost productivity, AI also drives down wages and stifles creativity and originality. Boasting about AI capabilities can be a powerful marketing tool, but contractors also feel pressured to do more for clients while getting the same pay. The end result: It's easier to get a foot in the door and harder to stand out.

The freelance economy is big. Bankrate estimates that one in four Americans has a side hustle. A report from Upwork, a freelance marketplace, found that skilled knowledge freelance workers made $1.5 trillion in 2024. Cody Luongo, a media consultant based in Charleston, South Carolina, recently joined the ranks of those freelance professionals after losing his job. AI is his ""constant companion,"" he says, whether drafting a press release or refining a pitch. He thinks it helps him close the experience gap with more established professionals and navigate scenarios he's never encountered. ""AI accelerates my work enough that I can do exponentially more for my clients with their allotted budgets,"" he says.

That's great for budget-conscious clients and, to some extent, for his own bottom line. What it means for his peers overall is a different story. While AI allows more side hustlers to enter the market, it can also make the endeavor less lucrative, thanks to competition from other freelancers and from AI itself, as clients consider a project and think, ""Eh, I bet the robots can do it.""

AI reduces hiring and pay for freelancers whose skills overlap with its capabilities, according to research by a group of professors out of Washington University. After ChatGPT's 2022 release, the number of jobs for writing-related freelancers on Upwork fell by 2% and monthly earnings fell by 5.2%. Freelancers who work in images — designers, editors, artists — saw their opportunities fall even more after DALL-E and Midjourney came out. Jobs fell by 3.7% and income by 9.4%. The fall-off was steeper for freelancers who produce higher-priced, better-executed work.

""The drop in earnings, if anything, is actually larger for high-quality freelancers in comparison with low-quality freelancers,"" says Xiang Hui, an assistant professor of marketing at Washington University and one of the academics behind the research. ""High quality doesn't really protect freelancers.""

Less-experienced freelancers are able to punch up their work with AI, flooding the marketplace with cheaper stuff that clients may find ""good enough."" There's still an obvious difference between ""good enough"" and truly great work, but the shrinking of the gap while the price difference remains the same means more experienced people lose part of their competitive edge.

""AI definitely lowers the barrier to entry, so it makes many activities accessible for more people,"" Hui says.

Nick Loper, who runs the website Side Hustle Nation —a community for part-time entrepreneurs and side hustlers— tells me he noticed someone on his site who has an AI headshot company. ""Well, shoot, that's my wife's side hustle, taking pictures of people,"" he says, but instead of charging $300-$400 for a half-hour session for human-taken headshots, the new entrant charges $29 and asks the client to ""upload a bunch of selfies that it spits back out"" as headshots. It may look a little weird — or unrealistically better, if the AI photo editor is extra kind — but people seeking out a deal might decide the price is worth the fake-ish product.

In terms of experience and expertise, AI is a two-sided coin. For this story, I spoke with one PR professional who says the technology has allowed her to expand into hosting events. She's able to use AI to draft invite copy, reminders, and panel questions and to create recaps, produce videos, and compile attendee lists after the fact. She charges more, too — instead of invoicing $200 an hour for three hours of work, $600 total, she charges $1,200 for the whole AI-enhanced shebang.

On the flipside, I heard from a marketer who complained that freelance platforms are now flooded with AI-generated job postings and applications. There's ""no sense in crafting a perfect pitch to a client"" these days because it will compete with AI pitches. I also heard from an Etsy witch who said she's ""drowning"" in an ocean of what's obviously AI competition — everything looks the same, with stereotypical images and suspiciously similar names. ""It's so frustrating knowing that these bots are preying on people who seek genuine spiritual guidance and receive something far from,"" she says. Whatever your beliefs, I imagine that if you're paying for a psychic, you'd rather it be the ""real"" thing than whatever ChatGPT is coming up with.

For many workers, whether freelance or full-time, AI has become an important tool in their work. Designers and coders can use it for organization, ideation, and client quotes. Canva, a graphic design platform, says its younger users, in particular, are reliant on AI for tasks such as brand design and data analysis. But someone letting on that they're leaning on AI may undercut how the work is perceived, fairly or not. Using AI is still considered taboo in many professional fields, particularly in creative ones.

When people believe work is produced with AI, they tend to reduce compensation for it, explains Shane Schweitzer, an assistant professor of management and organizational development at Northwestern University's D'Amore McKim School of Business. The quality of the work doesn't matter: People hold the same exact thing in less esteem when they think AI was involved in its creation. ""People just think they deserve less credit,"" Schweitzer says.

This is somewhat unfair — a product is a product, however it's made. But it's also understandable. While many workers and leaders position AI use as a productivity boost, others see it as a cheat and a sign of laziness. As much as the quality may sometimes be comparable, anyone who's used ChatGPT or other AI tools knows it can fall short. AI also relies on previously created material, which can homogenize output.

""AI can raise the baseline of creativity, but fewer people are having breakthroughs. You need breakthroughs for innovation,"" Schweitzer says. ""It's not leveling the playing field necessarily, it's just creating slightly more competence.""

One of the main arguments in favor of AI is that it handles mundane tasks and frees people up to do the more creative, interesting work. That's true of many side hustlers I spoke to, who used it for the boring tasks most everyone dreads. Lisa Driskil, who jokes the ""only thing that's not for sale is my husband"" in her eBay store, says AI saves her mounds of time in writing product descriptions and editing photos, especially given she has a full-time job. Ross Buhrdorf, the CEO of ZenBusiness, a business-in-a-box platform, recently launched an AI assistant, Velo, that supplements his services by helping people navigate issues such as taxes, regulations, and banking. For small business owners, ""the biggest demand is their time,"" he says. His company — now accompanied by AI — helps them figure out the logistics.

This may work for, say, a plumber or designer who is sick of invoicing. But if they're using AI to learn and hone their craft, that's an issue.

""It's being adopted so broadly that it's, at least eventually, going to prevent people from getting and using key skills,"" says Erin Hatton, a sociology professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo.

Creative work often emerges from iteration: The way you get better at the thing is by doing the hard work repeatedly — generating ideas, working through tweaks, taking feedback into consideration — not by slightly adjusting a robot's version of the thing. Moreover, a significant portion of the side hustle work AI is creating does not sound particularly enjoyable — checking the AI's homework is a tedious endeavor, and the technology makes errors.

Jinjin Qian, executive vice president of Strategic Finance at Fiverr, a freelance marketplace, says the demand side of their platform has changed significantly due to AI. Instead of hiring someone to build something from the ground up, clients use ChatGPT or other AI tools to write a blog post (or, in one case, a novel), make a video, or vibe code an app themselves, and then take it to a professional to get it across the finish line. She says the demand for simple, low-end jobs on the platform has plummeted.

On the client side, the equation is pretty straightforward: Getting an AI to do more of the work or shifting expectations in the name of AI saves money.

Guillermo Fernandes, a blockchain entrepreneur and consultant based in New York, tells me his since-sold compliance startup hired four coding interns in 2023. The next year, they hired only one; the rest they replaced with AI coding tools. It's not that they never hired freelancers again, but when they did, they were true ""experts,"" he says. Carey Bentley, the CEO of Lifehack Method, a productivity coaching company, is similarly eager to explain how she's been able to cut people thanks to AI. She recently got rid of the woman handling their email newsletters after determining her output wasn't up to par, especially once they added social media to her plate. ""Every contractor I'm hiring, I'm looking at what I'm paying them, and I'm thinking about how I'm going to get at least a 3X ROI on this person's time,"" she says. Anyone whose fields are going to be taken over by AI needs to hop to it on reskilling and ""get on the offense,"" she says.

Both Fernandes and Bentley are service providers themselves — the plot thickens when the shoe is on the other foot. Fernandes is now consulting for crypto and blockchain companies looking to lobby on Capitol Hill, and he works faster by using AI to analyze the difference between iterations of legislation. Bentley has her coaches record conversations with clients and then put them into AI to create personalized summary emails about what was discussed. They seem OK as productivity hacks, but they may diminish the perceived value of their services. Fernandes tells clients that AI tools are why he charges them less than what a regular consultant would. Bentley's clients are unaware that their personalized emails are generated by AI.

Many freelancers and side hustlers recognize that they and others are riding the tiger. They know it's dangerous — they just think it won't eat them.

Like people in creative fields that I spoke to, I sometimes use AI for my job — for this story, I asked it if my opening made sense — and for personal questions, such as whether my outfit is weather-appropriate. I can see the value in it in terms of productivity, but I also worry about what it means for the ability to generate quality, original work. AI certainly allows for more content and more output. But is it better? One person I spoke to for this story excitedly told me about how she's used ChatGPT to create and write a Substack. Based on our conversation it seemed less like she wanted someone to consume the content, and more for the content to exist as a calling card or line on her résumé. Perhaps the best case I hear for AI used in a side hustle comes from Kimberly Storin, the chief marketing officer at Zoom, who also happens to own a family business making customer furniture in Austin. They use it to put together quotes, find materials, and create rough designs, allowing them to submit proposals to clients faster than the competition. She's lost a couple of projects where the AI-generated estimate was probably higher than it should have been, but even that's valuable information for training the AI to get better. Plus, she can use Zoom's summaries of internal meetings at the shop when she has to focus on her day job.

AI opens doors for many side hustlers. It makes it easier to get moving and tackle the basics, clearing some of the more mundane administrative tasks out of the way. But it's not the fix that its proponents often cast it to be. Researchers looking at the broad swath of the tech's capabilities and creative freelancers who are in the trenches seeing AI outputs on a daily basis told me that while lifts everything to a 6/10, it greatly reduces the chance of a 9/10 or 10/10, raising the floor but lowering the ceiling. It turns the goal in many projects from ""great"" to ""I guess that'll do.""

Welcome to the Jefferson-Washington-Lincoln Elementary School in Anytown, USA. Our hypothetical public school is like thousands of others throughout the US: full of teachers passionate about their jobs and kids from different backgrounds with diverse academic needs.

Take Isabel, for whom English is a second language. She relies on the bilingual instruction in her classroom. Or Jack, who needs a little extra help understanding math and reading, and the one-on-one instruction he gets is helping him keep up. Or Sarah, whose parents work late and trust the after-school program to provide her a safe place to stay until they're off the job. And all three of them are taught by Ms. Smith, who relies on a federal student-loan forgiveness program for teachers and nonprofit workers like herself.

Whether these theoretical people — and millions of real children and teachers across America — continue to benefit from those programs in the future is up in the air. During his campaign, President Donald Trump promised to eliminate the Education Department. While the president can't get rid of the agency without Congress, the Supreme Court in July gave him the green light to forge ahead with his plan to reshape the agency in the meantime, including firing half its staff. In October, the agency terminated another 466 employees during the government shutdown, with the union representing the department saying that offices, including special education and civil rights, were hit. All year, the Trump administration has been gutting the department; in February, the administration cut millions of dollars in research contracts, putting at risk crucial data collection that teachers and education leaders say helps them better understand how students are performing in core subjects.

Education policy experts, teachers, state officials, and former US education secretaries I spoke with for this story said that while there's plenty of room to improve the Education Department's efficiency, cutting or outright eliminating the agency would have dire effects on American education. It would mean fewer resources for low-income students and those with disabilities, a lack of data collection on student outcomes, and risks to federal grants that millions of students rely on to go to college.

""If students with disabilities and low-income students do not get the services and support they need and do not get access to educational opportunity, that undermines the health of our economy and our national security,"" says John King Jr., who was the education secretary for former President Barack Obama and is the chancellor of the State University of New York. He added that America's higher education system is ""the envy of the world,"" and dismantling the department that funds this system puts the US at risk of losing its innovation edge. ""It's bad for everybody.""

Meanwhile, teachers, students, parents, and administrators are stuck waiting for the next shoe to drop. Eric Sosa, a high school history teacher in Austin, said that it's the nature of the teaching profession to have to ""beg, borrow, and steal to get what you need."" But with federal funding now on the line, he and his colleagues are constantly wondering which program, or job, will be next on the chopping block.

It's a dilemma that Heather Stambaugh, a high school social studies teacher in rural Ohio, is all too familiar with: she tells me her district relies on federal funds to support programs for low-income families, and she's worried that if Trump continues his plans to dismantle the Education Department, the checks will stop coming.

""It feels a bit like we're being thrown into a chaos loop,"" Stambaugh says.

Since its founding in 1979, the Education Department has played a critical role in the lives of individual students. Trump has suggested outsourcing the department's responsibilities to other federal agencies, but some experts say that other agencies — already tasked with many of their own responsibilities — are not equipped to manage the Education Department's vast funding and student aid network. Splitting up the functions could put the programs that millions of students rely on at risk, they say.

One of them, Title I, has provided grants for low-income school districts since 1965. Title I funds after-school and summer programs, teacher professional development, academic intervention for struggling students, tutoring, and more. The Education Department allocated more than $18 billion in Title I funds in fiscal year 2024. Trump wants to maintain that budget for fiscal years 2025 and 2026, which falls below the funding amounts Democrats have pushed for and Biden's 2025 budget request, which called for $18.6 billion.

Linda McMahon, Trump's education secretary, said that Title I funding would be immune from any department cuts, but there has already been budget chaos. In June, the department withheld nearly $7 billion in federal funding for schools due to claims that some programs did not align with the administration's political agenda, including migrant education that was supported by $375 million in Title I funds. The funds were released a month later, but it doesn't mean schools will be able to bounce right back, Halley Potter, the director of PK-12 education at The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank, says. Some school districts were already preparing to shut down programs and fire staff in anticipation of not receiving funding, she says, and even with the release of funds, staff can't be rehired on a dime. For example, public school systems in Alaska, California, and Washington reported laying off staff because of the funding holdups.

""I think a lot of places are going to be as nimble as they can be, but you can't open an after-school program at the beginning of August with a week's notice necessarily,"" Potter says. Sosa said that in July, his district already saw ""a small reduction in staffing,"" including teachers who helped kids catch up on math and reading.

The Trump administration also said it would place guardrails to ensure public schools are using the funds in ways that don't violate executive orders, including orders designed to discourage ""woke"" or diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. This means that although the funding has been released, it could be withdrawn. Potter says this uncertainty could cause schools to make some tough decisions about their budget. For instance, a district could cover the pay for a teacher who focuses on teaching English as a second language ""by shifting things around in the budget and stealing from some of the funding that's supposed to cover next year's summer programs,"" Potter tells me. ""So maybe they're able to keep going for now, but they're borrowing against the future and against the other programs that they need."" The department announced on September 15 that it was repurposing funding from programs that it determined ""are not in the best interest of students and families"" toward American history programs and HBCUs. In response, a trio of Democratic senators said the move puts funding meant to train teachers at risk.

Kira Severson, a first-grade teacher at a Title I school in Phoenix, said she and her students have been directly affected by funding uncertainty. The state's booming school voucher movement — which has been supported by Trump — has eaten into public school funds, and Severson said it's led to ""significantly less"" school supplies this year. She also doesn't know if her school will have the budget for after-school programs in the coming year.

""That was a form of my income over the summer,"" she said. She added that ""for a lot of these kids, school is the only safe place for them and the only place where they can get a free meal.""

""It's very concerning that the funding could go away and those kids could lose that,"" Severson said.

Another one of our hypothetical students at Jefferson-Washington-Lincoln Elementary, Jack, is struggling with his math and reading. Along with his yearly state assessments, he's in a district that was selected to take a nationwide test — commonly known as the Nation's Report Card — that compares achievement across all states, helping policymakers and teachers determine necessary interventions at the local and federal levels, so students like Jack have the best tools to help them keep up.

Without the Education Department's research arm, tracking Jack's progress in math and reading will become a lot more difficult. That makes the department's $900 million cut to research contracts ""at the top of my list of things to worry about,"" says Margaret Spellings, the education secretary for former President George W. Bush. Spellings tells me that without the grants, it's unclear how states and districts will get the data they need to best help their students succeed.

""It provides a lot of data and transparency and accountability that guide policymakers at the federal and state, and local levels about how we're doing,"" Spellings says. ""It shows us who's doing well and who's not doing well.""

In April, the National Assessment Governing Board voted to cut some assessments over the next decade with the intent to save money, including the state-level math and reading tests for 12th graders and performance tracking in urban school districts. Specifically, the cuts mean that fourth graders, who were supposed to take a science assessment in 2028 and 2032, won't be taking that first test, and the writing test for fourth, eighth, and 12th graders in 2032 was canceled altogether, stripping school districts of those results.

Potter says the potential loss of valuable information has already created ""a lot of instability"" across public schools that have historically used that data to assess progress over time. She adds that some magnet schools use the data to apply for and receive federal grants, and it's unclear whether that grant process will continue after the cuts.

Ongoing cuts can directly harm students like Jack. The Institute of Education Sciences, the nonpartisan research arm of the Education Department, uses classrooms across the country as data points in its research. For example, it might provide technology to classrooms and assess how students are learning using that technology to determine whether it helps them progress. Cuts to that research mean Jack may no longer be able to use the computer system that was helping him advance in math.

Severson said the uncertainty makes her feel ""helpless.""

""I'm in a spot where my hands are tied, and I just wish there was more I could do for my students,"" she says. ""And I feel like I can't, with what's going on, I feel like I can't protect them.""

McMahon wrote in congressional testimony that she ""began this year by canceling and renegotiating a number of contracts, and we are now redirecting those resources toward a leaner operation that will provide useful data and tools for teachers, education experts, and school administrators."" Despite the assurances, the department hasn't indicated plans to outsource data collection to another agency, and it's unclear whether it plans to bolster those efforts down the road.

During a conversation hosted by The Federalist Society on September 17, McMahon said that she is ""winding down"" the department's activities in an effort to give more power to the states.

""What we're trying to do is to show how we can move different parts of the Department of Education to show that they can be more efficiently operating in other agencies,"" McMahon said.

Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications at the department, said in a statement that the department looks ""forward to identifying additional strategies to make education programs more efficient and effective for students, families, and taxpayers.""

K-12 funding is just one bucket that the department facilitates — it's also responsible for trillions of dollars flowing through the country's higher education system. Proposed changes or cuts to the vast student-loan repayment system put our hypothetical teacher, Ms. Smith, at risk of higher monthly payments, with loan forgiveness on the line.

Carolyn Fast, The Century Foundation's director of higher education policy, says staffing cuts at the agency and the fallout from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed into law in July, will complicate the already complex student-loan system. The OBBB eliminated existing income-driven repayment plans and replaced them with two less generous options, meaning borrowers will face a harder time achieving debt relief. On top of that, staffing cuts at the Education Department mean borrowers seeking help with repayment or with their servicers are likelier to see their phone calls go unanswered.

""The dismantling of the department will have the most immediate and soonest effect on people's day-to-day lives,"" Fast tells me. ""The way that'll show up is just a lot of people who are frustrated and unable to get help with problems that they're having with their loan repayment, or potentially with their financial aid to go to school.""

Trump's spending law also places new borrowing caps for graduate and professional students, which will cut some borrowers off from pursuing a medical or law degree — or push them toward the riskier private student-loan market.

In a district that's already short on money, Stambaugh says that should federal funds stop flowing, her school won't be able to pick up the slack, and students will suffer.

""It's potentially very, very devastating and starts to feel very much like we're under attack for just trying to do something that makes the world a better place, makes kids' lives better,"" she says.

The Education Department is not flawless. Beth Akers, a senior fellow at the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute, says there is room for ""some significant reform"" of the agency's practices but that the Trump administration may be taking its push too far.

""I think it comes back to this philosophy that this administration seems to be holding, which is that yes, we see that there's these problems. We see there's significant need for reform. We've also seen previous administrations fail to make the sort of normal-looking reforms that people would expect. So we're going to blow it up and rebuild,"" Akers tells me. But this aggressive approach, abruptly firing staff and cutting funding, probably isn't the way she would go about it.

Kevin Huffman, a former commissioner for Tennessee's education department who worked for a Republican governor, says that while he's ""sympathetic to the idea that we want less bureaucracy,"" that's not a reason to ax the federal agency. Eliminating the Education Department, he says, would run counter to Trump's goal of reducing waste and boosting efficiency. Trump's plan involves redirecting the department's responsibilities to other agencies, but having a centralized department to track and distribute funds to schools, colleges, and education researchers makes it less likely that the cash goes to waste or that efforts are duplicated.

Additionally, it's not clear how the Education Department's responsibilities would be split up. Trump has suggested that the federal student-loan portfolio would be transferred to the Small Business Administration, and special-needs programs would be handed over to the Department of Health and Human Services. Recent court documents disclosed that the department was already looking into transferring some financial aid responsibilities to the Treasury Department. Jonathan Zimmerman, a professor of education history at the University of Pennsylvania, says the uncertainty means there's the risk that students who rely on funding from the department ""will get lost in the shuffle, and that the parts of the Education Department that are devoted to them won't actually be replaced elsewhere.""

And from a state education chief's perspective, regardless of political affiliation, Huffman says spreading out the Education Department's responsibilities would just make things a lot more complicated.

""I could call the people I knew at the US Department of Education and get answers and figure out what we were supposed to be doing,"" Huffman says. ""The idea of having to do that across three or four separate agencies with different processes sounds daunting, bureaucratic, and not particularly efficient.""

Potter says the funding whiplash and the gutting of the Education Department mean a rocky road ahead for students and schools.

""This is going to be a really challenging school year, and I think districts, in terms of what they're trying to figure out in terms of staffing and budgeting and how they make up for lost funds, is pretty unprecedented,"" Potter says.

Stambaugh just wants clarity on what the Trump administration actually plans to do so she and other teachers can best prepare to help their students.

""We all might actually be kind of in that flight, fight, or freeze,"" she says. ""I think we're all kind of frozen, waiting to see what's going to happen.""

President Donald Trump said that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin began a ""lengthy"" phone call Thursday morning.

The call comes a day before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House, as Kyiv seeks more U.S. support in its war against Russia.

""I am speaking to President Putin now,"" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post at 11:21 a.m. ET.

""The conversation is ongoing, a lengthy one, and I will report the contents, as will President Putin, at its conclusion. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""

Trump this week said that he is considering sending Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine to ratchet up pressure on Russia to end the war.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

As the U.S.-China rare earth dispute reignites fears of a trade war, tariffs are back in the spotlight for both investors and policymakers. Stocks have oscillated in recent days as traders make bets on whether President Donald Trump will back off his threats — following the ""TACO"" playbook, as some have called it.

Here are the latest updates:

A federal judge yesterday blocked Trump from firing federal workers during the government shutdown — at least for now. San Francisco U.S. District Court Judge Susan Yvonne Illston's temporary restraining order blocks the White House from taking any action to follow through with the layoffs and from firing other federal employees protected by the unions that filed the lawsuit.

The ruling comes days after the Trump administration began sending out reduction-in-force notifications to more than 4,000 federal employees. Russell Vought, the White House's budget director, said yesterday that he expects more than 10,000 total cuts.

There's still no end in sight for the shutdown, which is now on its 16th day. The Senate yesterday rejected stopgap funding bills for a ninth time.

United Airlines beat Wall Street's earnings expectations yesterday, but the carrier's stock slid in extended trading as investors focused on its weaker-than-expected revenue. United, which had a bumpy ride to start the year, forecast higher-than-expected earnings for the current quarter.

We're also keeping an eye on Hewlett Packard Enterprise, whose shares tumbled more than 9% in today's premarket after the company gave a weak outlook for its 2026 fiscal year. On the other hand, Salesforce gained more than 5% on the heels of its upbeat forecast for 2030.

Apple unveiled new MacBook Pro, iPad Pro and Vision Pro models yesterday, the latest releases after it revealed its new iPhone 17 and watch models last month. The new products all feature Apple's updated M5 chip, which the company says has four times the peak compute performance of its predecessor.

On the software front, artificial intelligence startup Anthropic launched a smaller and cheaper AI model for all users, named Claude Haiku 4.5. Its competitor OpenAI, meanwhile, is facing criticism for its decision to allow content such as erotica on ChatGPT. CEO Sam Altman defended the move, saying yesterday that OpenAI is ""not the elected moral police of the world.""

Legacy automakers are sounding the alarm on the electric vehicle business, but Tesla is staying largely quiet.

While Tesla is the clear leader in the U.S. EV market, the company has given up market share amid rising competition and sliding brand value, CNBC's Lora Kolodny reports. The broader EV industry is also no longer benefitting from now-expired $7,500 tax credits that helped rev up consumer interest.

With its quarterly earnings report due in next week, Wall Street is eager to see if Tesla — or its famously opinionated CEO Elon Musk — will report similar challenges as its competitors.

With what feels like a new billion-dollar tech deal every day, it's hard to keep track of who's paying who for what. Here's the $1 trillion web of artificial intelligence deals, visualized.

In this article

On Tuesday, Microsoft stopped supporting Windows 10, the operating system it introduced 10 years earlier. 

The software company is enticing people to upgrade their PCs with a slate of artificial intelligence features it will test in Windows 11, the successor to Windows 10.

Those who participate in both the Windows Insider Program and the Copilot Labs group for trying AI experiments will gain access to an updated Copilot assistant app in Windows 11 that can use desktop and web applications to complete certain tasks, such as resizing photos, with locally stored files.

Or perhaps a person could tell Copilot to put all available Brian Eno songs into a Spotify playlist and have the assistant push play, Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft's consumer marketing chief, told reporters in a briefing.

Anthropic, Google and OpenAI have all developed AI models known as computer-use agents that accept people's directives to perform actions in multiple steps that involve typing and clicking. 

Microsoft has brought this technology to corporate workers who build AI agents, and consumers with premium subscriptions can try a computer-use agent called Copilot Actions. Now the software company is planning a variant for Windows 11.

Copilot Actions will be turned off by default. If enabled, it will operate in a contained environment with its own desktop, Microsoft said. People can watch the software working step by step and take over at any point, although they're free to navigate away and do other things on their PCs as the work happens in the background.

""You may see the agent make mistakes or encounter challenges with complex interfaces, which is why real-world testing of this experience is so critical to help us apply learnings to make this experience more capable and streamlined,"" Mehdi wrote in a blog post.

It's the sort of thing that might help Microsoft get the attention of people who today own Apple's Mac computers or Chromebooks that run Google's Chrome OS. In the second quarter, Microsoft generated $4.3 billion in Windows and devices revenue, up just 2.5% from last year.

Windows 11 became available in 2021, bringing the Start button and app icons to the center of the taskbar on the bottom of the screen, instead of the traditional left side. In July, the new operating system became more popular than Windows 10 for the first time, according to data from web analytics software maker Statcounter. Microsoft controlled 72% of operating system market share in September, the data showed.

Microsoft wants to proceed carefully as it rolls out Copilot Actions. During the preview, the feature will only work with common folders such as desktop, documents, downloads or pictures, and people will have to approve the use of data elsewhere on their computers.

Those enrolled in the Windows Insider Program will be first to test an action in the Windows 11 File Explorer that draws on technology from Singaporean startup Manus. People can right-click on a file and click the ""Create website with Manus"" option.

Windows Insiders will also gain the ability to ask Copilot to analyze what's onscreen through chat messages. Until now, people could only engage with this Copilot Vision feature by talking aloud.

Finally, Microsoft intends to provide a redesigned shortcut to Copilot directly to the right of the Start button. The new widget will include buttons that activate Copilot Vision or spoken AI conversations with one click. Alternatively, people can summon the assistant by saying, ""Hey Copilot.""

WATCH: AI PCs will become mainstream in the next two years, says ASUS Co-CEO

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

In this article

Paxos, the blockchain partner of PayPal, mistakenly minted $300 trillion worth of the online payment giant's stablecoin on Wednesday in what the company called a ""technical error."" 

Market watchers had spotted the enormous injection of the PayPal PYUSD stablecoin on Etherscan — a block explorer and analytics platform for the Ethereum blockchain.

Paxos had mistakenly minted the stablecoins as part of an internal transfer, before it ""immediately identified the error and burned the excess PYUSD,"" the company said in a social media statement. 

""This was an internal technical error. There is no security breach. Customer funds are safe. We have addressed the root cause,"" it added. PayPal didn't respond to an inquiry from CNBC outside of regular business hours.

Transactions on Etherscan showed that the mistake had been fixed after about 20 minutes. 

PYUSD is advertised as a dollar-pegged stablecoin that is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, U.S. treasuries and similar cash equivalents. Therefore, PayPal says the tokens are always redeemable for U.S. dollars on a 1:1 basis. 

However, the technical error highlights that the dollar peg is guaranteed by PayPal and its independent third-party attestation reports, rather than intrinsically tied to the minting of a stablecoin. 

There aren't enough dollars in global circulation to back $300 trillion PYUSD, which would theoretically require more than double the world's estimated total GDP. 

Paxos' error comes at a time when stablecoins are becoming more mainstream as its adopted by an increasing number of banks and payment platforms. 

PYUSD is currently the sixth-largest stablecoin in the world with a market capitalization of over $2.6 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Upgrade, the online lender started by LendingClub founder Renaud Laplanche, has raised a new round of funding that values the startup at $7.3 billion.

The company said in a press release on Thursday that it raised $165 million in a round led by Neuberger Berman, with participation from LuminArx Capital Management. Laplanche, who created Upgrade in 2016, said it's the first time the company has raised money since 2021. 

""We've been cash flow positive over the past three years, so we didn't have to do a new round,"" Laplanche said in an interview. 

Upgrade got its start offering relatively small personal loans, operating in a similar market as LendingClub. The company has since expanded deeper into financial services with checking and savings accounts, a credit card, credit health monitoring and a buy now, pay later offering. In 2023, Upgrade acquired BNPL travel company Uplift for $100 million.

Revenue has more than doubled since the company's last fundraise, Laplanche said, and annualized revenue passed $1 billion in May.

Laplanche, who took LendingClub public in 2014, said Upgrade is looking to IPO but wanted additional capital for its balance sheet in the meantime. He said the company is also establishing a new valuation as it begins to offer employee liquidity. 

""We were probably 12 to 18 months away from an IPO at this stage,"" he said. ""So we wanted to go ahead and make sure everyone could sell a little bit of stock now without having to wait for the IPO.""

Although consumer lending is still dominated by traditional banks like JPMorgan Chase, Laplanche said the majority of Upgrade's customers are migrating from the legacy banks to take advantage of more automated and faster services.

""This year, we're focusing mostly on making the customer experience make sense across multiple products and making sure that the customer who might have joined Upgrade through a BNPL product has a very seamless experience,"" Laplanche said.

The company has also been focusing on home improvement and auto financing, areas that surpassed $2 billion and $1 billion, respectively, in total loan originations earlier this year.

Competition is rising across the board. 

Chime, which offers an array of online banking services, went public in June. SoFi has been gaining popularity. And fintech companies including PayPal and Square parent Block have been adding more banking services to their portfolios. 

Within BNPL, there's Affirm and Klarna, which held its IPO last month. 

Laplanche said Upgrade's focus in BNPL has been in the travel industry, through relationships with airlines, cruise lines, car rental companies and hotels. 

""It's a pretty specific industry that's different from retail, where Klarna and Affirm are stronger,"" he said.

In this article

Nestle said Thursday it will cut 16,000 jobs as the firm's new CEO, Philipp Navratil, looks to accelerate a turnaround at the consumer goods giant.

In a bid to improve operational efficiency, the firm said it will cut 12,000 white-collar jobs and a further 4,000 roles will be reduced over the next two years.

""We are transforming how we work,"" Navratil wrote in a LinkedIn post summarizing the company's earnings report. ""We are evolving and will simplify our organization and automate our processes.""

It's unclear how Nestle plans to incorporate more automation into its corporate offices, but company spokesperson Chiara Valsangiacomo told CNBC that the initiative is ""much broader"" than replacing roles with artificial intelligence. Other companies, primarily in the tech sector, have slashed jobs as they turn to AI to replace human labor. So far this year, more than 17,000 job losses have been specifically tied to AI, according to a recent report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

Shares of Nestle closed 9.3% higher on Thursday. The stock price jump boosted Europe's food and beverage sector, which was up more than 4.2% at the end of the session.

Under its former CEO, Laurent Freixe, Nestle had already announced a cost-savings program worth 2.5 billion Swiss francs ($3.14 billion). This has now been accelerated to 3 billion francs by the end of 2027. 

The company posted a better-than-expected organic growth rate of 4.3% in the third quarter as it battles an uncertain consumer outlook amid U.S. tariffs and an increase in raw material prices, such as cocoa and coffee beans. 

Notably, real internal growth, or RIG, returned to positive territory in the third quarter — up 1.5% — as the maker of Nespresso and KitKat saw growth investments pay off, also helped by easier comparisons. 

A miss on RIG in the second quarter had led to a sharp underperformance of Nestle shares. Ahead of the results, analysts at HSBC had already expected RIG to return to positive territory ""owing to easier comparatives, incrementally greater benefits from Nestle's own actions plus reduced elasticity effects from price increases.""

However, the company's business in Greater China continued to underperform, with the region negatively impacting organic growth by 80 basis points and RIG by 40 basis points. Nestle added that ""new management was now in place and it was executing its plan to transform the business."" 

The firm's strategy of focusing on winners and turning around its losers helped driver better-than-expected third-quarter sales, said Jon Cox, head of European consumer equities, at Kepler Cheuvreux.

""Overall, it is extremely positive and certainly looks operationally as if the company has turned the corner with the better performance while the management upheaval over the summer fades into the background,"" Cox said, adding he expects the stock to react very positively.

The Vevey, Switzerland-based consumer goods giant has come under pressure from investors as its operating and share performance have trailed peers.

Its shares are off more than 40% from their December 2021 peak, and have fallen 9% over the past 12 months. 

Nestle has endured a turbulent year, as it saw its CEO Freixe ousted over an undisclosed romantic relationship on Sept. 1. 

His successor, Navratil is the former CEO of the company's Nespresso business. He has pledged to ""fully embrace the company's strategic direction, as well as the action plan in place to drive Nestle's performance,"" and vowed to ""accelerate execution and to drive the value creation plan with intensity."" 

Only two weeks later, Nestle saw itself forced to accelerate Chairman Paul Bulcke's departure, owing to pressure from institutional shareholders over his handling of Freixe's allegations. 

Bulcke, also a former CEO of Nestle, stepped down from his role earlier than planned, handing over the reins to Vice Chairman and Chairman-elect Pablo Isla, a former Inditex CEO, who was set to take over after Nestle's AGM in April 2026. 

Analysts say the new leadership duo will need to earn back trust from investors. 

""Many long term investors … would have to hear more from someone who is relatively unknown to the market before becoming more positive,"" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a September note.

While the initial focus will be on recovery in volume growth and its Chinese business, longer-term investors will be keen to receive updates on the partial sale of Nestle's struggling water unit as well as its underperforming vitamins business, along with plans for its 20% stake in L'Oreal. 

""Now we must do more and move faster to accelerate our growth momentum,"" Navratil said Thursday in a statement on the company's earnings. 

""As Nestle moves forward, we will be rigorous in our approach to resource allocation, prioritising the opportunities and businesses with the highest potential return.""

— CNBC's Amelia Lucas contributed reporting for this story.

Correction: Jon Cox is head of European consumer equities at Kepler Cheuvreux. An earlier version misspelled the name of the firm.

In this article

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. on Thursday reported a 39.1% increase in third-quarter profit from last year, beating estimates and hitting a fresh record as demand for artificial intelligence chips stayed strong.

Here are the company's results versus LSEG SmartEstimates:

TSMC's revenue in the September quarter rose 30.3% from a year ago to NT$989.92 billion, also beating estimates. Net income increased 13.7% from last quarter, which had marked a record high at the time.

As Asia's largest technology company by market capitalization, TSMC has benefited from the artificial intelligence boom, producing advanced AI processors for clients such as Nvidia and Apple.

""Recent developments in AI market continue to be very positive,"" TSMC CEO C.C. Wei said on an earnings call, adding that increasing adoption of AI models by consumers has led to more demand for compute, and by extension, semiconductor products. ""Thus, our conviction in the AI megatrend is strengthening,"" he added.

Bolstered by this AI strength, Wei said the company had raised its 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range. In July, the company had expected full-year revenue growth of about 30%.

TSMC also increased its expected floor for capacity expansion and upgrades to $40 billion for the full year, up from a previous floor of $38 billion.

TSMC's high-performance computing division, which encompasses artificial intelligence and 5G applications, made up the majority of sales in the July-September quarter, accounting for 57% of revenue.

TSMC said advanced chips, with sizes 7-nanometer or smaller, accounted for 74% of TSMC's total wafer revenue in the quarter. 

In semiconductor technology, smaller nanometer sizes signify more compact transistor designs, which lead to greater processing power and efficiency. 

Growth in TSMC's most advanced chips particularly drove revenue gains in the third quarter, according to Counterpoint Research senior analyst William Li.

""TSMC's robust earnings are a direct reflection of the strong traction at 3nm as well as high utilization at 4/5nm – both of which are being driven by ongoing orders from AI GPU and HPC customers and premium smartphone platforms,"" Li told CNBC in a statement. 

TSMC executives also said Thursday that they were monitoring U.S. tariff developments as Taiwan negotiates for a lower ""reciprocal"" rate and Washington weighs industry-specific duties on semiconductors. However, TSMC is likely to receive some exemptions. 

""We understand there are uncertainties and risks from the potential impact of tariff policies, especially in consumer-related and price-sensitive market segments,"" Wei said, adding that the company would continue to monitor and plan for any impact. 

TSMC has been investing heavily in facilities in the U.S. — spending that could help reduce its exposure to tariff impacts.

Shares of TSMC in Taiwan have risen more than 38% so far this year.

Top European Central Bank board members said that the easing cycle is close to or at its end, in multiple exclusive interviews with CNBC.

Martin Kocher, European Central Bank Governing Council member and governor at Austrian National Bank, said that as long as nothing ""drastic"" happens, Europe is ""OK.""

Speaking to CNBC's Karen Tso at the IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington on Wednesday, Kocher said: ""At the moment, I think we're in a good place. So, there's no reason to change anything, as long as there are no changes that force us to do something. And if you take the larger picture, yes, the easing cycle is close to an end or at its end, but there's no reason to pre-commit at that stage.""

Due to high uncertainty that makes following guidance difficult, Kocher favors a meeting-by-meeting approach to decision-making, he said, otherwise central banks may commit to ""something that you cannot deliver on.""

On inflation, Kocher said that expectations are ""well anchored"" and there are no reasons to above-target rates.

Indeed, European Central Bank Governing Council member Joachim Nagel said that while inflation will remain sticky, the current path for interest rates remains clear.

The Deutsche Bundesbank president said: ""I do not see any reason to change anything if there is not something new coming, and I do not see where it might come from.""

In an exclusive interview, Nagel said global tariff tensions had created a ""lose-lose situation for everyone,"" but he cited the recent strength of the German economy in particular for providing optimism in Europe.

German economic institutes have recently revised up their growth forecasts for 2025, while Goldman Sachs predicts the economy will continue to expand 1.4% in 2026 and 1.8% in 2027.

The ECB's Kocher added that the impact of tariffs has not yet been seen in data, but they make trickle down over time. If Chinese trade is rerouted to Europe, it could affect inflation expectations, he said. However, the U.S. and European trade deal ""creates some certainty about the future,"" the Austrian central bank chief said.

There could be some upside with better-than-expected growth, Kocher said, if the savings rate translates into consumption. However, up- and downside risks ""are pretty much balanced"" right now.

Nagel flagged private credit as an area of concern, saying the size of the market and ""spillover from less regulated market participants"" was something regulators would need to monitor closely.

In separate exclusive interview, ECB Governing Council member François Villeroy de Galhau said he recommended ""agile pragmatism"" when it comes to the path for interest rates, adding: ""We are in a good position ... but a good position is not a fixed position.""

Diverging from the views of his ECB colleague Nagel, France's central bank chief suggested that the next rate move was more likely to be a rate cut than a rate hike.

This comes as he welcomed some political clarity in France, as newly reinstated Prime Minsiter Sébastien Lecornu suspended the controversial pension plan that has sat at the heart of France's political deadlock. Villeroy said that lawmakers now need to tackle the fiscal uncertainty.

However, Pierre Wunsch, governor of the National Bank of Belgium, said in a separate exclusive interview that the probability the central bank would cut again has been ""receding over the last few weeks or months,"" in part due to the strength of the euro.

""Service inflation is still at 3%, so that's something we need to monitor. Goods, energy, and non-energy industrial goods are close to zero or 1%, so that pulls inflation downwards,"" he said, noting that inflation in 2026 is expected to be lower.

Meanwhile, Kocher pointed back to the Mario Draghi and Enrico Letta reports as a ""blueprint"" for European competitiveness and noted the importance of reforming the continent's capital market. It is still fragmented, and ""not used enough,"" he said.

""We still have an outflow of capital from the European Union to other parts of the world, and there is too little investment, especially for what we need in terms of energy transition and infrastructure,"" Kocher added.

Investors have reacted positively to this week's political developments.

Hong Kong-listed shares of Nio plunged nearly 9% after Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC sued the Chinese electric vehicle maker for allegedly violating securities laws by inflating its revenues.

The lawsuit named Nio's CEO Li Bin and former Financial Officer Feng Wei as defendants, according to a court document filed in August in the Southern District of New York court.

The complaint alleged that Nio unlawfully recognized over $600 million of leased battery revenue from ""a superficially independent"" battery asset firm Weineng, which Nio controlled, but it did not disclose its interest in the firm.

Nio ""issued materially false and misleading statements and omissions that misrepresented NIO's relationship to Weineng and the Company's true revenue and earnings figures,"" which artificially inflated the value of Nio's securities, the lawsuit stated.

As a result, GIC — which purchased shares of Nio between Aug. 11, 2020, and July 11, 2022 — suffered ""tremendous losses,"" according to the lawsuit.

Shares of Nio on the Singapore Exchange closed 9.5% lower.

CNBC reached out to GIC and Nio for comment but did not hear back.

Nio offers a battery subscription model, allowing customers to buy its car without a battery at a lower cost and lease the battery separately through a monthly subscription plan.

According to the lawsuit, Weineng was created to buy the leased batteries from Nio, so customers effectively leased them from Weineng. 

The battery asset company was co-founded in 2020 by the defendants and three investors: Nio's battery supplier CATL, Hubei Science Technology Investment Group, and a subsidiary of investment bank Guotai Junan International Holdings. Each investor held a 25% stake.

The complaint alleged that Nio had ""a disproportionately larger economic interest in Weineng"" than the other founders and controlled it as Weineng's only source of revenue.

The arrangement, it said, allowed Nio to record years of subscription revenue upfront while removing depreciating battery assets from its balance sheet, in violation of securities laws. The company should have recognized the revenues in installments as customers paid for leases over time, the lawsuit argued.

It also claimed that Nio installed several of its own senior managers at Weineng to ensure that the affiliate acted in Nio's interests. 

Additionally, it argued that Nio should have consolidated Weineng's revenues into its financial statements due to its controlling stake.

In 2022, short-selling firm Grizzly Research made similar claims, alleging that Nio had inflated revenue and boosted net income margins to meet targets. 

""Instead of recognizing revenue over the life of the subscription (~7 years), Weineng allows NIO to recognize revenue from the batteries they sell immediately. Through this arrangement, we think NIO has juiced its numbers by pulling forward 7 years of revenue,"" the report said.

GIC's case against Nio is on hold after a judge ordered a temporary pause, according to an Oct. 3 court filing.

Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that GIC started purchasing Nio shares in 2020. The previous version misstated the year.

Europe's ambitious artificial intelligence strategy is at risk of colliding with an often overlooked but critically important environmental issue: water scarcity.

The European Union has big plans for data center expansion, announcing in April that it intends to at least triple its capacity over the next five to seven years as part of a push to become a world-class AI hub.

The rapid rollout of data centers, which power all aspects of the digital economy, from social media and online banking to AI tools like ChatGPT, has sparked some concern — particularly in regions already facing water scarcity.

The issue is especially acute across southern Europe, with around 30% of the population known to be situated in areas with permanent water stress. This refers to a situation where the demand for water exceeds the available supply during a specific period.

Data centers typically require large quantities of water to keep them from overheating.

Major tech companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Meta have invested billions of U.S. dollars in new facilities in Spain, for instance, while Google has plans to develop three hubs in Greece's Attica region.

Kevin Grecksch, associate professor of water science, policy and management at the U.K.'s University of Oxford, told CNBC that plans to build data centers in water-stressed areas across Europe reflects a lack of integrated thinking from policymakers.

""AI is a buzzword and the talk of the town,"" Grecksch said. ""So, national and regional politicians try to get their hands on it, and it sounds as if you're investing into the future, creating a few new jobs — but sustainability seems to be an afterthought.""

Grecksch said the rapid rollout of data centers across the region throws up plenty of unanswered questions, such as, given that in most jurisdictions public water supply has priority over everything else, what happens if data centers are shut down in a drought scenario? He conceded he had no answer to this prospect.

""Data centres tend to be built in arid or semi-arid climates because that's the preferred environment for servers; yet those areas tend to be subject to water scarcity or drought prone as well,"" Grecksch said.

A spokesperson for the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said policies of the European High Performance Computing Joint Initiative (EuroHPC JU) include selecting hosting sites for AI factories based on criteria that prioritizes energy efficiency and environmental sustainability.

""Green computing will continue to be pursued through energy-efficient supercomputers optimised for AI, using techniques such as dynamic power saving and re-use techniques like advanced cooling and recycling of the heat produced,"" the spokesperson told CNBC by email.

The EU referenced the new ""JUPITER"" supercomputer in Jülich, Germany, as ""a prime example of European excellence"" in addressing energy efficiency, saying the system runs entirely on renewable energy and features ""cutting-edge"" cooling and energy reuse.

In Aragon, an area of severe water stress in northeastern Spain, Amazon is planning to open three data centers. The proposal, which the U.S. tech giant says will create thousands of jobs, has sparked tension between local farmers and environmental activists.

In the U.K., the small English village of Culham has been picked as the first of the British government's so-called AI ""growth zones."" The designation of the Oxfordshire site, which is situated close to one of the country's first new reservoirs in 30 years, has raised fears that it could put further pressure on local water supplies.

Nick Kraft, senior analyst at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, said ""extremely arid"" and high-water stress localities were being targeted across Europe for further data center development.

""Complicating the matter is the fact that the most common understanding of data center water usage, and typically what companies report on when communicating with local stakeholders, is on-site water use — or the water used for cooling in data centers,"" Kraft told CNBC by email.

""This despite more than half of data centers' water footprint being off-site, occurring in energy generation and semiconductor manufacturing,"" he added.

There are emerging signs that data center operators are maturing in their water stewardship, Kraft said, but assessing the full water footprint of these projects is expected to remain a major challenge.

Analysis published by S&P Global last month said the data center industry's average exposure to water stress is projected to be high in the 2020s, with southern European countries such as Spain and Greece among the locations forecast to face the most water stress.

Michael Winterson, secretary general of the European Data Centre Association (EUDCA), which represents the interests of the European data center operator community, said water consumption is a concern that the industry takes seriously.

""Water treatment and collection is now normal for us. And there are continual innovations in this space that reduce energy required, reduce water needed and are fast approaching near zero chemical treatment,"" Winterson told CNBC.

The ""next big thing"" the EUDC wants to do in Europe, Winterson said, noting that the region typically lags the U.S. in this space, is to get non-potable water feeds, referring to water that is not safe for drinking but can be used for other industrial processes.

""This reduces chemicals and energy used to get water and keeps potable water for its primary purpose,"" he added.

For their part, many data center operators, claim that it is the energy-intensive nature of their technology that pushes them to consider sustainable innovations. Companies often use water usage effectiveness (WUE) as a metric for identifying water efficiency in data centers, however the metric poses its own limitations.

Microsoft has been trialing data center designs that it says consumes zero water for cooling and Start Campus said it's Sines facility in Portugal achieves a WUE of zero by recycling seawater through its sytems.

The EUDC's secretary general also sought to highlight the importance of data centers to the region's digital economy.

""This is trillions of dollars of GDP and millions of technology jobs in Europe alone — which in average pay significantly higher salaries than national average wages. A 20 [megawatt] Datacentre uses the similar amount of water as a golf course! How much GDP do golf courses create? What kind of jobs?"" Winterson said.

European lawmakers have previously warned about the region's growing water crisis, saying there is a pressing need to tackle issues such as scarcity, food security and pollution at a time when Europe is the fastest-warming continent on the planet.

The European Environment Agency, for its part, said late last month that the region's water resources are currently under ""severe pressure,"" with water stress affecting one-third of Europe's population and territory.

When factoring in the explosion of AI demand, Laura Ramsamy, climate and hazard lead at data analytics platform Climate X, said the rollout of new hyperscale data centers in already water-stressed European areas ""is really exacerbating the problem.""

In the Netherlands in 2022, for instance, Meta paused its plans to build a large data center in the region of Zeewolde amid objections over environmental concerns, particularly high power and water consumption.

Ireland, which has long embraced the rollout of data centers to facilitate an AI boom, also recently came under scrutiny from environmental groups, with many of these hubs concentrated in the Dublin area.

Notably, the Netherlands and Ireland have both imposed effective bans on new data centers over the coming years due to concerns over grid capacity and their environmental impact.

A spokesperson of Ireland's Department of Climate, Energy and the Environment said the construction and operation of data centers have ""positively contributed"" to the Irish economy over the past decade.

""As with all sectors of our economy, the operation and development of data centres are underpinned by Ireland's legally binding climate objectives and the need to maintain robust energy security,"" the spokesperson said.

""It is understood that the largest data centres in Ireland primarily operate air cooling rather than water cooling systems. This differentiates Ireland from many global data centre locations,"" they added.

Switzerland's government on Thursday cut its 2026 economic forecast for the country, citing the Trump administration's punitive tariffs as a ""heavy burden"" on its industries.

Officials held their forecast for the Swiss economy to expand by 1.3% this year, but noted that this level of economic growth was ""significantly below-average"" for the country. For next year, they are now forecasting gross domestic product (GDP) growth will slow to 0.9% – down from a previous 2026 forecast of 1.2% growth.

""Higher U.S. tariffs have further clouded the outlook for the Swiss economy,"" officials said in a news release on Thursday.

Switzerland is an export-driven economy, and the U.S. was the top foreign destination for its goods in 2024. Back in August, Switzerland was hit with 39% tariffs on goods sent to the U.S. after a Swiss delegation failed to secure a deal with U.S. officials — one of the highest country-specific rates imposed by the Trump administration.

The country's biggest exports include watches, pharmaceuticals and precious metals — but the country is also renowned for its luxury goods, chocolate and skincare products. Branded and patented pharma products are newly subject to 100% tariffs upon entry to the U.S., unless their manufacturers have or are building production facilities in America.

Swiss officials said in Thursday's update that under current trade conditions, global demand for Swiss goods and services is expected to rise ""only modestly"" in the coming quarters.

""The current trade policy environment presents particular challenges for Switzerland,"" they said. ""The additional tariffs are placing a heavy burden on affected sectors and export-oriented companies, with significant ripple effects expected across the broader economy. Moreover, persistent uncertainty is also dampening economic activity.""

The government also warned that most of America's other trading partners had been granted lower tariff rates, placing Swiss exporters at a competitive disadvantage in the U.S. market. White House trade policy held significant influence over the future trajectory of Switzerland's economy, they said.

""If Switzerland were to reach an agreement with the U.S. or if international trade policy were to ease, a more favorable development would be expected,"" they said. ""Overall, however, downside risks currently dominate.""

Beyond Trump's tariffs, demand for the Swiss franc is also adding to Switzerland's economic and diplomatic woes, with the currency – typically seen as a safe haven asset in times of broader volatility – gaining more than 12% this year amid lingering uncertainty. The rising franc has created headwinds for the country's central bank by putting downward pressure on prices as policymakers battle to avoid disinflation and negative interest rates.

Officials said on Thursday that the Swiss franc was continuing to play a role in Switzerland's economic challenges – and cautioned that a further strengthening of the franc was possible.

""A deterioration in the international environment cannot be ruled out,"" they said, noting that risks related to a market correction, global sovereign debt and the geopolitical landscape persisted.

""Should any of these risks materialize, further upward pressure on the Swiss franc would be expected,"" they said.

Charlotte de Montpellier, senior economist, France and Switzerland at ING, told CNBC on Thursday that ""risks for the Swiss economy are mounting.""

""Its exposure to the US market is big, amounting to 4% of GDP,"" de Montpellier said in an email. ""I estimate a cumulative direct impact of the current increase of US tariffs to 39% on Swiss GDP of about 0.86% in the first two years.""

De Montpellier recently revised her own growth forecast for Switzerland for 2026 down to 0.8% – almost half the growth rate she was forecasting at the beginning of this year.

""I believe that the risk are tilted to the downside and the likelihood of having a quarter of negative growth has strongly increased,"" she said. ""The Swiss economy, long buoyed by pharmaceutical exports, now faces a period of heightened uncertainty that will lead to a sharp deceleration of activity momentum.""

Melanie Debono, senior Europe economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said on Thursday that the new forecasts from the Swiss government were in line with her own.

""A fall in goods exports, as indicated by monthly nominal goods trade figures, coupled with falling investment — in light of the surge in uncertainty and despite [Swiss National Bank] rate cuts, which will ultimately feed through to lower interest rates faced by firms — means we expect the Swiss economy to enter recession in the second half of this year,"" she told CNBC via email. ""We think Swiss GDP will fall by 0.2% quarter-to-quarter in both Q3 and Q4.""

Speaking to CNBC's Carolin Roth on Wednesday, Georges Kern, CEO of Swiss luxury watchmaker Breitling, labeled the U.S. tariffs ""terrible news"" for Switzerland.

""39% tariffs is horrible,"" he said. ""Still, I believe it will be solved. Swiss politicians are really understanding how to deal with businesspeople. The Trump administration, these are businesspeople, these are not classic politicians ... But I'm confident that within the next couple of weeks there will be a much better solution than the 39%.""

Kern said that as the tariffs came into effect, Breitling had hiked prices globally to offset the impact, noting that luxury brands had more flexibility in this regard.

""[In] the U.S. we increased prices 4%, but also worldwide to balance the cost of the tariffs because you cannot just increase prices to the consumer by 39%,"" he explained. ""Thank god we have a certain pricing power at our price point, I don't think it will impact us dramatically, actually we're growing.""

In this article

Regulators in the U.S. have moved to block one of Hong Kong's largest telecommunications companies from accessing domestic networks, citing national security concerns.

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission announced on Wednesday that it had initiated proceedings to potentially bar HKT Trust and HKT Ltd and its subsidiaries from interconnecting with American networks, escalating concerns over its ties to China. 

The government agency asked HKT, which is a subsidiary of information and communication technology giant PCCW, to justify why its authorizations should not be revoked.  HKT's current hold permits allowing direct exchange of calls and data with U.S. carriers.

China Unicom, which owns about 18.4% of PCCW, lost its own U.S. network access in 2022 due to similar concerns.

""The FCC's action on HKT today is an appropriate step towards ensuring the safety and integrity of our communications networks,"" FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said in a statement. 

""The FCC will continue to safeguard America's networks against penetration from foreign adversaries, like China.""

The Hong Kong-listed shares of HKT fell more than 5%, while PCCW fell 3.6% in Thursday trading.

According to their 2024 annual reports, HKT and PCCW derived about 13% of their 2024 revenues from regions outside greater China and Singapore, though specific countries weren't detailed. HKT made up about 90% of the group's total revenue.

Neither PCCW nor HKT immediately responded to CNBC's requests for comment.

Under the leadership of Carr, the FCC has expanded efforts to expel Chinese state-linked entities, including China Telecom, Pacific Networks and ComNet, from U.S. markets.

On Friday, the FCC announced that the major U.S. online retail websites had removed millions of listings for banned Chinese electronics as part of its broader China crackdown.

PCCW is majority-owned by Hong Kong tycoon Richard Li, son of billionaire Li Ka-shing, who has increasingly found his businesses caught in the crossfire of the U.S.-China trade tensions.

FWD Group, owned by Li's Pacific Century Group, recently faced hurdles expanding into mainland China amid backlash from regulators in China, Bloomberg reported in July.

In March, Beijing reportedly instructed state-owned firms to pause new deals with businesses linked to Li Ka-shing and his family after their conglomerate CK Hutchison agreed to transfer stakes in over 40 global ports — including two in Panama — to a BlackRock-led consortium. 

The ports deal stalled after Beijing objected to the exclusion of Chinese investors, with CK Hutchison indicating it no longer plans to comeplete the transaction in 2025.

The FCC's latest move against HKT also comes as U.S. President Donald Trump escalates his trade war with China.

BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust has pushed a new batch of BTC onto Coinbase Prime wallets, as Arkham data confirms more than 700 BTC, worth about $47 million, redirected from ETF custody into the major U.S. exchange's institutional deposit pool. The transfers came in 300 BTC chunks followed by a 131 BTC move — and yes, all in the same direction. 

It comes just as the Bitcoin ETF sector logged -$104.1 million in net outflows yesterday, a sudden and dramatic pivot. On the chart perspective, it showed up as a 5% weekly drop for IBIT, closing at $62.84. Arkham"">

The $11 trillion fund, which had previously been holding ground as the flagship of institutional Bitcoin exposure, is suddenly showing cracks in its armor. That adds another layer of pressure to a market already dealing with crazy multi-billion leveraged wipeouts and nervous sentiment around the $110,000 BTC line.

The two signals together are hard to miss: coins leaving ETF wallets, outflow data flashing red and IBIT sliding deeper after months of relative strength worth 60%. 

Altseason preparations?

Ethereum ETFs, meanwhile, booked $169.7 million in inflows over the same period, and the rotation seems to be evident — capital flying away from Bitcoin exposure and into ETH, where supply shocks and ETF buying pressure are giving investors a more comfortable anchor into the end of the year.TradingView"">

Moving coins to Coinbase Prime does not automatically mean fire sales, but the timing and weight of the BlackRock name leave little room for a neutral interpretation. 

So, as it stands, Bitcoin ETFs are bleeding, Ethereum is catching capital and Coinbase is now sitting on BlackRock's coins. Whether it is housekeeping or redemptions remains to be seen.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

U.S. spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds exhibited contrasting fortunes on Wednesday as participants continue to tread carefully in the wake of Friday's historic flash crash.

The Bitcoin ETFs registered $104.1 million in net outflows on Oct. 15, negating the $102.7 million gains they made on Tuesday and continuing the back-and-forth flow data witnessed since last week's market turmoil.

Grayscale's GBTC led the outflows with $82.9 million, followed by Invesco's BTCO with $11.1 million, according to data compiled by The Block. BlackRock's delayed flow data subsequently confirmed its IBIT fund also saw $10.1 million exit, while the other ETFs experienced zero flows for the day.



In contrast, the Ethereum ETFs attracted $169.6 million combined on Wednesday, led by $164.3 million worth of net inflows into BlackRock's ETHA.

Bitwise's ETHW and Fidelity's FETH also added $12.3 million and $1 million, respectively, while 21Shares' CETH saw the only outflows of $8 million, and the remaining funds generated zero flows.



Since Friday, the Bitcoin ETFs have experienced $332.3 million in net outflows, and the Ethereum ETFs have seen a total of $197.6 million exit.

The turmoil began late Friday after Trump posted on Truth Social that he would impose 100% tariffs on all Chinese imports, responding to China's threat to cut off exports of rare earth metals, which are critical to U.S. technology manufacturing.

At its worst, Bitcoin fell 15% toward $100,000 on some exchanges, while Ethereum dropped over 20% and the broader crypto market witnessed more substantial losses. Cascading liquidations saw at least $20 billion of positions wiped out as some cryptocurrencies briefly fell literally to zero — the largest crypto liquidation event in history in U.S. dollar terms. As liquidation data is imperfect, with some exchanges still underreporting in incomplete bursts, the true figure is likely far higher.

While Bitcoin recovered to around $115,000 by Monday morning after Trump seemingly attempted to de-escalate the issue, tensions continue, and it has since retraced to around $111,357, according to The Block's BTC price page — down 9.2% in the past week. Other cryptocurrencies have similarly struggled amid the uncertainty, with Ethereum currently trading for $4,046 — down 7.4% over the same period.



""Structural effects from the unwind mean liquidity will likely stay thin as market participants recover from forced selling,"" K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde said earlier this week. ""Historically, such deleveraging phases lead to short-term stagnation and cautious trading, but they also tend to mark exhaustion points, creating fertile ground for longer-term recovery once stability returns.""

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

BitMine Immersion Technologies added 104,336 ETH, worth $417 million, to its corporate Ethereum treasury on Wednesday.

Lookonchain, using Arkham data, reported that the ETH was received in three new addresses through seven transactions originating from two wallets, one each from Kraken and BitGo. However, BitMine has not officially confirmed the transaction. 

BitMine's official ETH holdings stood at 3.03 million, worth around $12.2 billion, according to its last update on Oct. 13. The treasury firm, led by Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee, is currently the largest ETH treasury and the second-largest crypto treasury, behind Michael Saylor's Strategy.

The company has repeatedly stated its goal of accumulating 5% of Ethereum's total supply, and said it is committed to supporting Ethereum's growing role in financial market services. 

Lee has also endorsed Ethereum on multiple occasions. During a discussion at last month's Korea Blockchain Week conference, Lee said Wall Street players and the White House will favor Ethereum in their future blockchain endeavors as it is a ""truly neutral chain.""

BitMine's $417 million ETH acquisition comes amid a market slump, with ether down 8.7% in the past seven days at $4,028, according to The Block's price data. ETH is currently 18.5% lower than its all-time high of $4,946.

The overall crypto market remains subdued after the largest liquidation event in crypto history flushed out billions over the past weekend. Still, analysts said crypto market fundamentals remain strong for further price growth.

""Those cleaned out are crypto evangelists — they already believe crypto as an investible asset class so much that they speculate using leverage,"" said Paul Howard, senior director of Wincent. ""These people are not going away.""

Oops, something went wrong

Publicly traded Ethereum treasury company SharpLink Gaming, Inc. announced a $76.5 million registered direct offering of 4.5 million common shares at $17 per share, representing a 12% premium to its October 15 closing price of $15.15.

The move is meant to fuel further ETH purchases for the company following a period of slower acquisitions—all while BitMine Immersion Technologies, the largest corporate ETH holder, continues to widen the gap with consistently sizable Ethereum additions.

SharpLink Gaming now holds 840,124 ETH, valued at $3.38 billion. However, over the last month, the company has significantly slowed its acquisitions, adding only about 2,900 ETH over the last month—about $1.18 million worth.

By contrast, BitMine has added more Ethereum over the last month than SharpLink holds in total. BitMine has acquired approximately 880,500 ETH, valued at $3.55 billion at the current ETH price of $4,039. The firm now holds over $12.1 billion worth of ETH.

Alongside the share sale, SharpLink said that the unnamed institutional investor also received a 90-day premium purchase contract expiring on January 15, allowing purchase of an additional 4.5 million shares at $17.50 per share—a 19% premium to the closing price. If fully exercised, this would generate another $78.8 million in gross proceeds.

Tom Lee's BitMine Adds $838 Million More in Ethereum Amid Market Chaos

“This is a novel equity sale transaction that is both accretive to stockholders and strategically structured, reflecting strong institutional confidence in SharpLink and our long-term vision,” said SharpLink co-CEO Joseph Chalom, in a statement. “By raising equity at a meaningful premium to both market price and NAV, we're able to continue accumulating ETH and increasing ETH-per-share for our investors.”

SharpLink (SBET) stock is up slightly on the day, rising about 0.25% to a price of $15.19, as of this writing. It's down nearly 11% over the last week.

The price of Ethereum surged to a new all-time high of $4,946 in August on the back of the Ethereum treasury boom, which includes other major buyers like The Ether Machine, Bit Digital, and ETHZilla.

However, it's had an especially volatile week, plunging from $4,350 to below $3,700 last Friday as crypto markets were rocked by President Trump's tariff threats against China. Falling prices led to a cascade of liquidations, with more than $19 billion worth of positions hit in a single day—a new record for the crypto industry.

Ethereum is currently trading for $3,980, down more than 8% on the week. Myriad users are bearish on a short-term rebound, predicting just an 18% chance that the price will sit above $4,200 by 12pm UTC on Friday. Odds have fallen by more than 13% over the last 24 hours. (Disclaimer: Myriad is a product of Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.)

Ethereum's dual advancements with Fusaka and zkEVM pave the way for achieving 10,000 TPS on L1 and up to 10 million TPS on L2.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

Ethereum is picking up speed again, not in price charts where it is currently struggling, but in the silent machinery beneath it.

Two parallel breakthroughs, one on the protocol layer and the other in cryptography, are redefining how fast and how light the world's most-used blockchain can run.

Together, they sketch a future where anyone, from institutions to small-time validators, can participate on the network in real time without needing supercomputers or deep pockets.

The first significant milestone on that path is Fusaka, Ethereum's upcoming hard fork, tentatively expected in December.

The planned upgrade blends improvements to Ethereum's execution and consensus layers in one coordinated release.

Unlike Dencun, which introduced “blobs” to help rollups scale, Fusaka isn't chasing raw throughput.

Instead, its role is subtler, focusing on making the network lighter, cheaper, and more efficient.

Fusaka implements 12 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) aimed at streamlining validator workloads and improving how rollups post their data.

The centerpiece, EIP-7594, or PeerDAS, lets validators confirm data availability by sampling portions of rollup data instead of downloading it fully.

While this doesn't directly raise TPS, it changes how efficiently Ethereum handles data. More rollup information can now fit per block without increasing node requirements.

Developers expect the upgrade to lower rollup transaction costs and make it easier for small operators to run validators.

Notably, it also raises the gas limit from 45 million to 60 million, a 33% bump that gives Layer-2s more headroom to publish compressed transaction data.

Meanwhile, the rollout is already underway. Fusaka passed early tests on Holesky and Sepolia, and will undergo its final trial on the Hoodi testnet later this month.

While Fusaka lays the groundwork, the real spectacle is happening in the proving arena.

On Oct. 15, Ethereum scaling firm Brevis unveiled Pico Prism, a new zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) capable of producing cryptographic proofs almost as fast as the network creates blocks.

In testing, the system achieved 99.9% real-time proving, generating full block proofs in under 12 seconds.

Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake pointed out that this represents a leap from May's performance, when the SP1 Hypercube setup could only prove 94% of blocks within the same window.

According to him, the improvement cuts average proof latency to 6.9 seconds, meaning block verification can keep pace with block production. Notably, this is a prerequisite for Ethereum's long-term goal of sub-second settlement.

Drake furthered that this development, alongside the imminent Fusaka upgrade, will make on-premise proving viable for the first time.

He said:

“By year's end several teams will prove every L1 EVM block on a 16-GPU cluster, drawing less than 10kW total. The 10kW target—about the same as a Tesla home charger—matters for on-prem proving in garages and offices, eliminating reliance on cloud proving.”

Drake believes these developments fit into his long-term projection of “gigagas L1, teragas L2.”

In this scenario, Ethereum's throughput on its base layer for high-value activities like payments and trading rises to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS).

On the other hand, the network can scale up to 10 million TPS across its layer-2 networks to handle everything else. Drake said:

“L1 throughput has grown 100x since genesis ten years ago, from 20 kilogas/sec to 2 megagas/sec. With zkEVMs we can 100x again, in half the time.”

Ethereum's march toward faster, cheaper transactions comes with a quieter problem of its technical debt piling up.

Ethereum developer Federico Carrone, better known as Fede's Intern, cautions that many of the network's core development tools, especially the Solidity programming language, are losing momentum.

Solidity is the foundation of Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem. According to DeFiLlama, it is responsible for more than 86% of the smart contract language used in the blockchain network's over $200 billion DeFi protocols.

His concerns echo those of Paradigm CTO Georgios Konstantopoulos, who had previously said Solidity's ecosystem was “in a problematic state.”

However, Carrone sees the issue as technical and economic for the blockchain network.

He argued that maintaining complex infrastructure depends on time, continuity, and deep expertise, which cannot be obtained overnight.

In addition, Carrone noted that Ethereum's planned gas-limit increase under the Fusaka upgrade poses another risk.

Carrone warned that many execution clients have not significantly improved their performance and may struggle to process larger blocks.

Considering all these issues, he concluded:

“Ethereum's technical debt keeps growing, not only because of constant and necessary protocol evolution, but because a large set of dependencies and repositories are stagnating. The ecosystem continues to scale, securing billions of dollars in assets, while parts of the foundation are eroding.”

Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Staking represents the largest supply vacuum, with 35.7 million Ethereum staked worth approximately $146 billion and accounting for almost 30% of the entire supply.

Digital asset treasuries did not exist in the last market cycle but have now amassed 5.9 million Ethereum worth around $24 billion, equivalent to 4.9% of the total supply, according to StrategicEthReserve. These entities will hold the asset for long-term yields, removing substantial supply from active trading.

Staking represents the largest supply vacuum, with 35.7 million Ethereum staked worth approximately $146 billion and accounting for almost 30% of the entire supply. Most of this is illiquid due to the length of the exit queue, which currently stands at 40 days for validators wanting to withdraw their tokens.

Crypto Gucci stated that Ethereum has entered this cycle with record institutional demand and the smallest liquid float in its history. When demand meets a shrinking supply like this, price does not just go up but goes nuclear, the analyst wrote on Tuesday.

Public companies tracked by Ark Investments are collectively holding over 12% of the total Ethereum supply. Among them is Tom Lee's Bitmine, which purchased $834 million worth of tokens earlier this week and now holds $12.52 billion in Ethereum, more than halfway toward its target of controlling 5% of total circulating supply.

The Ethereum supply is marginally inflationary at the moment but has only increased by 0.5% since the Merge in 2022, when it transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, according to Ultrasound.Money. Compared to this, the Bitcoin supply has increased by 4% over the same period.

The month of October has been extremely volatile for the cryptocurrency market. With geopolitical tension and fear of escalating US-China trade war, the market uncertainty peaked. However, this may be the best time to scoop up some altcoins. 

As the Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran revealed that he expects two more rate cuts by the end of the year, a crypto bull phase is anticipated. Some also say that the best time to buy altcoins is when no one wants them. 

Bittensor TAOUSDT

On October 15, the token climbed over $460, and despite the intense market volatility, TAO surged to 32%, driven by growing institutional adoption. 

Previously, on October 10, crypto giant Grayscale filed a Form 10 registration with the US SEC to launch a Bittensor Trust. Moreover, the Bittensor halving event, which is scheduled for December 11, 2025, will also support TAO's price by creating scarcity as demand grows. 

BNB 

The token recently hit its all-time high of $1,370.55 on October 13, 2025. The overall outlook for the token is largely positive, supported by its strong technical indicators, ecosystem growth, and regulatory compliance. Being the native token for Binance and its fee discount of 25% has also been a key contributor to its bullish momentum.

The token continues to attract global investors with its innovative initiatives like the Alpha Points Program, Launchpool campaigns, and integration of digital wallets. 

Solana SOLUSDT

SOL is currently trading at $195.11, showing strong resilience amid the crypto market crash. The stability in the current market shows the token's potential for upside momentum. Its high-frequency trading, real-time settlements, and regulatory clarity have favored large adoption among the global institutions. 

Factors like strong staking rewards, a growing ecosystem, and effective corporate treasury strategies have positioned Solana as a mainstream finance.

FAQs

Geopolitical tension and US-China trade war fears are causing market-wide uncertainty, creating sharp price swings that can present opportunities for investors.

Some strategies suggest buying during fear, but it depends on your risk tolerance. Diversifying during downturns can be profitable if you've researched strong projects.

Investors often seek higher growth potential from specific altcoins, which can offer unique utility, faster technology, or focus on niche markets beyond the major leaders.

Generally, yes. While volatile, Bitcoin is more established. Altcoins can offer higher rewards but also carry greater risk of failure due to smaller market caps and newer projects.

Current volatility and anticipated Fed rate cuts may create a strategic entry point. Always base decisions on your own research and risk assessment, not just market timing.

Quick Facts:

So is it altcoin season, or not?

The concept of ‘altcoin season' – when altcoins broadly outperform Bitcoin – has long been the prize for crypto investors beyond Bitcoin. But timing its arrival remains elusive, and there's broad debate over what even altcoin season means.

All eyes now fall on the $ETH/$BTC pair, as it approaches a historically stout support band that could dictate the market's next major move.

Ethereum relative to Bitcoin is trading near 0.032–0.034, a zone that has often served as a bounce area in past cycles. Should the pair find support here and begin to rebound, it could mark the start of rotation back into altcoins. But if it fails, further downside might be in store.

Some argue that Bitcoin must push to new highs and drive dominance higher. Only then will capital rotate into altcoins – a pattern that aligns with many past cycles.

The logic basically holds like this: you need Bitcoin to reach ATHs, pushing more investors to Ethereum and other altcoins, which then cuts into Bitcoin's dominance and establishes a true altcoin season.

But there's another perspective out there.

Others counter that Ethereum (and select altcoins) can forge ahead even if Bitcoin stalls. They point to episodes (late 2017, early 2021) where $ETH led strong rallies shortly after $BTC's peaks.

The debate continues to rage on X, with both sides arguing that either Bitcoin, or Ethereum, or both, need to push higher before an altcoin season can truly get underway.

The altcoin market (excluding stablecoins) still sits around 20% below its prior highs, meaning room exists for upside if conditions become favorable.

And some of the altcoins out there – in particular $ETH, $HYPER, and $SNORT – are poised to go parabolic once altcoin season gets underway.

Let's take a closer look at the best altcoins to buy today.

Want to find a winning altcoin these days? Look for the projects that build infrastructure for crypto's continued growth.

By leveraging a Canonical Bridge to the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper will allow investors to deploy wrapped $BTC across the full expense of the crypto economy.



What is Bitcoin Hyper? It's set to be the best way to make fast, cheap Bitcoin transactions possible. Learn how to buy Hyper, and act fast – whales are pouring hundreds of thousands into the project on a weekly basis, boosting it to nearly $24M raised.

Our price prediction shows $HYPER could potentially reach $0.32 from its current $0.013125, a 2,338% increase.

Visit the Bitcoin Hyper presale page to buy your $HYPER today.

Meme coin trading is typically madness. Tens of thousands of coins are launched around the clock, with most never seeing the virtual light of day.

But if you can find the right projects amongst the madness, there's room for major gains. That's where Snorter Token ($SNORT) comes in.



A meme coin trading bot based on Solana and native to Telegram, the Snorter Bot will give traders all the tools they need to sniff out and snipe the best meme coins before they go mainstream.

Our Snorter Token price prediction highlights $SNORTs potential to rise from its current $0.1081 to $0.94 by the end of the year. With only four days left, the presale has already brought in over $4.8M. Learn how to buy $SNORT and stake it for 107% before the presale closes.

The clock is ticking. Buy your $SNORT before it's too late.

Don't get lost in the altcoin season debate: whether $BTC leads or $ETH does, nearly every analyst expects a strong performance from the biggest altcoin of them all – Ethereum ($ETH).

Whether its $5K or $7K to $8K, the rising tide of Bitcoin and general altcoin enthusiasm should send Ethereum upwards. Add in the continued interest in Ethereum by companies like BitMine, which currently holds over 3M $ETH, and Ethereum's future looks bright indeed.

Meanwhile, macro conditions play a supporting role to any altcoin season narrative: signs that the US Federal Reserve may ease rates further could inject liquidity into risk assets, helping altcoin plays.

Buy $ETH, currently priced at around $4K, through Binance and other reputable platforms.

Don't forget, this is not financial advice. Always do your own research before making any investment.

BNY and the National Bank of Canada went live this week with EquiLend's 1Source platform,
joining the blockchain-based system designed to eliminate manual trade
reconciliations in the securities finance industry.

The company
that offers stock lending said a global broker-dealer will begin trading on the
platform soon, with several other firms close to signing on. BNY and the National
Bank of Canada are now executing securities lending transactions through the
distributed ledger, which maintains a synchronized record of trades between
counterparties.

The
industry currently spends roughly $100 million annually on reconciliation teams
and fixing settlement breaks, according to estimates from industry
participants. EquiLend's system is built to remove those costs by keeping both
sides of each transaction aligned from the start, rather than having firms
record details separately and fix mismatches later.

""This
milestone underscores BNY's commitment to innovation and leveraging new
technologies to mitigate risk,"" said Nehal Udeshi, Head of Securities Finance at BNY. ""By using 1Source, we're aiming to manage challenges
associated with manual reconciliation, while delivering benefits to our
clients.""

For example, EuiLend's services have been used by eToro for the past six months, allowing UK and European users to earn additional income by lending their stocks. A similar product was launched by Robinhood in 2022 and by Interactive Brokers in 2023.

Carl Attie,
Managing Director and Head of Global Securities Finance at National Bank of
Canada, said the bank joined the platform as part of its focus on technology
solutions for clients. 

""This
milestone lays the foundation for broader adoption and future enhancements,
enabling us to streamline processes, increase efficiency and enhance resilience
in the securities finance marketplace,"" Attie said.

EquiLend
developed the platform with Digital Asset's Canton blockchain technology, which
allows multiple parties to share transaction data while maintaining privacy
controls. The system launched with coverage of North American equities backed
by cash collateral, though expansion to corporate bonds, non-cash collateral,
and European markets is planned.

Third-party
analysis from Vy Solutions in 2022 estimated the platform could save the
securities finance industry hundreds of millions of dollars per year through
reduced operational expenses and fewer settlement failures.

The
securities lending market has relied on fragmented back office systems where
counterparties maintain separate records of the same transactions.
Discrepancies in quantities, rates, or settlement dates often surface days
after trades are executed, creating reconciliation headaches and liquidity
risks.

EquiLend's
system puts each transaction on a shared ledger where both parties see
identical information in real time. Lifecycle events like recalls, rate
changes, and returns are processed within the same environment, automatically
updating both sides simultaneously.

""Each
new participant strengthens the network effect of 1Source, accelerating the
industry-wide benefits of improved accuracy, transparency, and
efficiency,"" said Rich Grossi, CEO of EquiLend.

The
platform currently supports loan initiation, daily mark-to-market calculations,
benchmark-based rate adjustments, recalls, and buy-ins. EquiLend plans to add
automated rerating for large loan books tied to benchmark shifts, which should
cut another source of breaks when reference rates change.

 North Korean state-linked hackers have begun using public blockchains to deliver malware and steal cryptocurrency, in what researchers say is the first known case of a nation-state adopting the technique. 

 Google security researchers said on Thursday that they observed a Pyongyang-backed hacking group, tracked as UNC5342, deploying a method known as EtherHiding — a way of embedding malicious code inside smart contracts on decentralized networks such as Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain. 

 The technique makes it harder to block or remove malware, since the code is stored on blockchain ledgers that cannot be taken offline or altered. The malicious code remains accessible as long as the blockchain itself is operational, according to researchers. 

 “This represents a shift toward next-generation bulletproof hosting,” Google said, noting that attackers are increasingly exploiting the same decentralization features that make blockchain resilient. 

 Since February, UNC5342 has used EtherHiding as part of a social-engineering campaign that lures developers — often those working in the cryptocurrency or tech industries — into downloading malware disguised as job-related files or coding challenges. 

 Once a target opens the file, a malicious script connects to the blockchain to retrieve encrypted code from a smart contract. That code installs the JadeSnow loader, which in turn delivers a more persistent backdoor known as InvisibleFerret that has been used in multiple cryptocurrency thefts. 

 Because the malicious payloads are stored on decentralized blockchains, they cannot be removed by traditional takedown efforts. Attackers can also quietly update or replace their malware by modifying the smart contract, Google said. 

 Blockchain's pseudonymous nature adds another layer of anonymity, making it difficult to identify those behind the operation. 

 Google said EtherHiding was first used in 2023 by a financially motivated group known as UNC5142, but this is the first time a state-sponsored actor has adopted it. 

 The company added that while the hackers rely on decentralized blockchains to store their code, they still interact through centralized web services that defenders can monitor or block to disrupt attacks. 

 “In other words, UNC5142 and UNC5342 are using permissioned services to interact with permissionless blockchains,” the researchers said.

A threat actor with ties to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (aka North Korea) has been observed leveraging the EtherHiding technique to distribute malware and enable cryptocurrency theft, marking the first time a state-sponsored hacking group has embraced the method.

The activity has been attributed by Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) to a threat cluster it tracks as UNC5342, which is also known as CL-STA-0240 (Palo Alto Networks Unit 42), DeceptiveDevelopment (ESET), DEV#POPPER (Securonix), Famous Chollima (CrowdStrike), Gwisin Gang (DTEX), Tenacious Pungsan (Datadog), and Void Dokkaebi (Trend Micro).

The attack wave is part of a long-running campaign codenamed Contagious Interview, wherein the attackers approach potential targets on LinkedIn by posing as recruiters or hiring managers, and trick them into running malicious code under the pretext of a job assessment after shifting the conversation to Telegram or Discord.

The end goal of these efforts is to gain unauthorized access to developers' machines, steal sensitive data, and siphon cryptocurrency assets – consistent with North Korea's twin pursuit of cyber espionage and financial gain.

Google said it has observed UNC5342 incorporating EtherHiding – a stealthy approach that involves embedding nefarious code within a smart contract on a public blockchain like BNB Smart Chain (BSC) or Ethereum – since February 2025. In doing so, the attack turns the blockchain into a decentralized dead drop resolver that's resilient to takedown efforts.

Besides resilience, EtherHiding also abuses the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions to make it harder to trace who has deployed the smart contract. Complicating matters further, the technique is also flexible in that it allows the attacker who is in control of the smart contract to update the malicious payload at any time (albeit costing an average of $1.37 in gas fees), thereby opening the door to a wide spectrum of threats.

""This development signals an escalation in the threat landscape, as nation-state threat actors are now utilizing new techniques to distribute malware that is resistant to law enforcement take-downs and can be easily modified for new campaigns,"" Robert Wallace, consulting leader at Mandiant, Google Cloud, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News.

The infection chain triggered following the social engineering attack is a multi-stage process that's capable of targeting Windows, macOS, and Linux systems with three different malware families -

""EtherHiding represents a shift toward next-generation bulletproof hosting, where the inherent features of blockchain technology are repurposed for malicious ends,"" Google said. ""This technique underscores the continuous evolution of cyber threats as attackers adapt and leverage new technologies to their advantage.""

Oops, something went wrong

Oct. 16 (UPI) -- PayPal's blockchain partner Paxos accidentally minted $300 trillion in stablecoin Wednesday as part of what it called an ""internal transfer.""

The colossal rise in PYUSD stablecoin was noticed by market watchers on Etherscan, an analytics platform for the Ethereum blockchain, CNBC reported.

Paxos announced on X that it ""mistakenly minted excess PYUSD as part of an internal transfer.""

""Paxos immediately identified the error and burned the excess PYUSD. This was an internal technical error. There is no security breach. Customer funds are safe. We have addressed the root cause,"" it wrote.

Etherscan showed the error had been fixed after about 20 minutes. PYUSD is a dollar-backed stablecoin, meaning it's fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, U.S. treasuries and similar cash equivalents. PayPal says the tokens are always redeemable for U.S. dollars.

But the $300 trillion in PYUSD would require more dollars than what's in global circulation. For comparison, In 2024, the global gross domestic product was about $113.3 trillion.

PYUSD is the sixth-largest stablecoin in the world with a market capitalization of over $2.6 billion, CNBC said.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

As economic uncertainty pushes many to seek new ways to grow their income, a growing number of Miami residents are turning to cryptocurrency. 

For some, it's not just an investment — it's a life-changing opportunity.

Miami illustrator and muralist Marlon Pruz told CBS News Miami he has struck gold in the crypto world by selling what's known as NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. An NFT is a digital asset that signifies ownership of a digital item. For Pruz, it's his ticket to sell his digital art pieces.

""This artist Beepull sold one of his NFTs for $69 million and that's what really opened up a lot of people's eyes,"" said Pruz.

Miami has emerged as a hub for digital asset enthusiasts. Crypto consultant Danny Brownwolf told CBS News Miami her journey into the crypto world began while working in international policy back in 2017.

At the time, the United Nations launched a pilot project using the technology to track humanitarian aid distribution, and it captivated her interest.

""I was like, what is this magical technology they are using to solve a real-world problem and I dug in and I just went down the rabbit hole ever since,"" said Brownwolf.

Brownwolf demonstrated just how swiftly she could send cryptocurrency using the platform X. In mere moments, she sent $1 in cryptocurrency through the platform and it automatically opened a digital wallet containing the funds.

""You can say that crypto is any asset represented in a digital way native to the internet, that allows for no middleman,"" said Brownwolf.

Unlike traditional currencies regulated by central banks, cryptocurrencies are decentralized and operate on a technology called blockchain. This means that transactions are verified by a network of computers rather than a single entity.

Brownwolf recently guided start-up advisor and investor Ethan Appleby through the crypto onboarding process at the Lab Miami in Wynwood, a gathering place for tech pioneers and entrepreneurs.

""You're officially on chain,"" exclaimed Brownwolf.

""Thank you so much. Amazing!"" replied Appleby.

Recently, the GENIUS Act was signed into law, marking a significant milestone in the regulation of digital assets nationwide.

""It allows for the U.S. dollar to be issued as a crypto. So, now you have, think of cash, it has the same properties of cash. It's backed one-to-one either by a real U.S. dollar or by U.S. bonds,"" said Brownwolf.

For beginners, Brownwolf recommends starting with platforms that are user-friendly for those new to cryptocurrency. Some of them include Robinhood, Coinbase, Gemini and Kraken.

So, how is your money protected from hackers?

""Once you have money in any type of digital form, then you need to protect your password, your access and best practices like two-factor authentication,"" said Brownwolf.

For Pruz, joining the crypto craze has been transformative. ""I keep telling my friends you need to get into this. You need to take the deep dive,"" he said.

Pruz said it took him nearly two years to truly grasp the process and start seeing significant profits. Brownwolf added that for everyday people deciding what to invest in, it's important to ""look for things that solve problems in the current industry you work in or in a field or industry that you are knowledgeable about.""

The Bittensor hack unfolded in the years of 2024 and 2025, leading to an astounding theft that affected users ranging from $8 million to $28 million. It was particularly concerning as the hackers utilized anime-themed NFTs to launder their stolen funds. ZachXBT, a blockchain analyst, took the initiative of tracing the laundering routes, revealing that privacy tools and Avalanche bridges were cleverly employed by the hackers to hide their transactions. The aftermath of this incident not only revealed vulnerabilities within the NFT market but also instigated considerable regulatory responses as stakeholders expressed their demand for heightened anti-money laundering measures.

In the wake of the hack, the Total Value Locked (TVL) for Bittensor experienced a noticeable decline, stirring a wave of market anxiety. Ethereum and Avalanche networks played a critical role in the operational tactics employed by the hackers, showcasing the ever-evolving strategies adopted by cybercriminals in the crypto landscape. The incident acted as a stark reminder for the crypto community, revealing the pressing need for improved security measures and stricter regulatory scrutiny.

NFTs, especially those inspired by popular culture such as anime, are emerging as a new tool for laundering money. These criminals are utilizing various methods, including wash trading, to hide the origins of illicit funds. In the context of the Bittensor hack, the laundering of funds was funneled through overpriced anime NFTs, allowing the offenders to effectively mask their transactions.

The integration of privacy mixers and decentralized exchanges has made tracing these funds even more difficult. As pointed out by ZachXBT, it's becoming a rarity to witness hacks involving NFT wash trading, indicating a transformation in the operating methods of cybercriminals. This trend accentuates the urgency for crypto platforms to fortify their monitoring processes and compliance protocols to prevent and detect such illicit activity.

In light of the escalating worries surrounding NFT-induced financial crimes, regulatory authorities within the European Union are actively crafting frameworks aimed at addressing these risks. The proposed amendments to the EU's Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws suggest categorizing NFT platforms as ""obliged entities"", akin to banks and traditional financial institutions. This designation would compel NFT marketplaces to execute customer due diligence, conduct identity checks, and report any suspicious transactions.

Furthermore, the impending Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR) will necessitate that crypto-asset service providers gather and share personal details of both crypto transaction senders and recipients. This regulation is aimed at increasing traceability and transparency, rendering it more challenging for criminals to exploit the anonymity typically linked with NFTs.

Notwithstanding these advancements, a regulatory gap persists concerning decentralized platforms and self-managed wallets. Ongoing discussions are revolving around whether said entities should be bound to the same AML obligations as centralized intermediaries. The EU's attempts to align its regulations with global benchmarks, like those established by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), are pivotal in preventing regulatory arbitrage and ensuring uniform oversight across the crypto domain.

Fintech startups, particularly those entrenched in the NFT industry, should deploy a multifaceted approach to shield themselves against financial crimes. There are numerous strategies that can be embraced:

Incorporating advanced technologies: Leveraging AI and machine learning for instantaneous monitoring of transaction patterns could illuminate suspicious activities preemptively. Blockchain analytics tools would also yield insights into potential laundering methodologies.

Establishing rigorous KYC and AML procedures: Formulating robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) frameworks is of utmost importance. This includes comprehensive risk assessments during onboarding processes and ongoing monitoring of transactions.

Bolstering security protocols: Startups ought to implement best practices for private key management, including the use of hardware wallets and multi-signature arrangements. Routine security audits and employee training on identifying phishing and social engineering attacks can additionally mitigate vulnerabilities.

Collaborating with regulatory bodies: Engaging with regulators and industry peers for intelligence sharing on threats and compliance strategies could bolster defenses against emergent dangers. Partaking in national initiatives, like Hong Kong's Scameter alert system, could provide additional resources.

Educating employees and developers: Conducting frequent training sessions on the latest fraud typologies and simulating attack scenarios could prepare teams to spot and handle potential threats effectively.

The Bittensor hack carries crucial lessons for the crypto community, particularly for crypto-friendly small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Here are some takeaways:

Supply chain integrity: SMEs must scrutinize all software dependencies and remain vigilant for typosquatting to prevent compromised packages from infiltrating their systems.

Incident response readiness: Having clear protocols in place for incident response can significantly limit losses during a breach. The ability to halt critical operations is essential for damage mitigation.

Monitoring and threat intelligence improvement: Real-time anomaly detection and collaboration with the cybersecurity community can help identify and neutralize emerging threats.

Legal preparedness: As illustrated in the Bittensor case, legal repercussions may accompany significant breaches. Adhering to regulatory requirements and being prepared for potential litigation is crucial.

Continuous education: Regular training for employees on security best practices can remarkably decrease both insider threats and accidental compromises.

To conclude, the Bittensor hack reveals a paramount necessity for a comprehensive security stance within the crypto ecosystem. By absorbing insights from such incidents and adopting proactive strategies, SMEs can better shield themselves against the escalating threats posed by cybercriminals in the rapidly shifting world of NFTs and cryptocurrency.

After the crypto market crash on October 10, the NFT market showed signs of recovery after losing over $1B across all networks. While it may take some time for the NFT sector to restore its market capitalization from before the crash, the recovery is still a positive sign in uncertain market periods.



Yet, since the sell-offs confirm that NFTs are not immune to crypto volatility, plenty of investors are switching their attention to presales. In addition to increased interest in Remmitix price prediction, DeepSnitch AI also started its trending journey after raising nearly $420K in the second stage of the presale.



DeepSnitch AI is an AI project that proposes a comprehensive trading suite with five AI agents that transform on-chain noise into actionable analytics. Priced at $0.01877, investors expect the project to shoot to the top after listing, owing to its affordability and core utility.



On October 15, the NFT market started recovering after a massive sell-off during the Friday crash when NFTs lost a total of $1.2B in market cap.

On-chain data reveals that the sector fell from $6.2B to $5B in only 24 hours. More precisely, the crash caused 20% across different networks.





The NFT market regained $500K by Sunday, with traders expecting the sector to reach the pre-crash market cap in a few days.

Yet, top NFT collections are down. This includes the Bored Ape Yacht Club, which was down 10% and Pudgy Penguins, down by over 21% at press time. Similarly, even CryptoPunks, the most active NFT collection, saw an 8% decrease on its weekly chart.

Another sign of imminent market recovery is the resurgence of spot ETFs. On October 14, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs recorded a net inflow that exceeded $338M.

Moreover, Ethereum ETFs attracted $236M, outperforming Bitcoin, which recorded $102M.

Although this may not be enough to definitely conclude that recovery is in full swing, the performance on October 14 restored bullish sentiments after BTC and ETH funds lost $755M.

Traders are waiting for conclusive signs of a breakout as top coins lost momentum on October 15, with Bitcoin trading in the $111K area, according to CoinMarketCap. Thus, the market is cautious, leading to many exploring new presales that may shield them from short-term market volatility.



A tried and true AI project, DeepSnitch AI is not only an effective day-to-day trading tool, but it also has a strong upside potential.

DeepSnitch AI is developing an analytics suite leveraging five autonomous AI agents programmed to analyze on-chain data. This information will be presented in the form of actionable insights accessible via a centralized dashboard.

The first two agents are particularly interesting.

SnitchFeed, for instance, analyzes market sentiments by scouring crypto alpha groups and social media threads. If any shift happens, SnitchFeed will spot it and notify the user.

In addition to accurately tracking whale wallets, the agent will also spot insider signals, keep a lookout for any suspicious activity, and warn traders of incoming FUD storms.

The second agent, SnitchFeed, can screen tokens and identify rug pull risks, track developer activity, helping traders avoid a scam, as well as identify high upside projects.

There's a whole list of reasons why traders believe DeepSnitch AI could turn into the next crypto moonshot. The first one is its unique position in the AI sector.

While this category is growing fast, most projects propose architectures, making developers the target audience. In contrast, DeepSnitch AI casts a wider net with a solution designed to be used by retail traders daily.

As a result, the DSNT token, currently priced at $0.01877, could reach mainstream acceptance, which will ensure organic growth and potentially pump the token by at least 100x after listing.

DeepSnitch AI raised over $420K in record time and is still in its second stage. Investing at this price could yield traders an easy $50K on a $500 investment if the 100x prediction comes true.

Remmitix is a trending project with a powerful DeFi angle. Created to simplify cross-border payments, the platform will enable crypto-to-fiat transfer to various banks in over 30 countries.

In addition, the Remmitix platform also attempts to bridge the DeFi/TradFi gap by providing small businesses a gateway to accepting crypto payments.

Generally, Remittix forecast is helped by the fact that it provides a clear solution to an actual problem, which could help the coin grow to $0.12 by the end of the year. This isn't bad considering RTX is currently at $0.1166.

Unfortunately, the project might face competition from more established projects that are already experimenting with cross-border payments. Still, a longer-term Remmitix price prediction targets $0.2, which represents a 2x upside.

BlockDAG is building an L1 that implements a revolutionary DAG-PoW architecture. The goal is to make on-chain transactions more efficient, and in the case of BDAG, the target is 15k transactions per second.

The architecture may also allow BlockDag to strengthen the overall security and bring it to the level of Bitcoin.

Yet, investors have cooled on the project because of the missed August launch and the $600M presale cap, which may indicate that BlockDAG prioritizes earnings in favor of community building.

The BDAG token is $0.0015 with projections that place the end-of-the-year target at $0.00251.

Even though the recovery after the October 10 crash has been slow so far, as traders grow more confident, the market may start pumping heavily.

In the meantime, presales will continue to amass funds and attract new investors hoping to catch the next runner.

Yet, while Remmitix price prediction is bullish and the project oozes quality, DeepSnitch AI is a fresh presale with a unique roadmap that has the potential to hit the big leagues after launch.

With over $420K raised, the snowball effect has already started, which could be a sign of things to come, meaning that DeepSnitch AI could become a moonshot by the end of January 2026.

Join the DeepSnitch AI presale ASAP and take part in the most exciting presale in the ongoing cycle.



Remmitix could reach $0.12 by the end of 2025 and potentially climb to $0.2 long-term, driven by its DeFi-based cross-border payment system.

DeepSnitch AI gained traction after raising over $420K in its presale. The project features five AI agents designed to analyze on-chain data and deliver actionable trading insights, which could help support long-term growth.

Yes. The NFT sector recovered $500M within days, signaling renewed investor confidence.

Interest in XRP and XLM price has once again gone through the roof this week as investors look beyond short-term market trends towards projects that are building long-term utility. The renewed interest in the two tokens is part of a broader search for digital assets to combine scalability, liquidity, and global adoption potential.

This is accompanied by a new DeFi project, Remittix (RTX), which continues to make headlines after it passed through major milestones in its presale phase.



Stellar (XLM) is currently selling at $0.3262, after a significant increase of 0.57 % in the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization is at $10.59 billion, with its volume of trade for the day falling by 28.22 % to $268.23 million.



Ripple's XRP, on the other hand, maintains steady momentum at $2.43, a 1.64 % daily gain, supported by a $148.37 billion market cap and $5.82 billion trading volume, down 29.07 %.



Both XLM price and XRP movements indicate investors are adopting a longer-term approach rather than reacting to daily volatility.

Many holders of these established assets are beginning to diversify into early-stage crypto investments that show practical use cases, and this trend has brought attention to Remittix, a cross-chain DeFi project gaining recognition for its real-world functionality.

Remittix is currently priced at $0.1166 per token, with over $27.4 million raised and 678.5 million tokens sold in its ongoing presale. The project aims to connect digital currencies to traditional finance by enabling users to send crypto directly to bank accounts in 30 + countries — a function rarely offered by today's DeFi projects.

Following its $20 million presale milestone, Remittix announced its first centralized exchange listing on BitMart, followed by a second listing on LBank after reaching $22 million raised. Beta testing for the Remittix Wallet is already live, allowing users to test crypto-to-fiat transfers with low gas fees and instant settlements.

The Remittix team is now fully verified by CertiK and ranked #1 among pre-launch tokens, confirming its position as one of the best crypto presale 2025 contenders.



While XLM price and XRP consolidate in good support levels, market sentiment is shifting towards tokens that demonstrate active development and concrete output. Remittix, with its audited security, working product, and impending listings, fits the bill for what most now call crypto with real utility.

In a hyped-up crowded market, RTX is a nascent crypto project created for adoption, trust, and usability — aspects that are appealing to both XLM and XRP holders seeking long-term value in both centralized and decentralized platforms.

The United Kingdom's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has released detailed guidance on the use of encryption under the UK GDPR. This guidance is a part of the ICO's wider information-security programme and is designed to help organisations use encryption effectively to safeguard personal information.

This article outlines the key points of the ICO's guidance on encryption and its role within an organisation's overall security framework.

The ICO defines encryption as “a process that uses a secret key to encode information, ensuring that only those with access to the key can read it.” In practice, encryption transforms readable information (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext). Decryption reverses the process, restoring the information to its original form when the correct key is used.

The ICO recognizes the resiliency of modern encryption methods, stating that properly implemented modern encryption can resist brute-force guessing for impractically long periods (potentially millions of years, depending on key type and available computing power). This is why encryption is widely recognised as one of the most reliable safeguards against unauthorised access to personal data.

The UK GDPR requires organisations to protect personal data with appropriate technical and organisational measures (also known as TOMs). Encryption is specifically cited in Article 32 as an example of such a measure.

The ICO stresses that encryption is not mandated in every circumstance, nor does the UK demand it as such. Instead, it should be applied based on risk, taking into account the sensitivity of the data, potential harm to individuals, available technology, and proportionality of cost.

That being said, the ICO's guide very succinctly surmised that for most day-to-day scenarios such as sending data across the internet, storing it on devices, or holding it on removable media, encryption is an expected safeguard. For example, the ICO expects all websites to implement HTTPS across every page, not only on login or payment screens.

According to the ICO, there are several common scenarios where encryption should be routine:

The ICO distinguishes between two primary forms of encryption:

The ICO frames encryption as a risk-based decision within a defence-in-depth approach to security. It lays down the following steps which organizations must keep in mind when deciding on encryption:

The ICO reminds organizations that while encryption reduces risk, it does not eliminate it. Keys can be lost, misused, or compromised. Finally, encrypted data still remains personal data under UK data protection law if it relates to an identifiable person.

The ICO strongly advises encrypting all personal data stored on laptops, smartphones, tablets, USB drives, servers, and backup media. Full-disk encryption is highlighted as an essential control and the ICO notes that most operating systems now include this functionality, which encrypts all device data and unlocks it only when a password is entered.

To ensure storage encryption is effective, the ICO recommends:

Failing to encrypt data has led to serious breaches and enforcement action in the past. Conversely, enabling encryption significantly reduces risks to individuals, reputational harm, and regulatory penalties. In the ICO's words, encryption for stored data is a baseline expectation.

The ICO also advises encrypting personal data whenever it is transmitted, whether over the internet, Wi-Fi, or wired networks. Encryption in transit prevents interception and eavesdropping by third parties.

For web services and other networked transfers, the ICO recommends to:

The ICO cautions that transit encryption protects data only while it is moving. Once it arrives at its destination, it must also be protected in storage. Organisations should therefore treat encryption in transit as one part of a wider strategy.

The ICO stresses that effective encryption depends not just on using it, but on choosing and managing it correctly. Organisations must keep in mind the following:

The ICO emphasizes that encryption must sit within a layered security approach. Alongside encryption, organisations should:

The ICO's encryption guidance under UK GDPR makes one point very clear: encryption is no longer optional. It is a widely available, cost-effective tool that should be routinely applied when storing or transmitting personal data.

By choosing trusted methods, managing keys securely, and embedding encryption within a wider security strategy, organisations can not only comply with the law but also protect individuals from harm, strengthen trust, and reduce their own regulatory and reputational risks.

For years, the crypto world has struggled to rebuild trust after the initial coin offering (ICO) craze of 2017 lost steam. That early wave burned out because of unclear rules, heavy speculation, and too many projects that failed to deliver on their promises. Many assumed ICOs were a thing of the past. Yet, quietly and without hype, a new version of the model is starting to surface. MegaETH has sparked fresh attention by opening registration for a token sale through Sonar, a launch platform created by Jordan “Cobie” Fish. What makes this move stand out is not nostalgia for old ICOs, but the fact that the structure is very different from what the industry saw in previous cycles.

Instead of allowing tokens to be sold without oversight or transparency, the Sonar approach focuses on identity, accountability, and meaningful participation. The goal is to give contributors more responsibility and to discourage anonymous speculation and fast exits. This signals a shift away from chaotic presales and toward something more deliberate and credible. Registration for the MegaETH token sale started on October 13, 2025, and will remain open until October 27. Many observers believe this launch could become the first real test of a more responsible and mature version of the ICO model one shaped less by hype and more by structure, clarity, and community involvement.

MegaETH positions itself as a “real-time blockchain” compatible with Ethereum. Its claim is speed and user ownership, not hype or exclusivity. The project already raised $10 million through Echo in December 2024, created its native stablecoin MegaUSD (USDm) with Ethena Labs, and laid out a structure for ecosystem incentives. The choice of Sonar as a launchpad adds another layer. Sonar is not a traditional presale site. Built to promote transparent token sales without the heavy influence of private venture capital, it emphasizes fairness and community engagement. Participants must complete identity verification. Those located in restricted jurisdictions are excluded, and U.S. participants must be accredited investors and comply with a 12-month lockup period. Employees of MegaETH cannot participate at all.

The system is designed to slow speculation and prevent a race for short-term exits. Instead of rewarding those who farm for token allocations, the platform integrates mechanisms that focus on building participation over time.

One of the most notable differences is MegaETH's incorporation of soulbound NFTs through a collection known as The Fluffle. These tokens cannot be traded and function as digital proof of authentic participation. They are tied to a points system that avoids the “earn-and-dump” mentality common in airdrop farming. In a public statement shared in early September 2025, the MegaETH team criticized traditional airdrop systems for encouraging artificial use and draining long-term value. Soulbound rewards instead aim to recognize real supporters while discouraging opportunists. This approach signals a shift away from incentives that attract superficial engagement.

The table below summarizes how the MegaETH sale framework contrasts with earlier ICO mechanics:

 

Sonar's involvement carries weight because of its creator. Jordan “Cobie” Fish, widely known for his role in co-founding Lido, is associated with decentralized initiatives that reject aggressive venture dominance. The platform is self-hosted and promotes accountability as a way to repair reputational damage left by presale-driven launches. This renewed format arrives at a time when sentiment around early token access has shifted. Instead of two-tier systems where VCs receive favorable terms and communities get leftovers, Sonar is positioning itself as a reset point. Whether this model scales depends on adherence to transparency, enforcement of participation rules, and global accessibility.

I recommend you do this asap for the MegaETH sale on Sonar, could be huge.

There is also an X and Discord connection button that may play a role in your allocation.

You need an Echo account to participate (yes, KYC).

But it's quite simple:

If MegaETH's token sale concludes successfully under these parameters, it may influence how future fundraising evolves. Several outcomes become possible:

Crypto networks may adopt stricter alignment between contribution and allocation. Participants who engage through community channels, development, or governance may receive more weight in distribution models.

Regulated yet open-access token launches could challenge VC-dominated private rounds. Instead of deals occurring behind closed doors, projects might blend compliance with inclusivity using identity verification and structured lockups.

Soulbound participation rewards may reduce volatility and wash trading. Binding recognition to community involvement instead of token flipping could change the way value flows in early-stage ecosystems.

Real-time blockchain infrastructure paired with community financing may attract developers, especially as MegaUSD and ecosystem tooling mature.

The deadline of October 27, 2025, is not just a date on the calendar. It marks the first real test of a new approach to token sales one that tries to fix the mistakes of past ICOs without shutting people out. The MegaETH launch on Sonar is not using the ICO model for nostalgia. Instead, it is treating it as a structure that can be rebuilt in a smarter and more responsible way.

Whether this inspires a wider comeback of community-driven token launches will depend on what happens after the sale begins. Success will require careful execution, clear oversight, and a positive response from the public once tokens are distributed. If the approach works, 2025 may not be remembered as a repeat of old speculation but as the moment ICOs were reshaped to fit a more regulated and purpose-driven market.

What happens next will decide if this is a one-time experiment or the beginning of a long-term change in how tokens are introduced to the public.

Source: Freepik

Capita has been handed a record ransomware fine of £14 million by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) after a 2023 cyberattack exposed the personal data of 6.6 million people. The Capita ransomware fine marks the largest penalty ever issued by the ICO for a ransomware-related breach and highlights serious shortcomings in the company's cybersecurity defences.

The ICO investigation revealed that Capita's data breach in 2023 resulted from inadequate security measures that left the systems of the UK's largest outsourcing firm open to attack. Hackers stole nearly one terabyte of information, including pension data, employee details, and sensitive financial records.

The regulator fined Capita plc £8 million and its pensions arm, Capita Pension Solutions Limited £6 million, bringing the total penalty to £14 million. Although this is less than the initial £45 million fine proposed by the ICO, it remains a landmark decision in the UK's approach to ransomware and data protection enforcement.

The UK ransomware attack on Capita began in March 2023 when an employee accidentally downloaded a malicious file. Although a high-priority security alert was triggered within minutes, Capita failed to quarantine the infected device for more than two days.

This delay allowed attackers to move across Capita's network, gain administrator access, and steal massive amounts of data between March 29 and 30, 2023. The next day, ransomware was deployed, locking Capita out of its own systems.

The ICO fine on Capita follows an extensive investigation that found several failures in its incident response. Despite repeated internal warnings about system vulnerabilities, the company failed to implement stronger administrative controls, allowing hackers to escalate privileges and access critical systems.

According to the Information Commissioner's Office, Capita lacked adequate technical and organisational safeguards to protect personal data. Key failings included:

John Edwards, the UK Information Commissioner, said the Capita cybersecurity failures represented a major breach of trust.

“Capita failed in its duty to protect the data entrusted to it by millions of people. The scale of this breach and its impact could have been prevented had sufficient security measures been in place,” he said.

Edwards warned that businesses cannot afford to be complacent. “With so many cyberattacks in the headlines, our message is clear: every organisation, no matter how large, must take proactive steps to keep people's data secure. Cyber criminals don't wait, and neither should businesses.”

Following the Capita data breach 2023, the company offered affected individuals 12 months of free credit monitoring through Experian and set up a dedicated call centre. Over 260,000 people activated the monitoring service.

The ICO acknowledged that Capita cooperated fully during the investigation and made improvements to its cybersecurity posture after the attack. These actions contributed to reducing the total penalty from £45 million to £14 million.

Capita accepted responsibility for the breach and agreed not to appeal the decision, finalising the Capita ransomware fine in a voluntary settlement with the ICO.

The ICO fine on Capita serves as a strong reminder that even established firms are not immune to cyber threats. The regulator urged all organisations to follow the National Cyber Security Centre's (NCSC) guidance, apply the principle of least privilege, and ensure timely response to alerts.

The Capita case reinforces that cybersecurity failures can lead not only to reputational damage but also to record-breaking financial penalties. With ransomware attacks continuing to rise, the message from regulators is clear — investing in security today can prevent severe consequences tomorrow.

Central banks are striving to keep control of the cryptocurrency wave by launching their own digital currencies — but they are moving too slowly and risk being left in the dust as private sector stablecoins sweep all before them.

“In India we are of the view that CBDC is the answer for cross-border payments,” said Sanjay Malhotra, governor of the Reserve Bank of India (pictured), in an onstage interview at the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday.

But unless other countries also adopt CBDCs, India will not see the benefits, Malhotra admitted.

The country is expanding its CBDC pilot programme and launched a retail sandbox for the e-rupee earlier this month. But in the meantime, stablecoins outstanding globally have hit $280bn, according to analysts at Citigroup.

“I would rather urge all those presidents from central banks and other jurisdictions that we need to promote the CBDC, because this has huge advantages over stablecoins,” Malhotra said. “[CBDC] can be tokenised, it can reduce [the cost of] cross-border payments while being fiat, having the advantages of the integrity of money.”

Concern among central bankers that stablecoins might eat CBDCs' lunch is palpable, but in truth there is “no CBDC lunch to eat,” said Timothy Massad, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center on Regulation and Markets.

The Atlantic Council has counted 137 countries and currency unions, representing 98% of global GDP, which are exploring a CBDC. But just three have actually launched one — the Bahamas, Jamaica and Nigeria.

Progress on CBDCs from major global central banks is limited. China is testing a CBDC — the e-CNY. “But you have seen very limited take-up,” Massad told GlobalMarkets.

That is not because China is using stablecoins, but because it already has a fast payments system in Alipay and WeChat Pay.

The European Central Bank has said 2029 is a realistic date to have its CBDC ready and launched, but this is likely to be a best case scenario.

“No one believes quick moves should be done,” Lithuania's vice-minister of finance Januš Kizenevič told GM. A eurozone CBDC was definitely needed, he said. But there are also “huge financial risks” that mean a broader, deeper conversation is needed before anything is launched, he added.

Yet by 2030, when the ECB's proposed CBDC may be only months old, Citi analysts expect stablecoins outstanding to have reached $1.9tr in a base case and $4tr in a bull case. Their predicted band for stablecoin-based transaction activity is $100tr to $200tr.

Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at Circle, the world's largest regulated stablecoin issuer, pointed to emerging use cases that were “impossible when stablecoins were on the edge of finance”.

This includes using stablecoins as collateral in capital markets. “You've seen announcements from Deutsche Börse in Europe partnering with Circle and using our euro-denominated stablecoin as a new form of collateral,” Disparte said.

Last week, 10 leading international banks announced they were jointly exploring a 1:1 stablecoin backed by G7 currencies. The group comprised Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citi, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, MUFG, Santander, Toronto-Dominion and UBS.

But stablecoins' success does not mean CBDCs are doomed. Tom Zschach, chief innovation officer at Swift, expects dollar-denominated stablecoins, tokenised commercial bank deposits and CBDCs to exist side by side — likely serving different use cases.

He pointed to Dubai as a vision of this financial future: “They have all three live, or soon to be live: a central bank digital currency, a tokenised deposit and a stablecoin for things like remittances.”

At an international forum, RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra said that Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) holds the key to making cross-border payments faster and more efficient. India, he said, is already conducting pilot projects for both retail and wholesale CBDCs — the former for daily transactions, and the latter for bank-to-bank settlements. Malhotra noted that India doesn't need CBDC or stablecoins for domestic use, given its robust digital payment ecosystem, but urged other countries to adopt CBDC to realize its full cross-border potential. Emphasizing the risks of cryptocurrencies, he said they have major implications for monetary policy, capital flow control, and money laundering, reinforcing India's preference for a regulated digital rupee.

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra on Wednesday urged other central banks to use and promote Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) instead of stablecoins to facilitate international payments. Speaking at the annual meeting of the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington, DC, Malhotra also reiterated the Indian central bank's stance on cryptocurrencies, saying their usage had implications for monetary policy, capital account flows, and money laundering.

“Unless other countries also adopt CBDC, we are not going to see the benefits of CBDC insofar as cross-border payments are concerned. So, I would urge all those present from central banks and other jurisdictions that we need to promote the CBDC, because this has huge advantages over stablecoins,” Malhotra said in a conversation with Krishna Srinivasan, the Director of the IMF's Asia and Pacific Department.

“It is fiat (money), it has all the advantages of stablecoins, it can be tokenised…and (has) the advantages of singleness of money, the integrity of money. So, all of us need to promote that. Only then we will be able to actually roll it out at a large scale,” he added.

The RBI is currently conducting pilot projects of two types of CBDCs – retail and wholesale. Malhotra said on Wednesday that with domestic payments not an issue in India, CBDCs were the answer for cross-border payments.

Malhotra's comments come days after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman seemingly suggested a shift in the government's stance on stablecoins. Earlier this month at the Kautilya Economic Conclave, Sitharaman had said innovations such as stablecoins were transforming the landscape of money and capital flows and forcing countries to choose between adapting to new monetary architectures or risk being excluded.

“Such developments underscore the scale of the transformation underway. They also remind us that no nation can insulate itself from systemic change. Whether we welcome these shifts or not, we must prepare to engage with them,” the Finance Minister said on October 3 in New Delhi.

Rising acceptance of stablecoins

Sitharaman's comments came at a time when stablecoins – which are essentially private cryptocurrencies linked to an actual asset, usually the US dollar – are seeing increasing acceptance among policymakers.

In June, the US Senate passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act), while the Digital Asset Basic Act bill was introduced in South Korea's National Assembly. Under this bill, domestic firms can issue their own stablecoins pegged to the South Korean won. In May, Hong Kong ‘s Legislative Council passed a stablecoin legislation to establish a licensing regime for local ‘fiat-referenced stablecoins' issuers.

For governments, advancing stablecoins linked to national currencies is also being seen as a way to promote the international standing of their currency. “A thriving stablecoin ecosystem will drive demand from the private sector for US Treasuries, which back stablecoins. This newfound demand could lower government borrowing costs and help rein in the national debt,” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent posted on X on June 17, going on to add two days later that “stablecoins can reinforce dollar supremacy”.

At present, Tether and USDC are the top two stablecoins globally. Both are pegged to the US dollar and make up around 90 per cent of the $285 billion global stablecoin market.

The RBI has previously warned about the dangers of increased acceptance of US dollar-linked private cryptocurrencies, which could result in the dollarisation of the Indian economy – a situation where the US dollar becomes increasingly acceptable in the country and begins to substitute the rupee. This can lead to domestic policies not having their desired impact because the government or the RBI cannot control the supply of the US dollar.

‘Phenomenal' economic growth

Commenting on the Indian economy's performance, Governor Malhotra said growth has been “phenomenal”. He went on to say there were upside risks to the RBI's growth forecast of 6.8 per cent for the current fiscal year should the US tariff issue be resolved.

“We have in our projections actually taken into account the higher tariffs as the baseline. But negotiations are on. Even today, there is a team over here (to negotiate). So, I met the team in the morning over breakfast. They're over here discussing with the US authorities.”

“India is mostly a domestic driven economy. While we are impacted by the higher tariffs, it's not a matter of huge concern. 6.8 per cent, of course, is much below our aspirational levels of growth… But yes, there will be an upside if we are able to have an early resolution to the tariffs,” he added.

India's higher-than-expected growth rate of 7.8 per cent in the April-June quarter has led to an upgrade in forecasts for the current year that will end in March 2026, with the World Bank and IMF both raising their GDP growth forecasts for India for the current year by 20 basis points (bps) this month to 6.5-6.6 per cent. However, with the US levying a total tariff of 50 per cent on Indian goods, risks are seen to next year's growth. As such, the two multilateral organisations also cut their forecasts for India's growth next year by 20 bps to 6.2-6.3 per cent.

Miami, FL, USA, October 16th, 2025, Chainwire

Everstake, the largest global non-custodial staking provider for institutional and retail clients, has achieved two new milestones in its security and compliance program: alignment with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF 2.0) and full compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Together with existing SOC 2 Type II, ISO/IEC 27001:2022, and GDPR compliance, these achievements make Everstake the first crypto staking company to hold all five certifications that define institutional-grade infrastructure. The independent audits were conducted by Prescient Security, a global leader in cybersecurity assurance.

According to EY, 86% of institutional investors already have or plan to gain exposure to digital assets in 2025, with 35% exploring staking for yield, while 55% cite compliance as a key barrier to entering the crypto space. Everstake's five-pillar certification framework bridges this gap, aligning staking with the same security and privacy standards trusted by global financial institutions.

Everstake has completed an independent NIST CSF assessment, with a Cybersecurity Maturity Score of 4.16. Global benchmarks indicate that only 4% of organizations worldwide achieve the “Optimized” level on NIST-aligned maturity scales, positioning Everstake among a select group recognized for its advanced, adaptive cybersecurity practices.

This accomplishment reaffirms Everstake's ongoing investment in security, governance, and technology. A Level 4 score confirms that the company not only meets global standards but also proactively anticipates and adapts to emerging threats—enhancing resilience and institutional confidence.
		



The California Consumer Privacy Act compliance further strengthens Everstake's data protection framework, bringing transparency, user rights, and privacy standards to the U.S.-based customers — complementing its GDPR protections for European users.

The complete certification reports are available upon request.

A 'BitQueen' behind a £5.1billion Chinese investment fraud has given police access to a further £67million worth of cryptocurrency contained on a secret device hidden in her jogging bottoms. 

Prosecutors announced yesterday that the seized digital currency would be used to fund a compensation scheme for 128,000 Chinese investors conned between 2014 and 2017. 

Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, has agreed to give up all her Bitcoin after pleading guilty last month to possessing and transferring criminal property on the first day of her trial at Southwark Crown Court.

The first £5.1 billion of Bitcoin was seized after police raids on her six-bedroom rented house near Hampstead Heath, north London, in 2018 - prompting a battle between Britain and China over where it should end up. 

During interviews in prison with prosecutors and police last month, Qian finally gave access codes for another device alongside passwords for two digital wallets containing £67million of Bitcoin and another cryptocurrency, Ripple.

The stash has been added to the original £5bn Bitcoin hoard, which Chancellor Rachel Reeves has reportedly earmarked to help plug the hole in the public finances.

However, Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions, is establishing a compensation scheme for the victims.

Qian's assistant Jian Wen (pictured) was convicted of money laundering

It is not clear whether they will receive solely their initial investment, or a sum that takes into account the massive increase in Bitcoin's value since they made their investments.  

One Bitcoin was worth around £750 at the start of 2017, when Qian's fraud was exposed, to a record £94,000 this month.

William Glover, from the law firm Fieldfisher, told the Times: 'Some lost their life savings and many of them are elderly or vulnerable. The victims have been without their property for some ten years now and are entitled to recover their property from the Bitcoin frozen in this jurisdiction.

'The frozen Bitcoin does not belong to the UK state. The UK state does not have the right to freely dispose of the frozen Bitcoin over victims' legitimate legal and proprietary interests.'

The CPS last year published a 'notice to the victims of the Lantian Gerui fraud'.

The notice said it had made a property freezing order on December 18, 2023, under the proceeds of crime act 'and will remain in force, prohibiting the dissipation of the property, until the conclusion of the civil recovery proceedings or until further order of the High Court'.

Qian's fraud tricked Chinese investors into ploughing their money into fraudulent wealth schemes before it was transferred over into Bitcoin. 

She then fled China using false documents and entered the UK, where in September 2018 she attempted to launder the proceeds via purchasing property, with the help of an assistant, Jian Wen.

The first £5.1billion of bitcoin was seized during a raid on Qian's Hampstead mansion

The Met did not realise the devices they had seized contained Bitcoin until 2021, by which point Qian had vanished. It is thought to be the largest law enforcement Bitcoin seizure ever. 

She was not charged until April 2024 after she was arrested in York.

Qian emerged from relative obscurity to run a Chinese company called Tianjin Lantian Gerui Electronic Technology, launched in March 2014.

The firm sold investment products with promised returns of up to 300 per cent. In reality, she was simply funnelling her investors' money into Bitcoin for her own enrichment.

Will Lyne, The Met's Head of Economic and Cybercrime Command, said officers were able to gather evidence with the assistance of police in China.

'We were able to obtain compelling evidence of the criminal origins of the cryptoassets Qian attempted to launder in the UK,' he said.

'My thoughts are with the thousands of victims defrauded in this scheme, and I hope today's outcome acknowledges the harm Qian inflicted and reinforces the Met's unwavering commitment to justice.'

Wen was convicted of money laundering and jailed for six years in 2014.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Australia is preparing to grant its anti-money laundering authority extended powers to regulate cryptocurrency ATMs following the government's findings regarding misuse.

Speaking at the National Press Club on Thursday, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke proposed granting new powers to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) to restrict certain ""high-risk products,"" including crypto ATMs, The Guardian reported.

Burke said that, while not every user of a crypto ATM is engaging in wrongdoing, the proportion of illicit use is concerning and difficult for authorities to trace. ""I want AUSTRAC to have the power to restrict, or if it decides to prohibit, high-risk products, and be in no doubt crypto ATMs are a high-risk product,"" he said.

Burke painted a picture of rapid growth in crypto ATMs across Australia — from 23 machines six years ago to roughly 2,000 today — positioning Australia as third in the world for density of such machines, News.com.au reported. He warned that the prevalence of cash-to-crypto transactions makes tracing the funds difficult, and that AUSTRAC had linked crypto ATMs to money laundering, fraud, illicit drugs, and child exploitation. 

AUSTRAC stated on Thursday that Burke's amendment would ""give the AUSTRAC CEO additional options to reduce money laundering risks associated with high-risk products.""

""[Crypto] transactions are becoming integrated into money laundering methodologies and crypto ATMs present even more risks due to the ability to turn cash into digital currency that can be sent instantly and virtually anonymously across the globe,"" said AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas.

Australia isn't alone in tightening oversight of crypto ATMs. In July, New Zealand announced plans to ban crypto ATMs as part of its anti-money laundering efforts. In August, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker signed a bill requiring crypto kiosk and ATM operators to register with state regulators, maintain live customer support, and implement comprehensive anti-fraud and compliance programs.

Oops, something went wrong

The Bank of England (BoE) plans to support the UK's digital asset framework by allowing systemic stablecoin issuers to hold accounts directly at the central bank.

In remarks at DC Fintech Week on Wednesday, deputy governor for financial stability Sarah Breeden said the Bank would “play the role of banker” to large, systemic stablecoin issuers, a move aimed at bolstering financial stability and confidence in digital money.

“In contrast to other jurisdictions where stablecoins have to rely, in effect, on their competitors, commercial banks, to provide them with a bank account, in the UK's regime the Bank of England will play the role of banker to systemic issuers,” Breeden said.

“That avoids the issues we're already starting to see overseas, where stablecoin issuers struggle to access banking services.”

Under the proposed framework, major stablecoin issuers would be required to hold most of their reserves as deposits at the Bank of England, while a portion could be invested in short-term UK government bonds to earn a limited return.

Breeden also revealed that the central bank is considering providing a liquidity facility for these bond investments, allowing solvent issuers to quickly access cash to meet redemptions during times of stress.

Breeden said the BoE's direct role would help prevent contagion risks between commercial banks and stablecoin issuers. “Holding deposits with the central bank mitigates the financial stability risks that could otherwise arise from interconnectedness between commercial banks and systemic stablecoin issuers,” she said.

“It avoids the risk of rapid outflows from a stablecoin backed by commercial bank deposits creating funding challenges for the bank, and it avoids the risk of a bank failure calling into question the solvency of a stablecoin issuer, as we saw in March 2023 when Circle's (CRCL) USDC briefly lost its peg.”

The BoE's central banking and liquidity facilities will, however, only apply to systemic stablecoins — those deemed significant enough to pose a risk to the wider financial system. Smaller issuers will continue to be regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

Breeden also addressed one of the most contentious aspects of the UK's forthcoming stablecoin regime holding limits.

The Bank is considering temporary limits of £10,000 to £20,000 for individuals and up to £10m for businesses, to prevent a sudden flight of deposits from commercial banks into stablecoins.

“Rapid adoption of stablecoins could cause significant outflows of deposits from banks, which could in turn restrict the availability of credit to households and businesses,” Breeden said. “To prevent that, we are considering limits on customers' holdings of systemic stablecoins, aggregate limits on the overall size of a coin, and transaction-size limits.”

She emphasised that these measures would be temporary, and that the limits would be lifted once regulators are confident that stablecoin adoption no longer threatens the flow of credit in the economy.

The BoE is expected to publish a detailed consultation paper by the end of the year, outlining the full framework for regulating systemic stablecoins.

The move comes as global regulators race to catch up with rapid developments in digital money and as the US accelerates its own plans under the Genius Act, part of US president Donald Trump's broader financial deregulation agenda.

On Thursday, Lord Ed Vaizey, former minister for the digital economy and current co-chair of the UK parliament's Crypto and Digital Assets All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), called on the Bank of England to publish its modelling underpinning it's proposals to impose ownership limits of £10,000 to £20,000 for individuals and £10m for businesses on all “systemic” stablecoins.

In a debate in the House of Lords on Thursday he said: “Given the Bank of England's announcement that it plans to regulate how much stablecoin an individual can hold, does this not send a terrible signal to people who want to base their crypto businesses in the UK, and would the government ask the Bank of England to publish their modelling? Because their reasoning is based on the fact that unlimited holdings of stablecoins might lead to a run on bank deposits.”

Sony has taken Wall Street by surprise after its banking division, Sony Bank, filed an application with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to establish a national crypto bank under its subsidiary “Connectia Trust.” 

The move positions the Japanese tech giant to become one of the first major global corporations to issue a U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin through a federally regulated institution.

The application outlines plans to issue a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, maintain the reserve assets backing it, and provide digital asset custody and management services.

The filing places Sony alongside an elite list of firms, including Coinbase, Circle, Paxos, Stripe, and Ripple, currently awaiting OCC approval to operate as national digital banks.

If approved, Sony would become the first major global technology company to receive a U.S. bank charter specifically tied to stablecoin issuance. 

The move shows how far stablecoins have evolved from a crypto niche to a mainstream financial instrument, particularly after the U.S. passed the GENIUS Act, a bill that established a unified federal framework for stablecoin issuers, requiring full backing by cash or Treasuries and ensuring token holder redemption rights.

According to Sony's filing, Connectia Trust plans to issue a USD-pegged stablecoin, hold corresponding reserves in cash or Treasuries, and provide digital asset custody and management services. 

The company said these activities fall within the OCC's previously approved scope of permissible national bank operations.

“During its initial phase, Trust Bank intends to engage in digital asset activities that the OCC has found permissible under existing national bank legal authorities,” Sony Bank wrote in its application. 

“These include the issuance of dollar-pegged stablecoins and maintenance of corresponding reserve assets, non-fiduciary digital asset custody services, and fiduciary asset management for affiliates.”

So far, Anchorage Digital Bank remains the only crypto-native institution to secure a full de novo OCC charter, though it faced compliance challenges that led to a temporary cease-and-desist order in 2022, later lifted this August.

The OCC, an independent bureau of the U.S. Treasury, plays a crucial role here. It is the only regulator that can issue a national bank charter, allowing a firm to legally operate banking activities across all U.S. states under one license. 

An OCC charter has become a prized gateway to legitimacy, granting crypto firms access to the Federal Reserve's payment systems and establishing credibility with institutional partners.

🏦 The US Senate has confirmed former crypto exec Jonathan Gould as OCC chief in a 50–45 vote, naming him the first permanent head since 2020.#OCC #JonathanGould https://t.co/ipM7YhaG8B

The OCC has received over 15 applications from fintech and crypto entities seeking trust charters, a sign of renewed regulatory openness under OCC chief Jonathan Gould, a former blockchain executive confirmed earlier this year.

Gould, who previously served as chief legal officer at Bitfury, has publicly emphasized that the OCC “does not impose blanket barriers” to banks engaged in digital asset activities.

His confirmation marked a policy shift: in May, the OCC issued new guidance explicitly allowing national banks to buy, sell, and custody cryptocurrencies on behalf of clients, provided they meet safety and risk management standards. 

That change has transformed the OCC into a more crypto-friendly regulator under the Trump administration, following several years of hesitation.

Notably, the agency recently approved Erebor Bank for conditional national status, showing a willingness to back digital-first institutions once again.

The regulation clarity has sparked a surge of new OCC applications from financial and tech firms hoping to capitalize on what has become one of crypto's most lucrative markets. 

The total stablecoin market capitalization now exceeds $300 billion, dominated by Tether (USDT) and Circle's USD Coin (USDC), according to DefiLlama.

Forecasts suggest the market could drain $1 trillion from global banks by 2028, making Sony's entry well-timed for a fast-growing segment of the digital economy.

If approved, Connectia Trust would join a new generation of federally chartered digital asset banks. 

The implications go beyond finance. Sony Bank, already known for steady profits from mortgage lending and foreign currency operations, has been expanding aggressively into digital banking. 

Earlier this year, it launched a next-generation banking system and the Sony Bank CONNECT app, designed to link its services with other Sony Group platforms and Web3 infrastructure.

Analysts believe the stablecoin initiative could lay the foundation for Sony's broader ecosystem strategy. 

Like JPM Coin, Connectia Trust's tokens may initially operate as closed-loop settlement assets, used internally for treasury transfers, cross-border payments between subsidiaries, or digital transactions within Sony's entertainment network. 

That could mean stablecoin-powered payments across PlayStation, Sony Music, and Sony Pictures, or instant settlement between Sony's international branches.

Such integration would give Sony an edge in programmable money applications, aligning its financial arm with its global entertainment and gaming businesses, a potential first for a consumer tech conglomerate.

Notably, Sony has been active for a while in the blockchain sector. In January, Sony Group launched Soneiun, an Ethereum layer-2 network built in partnership with Startale Group, extending its reach into decentralized infrastructure. 

The company had first teased the project in 2023, and the chain now holds over $75.87M in total locked value.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has granted preliminary approval to Erebor Bank, a new financial institution backed by billionaire Peter Thiel and other tech investors. The decision marks the first new national bank charter approved under Comptroller Jonathan Gould.

Erebor filed its application on June 11 and received approval after a four-month review. The bank is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio.

“I am committed to a dynamic and diverse federal banking system, and our decision today is a first but important step in living up to that commitment,” Gould said in a statement. He added that the OCC “does not impose blanket barriers to banks that want to engage in digital asset activities.”

The approval represents a shift in regulatory approach toward crypto-linked banking. Previous OCC leadership took a more restrictive stance after the 2023 collapse of several crypto-friendly banks.

Erebor still must clear compliance, cybersecurity, and capital adequacy reviews before beginning operations. This process could take several months.

The bank plans to serve clients in artificial intelligence, defense, manufacturing, and digital assets sectors. It will also work with payment processors, venture funds, and trading firms.

According to its filings, Erebor expects to hold about $1 million in cryptocurrency for transactional purposes. This indicates limited but deliberate exposure to digital assets.

A source close to the company told the Financial Times that Erebor aims to be “a stable, low-risk, reliable bank doing normal banking things without screwing everyone over with undue risk.” The bank is positioning itself as a replacement for Silicon Valley Bank, which collapsed in March 2023.

Silicon Valley Bank's failure left tech startups and crypto firms without stable banking partners. Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank also collapsed or were taken over during the same period.

Rising interest rates made it harder for companies to secure financing. Many tech firms and crypto businesses struggled to find traditional banking services.

Erebor's founders include Palmer Luckey, founder of Anduril Industries, and Joe Lonsdale, a venture capitalist. The backing of these tech industry figures has helped the bank gain regulatory approval.

The bank will operate as a full-service national bank offering deposits and lending services. It plans to integrate digital asset operations under federal regulations.

The approval comes during a period of regulatory change in Washington. President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act, which establishes rules for stablecoin issuers.

Congress is considering additional legislation on crypto market structure and limits on central bank digital currencies. Several crypto companies are now seeking expanded regulatory approval.

Coinbase applied for a national trust company charter with the OCC. The exchange said it does not plan to become a bank but wants to expand into payments and custody services.

Circle, which issues the USDC stablecoin, has applied to establish a national trust bank. Ripple Labs filed for a similar license.

Banking and credit union trade groups have opposed granting bank charters to crypto companies. They cited policy and process concerns in their objections.

Caitlin Long, founder of Custodia Bank, said the issue will likely end up in court. She argued that questions about trust charters functioning as bank charters may need judicial review.

In May, the OCC issued guidance confirming that banks can buy and sell cryptocurrencies held in custody for customers. The policy allows banks to outsource crypto custody to third parties if they meet safety standards.

Gould was confirmed by the Senate in June with a 50-45 vote. He became the OCC's first permanent comptroller since 2020.

His background includes work at Bitfury, a blockchain technology company. Under his leadership, the OCC removed references to “reputation risk” from its guidance documents.

Some lawmakers have raised concerns about crypto's growing political ties. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen, and Ron Wyden asked Gould to investigate potential conflicts of interest related to Trump's involvement in crypto ventures.

HCM CIY — U2U Network, a layer-1 blockchain platform developed by Vietnamese engineers, has announced that its native token, $U2U, will be listed on Kraken, one of the most reputable and strictest digital asset exchanges in the world, on October 17. 

It marks a major step forward for “Make in Vietnam” blockchain technology by meeting the stringent standards required to be listed on one of the oldest and most trusted exchanges in the industry.

Founded in 2011 and headquartered in the US, Kraken is renowned for its compliance, transparency and security. It legally operates in more than 190 countries, has over 10 million users worldwide and ranks among the top exchanges globally by trading volume alongside Binance and Coinbase.

Renowned for its rigorous due diligence and conservative listing standards, over 14 years of operation, it has listed fewer than 500 tokens. 

Chloe Phùng, co-founder and CEO of U2U Network, said: “We want to prove that Việt Nam is capable of developing a world-class blockchain platform with real applications, real users and real value.”

Being listed on Kraken is a significant milestone, but, more importantly, it validates U2U's prudent, transparent and sustainable approach to entering the US market, she added.

Built on DAG (directed acyclic graph) architecture optimised for speed and EVM compatibility, U2U processes over 17,000 transactions per second with finality of less than 1 second and extremely low costs.

The project has more than 1.4 million global users and supports over 100 projects developing or committed to building on its platform.

Messari, a leading crypto market intelligence firm, ranks U2U among the top three Global DePIN Layer-1 blockchains, recognising its pioneering role in developing blockchain infrastructure connected to practical applications.

U2U Network is backed by the digital arm of SSI Securities Corporation, KuCoin Ventures, Chain Capital, and AWS.

Nguyễn Duy Hưng, chairman of SSI, said: “A Vietnamese company meeting the listing standards of a Tier-1 US exchange clearly proves that we can build globally competitive technology. U2U Network not only represents a successful blockchain project but also embodies the creativity and strategic vision of Vietnamese people in taking local technology to the world.” — VNS

Ripple, the blockchain firm closely associated with the XRP Ledger (XRP) network, is acquiring treasury software provider GTreasury for $1 billion, pushing deeper into corporate finance.

GTreasury's treasury platform, used by Fortune 500 enterprise for managing cash, foreign exchange and risk, will become part of Ripple's expanding suite of financial tools, the firm told CoinDesk on Thursday. The acquisition is set to close in the coming months, subject to regulatory approvals, it added.

The deal brings Ripple into direct contact with large treasury departments, many of which still rely on legacy systems to manage billions in liquidity, as the digital asset company works towards making its blockchain infrastructure central to how enterprises manage money.

""For too long, money has been stuck in slow, outdated payments systems and infrastructure, causing unnecessary delays, high costs, and roadblocks to entering new markets -- problems that blockchain technologies are ideally suited to solve,"" Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a statement.

""Ripple's and GTreasury's capabilities together bring the best of both worlds, so treasury and finance teams can finally put their trapped capital to work, process payments instantly, and open up new growth opportunities,"" he added.

Ripple, best known for its cross-border payments network, is increasingly positioning itself as a broader provider of financial services infrastructure underpinned by digital assets and blockchain tech.

The firm rolled out its U.S. dollar stablecoin last year, which swelled over $840 million in supply available on XRP Ledger (XRP) and Ethereum. 

Ripple also offers custody services for digital assets via its institutional custody arm, born out of the acquisition of Swiss crypto specialist Metaco.

The GTreasury deal set to be Ripple's third acquisition of this year multi-asset prime broker Hidden Road for $1.25 billion and stablecoin payments platform Rail for $200 million, as part of a coordinated effort to build out the building blocks of a full-stack crypto-powered finance platform.

Crypto Markets Today: Bearish October Continues as Altcoins Dealt Hammer Blow

Crypto markets extended their steep losses Thursday as altcoins plunged and bitcoin tested key support, with derivatives data showing cautious sentiment amid fading liquidity.

Even as more firms board the bitcoin treasury bandwagon, their collective appetite for scooping up BTC has weakened.

That decline is nothing short of drastic when you look at the numbers. The seven-day moving average of net daily inflows into bitcoin digital asset treasuries (DATs) recently dropped to 140 BTC, marking the lowest level since mid-June and a sharp decline from a July peak of 8,249 BTC, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net.

Things look even bleaker when you zoom in on daily activity this month: 12 out of 15 days saw under 500 BTC flowing in, including multiple days with no inflows whatsoever.

It tells us that institutional appetite for exposure to BTC via traditional market vehicles has weakened after a period of aggressive buying early this year that helped prop up BTC prices.

Interestingly, bitcoin's price rally has cooled off sharply, dropping to nearly $110,000 after hitting a record high of over $126,000 on October 6. Zooming out, the market has been consolidating within a broad range above $110,000 since June, reflecting a tug-of-war between bullish optimism and profit-taking.

The DAT trend, pioneered by the likes of Strategy, follows a centuries-old playbook of borrowing fiat to acquire scarce, hard assets.

This article is part of CoinDesk's Bitcoin Treasuries Theme Week, sponsored by Genius Group.

Bitcoin, with its fixed supply capped at 21 million coins and the best performance among major assets over the last decade, has drawn demand from a growing number of digital asset treasuries seeking to hedge inflation and diversify reserves. So far, the top 100 public DATs by market value have cumulative acquired over 1 million BTC.

However, like gold, BTC doesn't offer an inherent yield, which means that coins acquired with borrowed money sit idle on the balance sheet without any offsetting cash flow. The DAT trend, therefore, is a bet that prices will continue to rise, generating capital gains. It's similar to running a ompany focused on acquiring gold, which is also a zero-yielding asset. 

The most popular strategy has been to issue stock at a premium to the net asset value (NAV), followed by issuing debt to finance purchases. The premium is the result of the narrative, ""a memetic premium based on the figurehead at the company – you know them by name,"" NYDIG said.

These firms, therefore, stand exposed to a situation where they either fail to generate sufficient memetic premium to increase their crypto per share or investors liquidate their share holdings, causing the premium to NAV to collapse.

That's already happening. Approximately one in four publicly traded DATs now trade below their net asset value (NAV), meaning their market valuations are less than the value of the cryptocurrencies they hold on their balance sheets.

According to NYDIG, these premiums are positively correlated to prices, which means a downtrend in BTC's price could see these premiums evaporate.

This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

Bitcoin's BTC$110,901.10 price recovery following Friday's crash has been tepid at best, leaving prices dangerously close to the key support zone. The outcome here could set the stage for significant moves.

BTC rallied to $116,000 after Friday's sharp drop, during which prices fell to nearly $105,000 on several exchanges. However, as anticipated, the recovery was brief, with prices falling back to trade near $110,000 amid bearish signals from key momentum indicators.

According to the daily candlestick chart, the $107,000 to $110,000 range forms a crucial support zone, identified by intraday highs from December to January and intraday lows from September. The convergence of these highs and lows suggests both bulls and bears have struggled to assert control in this region, making it a pivotal battleground for the market. Besides, the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) is now located at around $107,500.

This raises a crucial question: what happens if the $107,000–$110,000 support zone fails to hold? A potential breakdown would indicate that sellers have gained the upper hand, exposing bitcoin to a deeper sell-off.

The first line of support in that case could be $98,330, the swing low registered on June 22. Below this, the focus would shift to the lower end of the ascending channel, currently seen at around $82,000.

Recent price action within a well-defined bullish channel, drawn by connecting the higher lows from October 2023 and August 2024 with a parallel trendline through the high in March 2024, suggests overbought conditions and scope for a deeper pullback.

Bitcoin's uptrend since 2023 has been mostly steady and sustainable, as shown by price movements contained within a parallel channel sloping at approximately 45 degrees.

In recent weeks, bitcoin's price has repeatedly topped the upper boundary of the well-defined channel, signaling moments of over exuberance or overbought conditions. These breakouts signaled moments of over exuberance or overbought conditions, but have been short-lived, with prices quickly falling back to suggest buyer exhaustion.

Thus, a deeper sell-off cannot be ruled out. Note how prices repeatedly failed to establish a sustained foothold above the upper boundary in December-January. This repeated rejection eventually paved the way for a sharp slide, with prices falling to around $75,000.

That said, traders need to watch for a bounce from the crucial $107,000–$110,000 support zone. A strong rebound here, coupled with a quick invalidation of lower highs through a move above $116,000, could set BTC on a path toward challenging its record highs.

 Onchain data suggests that BitMine acquired 104,336 ETH, worth approximately $417 million, on Thursday, as prices fell 20% from their August highs, bringing its treasury to over 2.5% of the total supply. 

The world's largest Ether (ETH) digital asset treasury, BitMine, has reportedly bought the dip again as ETH continues to retreat from its August all-time high.

Tom Lee-chaired BitMine Immersion Technologies reportedly scooped up a further 104,336 Ether worth around $417 million on Thursday, according to onchain data. 

Over the past seven hours, three new wallets received the assets from Kraken and BitGo, Lookonchain reported. BitMine has not publicly confirmed the transactions. 

“Despite the crypto market crash, Tom Lee still predicts ETH will hit $10,000 by year-end,” Lookonchain added. 

Earlier this week, Lee and BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes doubled down on their prediction that Ether will hit $10,000 this year.

Blockchain intelligence firm Arkham agreed with the findings, stating that three new whale wallets just acquired $75 million in ETH each. “The acquisition patterns match BitMine ETH acquisitions from BitGo,” they said. 

Cointelegraph contacted BitMine for confirmation of the purchase but did not receive an immediate response. 

BitMine bought the dip earlier this week following the weekend crypto market rout. On Monday, the firm announced that it acquired 202,037 ETH tokens “over the past few days,” taking advantage of the lower prices.  

“The crypto liquidation over the past few days created a price decline in ETH, which BitMine took advantage of,” said Tom Lee at the time. 

Digital asset treasuries, such as BitMine, appear to be unfazed by the recent crypto market turmoil, using the opportunity to buy the dips. 

BitMine has now reached 50% of its treasury target in just a few months, having accumulated a whopping 3 million ETH, equivalent to 2.5% of the entire supply.

Its holdings also represent half of the Ether accumulated by all public corporate treasuries, which currently stands at 5.9 million ETH, worth $23.7 billion, according to StrategicEthReserve.

The dip buying comes as Ether markets continue to trend downward. 

ETH fell to $3,945 in late trading on Wednesday, representing a 20% decline from its August all-time high of $4,946.  

It had regained a little composure at the time of writing, trading just above the psychological $4,000 level.

However, Lee is among many experts and analysts who are confident that Ether will resume its bull run over the next couple of months.

“Ethereum is copying Bitcoin's 2020-2021 run,” said analyst “Rekt Fencer,” who added that “$15,000 for ETH is still on the table this cycle.”

Meanwhile, market analyst “Crypto Bullet” compared chart patterns from Bitcoin (BTC) in 2024 to Ether in 2025, stating that they are “exactly the same pattern,” before predicting an Ether move up to $6,000 to $7,000 this year.

 Crypto executives have tipped Ether to rise as high as 200% by the end of the year, led by corporate Ether purchases, ETF accumulation and Ether locked in staking. 

Nearly all of the Ethereum accumulated by public companies to date occurred within a three-month window between July and September, according to recent data.

This comes as several crypto executives predict the price of Ether (ETH) will rise by as much as 200% before the end of the year. 

“95% of all ETH held by public companies was purchased in the past quarter alone,” Bitwise Invest said on Wednesday, referring to the $19.13 billion held in public treasuries, equivalent to roughly 4% of Ether's total supply.

Of the 4.63 million ETH held on public company balance sheets as of Sept. 30, roughly 4 million were added during the third quarter, according to Bitwise.

The concentration of ETH buying activity in Q3 raises questions about what lies ahead for Ether during the fourth quarter of 2025, which is historically Ether's second-worst performing quarter on average, according to CoinGlass.

Ether (ETH) was trading above $4,300 before Friday's crypto marketwide sell-off, which triggered over $19 billion in liquidations across the market. It has since fallen below the key $4,000 level, changing hands at $3,980, according to CoinMarketCap.

However, the new treasury narrative has some analysts predicting a stronger-than-usual finish.

At the time of publication, BitMine Immersion Technologies holds the largest share with approximately 3.03 million ETH, followed by Sharplink Gaming with 840,120 ETH, and The Ether Machine with 496,710 ETH, according to StrategicETHReserve.

Both BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes and BitMine chair Tom Lee have projected ETH to reach $10,000 by year-end, with Lee suggesting a possible climb to $12,000.

Sharplink Gaming co-CEO Joseph Chalom said on Wednesday that he is “bullish” about Ethereum as it is “the best choice for institutions.”

“It's decentralized, secure and continuously growing its network,” Chalom said.

Chalom told Cointelegraph Magazine that one of Sharplink Gaming's top priorities is “to raise capital and accumulate as much ETH as possible.”

Analysts also point to catalysts beyond corporate treasuries, including steady inflows into US spot Ether ETFs and the large share of ETH that remains locked in staking contracts.

“40% OF THE ENTIRE SUPPLY IS GONE FROM CIRCULATION. THIS IS THE SETUP FOR AN ETHEREUM SUPERCYCLE,” Merlijn The Trader said in an X post on Wednesday.

On Wednesday, Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Trading Capital, said that the “$ETH vs. $BTC has barely started.” 

“The first uptick has happened, just like 2019,” van de Poppe said, explaining that there's so much more upside to come, we don't have to comprehend and understand that it's possible.”

“But yes, it will come,” van de Poppe added.

Can We Bury Enough Wood to Slow Climate Change?

Wood vaulting, a simple, low-tech approach to storing carbon, has the potential to remove 12 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year—and some companies are already trying it

Humanity has only so much time to limit global warming and minimize the severity of future climate disasters. And with mostly tepid attempts to slash greenhouse gas emissions, researchers are scrambling for realistic ways to pull carbon out of the atmosphere. Flashy, high-tech proposals that promise to vacuum pollutants out of the sky, or to scrub them from smokestacks before they hit the atmosphere, have attracted attention and investment—but are falling far short of expectations. Now a growing number of scientists and entrepreneurs are trying a vastly simpler approach: collecting truckloads of logs, branches, wood chips and sawdust—and burying them.

Wood burial, also called wood vaulting or biomass burial, could potentially store more than 12 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year and decrease global warming by more than a third of a degree Celsius (more than half a degree Fahrenheit), according to a recent study in Nature Geoscience. This difference sounds small, but preventing a few tenths of a degree of warming could keep polar ice caps from completely disintegrating, coral reefs from collapsing and other tipping points from triggering.

“If we want to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere,” says the study's lead author Yiqi Luo, a Cornell University ecosystem ecologist, “we basically need to create new reservoirs in land, ocean or geological structures.”

The concept is straightforward: instead of constructing massive machines to collect atmospheric carbon dioxide and inject it miles into the Earth's crust, wood vaulters simply divert materials from Earth's fast-paced biological carbon cycle into the much-slower geological carbon cycle.

“Every year, terrestrial plants alone capture six times as much carbon as our fossil fuel emissions,” says Ning Zeng, a University of Maryland climate scientist, who has been a leader in the field of biomass burial for two decades and was not involved in the new research. “But pretty much all of that goes back into the atmosphere as leaves fall and trees die and decay.” If carbon dioxide is buried under just a few yards of dirt—where bacteria no longer have the oxygen they need to break down woody tissues—however, none or very little of it is released. If even a small fraction of woody debris that decays aboveground each year was treated this way, it would be easier to achieve the 10 billion tons per year of carbon that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the United Nations body that is responsible for informing global climate policies) agrees must be achieved by 2050 in order to keep the planet's temperature rise to less than two degrees C (3.6 degrees F).

Mast Reforestation

The new study by Luo and his team shows that global logging alone involves more than enough wood to reach that benchmark. As they await the axe, trees in logging-focused forests take up roughly 170 billion tons of carbon every year, 14 billion tons of which finds its way into wood. The researchers contend that all of this wood eventually ends up wasted in one form or another: branches cut from trees before processing, sawmill debris, landfilled furniture, demolished homes. If all this wood could be collected and buried instead of burned or allowed to decompose, those 14 billion tons of carbon would be safely removed every year. And according to the research team's models, this would remove a grand total of at least 770 billion tons from the atmosphere by 2100, turning the global thermostat down by at least 0.35 degree C (0.63 degree F).

There's no reason to doubt the study's math or methods, says Kevin Fingerman, a professor and carbon accounting expert at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt. But as the proposed technique gets implemented in the real world, practitioners would need to carefully and accurately calculate how much carbon their vaults have kept out of the atmosphere. This would involve assessing what the fate of the wood would have been without intervention—and that's no trivial feat. “It's somewhere between difficult and impossible to prove what would happen to this particular pile of biomass if we hadn't buried it,” Fingerman says. “We can never really know.”

In practice, of course, it likely won't be feasible to divert every single scrap of wood from dumpster to earthen vault and achieve the maximum amount of carbon capture that Luo has calculated. But collecting the debris from lumber and forestry projects is feasible, and several start-ups have already begun to do so.

In Colorado, for instance, Serge Bushman and his company Woodcache have collected and buried leftover logging debris from forest thinning operations aimed at reducing fire risks, diverting it from being burned or decaying in the open air. They claim that their first commercial project alone should prevent more than 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere, and they've got several more under development in the U.S. Mountain West and the Southeast.

Another start-up, Mast Reforestation, has cut down dead and burned trees on a plot of private land in Montana, removing what the company estimates is 5,000 tons of carbon in its first phase, with the potential for 30,000 tons in the long run, says CEO Grant Canary. The carbon credits they sell will be used to fund the reforestation of the burned and denuded acreage, a program Canary hopes to repeat in burned forests throughout the West. Zeng also has his own company, Carbon Lockdown, which has completed a couple of demonstration projects in the Northeast and has one 5,000-ton project underway.

Though more research is needed to prove that biomass burial works in practice the way that the theories say it should, Zeng's own work has shown that wood interned in clay soils can remain stable for millennia. Clay's fine-grained structure ensures that little to no oxygen reaches buried wood, preventing bacteria from decomposing it. In 2013 his team unearthed a red cedar log that had been preserved in clay for 3,775 years.

Construction of the first trench of the world's first commercial-scale wood vault, near the Potomac River, where the equivalent of 100 metric tons of carbon dioxide were buried.

Ning Zeng

But no matter what's been shown in the past, each wood vault must be robustly monitored to ensure the wood is staying stable as planned. This is why Mast, Woodcache and Carbon Lockdown design their wood vaults to include instruments that will, for example, monitor methane coming off the soil surface. Abnormally high values could indicate the wood is decomposing faster than expected, which would suggest the vault may need to be opened and potentially redesigned.

Though there are some potential obstacles to implementing wood vaulting—such as concerns over roads being able to handle heavy machinery or about securing bank financing—there are fewer such impediments compared with large direct-air-capture machines, says Holly Jean Buck, an environmental social scientist at the University at Buffalo, who focuses on carbon removal and geoengineering. Communities are far more likely to support something that they perceive as natural than something that involves lacing miles of pipeline through their communities (which would be necessary in many direct-capture scenarios), she says.

Given the investments pouring into much more complex and futuristic climate tech ventures, the implications of Luo's paper amuse Buck. “What if the answer was just digging a hole and putting some wood in there?” she says. “A kindergartner could figure that out.”

A Mathematical Paradox Shows How Combining Losing Strategies Can Create a Win

In certain circumstances, losses create a sure path to victory, an idea with implications for biology and cancer therapy

By Manon Bischoff edited by Daisy Yuhas

Filo/Getty Images (images); Scientific American (animation)

In 1996 Spanish physicist Juan Parrondo made an incredible discovery: sometimes two games that each end in loss individually can be combined into a winning strategy. This paradox is no mere mathematical curiosity—it's scientifically useful. It helps explain the varied life histories of slime molds and could contribute to new cancer therapy strategies.

To understand this paradox, we need to imagine a situation in which you play two games with some very specific parameters. For instance, let's imagine that the first game, “A,” involves a coin toss. The coin in this case has a weight distribution has been slightly altered so that it lands preferentially on one side with a probability of 50.5 percent. Now let's assume that Game A is somewhat rigged so that I win if it lands on the preferred side and you win if it lands on the other side. You can therefore only win with a probability of 49.5 percent and, in this case, I will give you $1; otherwise you will pay me the same amount.

If you play Game A against me many times, you will inevitably sustain a lot of losses because you have to pay me an average of one cent per game. (We can calculate that quickly by taking the likelihood of your win and subtracting the likelihood of my win: 0.495 – 0.505 = –0.01.)

Then there is a second, more complicated game, “B,” that involves spinning two wheels of fortune. For this game, you will get to spin one or the other based on how much money you currently have. If your available capital for the game (based on how you've been playing A) is evenly divisible by 3, then you spin a wheel of fortune that gives you a chance of winning of only 9.5 percent. If, on the other hand, your capital is not divisible by 3, then you get better odds: you spin another wheel that gives you a 74.5 percent chance of winning.

Now things get interesting.

In Game B, the stake is once again $1. On average, you will lose 87 cents per spin.

Let's dig into that. You might assume that one third of the time, you will spin the wheel that's unfavorable for you and two thirds of the time, you will spin the other wheel. But that's incorrect because your money doesn't fluctuate evenly. For example, if you have $9, you'll spin the unfavorable wheel and will likely lose, leaving you with only $8. If you play the game again with that amount, however, you'll spin the wheel that's more favorable for you and will have a higher chance of winning. So you'll end up with $9 again.

The probability that you have sum of money divisible by 3 is therefore significantly more than one third. Using a complicated procedure known as a Markov chain, you can calculate that your overall probability of winning Game B is just 49.565 percent—and your expected profit per round is negative: 0.49565 – 0.50435 = –0.0087.

If you're smart, you wouldn't play against me in either Game A or Game B. In both cases, you're bound to lose in the long run. But Parrondo realized that a mixed strategy can pay off: by alternating between Games A and B, you can actually win overall.

For example, if you always play two rounds of Game A followed by two rounds of Game B, you'll win an average of 1.48 cents per round. Or if you follow each A round with two B rounds, you'll earn an average of 5.8 cents per round. So in the long run, you'd see a profit in both cases.

As Parrondo discovered, there are more combinations of A and B that have a positive expected value for you than vice versa. Therefore, you emerge as a winner even if you randomly choose whether to play A or B each round (for example, by letting a fair coin decide). In this case, your average win is 1.47 cents per round.

How is this possible? The key to the Parrondo's paradox is that the two games A and B can influence each other because Game B depends on the money you currently have, and that amount fluctuates as you play Game A. Therefore, A and B can no longer be viewed as independent games. This is the core of Parrondo's paradox. If Game B were modified so that, for example, the value of a die determined which wheel of fortune you would spin, the paradox would disappear because both games would be completely independent of each other.

Since Parrondo's surprising publication in 1996, numerous papers have appeared on the topic. In 2017 two computer scientists demonstrated that this paradox can explain the varied life strategies of slime molds, which can alternate between a solitary, nomadic life and a stationary colony.

In some situations, it's more advantageous for these beings to gather together to form colonies instead of existing as solitary wanderers. But these communal living arrangements cannot survive in the long run either: the organisms exploit their environment, and eventually the resources start to deplete. Sticking to one strategy would inevitably lead to death, but a mixed strategy offers a solution: the organisms temporarily become mobile again while the environment in a particular area regenerates.

Computational physicist Jian-Yue Guan of Lanzhou University in China and her colleagues presented another application of Parrondo's paradox in a paper published in Physical Review E in August 2025. For many types of cancer, two different approaches to chemotherapy are used. Patients either receive the maximum tolerated dose at specific intervals or they are treated continuously with a low dose. The first strategy has the disadvantage that some tumor cells develop resistance and thus do not respond to the medication. In the second strategy, the drug concentration is not always high enough to completely eradicate all cancer cells.

Through computer simulations, the researchers demonstrated that switching between the two medication approaches at set times could lead to better results even without detailed monitoring—much like a random order of A and B is advantageous in the lottery example. Whether this theoretical approach can truly be applied to cancer medicine needs further investigation. Guan and her team plan to test their ideas with in vitro studies.

The unidentified stone idol appeared in the earth as archaeologists excavated an ancient fortress in present-day Armenia.

Here is what you will learn when you read this story:

As archaeologists excavated the ruins of the fortified city of Argishtikhinili, built some 2,500 years ago on Surb Davti Blur Hill in Armenia, a lost civilization began to emerge. It was all that was left of the once mighty kingdom of Urartu in the South Caucasus. Among the rubble was a crumbling cityscape of terraced houses and floors, paved in adobe and stone. Then, as dust was cleared from ceramic vessels and other artifacts in a storage room, a strangely humanoid face carved from volcanic stone began to materialize.

The identity of this unknown face is a mystery. Archaeologist Mateusz Isra of the Polish Center of Mediterranean Archaeology at the University of Warsaw, who led a team of Polish and Armenian researchers in unearthing what remained of Argishtikhinili, thinks it may be an idol venerated by the Urartian people at a time when Urartu was in decline. It still stands just as it did thousands of years ago; at about 1.6 feet (half a meter) high, the face of this figure was sculpted with a long, slender nose between close-set eyes and a stoically narrow mouth. It seems to mirror similar sculptures that ancient Armenians built to honor ancestors or use for ritual purposes in fertility cults.

Found next to the idol was a stone chest, one that may offer deeper insights into ritual practices. Subjecting the chest to chemical analysis could reveal organic residues of offerings, such as the remnants of wine and hallucinogens found in Egypt's Bes mugs, or other materials used for specific rituals.

Figures discovered in Armenian sites from this time period have revealed that the spiritual roots of the Urartians ran deep, even in everyday life. What is known about their religion is they worshipped a pantheon of deities, some indigenous, some assimilated from recent conquests, many derived from earlier Mesopotamian and Anatolian beliefs. Many of their names were inscribed in a mountain niche outside the capital of Tushpa, also known as Van.

Along with the names of 79 gods literally set in stone were lists of the sacrifices that should be made to them. If further studies find residues in the chest that match the sacrifices mandated for a given deity, this could indicate that the idol may have been made in the image of that deity.

The most important of the Urartian gods were supreme deity Haldi, Teisheba, who ruled over storms and thunder, and Sun god Shivini, whose winged solar disk was likely borrowed from the Egyptian solar god Ra. There were also local gods and goddesses named after the settlements they were believed to watch over. If the idol was one of these gods, they would have been referred to as “the god of the city of Argishtikhinili.”

While there are no surviving Urartian temples, Assyrian reliefs from the same time period offer a glimpse inside them, and fortresses were also associated with certain deities. Because Argishtikhinili was a fortress, it is possible that it doubled as a place of worship that would have been called “the fortress of” the deity it honored. That could mean the idol is the face of the fortress deity. While the religious art of Urartu often took the form of bronze figurines, gods were also depicted on storeroom walls, and there is a possibility that the storeroom where archaeologists found the stone idol rose may have once been painted with the image of the deity it was supposed to represent.

Was that deity Haldi? Nobody knows. Haldi was often engraved on the trappings of war, including weapons and shields, though no such artifacts were found at the Surb Davti Blur Hill site. Future investigations may finally show us the idol's real face.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Many of the paleontologists working today are part of the “Jurassic Park generation”—an entire legion of scientists inspired by Steven Spielberg's famous dino-fueled action film. Although Jurassic Park captured the scientific imagination of its audience, it didn't get everything right about dinosaurs. Many theropods, for example, likely had feathers (including the fearsome Tyrannosaurus Rex and Velociraptor), and most of the dinosaurs in the film didn't even live during the Jurassic period. 

But when it comes to amber being an invaluable time capsule of Earth's dinosaur days, Jurassic Park scores a perfect 10. Now, a new study from the journal Communications Earth & Environment reinforces that fact. Xavier Delclòs, a researcher from the University of Barcelona (who led the study), and his team detail the first amber deposit encasing an arthropod to ever be discovered in South America. 

Discovered in the Hollín Formation (a sedimentary layer that stretches across Ecuador's Oriente Basin and is well-known for its oil reserves) in quarries located in the eastern part of the Ecuadorian Andes, this amber isn't the first discovered from petroleum drilling cores. But it is the first to yield sufficient quantities ripe for paleontological study—it contained various arthropods, pollen, and plant material. Delclòs and his team examined three quarries, and the largest sample came from the Genoveva quarry. The researchers dated this amber to around 112 million years ago (the Albian age during the Cretaceous period). 

While it's not exactly the dino DNA find portrayed in Jurassic Park, it still provides an unprecedented snapshot into life on the ancient supercontinent Gondwana, which included two-thirds of today's continental area.

“The Genoveva amber represents the largest Mesozoic amber deposit in South America and is one of the few deposits in the Southern Hemisphere with abundant amber during the Cretaceous Resinous Interval (175 million to 72 million years ago), making it critical for global studies of this Cretaceous phenomenon,” the authors wrote. 

The researchers found two types of resin—one that formed near the roots of resin-producing plants and another that formed in the open air. Of the 60 open-air samples, 21 featured “bio-inclusions”—trapped remnants of plants and animals that included flies, beetles, and wasps. The rock surrounding these amber time capsules also contained a variety of plant fossils, including pollen and spores. The amber and fossils together paint a picture of a warm, humid Gondwana forest teeming with plant and animal life.

“This discovery and the associated plant remains in the amber-bearing rocks enhance our understanding of the Gondwanan arthropod fauna and flora inhabiting forests along its western margin during a time interval of major ecosystem transformation,” the authors wrote. 

The scientists hope that future fieldwork from this deposit will reveal connections among other Gondwana regions—including Antarctica, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, which also contain similar amber deposits—and more details about the Age of Dinosaurs.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","From poison to power: How lead exposure helped shape human intelligence","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251015230952.htm","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 14:32:46 GMT","

What made the modern human brain so different from that of our extinct relatives, such as Neanderthals? Researchers at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine, along with an international team, have discovered that ancient hominids, including early humans and great apes, came into contact with lead far earlier than previously believed -- up to two million years before modern humans began mining it. This long-term exposure may have influenced how early brains evolved, possibly hindering language and social development in all but modern humans, who possess a unique protective genetic variant. The findings were published in Science Advances on October 15, 2025.

The team examined fossilized teeth from 51 hominids found across Africa, Asia, and Europe. The samples included both modern and archaic humans such as Neanderthals, early human ancestors like Australopithecus africanus, and extinct great apes including Gigantopithecus blacki.

Lead traces were present in 73% of the fossils studied, with 71% of modern and archaic human samples showing contamination. Fossils of G. blacki dating back 1.8 million years revealed the highest levels of acute exposure.

It was previously thought that humans began facing significant lead exposure only in recorded history, especially during the Roman era, when lead pipes were used for water systems, and later during the Industrial Revolution. Lead pollution declined only after the late twentieth century.

""We stopped using lead in our daily lives when we realized how toxic it is, but nobody had ever studied lead in prehistory,"" said corresponding author Alysson Muotri, Ph.D., professor of pediatrics and cellular & molecular medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine, associate director of the Archealization Center, and director of the Sanford Integrated Space Stem Cell Orbital Research Center.

To the researchers' surprise, teeth from people born in the mid-twentieth century (the 1940s through the 1970s), when exposure to leaded gasoline and paint was widespread, showed similar lead patterns to ancient human fossils.

The scientists suggest that ancient humans and their relatives might have encountered lead through their search for water, much like the Romans did later in history.

""One possibility is that they were looking for caves with running water inside,"" Muotri said. ""Caves contain lead, so they were all contaminated. Based on the tooth enamel studies, it started very early in infancy.""

Lead exposure disrupts brain growth and function, impairing intelligence and emotional regulation.

Faced with this evidence, Muotri and his team began to question how modern humans managed to thrive despite such toxic conditions during their evolutionary past.

A tiny genetic change

A gene known as neuro-oncological ventral antigen 1 (NOVA1) plays a major role in brain formation and synaptic development. Acting as a key regulator of neurodevelopment, NOVA1 helps determine how neural progenitor cells react to lead exposure, and disturbances in its activity are linked to neurological disorders.

Nearly all modern humans carry a version of the NOVA1 gene that differs by a single DNA base pair from the version found in Neanderthals. Earlier work from Muotri's group showed that swapping the modern NOVA1 with the older variant in miniature brain models, called organoids, caused dramatic changes in brain structure and connectivity.

""Everything about the organoids is identical except for that genetic variant, allowing us to ask whether that specific mutation between us and Neanderthals is giving us any advantage,"" said Muotri. The archaic variant accelerated brain maturation but resulted in less complexity over time. ""If all humans have this newer mutation in all corners of the world, very strong genetic pressure must have selected for it in our species.""

To test whether lead exposure might have shaped this genetic shift, the researchers created brain organoids with both the modern and ancestral NOVA1 variants, exposing them to lead and monitoring the growth of cortical and thalamic neurons.

They found that lead changed NOVA1 activity in both types of organoids, influencing genes linked to conditions such as autism and epilepsy.

However, only the archaic NOVA1 variant altered the activity of FOXP2, a gene crucial for speech and language. People with certain FOXP2 mutations struggle to form complex words and sentences.

""These type of neurons related to complex language are susceptible to death in the archaic version of NOVA1,"" said Muotri. "" The FOXP2 gene is identical between us and the Neanderthals, but it's how the gene is regulated by NOVA1 that likely contributes to language differences.""

Evolutionary implications

The findings suggest that the acquisition of the modern NOVA1 variant may have protected us from the detrimental effects of lead, promoting complex language development and social cohesion. This could have given modern humans a significant evolutionary advantage over Neanderthals, even in the presence of lead contamination.

Muotri believes these results have important implications for understanding how environmental stressors shaped brain development during human evolution. He speculates that lead exposure may have contributed to the extinction of Neanderthals around 40,000 years ago.

""Language is such an important advantage, it's transformational, it is our superpower,"" said Muotri. ""Because we have language, we are able to organize society and exchange ideas, allowing us to coordinate large movements. There is no evidence that Neanderthals could do that. They might have had abstract thinking, but they could not translate that to each other. And maybe the reason is because they never had a system to communicate that was as efficient as our complex language.""

Understanding how NOVA1 gene variants can affect FOXP2 expression helps elucidate the relationship between lead contamination and brain development and also sheds light on neurological conditions related to language, including speech apraxia -- a condition that makes it difficult to produce speech sounds correctly -- and autism.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Who or what dug Mars' mysterious gullies? The answer is explosive","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251015230949.htm","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 04:17:36 GMT","

Could Mars have once supported life? Scientists still don't have proof. Yet some of the planet's strange surface features might seem to hint at it. Earth scientist Dr. Lonneke Roelofs of Utrecht University set out to study the origin of mysterious gullies carved into Martian dunes. In her laboratory experiments, she discovered that blocks of frozen carbon dioxide (CO2 ice) can actually dig these channels on their own. ""It felt like I was watching the sandworms in the film Dune,"" she said. Her research appears in Geophysical Research Letters.

For years, scientists suspected CO2 ice might be responsible for the odd formations, but no one had been able to show it directly. Roelofs succeeded by creating gullies in the lab using CO2 ice blocks, replicating a natural process that doesn't occur on Earth and had never before been seen in action.

Sublimation

During the Martian winter, when temperatures plunge to around minus 120 degrees Celsius, ice accumulates on the dunes. As spring approaches, the sun warms the slopes and large ice blocks -- sometimes a meter long -- break loose. Because Mars has a thin atmosphere and a sharp temperature difference between warm sand and the ice, the underside of these blocks instantly turns to gas in a process known as sublimation. Since gas takes up far more space than solid ice, the pressure builds rapidly, making the ice appear to ""explode.""

""In our simulation, I saw how this high gas pressure blasts away the sand around the block in all directions,"" says Roelofs. As a result, the block digs itself into the slope and becomes trapped in a hollow surrounded by small ridges of settled sand. ""However, the sublimation process continues, and so the sand keeps on being blasted in all directions."" As the ice keeps vaporizing, it gradually slides downhill, carving a long, deep trench with ridges on either side. These artificial gullies match the ones seen on Mars almost exactly.

Landscape formation

Roelofs studies the geological forces that sculpt Mars' surface. In earlier work, she showed that sublimating CO2 ice can trigger debris flows that cut deep channels along crater walls. ""But the gullies from this research looked different,"" she explains. ""Therefore, a different process was behind this, but which? That is what I set out to discover.""

Mars chamber

Together with master student Simone Visschers, she traveled to the English city of Milton Keynes to solve the mystery behind these unusual sand gullies. The Open University has a 'Mars chamber': a facility for simulating Martian conditions. Financial support from the British Society of Geomorphology made the visit possible. ""We tried out various things by simulating a dune slope at different angles of steepness. We let a block of CO2 ice fall from the top of the slope and observed what happened,"" states the researcher. ""After finding the right slope, we finally saw results. The CO2 ice block began to dig into the slope and move downwards just like a burrowing mole or the sandworms from Dune. It looked very strange!""

From ice to gullies

But how exactly do these blocks of ice form? ""The CO2 ice blocks form on the desert dunes halfway down the southern hemisphere of Mars. During the winter, a layer of CO2 ice forms over the entire surface of the dune field, sometimes up to a thickness of 70 cm! In spring, this ice begins to warm up and sublimate. The last remnants of this ice are located on the shaded side of the dune tops, and that is where the blocks break off from once the temperature is high enough. Once the blocks reach the bottom of the slope and stop moving, the ice continues to sublimate until all the CO2 has evaporated. What remains is a hollow in the sand at the bottom of the dune.""

Why Mars?

Why does this planet fascinate people so much? ""Mars is our nearest neighbour. It is the only rocky planet close to the 'green zone' of our solar system. This zone lies exactly far enough from the Sun to make the presence of liquid water possible, which is a prerequisite for life. Questions about the origin of life, and possible extra-terrestrial life, could therefore be solved here,"" says Roelofs. ""Also, conducting research into the formation of landscape structures of other planets is a way of stepping outside the frameworks used to think about the Earth. This allows you to pose slightly different questions, which in turn can deliver new insights for processes here on our planet.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists just found real teeth growing on a fish's head","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251015231009.htm","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 09:38:36 GMT","

When it comes to teeth, most vertebrates share the same basic blueprint. Regardless of their size, shape, or sharpness, teeth typically have the same genetic roots, similar physical makeup, and, almost always, a place in the jaw.

That assumption, however, may no longer hold true. Scientists studying the spotted ratfish, a shark-like species found in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, discovered that it has rows of teeth growing on top of its head. These teeth line a cartilage-based structure known as the tenaculum, a forehead appendage that loosely resembles Squidward's nose.

For years, biologists have debated where teeth originally came from -- an important question, given how vital they are to feeding and survival. Most discussions have focused solely on oral teeth, without exploring whether teeth might have evolved elsewhere on the body. The discovery of teeth on the tenaculum has reopened that debate, prompting researchers to ask how widespread such features might be and what they reveal about the history of vertebrate dentition.

""This insane, absolutely spectacular feature flips the long-standing assumption in evolutionary biology that teeth are strictly oral structures,"" said Karly Cohen, a UW postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington's Friday Harbor Labs. ""The tenaculum is a developmental relic, not a bizarre one-off, and the first clear example of a toothed structure outside the jaw.""

The research was published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Spotted ratfish are among the most common fish in Puget Sound. They belong to a group of cartilaginous fish known as chimaeras, which diverged from sharks millions of years ago. Growing to about 2 feet in length, these fish are named for their long, slender tails that make up roughly half their body size. Only adult males develop a tenaculum on their forehead. When resting, it appears as a small white nub between their eyes, but when raised, it becomes a hooked, barbed organ covered in teeth.

Males use the tenaculum both for display and function. They raise it to ward off rivals and, during mating, use it to grip females by the pectoral fin, keeping the pair together in the water.

""Sharks don't have arms, but they need to mate underwater,"" Cohen said. ""So, a lot of them have developed grasping structures to connect themselves to a mate during reproduction.""

Spotted ratfish also use pelvic claspers for mating, similar to many other cartilaginous fish.

In most sharks, rays, and skates, the body is covered in small, tooth-like scales called denticles. But apart from the denticles on their pelvic claspers, spotted ratfish are largely smooth-skinned. This unusual lack of denticles led scientists to question what became of them -- and whether the teeth on the tenaculum might represent their evolutionary remnants.

Before conducting the study, researchers had two possibilities in mind. One was that the ""teeth"" were simply modified denticles, a leftover feature from ancient ancestors. The other suggested they were genuine teeth, similar to those found inside the mouth.

""Ratfish have really weird faces,"" Cohen said. ""When they are small, they kind of look like an elephant squished into a little yolk sack.""

The cells that form the oral region are spread farther afield, making it plausible that at some point, a clump of tooth-forming cells might have migrated onto the head and stuck.

To test these theories, the researchers caught and analyzed hundreds of fish, using micro-CT scans and tissue samples to document tenaculum development. While sharks can be quite hard to study, spotted ratfish abound in Puget Sound. They frequent the shallows surrounding Friday Harbor Labs, the UW research facility located on San Juan Island. They also compared the modern ratfish to ancestral fossils.

The scans showed that both male and female ratfish begin making a tenaculum early on. In males, it grows from a small cluster of cells into a little white pimple that elongates between the eyes. It attaches to muscles controlling the jaw and finally, erupts through the surface of the skin and sprouts teeth. In females it never materializes -- or mineralizes -- but evidence of an early structure remains.

The new teeth are rooted in a band of tissue called the dental lamina that is present in the jaw but has never been documented elsewhere. ""When we saw the dental lamina for the first time, our eyes popped,"" Cohen said. ""It was so exciting to see this crucial structure outside the jaw.""

In humans, the dental lamina disintegrates after we grow our adult teeth, but many vertebrates retain the ability to replace their teeth. Sharks, for example, have ""a constant conveyor belt"" of new teeth, Cohen said. Dermal denticles, including the ones on the spotted ratfish's pelvic claspers, do not have a dental lamina. Identifying this structure was compelling evidence that the teeth on the tenaculum really are teeth and not leftover denticles. Genetic evidence also backed this conclusion.

""Vertebrate teeth are extremely well united by a genetic toolbox,"" Cohen said.

Tissue samples revealed that the genes associated with teeth across vertebrates were expressed in the tenaculum, but not the denticles. In the fossil record, they also observed evidence of teeth on the tenaculum of related species.

""We have a combination of experimental data with paleontological evidence to show how these fishes coopted a preexisting program for manufacturing teeth to make a new device that is essential for reproduction,"" said Michael Coates, a professor and the chair of organismal biology and anatomy at the University of Chicago and a co-author of the paper.

The modern adult male spotted ratfish can grow seven or eight rows of hooked teeth on its tenaculum. These teeth retract and flex more than the average canine, enabling the fish to latch onto a mate while swimming. The size of the tenaculum also appears to be unrelated to the length of the fish. Its development aligns instead with the pelvic claspers, suggesting that the migrant tissue is now regulated by other networks.

""If these strange chimaeras are sticking teeth on the front of their head, it makes you think about the dynamism of tooth development more generally,"" said Gareth Fraser, a professor of biology at the University of Florida and the study's senior author.

Sharks often serve as the model for studying teeth and development because they have so many oral teeth and are covered in denticles. But, Cohen added, sharks possess just a sliver of the dental diversity captured by history. ""Chimeras offer a rare glimpse into the past,"" she said ""I think the more we look at spiky structures on vertebrates, the more teeth we are going to find outside the jaw.""

This research was funded by National Science Foundation, the Save Our Seas Foundation, and internal endowments at Friday Harbor Labs supporting innovative early-career research.

""These glasses are unique to Australia and have recorded an ancient impact event we did not even know about,"" Professor Jourdan said.

The discovery focuses on rare natural glass called tektites, which form when a meteorite hits Earth with enough force to melt the surface and fling molten material vast distances. This newly identified variety of tektites has so far been discovered only across parts of South Australia.

Co-author Professor Fred Jourdan from Curtin's School of Earth and Planetary Sciences compared the finding to uncovering a new chapter in Earth's turbulent past.

""These glasses are unique to Australia and have recorded an ancient impact event we did not even know about,"" Professor Jourdan said.

""They formed when an asteroid slammed into Earth, melting surface rock and scattering debris for thousands of kilometers. These tiny pieces of glass are like little time capsules from deep in our planet's history.

""What makes the discovery even more intriguing is that, although the impact must have been immense, scientists are yet to locate the crater.

""Understanding when and how often large asteroids have struck Earth also helps us assess the risk of future impacts, which is important for planetary defense.""

Lead author Anna Musolino, a PhD student at Aix-Marseille University, said the glasses stand apart from all previously known tektites.

""These tektites are unique because of their unusual chemistry and their age, which is about 11 million years,"" Ms. Musolino said.

""They record a completely separate impact event from the famous Australasian tektite-strewn field.

""While the Australasian tektites formed about 780,000 years ago and are spread across half the globe, these tektites are much older and their discovery suggests a previously unrecognized giant impact.""

The study was part of a larger research project led by Emeritus Professor Pierre Rochette from Aix-Marseille University and highlights both the destructive power of past impacts and the importance of studying them.

The full research paper, 'A new tektite strewn field in Australia ejected from a volcanic arc impact crater 11 Myr ago', is published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters.

Picture a future where factories can create materials and chemical compounds more quickly, at lower cost, and with fewer production steps. Imagine your laptop processing complex data in seconds or a supercomputer learning and adapting as efficiently as the human brain. These possibilities depend on one fundamental factor: how electrons behave inside materials. Researchers at Auburn University have now developed a groundbreaking type of material that allows scientists to precisely control these tiny charged particles. Their findings, published in ACS Materials Letters, describe how the team achieved adjustable coupling between isolated-metal molecular complexes, called solvated electron precursors, where electrons are not tied to specific atoms but instead move freely within open spaces.

Electrons are central to nearly every chemical and technological process. They drive energy transfer, bonding, and electrical conductivity, serving as the foundation for both chemical synthesis and modern electronics. In chemical reactions, electrons enable redox processes, bond formation, and catalytic activity. In technology, managing how electrons move and interact underpins everything from electronic circuits and AI systems to solar cells and quantum computers. Typically, electrons are confined to atoms, which restricts their potential uses. However, in materials known as electrides, electrons move independently, opening the door to remarkable new capabilities.

""By learning how to control these free electrons, we can design materials that do things nature never intended,"" explains Dr. Evangelos Miliordos, Associate Professor of Chemistry at Auburn and senior author of the study, which was based on advanced computational modeling.

To achieve this, the Auburn team created innovative material structures called Surface Immobilized Electrides by attaching solvated electron precursors to stable surfaces such as diamond and silicon carbide. This configuration makes the electronic characteristics of the electrides both durable and tunable. By changing how the molecules are arranged, electrons can either cluster into isolated ""islands"" that behave like quantum bits for advanced computing or spread into extended ""seas"" that promote complex chemical reactions.

This versatility is what gives the discovery its transformative potential. One version could lead to the development of powerful quantum computers capable of solving problems beyond the reach of today's technology. Another could provide the basis for cutting-edge catalysts that speed up essential chemical reactions, potentially revolutionizing how fuels, pharmaceuticals, and industrial materials are produced.

""As our society pushes the limits of current technology, the demand for new kinds of materials is exploding,"" says Dr. Marcelo Kuroda, Associate Professor of Physics at Auburn. ""Our work shows a new path to materials that offer both opportunities for fundamental investigations on interactions in matter as well as practical applications.""

Earlier versions of electrides were unstable and difficult to scale. By depositing them directly on solid surfaces, the Auburn team has overcome these barriers, proposing a family of materials structures that could move from theoretical models to real-world devices. ""This is fundamental science, but it has very real implications,"" says Dr. Konstantin Klyukin, Assistant Professor of Materials Engineering at Auburn. ""We're talking about technologies that could change the way we compute and the way we manufacture.""

The theoretical study was led by faculty across chemistry, physics, and materials engineering at Auburn University. ""This is just the beginning,"" Miliordos adds. ""By learning how to tame free electrons, we can imagine a future with faster computers, smarter machines, and new technologies we haven't even dreamed of yet.""

The study, ""Electrides with Tunable Electron Delocalization for Applications in Quantum Computing and Catalysis,"" was also coauthored by graduate students Andrei Evdokimov and Valentina Nesterova. It was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation and Auburn University computing resources.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Tiny brain nanotubes found by Johns Hopkins may spread Alzheimer's","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251015230939.htm","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 05:31:08 GMT","

Researchers at Johns Hopkins Medicine report that they have identified how mammalian brains build intricate networks of tiny tubes that move toxins in and out of brain cells, much like pneumatic tubes send items through systems in factories and stores.

Their experiments, which used genetically modified mice and advanced imaging tools, were supported by the National Institutes of Health and published on Oct. 2 in Science. According to the team, the discovery could deepen scientific understanding of how Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders develop, offering potential pathways for new treatments.

In the study, the scientists observed that these microscopic tubes, known as nanotubes, primarily formed to help neurons expel toxic small molecules such as amyloid-beta. This protein can clump together into sticky plaques, one of the defining features of Alzheimer's disease.

""Cells have to get rid of toxic molecules, and by producing a nanotube, they can then transmit this toxic molecule to a neighbor cell,"" says corresponding author Hyungbae Kwon, associate professor of neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""Unfortunately, this also results in spreading harmful proteins to other areas of the brain.""

With the help of powerful microscopes and live-cell imaging, the team watched as neurons created long, slender extensions between their dendrites -- the branching projections that connect brain cells. These ""dendritic nanotubes,"" as the researchers call them, appeared to shuttle harmful molecules from one neuron to another.

""The long and thin column-like structures of these dendritic nanotubes help transfer information quickly from neuron to neuron,"" says Kwon. ""These nanotubes can transport calcium, ions or toxic molecules, and are ideal for sending information to cells that are far away.""

Computer simulations of the process mirrored the early stages of amyloid buildup, or ""early amyloidosis,"" and revealed what the researchers describe as a ""nanotubular connectivity layer"" that adds a new dimension to how brain cells interact.

Kwon notes that these insights could help scientists refine approaches to treating Alzheimer's and similar conditions.

To explore the phenomenon, the researchers collected small brain tissue samples from healthy mice and examined them with high-resolution microscopy, allowing them to visualize the nanotubes in remarkable detail and track how they moved materials between neurons.

They then compared these samples with brain tissue from mice genetically engineered to develop Alzheimer's-like amyloid buildup.

The researchers say the mice with Alzheimer's disease had an increased number of nanotubes in their brains at three months old, when the mice were symptom-free, as compared with normal mice of the same age. At six months of age, the number of nanotubes in normal mice and those with Alzheimer's disease began to equalize.

By taking a closer look at human neurons (sampled with permission from a publicly available electron microscopy database), the scientists identified nanotubes with similar morphology forming between neurons in the same way that the laboratory mice developed them.

In future experiments, Kwon says, the team will focus on whether larger-scale nanotube networks exist in cell types other than neurons in the brain. Eventually, he intends to design an experiment in which researchers create a nanotube to see how it affects the state of cells.

With such knowledge, Kwon says, there's the possibility of one day dialing up or down nanotube production to protect the brain.

""When designing a potential treatment based on this work, we can target how nanotubes are produced -- by either increasing or decreasing their formation -- according to the stage of the disease,"" Kwon says.

Funding for this research was provided by the National Institutes of Health (DP1MH119428 and R01NS138176).

Additional researchers who conducted the study are Minhyeok Chang, Sarah Krüssel, Juhyun Kim, Daniel Lee, Alec Merodio and Jaeyoung Kwon from Johns Hopkins; and Laxmi Kumar Parajuli and Shigeo Okabe from the University of Tokyo, Japan.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a surface-controlled chemical vapour deposition method, in which materials are prepared one atomic layer at the time. With ALD, film thickness can be controlled very precisely, and it allows the user to cover large areas and surfaces with a complex three-dimensional structure uniformly and conformally. ALD is used for the deposition of high-quality thin films and nanostructures, as well as for surface functionalization and interface engineering in a wide range of applications, both from a research and development perspective, as well as for high-volume manufacturing. This Primer outlines the method of ALD, describing the precursors, coreactants and tools commonly used and illustrating examples of typical results from ALD processes. We describe the implementation of ALD in high-volume manufacturing in the semiconductor, solar and display industry and detail other existing and emerging application fields. We devote special attention to the reproducibility of the method, key technical specifications and figures of merit, as well as its limitations and challenges. Finally, we outline the future perspective of ALD and its applications to position it within the broader trend of atomic-scale processing.

The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences climate variability globally, encompassing various other modes of variability, and thus represents a key predictable climate signal on seasonal timescales. Yet, its response to greenhouse warming remains uncertain, with models projecting a range of outcomes. Here, we demonstrate that in response to warming, a state-of-the-art high-resolution climate model simulates a rapid transition from a moderate-amplitude irregular regime, as observed in the current climate, to a highly regular oscillation with intensifying amplitude. This behaviour can be attributed to increasing air-sea feedbacks, which approach criticality in the second half of this century, and growing atmospheric noise. As ENSO intensifies in this model, it synchronizes with other prominent climate modes, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole, thereby imprinting its regular, predictable variability on them. If realized, this global climate mode resonance would have wide-ranging whiplash impacts on regional hydroclimates.

Despite the profound influence of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the global climate system1,2, its response to greenhouse warming remains uncertain. Climate models exhibit a wide range of possible future ENSO behaviors1,3,4,5,6,7, hindering confidence in regional climate projections. The dynamics of ENSO are governed by a delicate balance of positive and negative feedbacks8,9 that determine both ENSO's instability10 and periodicity11. The relative strengths of the individual feedbacks are, in turn, determined by both model parametrizations and the structure of the climate mean state12,13,14. Previous research, using both simple low-order models15 and intermediate complexity models16, has demonstrated how changes in the climate mean state can affect the strength of these feedbacks (such as the zonal advective and thermocline feedbacks) and thereby ENSO characteristics (such as its growth rate, periodicity, and spatial pattern). In addition, recent studies also indicated that the interactions of ENSO with the seasonal cycle17,18,19 as well as with other more damped empirical modes in the climate system, such as the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)20, the Tropical North Atlantic (TNA) mode21, or the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)22 can shape the dynamics of both ENSO and these other modes23,24,25.

Over 20 years ago, an ENSO-resolving coupled general circulation model5,26 exhibited a very intriguing ENSO behavior. It showed a gradual increase in the linear ENSO growth rate in response to greenhouse warming and the crossing of a Hopf bifurcation in the mid-twenty-first century26. This ENSO regime shift towards supercriticality resulted in a rapid intensification in ENSO's amplitude. Such a drastic transition in qualitative ENSO behavior has not been reported in other complex climate models.

Here we revisit the issue of anthropogenically forced rapid emergence of ENSO supercriticality and its potential repercussions on global climate using an ensemble of state-of-the-art high resolution climate model simulations (AWI-CM3, TCo319 horizonal resolution with ~31 km and 137 vertical layers in the atmosphere and ~4–25 km with 80 vertical layers in the ocean)27, subject to SSP5-8.5 greenhouse gas forcing (see “Methods”). We demonstrate that this model simulates a rapid intensification of ENSO by mid-twenty-first century, a transition to a regular, strongly seasonally-locked oscillation (with periodicities of 2, 3, 4, and 5 years), and an unprecedented resonance with other important modes of climate variability. Using a hierarchy of simplified dynamical ENSO models, with parameters estimated from the complex AWI-CM3 simulations, we study the underlying mechanisms for the qualitative change in ENSO behavior, focusing on coupled air-sea feedbacks and atmospheric noise. While models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) show a wide range of possible future ENSO regularity and amplitude projections, a few models show qualitatively similar behavior to AWI-CM3. If this peculiar ENSO dynamical scenario were to materialize in the future, it could lead to both increased ENSO predictability, due to greater regularity, and, at the same time, to warming-amplified “whiplash impacts”28 on regional climates. These impacts would arise from the compounding effects of (1) more regular ENSO transitions, (2) increased ENSO sea surface temperature (SST) variance, (3) larger ENSO impacts on precipitation and the atmospheric circulation for the same SST anomaly29, and (4) synchronized fluctuations of the other climate modes.

As the Earth warms in response to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, the AWI-CM3 TCo319 model27 simulates a future increase in variability of both SST (Fig. 1e) and sea level pressure (SLP) (Fig. 1f) between the current (Period P1; 2015–2035) and end-of-the-century (Period P2; 2080–2100) climate in many regions of the globe. Further looking at the key regional aspects of these SST and SLP variability changes, we see a striking projected increase in ENSO SST variance as well as in ENSO regularity, i.e., a tendency from an intermittent to a more cyclic ENSO behavior, reminiscent of a Hopf bifurcation30 over this century (Figs. 1a, b, 2a and 3a). Interestingly, the model simulates qualitatively similar changes in the NAO index (Fig. 1c, d), the dominant empirical mode of atmospheric variability over the North Atlantic and Europe, especially in boreal winter (December–January–February: DJF). Both the dominant interannual ENSO timescale, as well as its near-annual combination tones17,18, are evident in the NAO wavelet power spectrum above a white noise background, and their variance increases with time and rising greenhouse gas concentrations (Fig. 1d). Increasing ENSO influences on the NAO are likely to have important implications for atmospheric impacts and climate predictability over Europe27.

In h and i, red curves denote the meridional width of ENSO zonal wind stress anomalies \({\tau }_{x}^{{\prime} }\) (see “Methods”).

Next, using sample entropy (SampEn; see “Methods”) of Niño3.4 SST anomalies as a metric for ENSO regularity together with the Niño3.4 SST anomaly standard deviation (SD), we show that a 1950 control simulation of AWI-CM3 TCo319 exhibits both ENSO regularity (Fig. 2a) and ENSO amplitude (Fig. 2b) similar to the observations and that the increase of both metrics in the AWI-CM3 TCo319 future projections cannot be explained by internal variability. Furthermore, analysis of the CMIP6 model archive demonstrates that while there is a wide range of possible changes in future ENSO regularity (Fig. 2c) and amplitude (Fig. 2d), 55% of CMIP6 models show an increase in ENSO regularity (Fig. 2c) and 82% an increase in ENSO SST anomaly amplitude (Fig. 2d) by the second half of this century under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. In addition, a few models (i.e., E3SM-1-1, EC-Earth3, and EC-Earth3-Veg) show similar increased ENSO regularity and amplitude as AWI-CM3 TCo319 (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Fig. 1). We emphasize that we do not expect strong inter-model agreement of ENSO projections across the CMIP6 archive given that considerable biases of climate mean states and ENSO dynamics result in different ENSO regimes across models8,24.

To understand the simulated regime shift in ENSO toward higher variance and increased regularity in AWI-CM3 TCo319, we derive two conceptual ENSO models directly from the simulation output. The first is a version of the recharge oscillator (RO) model13 that includes seasonal cycle modulations9 and encapsulates the fundamental ENSO dynamics in two coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for SST anomalies in the Niño3.4 region and the zonal-mean equatorial upper-ocean warm water volume. The second is a modified version of the extended recharge oscillator (XRO)24, which also takes into account the seasonally-modulated interactions between ENSO (as described by the RO) and the North Pacific Meridional mode (NPMM), TNA, IOD, and the Indian Ocean Basin (IOB) mode (yielding six coupled ODEs; see “Methods”). We estimate the time-evolving parameters of both conceptual models using multi-linear regression in a moving 21-year window. This allows us to compute the time-dependent linear growth rates and frequencies of ENSO via Floquet eigen analysis31 and assess changes in the damping rates and coupling strengths of the interacting modes in response to greenhouse warming.

Both models show that ENSO's linear growth rate increases considerably later in the twenty-first century, particularly during boreal summer (Fig. 3b). This is consistent with the increase in ENSO variance in boreal winter (Fig. 3a). We emphasize that while ENSO, in an annual mean sense, is still in the stable (subcritical) regime, the presence of atmospheric stochastic noise, can lead to a noise-induced Hopf bifurcation that occurs before criticality (i.e., the point at which its growth rate switches from negative to positive) is reached32,33. Moreover, the noise amplitude, calculated as the residual from the XRO model projection, increases substantially in boreal spring to summer (Fig. 3c), together with the growth rate, pushing ENSO into the high-variance and highly-regular regime. This is consistent with increased tropical intraseasonal atmospheric variability in the AWI-CM3 TCo319 simulation (Supplementary Fig. 2, ref. 27), which is well known to energize the ENSO mode2,9,34 and also seen in other climate model simulations35. Comparing the wavelet spectrum of the Niño3.4 index (Fig. 1b) with the linear ENSO frequency for both the RO and XRO (Supplementary Fig. 3), we see close agreement at the dominant interannual frequencies of ~2, 3, 4, and 5 yr−1.

Next, we use the Bjerknes stability analysis (see “Methods”) to determine which feedback changes are responsible for ENSO's growing instability. Comparing the difference (Fig. 3f) between period 2 (P2: 2080–2100; Fig. 3e) and period 1 (P1: 2015–2035; Fig. 3d) of the individual ENSO feedbacks that make up ENSO's net growth rate, we find that the increased growth rate primarily results from a reduced damping from thermocline adjustment (\(\varepsilon\)) and a modest enhancement of the Bjerknes feedback (R). The changes in R can be explained by enhanced Ekman feedback (EK) and reduced dynamic damping (DD), which are slightly offset by a reduced thermocline feedback (TH) and increased thermodynamic damping (TD). The enhanced Ekman feedback is primarily driven by enhanced stratification and an amplified anomalous vertical current response to SST anomalies (Supplementary Fig. 4d, i). The reduced dynamic damping is linked to the weakening of the climatological trade winds and surface currents. For the zonal advective feedback changes, we see a cancellation effect between the mean state and feedback changes, with reduced \(d\overline{T}/{dx}\) but strongly enhanced anomalous zonal current response to SST anomalies (Supplementary Fig. 4a, d, h). The reduced thermocline feedback is explained by a weakening of the climatological trade winds and climatological upwelling (Supplementary Fig. 4b, f).

We attribute the reduced damping from thermocline adjustment (\(\varepsilon\)) to the widening of ENSO wind stress anomalies (Fig. 3g, h and Supplementary Fig. 5a), which leads to increased wind stress curl off the equator, exciting longer Rossby waves. These are less effectively reflected at the western boundary and thus lead to reduced damping from thermocline adjustment (see “ENSO wind stress structure” in “Methods”). Importantly, the projected changes in the ENSO-associated zonal wind stress in the AWI-CM3 TCo319 simulations (Supplementary Fig. 5a) are consistent with the CMIP6 multi-model mean of the response36. The changes of R and \({\varepsilon}\) together lead to the largest growth rate increase in the boreal spring season (Fig. 3f).

The AWI-CM3 model explicitly resolves Tropical Instability Waves (TIWs), which also play a key role in ENSO thermodynamics4,37, mainly as a negative feedback38. With ocean background currents changing in response to the simulated greenhouse warming, the statistics of TIWs will also change, and their contribution to the ENSO heat budget4 will also change. This effect has not been explicitly accounted for in our calculations of the ENSO instability index, but it is captured, among other effects, in the residual term (Fig. 3d–f).

For climate modes, which are characterized by the variations in SST, such as the TNA mode (Fig. 4b), the IOB (Fig. 4c), the IOD (Fig. 4d), and the NPMM (Fig. 4e), we find a considerable intensification of their amplitude, ranging from 40–75%. All these modes are known to interact with ENSO18,23,24. To further elucidate the apparent emergent synchronization between ENSO and the other climate modes (i.e., NPMM, TNA, IOD, and IOB) in response to greenhouse warming (Fig. 4), we calculate the power spectrum for each mode for P1 and P2 respectively (Supplementary Fig. 6). We see a clear indication of statistically significant and intensifying spectral peaks for the NPMM, TNA, IOD, and IOB indices at the dominant ENSO frequencies (fE) as well as at the near-annual ENSO combination tone frequencies (1±fE) above a Lorentz/Hasselmann background spectrum39, consistent with theoretical expectations17,18. The emergence of interannual and near-annual ENSO timescales in the spectra of other climate modes provides the first clear evidence that their coupling with ENSO strengthens in response to greenhouse warming in this model. In addition, we see a clear intensification of both the ENSO and ENSO combination mode17 wind stress variability (Supplementary Fig. 7).

a–e Ensemble-mean moving 21-year seasonally varying (shading) and monthly (blue curve) standard deviation (SD) changes of each climate mode relative to its monthly SD during 2015–2035 (ratio) for the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Tropical North Atlantic (TNA) mode, Indian Ocean Basin (IOB) mode, Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and North Pacific Meridional Mode (NPMM) indices, respectively. f–j Ensemble-mean moving 21-year phase synchronization quantified by the histogram of phase differences (shading) between each climate mode and the Niño3.4 index for NAO, TNA, IOB, IOD, and NPMM, respectively. The blue curves in f–j indicate synchronization strength defined by the SD of the histogram density (PDF) of phase differences. The blue shading in a–j indicates the one SD spread among the four ensemble members.

To better quantify the dynamical linkage between different climate modes, we calculate the phase difference (see “Methods”) between the Niño3.4 index (representing ENSO) and the other indices (Fig. 4f–j). A bounded phase difference indicates stronger phase-coupling between the climate modes under consideration (Supplementary Fig. 8). Here, we focus on 1:1 phase synchronization, meaning that the oscillators maintain a (near-)constant phase difference. Starting around 2060, a strong preference for bounded phase differences emerges between ENSO and each of the other modes (i.e., blue curves in Fig. 4f–j have high values), thus providing further evidence of an intensifying connection between ENSO and the other modes as time progresses. The time-evolving probability distribution of phase differences (red shading in Fig. 4f–j) also documents that the range of phase differences narrows considerably for all modes, supporting the evidence for strengthened phase synchronization with ENSO.

Under present-day conditions, the influence of ENSO on the NAO is detectable but generally weak and indirect. Consequently, current seasonal forecasts for the European climate do not treat ENSO as a primary driver of NAO-related variability or impacts. According to our simulations, however, this could change in the future. The amplitude of the NAO increases by about 20% during the simulation (Fig. 4a), but the overall seasonal amplitude modulation with a peak in February remains relatively stable. The ±π preferred phase difference to ENSO for the NAO is consistent with the well-known out-of-phase relationship between ENSO and the NAO. As greenhouse gas concentrations increase, the preferred phase difference between ENSO and the NAO becomes more robust (Fig. 4f), with dominant peaks between −π and −π/2, consistent with an increasingly negative correlation in boreal winter. Overall, we expect these dynamics to potentially influence the seasonal predictability of the NAO, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 9, which shows the projected extended persistence of both ENSO and NAO. It is also illustrated in Fig. 1, which shows that after 2060, 2-year-long La Niña events typically create two subsequent strong NAO events.

Whether the intensification of the NAO linkage to ENSO emerges, simply because the ENSO SST amplitude increases during the simulation, or whether large-scale reorganizations of the extratropical atmospheric circulation facilitate the coupling between the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern and the NAO in wintertime (DJF) is quantified by a regression analysis for both periods (Fig. 5). For P1, the regression of precipitation and 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500) anomalies onto Niño3.4 SST anomalies and Niño4 precipitation shows no substantial impact in Europe. During P2, for the regressions with both the Niño3.4 SST index in degrees Kelvin (Fig. 5e) and with the normalized Niño3.4 SST index (Fig. 5d), we see increases in the regression coefficient amplitudes and a clear negative NAO pattern emerging. The strongest signal can be found for the normalized Niño3.4 index, which indicates that the amplification of the SST signal itself plays a vital role in strengthening the teleconnection. However, even a 1 K SST change in the Niño3.4 region, the NAO pattern emerges much more strongly in P2 than in P1, indicating a higher sensitivity of the atmospheric response to the same amplitude of warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific. As a result of the increased synchronization between ENSO and the NAO pattern in boreal winter, we also find an enhanced precipitation response over western Europe27 with considerably wetter conditions occurring over the Iberian Peninsula during El Niño events (Fig. 5). Recent studies have suggested that the ENSO–NAO teleconnection may strengthen in response to greenhouse warming, either due to amplified ENSO forcing or increased extratropical sensitivity. Reference40 showed that CMIP5 models simulate both enhanced tropical Pacific precipitation variability and a more robust ENSO–NAO correlation in the future, with evidence for stronger stratospheric and tropospheric pathways. Reference41, using a pacemaker approach with fixed ENSO SST anomalies, attributed the strengthened NAO response to increased extratropical sensitivity linked to a more zonally extended Pacific jet. Our study confirms and extends these results by showing that in a high-resolution coupled model, both mechanisms occur simultaneously: ENSO amplitude increases due to stronger air–sea feedbacks and enhanced atmospheric noise, while normalized regressions reveal that the extratropical circulation becomes more sensitive to ENSO forcing. In addition, we identify a regime shift toward a highly regular, seasonally phase-locked ENSO that entrains other modes like the NAO, suggesting a possible global synchronization of interannual variability under climate change.

Stippling and dark contours indicate statistical significance at the 95% level using a one-sided Student's t test.

The increase in ENSO variance and regularity directly leads to increased variance and regularity of the other SST climate modes. In addition, we find that both a reduction of their individual damping rates (Supplementary Fig. 10a–d) and increased ENSO teleconnection strength (Supplementary Fig. 10e–l) also contribute to the global climate mode resonance. The enhanced variance of the NPMM is primarily driven by reduced damping from February to July (Supplementary Fig. 10a), likely associated with SST warming in the subtropical northeastern Pacific and enhanced wind–evaporation–SST (WES) feedback42. The reduction in damping rate and the strengthening of ENSO teleconnection are essential for increasing IOD and TNA variance (Supplementary Fig. 10c, d, g, h). Interestingly, the IOB exhibits an enhanced early variance peak in February–March and a secondary peak in May–June by the end of the twenty-first century (Fig. 4c). This change is related to reduced damping in addition to enhanced ENSO teleconnection from November to April (Supplementary Fig. 10b, j).

Previous work has shown that the atmosphere is “ringing” with a range of combination tones in response to ENSO forcing, causing an “ENSO frequency cascade”43. Here we show that ENSO not only causes these deterministic signals in the atmosphere, but its intensification can also energize both atmospheric and air-sea coupled climate modes across the globe in response to greenhouse warming. This global climate resonance towards the strengthening ENSO signal is apparent in the raw timeseries (Fig. 1), their amplitudes, spectra, and phase synchronization characteristics (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 6). ENSO variability increases in the AWI-CM3 simulation because of an intensification of atmospheric noise in boreal summer (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 2c), reduced damping from thermocline adjustment, and the modest increase of the Bjerknes feedback (Fig. 3f). Its global synchronization towards the extratropics (e.g., with the NAO) is boosted by the growing ENSO amplitude, but also by an overall reorganization of atmospheric teleconnection patterns (Fig. 5), due to a different future atmospheric mean flow. The changes in the mean flow—particularly a stronger, more zonally extended Pacific jet and increased Atlantic baroclinicity—can enhance the propagation, amplification, and momentum deposition of ENSO-forced stationary waves into the North Atlantic sector, thereby strengthening the teleconnection to the NAO.

Increasing ENSO amplitude and teleconnection patterns imply that remote extratropical precipitation responses, such as in Southern California and the Iberian Peninsula (Fig. 5), will also become stronger between alternating El Niño and La Niña events. Even though the recurrence of these events may become more predictable due to the increased regularity/periodicity and amplitude (Fig. 1)44, future ENSO teleconnections might generate enhanced whiplash effects on hydroclimate, which requires additional planning and management strategies to minimize the costs of climate damage. While similar increases in ENSO regularity and amplitude can be found in some CMIP6 model projections (Fig. 2), future work needs to assess the detailed dynamics across these models and assess the likelihood of the ENSO regime changes seen in AWI-CM3.

This study employs the Alfred Wegener Institute Climate Model (AWI-CM3), which couples the OpenIFS (Open Integrated Forecasting System) atmosphere model with the FESOM2 (Finite-volume Sea Ice-Ocean Model) ocean model. The atmospheric component operates at a horizontal resolution of approximately 31 km (TCo319) with 137 vertical pressure levels. It contains the WAM (Wave Model) surface gravity wave model and the hydrology model H-TESSEL (Hydrology in the Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchange over Land). The ocean model features a variable horizontal resolution ranging from 5 to 27 km, depending among others on latitude, and includes 80 vertical layers. The reader is referred to a more detailed description of AWI-CM3 and the simulations (except the additional ensemble members)27.

A full transient simulation covering the period from 1950 to 2100, branched off from a 100-year-long spin-up simulation, was conducted using historical forcing from 1950 to 2014 CE, followed by the high-emission shared socio-economic pathway (SSP) 5-8.5 scenario thereafter. To assess the robustness of our results, three additional ensemble simulations spanning the period from 2055 to 2100 were conducted. In line with the micro-perturbation initialization strategy (e.g., ref. 35), a small perturbation was added to the wave model restart files.

A 150-year TCo319 control simulation with fixed 1950 forcing (CTL1950) was also analyzed to characterize internal climate variability and to serve as a baseline comparison. The CTL1950 simulation reproduces the observed SST and precipitation mean state and SST variability reasonably well (Supplementary Fig. 11). The CTL1950 simulation also reproduces the observed characteristics of ENSO, including its seasonal synchronization, spectral characteristics, and teleconnections (Supplementary Fig. 12).

We use four observational SST reconstructions/reanalysis: the Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature dataset v.1.1 (HadISST45), the Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature v.5 (ERSSTv546), the Centennial in situ Observation-Based Estimates of Sea Surface Temperature v.2 (COBE247) for 1871–2024, and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis 5 (ERA548) for 1940–2024. In addition, ERA5 monthly precipitation and sea level pressure (SLP) fields are used for 1940–2024.

We also analyze simulations from 49 CMIP6 models, including historical runs and SSP5-8.5 projections, providing monthly SST and SLP data (Supplementary Table 1). The simulations are forced by historical anthropogenic and natural forcings up to 2014, followed by future greenhouse-gas forcing under the SSP5-8.5 scenario through 2100, covering the period 1850–2100. All model output was re-gridded to a common 1° × 1° horizontal resolution using bilinear interpolation.

All monthly fields are first quadratically detrended, and then anomalies are computed by subtracting the 21-year running monthly climatology. We then calculate the climate mode indices with the detrended anomalies. The ENSO SST index is represented as SST anomalies averaged over the cold tongue region (180°–90°W, 6°S–6°N). The Niño3.4 SST index is defined as SST anomalies averaged over the Niño3.4 region (170°–120°W, 5°S–5°N). The Niño4 precipitation index is defined as precipitation anomalies averaged over the Niño4 region (160°E–150°W, 5°S–5°N). The North Pacific Meridional Mode (NPMM) index is defined as SST anomalies averaged over 160°–120°W, 10°–25°N49. The NPMM SST anomaly index reproduces the original maximum covariance analysis (MCA)-based NPMM index with a correlation of ~0.9549. The Tropical North Atlantic (TNA) index is defined as SST anomalies averaged over 55°–15°W, 5°–25°N50. The Indian Ocean Basin (IOB) mode index is defined as SST anomalies averaged over 40°–100°E, 20°S–20°N51. The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) mode index is defined as SST anomalies averaged over 50°–70°E, 10°S–10°N minus those averaged over 90°–110°E, 10°S–0°N20. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index is defined as the principal-component (PC) time series associated with the leading Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) of area-weighted SLP anomalies over the North Atlantic sector 90°W–40°E, 20°–80°N52.

Wavelet analysis was used to explore the different climate modes' time-frequency characteristics and identify dominant periodicities53. A continuous wavelet transform was performed using the Morlet wavelet, which offers an optimal balance between frequency and time localization, making it ideal for capturing oscillatory behavior. The analysis was conducted on normalized Niño3.4 SST and NAO indices, with the resulting wavelet power spectra computed for each ensemble member, followed by calculating the ensemble-mean of the spectra (Fig. 1b, d) to highlight changes in dominant frequencies over time. Statistical significance was assessed using Monte Carlo simulations: Niño3.4 SST was tested against an AR(1) process with a lag(−1 month) autocorrelation coefficient of 0.9, while the NAO index was tested against a white-noise process.

The power spectral density (PSD) of the various climate mode indices (the four ensemble members for P2 were concatenated, leading to 84 years of monthly data for P2 but only 21 years of monthly data for P1) was calculated using the Multi-Taper Method (MTM) with 3 tapers and nfft = 256 for P1 and nfft = 1024 for P254. A Lorentzian background spectrum null hypothesis was chosen for the SST modes. The significance level of spectral peaks was therefore determined from the respective PSD percentile at each frequency of PSDs calculated with the same MTM method for 10,000 discrete AR(1) processes with (i) the same lag(−1 month) autocorrelation, (ii) the same variance, and (iii) the same data length as the respective index that is tested against. A white noise null hypothesis was chosen for the NAO atmospheric mode. Here, the significance level of spectral peaks was determined from the respective PSD percentile at each frequency of PSDs calculated with the same MTM method, generated from 10,000 realizations of white noise time series with (i) the same variance and (ii) the same data length as the index that is tested against.

We assessed ENSO regularity by calculating the sample entropy (SampEn) of the Niño3.4 SST anomaly index, a nonlinear metric that measures how predictable a time series is55. SampEn is an alternative to approximate entropy (ApEn56) for quantifying the randomness of a time series; unlike ApEn, it excludes self-matches, thereby reducing bias and improving consistency across different data segments57. Compared to an ENSO regularity metric that is defined by the sharpness of the ENSO spectral peak58, SampEn is less sensitive to record length, spectral windowing, and other frequency-domain constraints. Lower SampEn values indicate more regular (periodic) behavior, whereas higher values indicate more irregular behavior. Given a time series \(\{{x}_{1},{x}_{2},\ldots,{x}_{N}\}\), SampEn estimates the negative natural logarithm of the conditional probability that two sequences of length \(m\) that match within tolerance \(r\) will also match for \(m+1\) points, while excluding self-matches to reduce bias and improve consistency. We used an embedding dimension \(m=2\) (the dimensionality of the ENSO RO model) and a tolerance \(r=0.2\sigma\), where \(\sigma\) is the standard deviation of the time series. The SampEn metric is defined as:

where \({A}^{m}\left(r\right)\) the probability that two sequences of length m + 1 are similar (matches), \({B}^{m}\left(r\right)\) is the probability that two sequences of length \(m\) are similar (candidates). Explicitly,

where \({u}_{m}\left(i\right)\) is the subsequence \(\{{x}_{i},{x}_{i+1},\ldots,{x}_{i+m-1}\},d\left[{u}_{m}\left(j\right),{u}_{m}\left(i\right)\right]={\max }_{k=1,\ldots,m}|{x}_{i+k-1}-{x}_{j+k-1}|\) is the maximum norm distance. Since the number of matches is always less than or equal to the number of possible vectors, the ratio \({A}^{m}\left(r\right)/{B}^{m}\left(r\right)\) is a conditional probability less than unity, ensuring SampEn is positive. This method provides a single diagnostic value characterizing the regularity of the ENSO time series, facilitating consistent comparison across observations and simulations under different climate scenarios. The observed SampEn effectively captures the decadal variations in ENSO forecast skill, including the modest decrease in predictability after the 2000s (black curve in Fig. 2a, refs. 59,60,61).

The Recharge-Oscillator (RO) model is a widely recognized framework for diagnosing and understanding ENSO dynamics in observations and climate models9,13. The RO model captures the oscillatory behavior of El Niño and La Niña events through two coupled equations describing the evolution of ENSO SST anomalies (\({T}_{{{\rm{ENSO}}}}\)) and equatorial Pacific zonal-mean thermocline depth anomalies (\(h\)). In its linear form, the model is expressed as:

In Eq. (4), \({{{\bf{L}}}}_{{{\rm{ENSO}}}}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}R & {F}_{1}\\ -{F}_{2} & -\varepsilon \end{array}\right)\), where \(R\) represents the SST anomaly growth rate, collectively describing the Bjerknes feedback, \(\varepsilon\) denotes ocean damping rate related to the energy leakage at the western boundary and mixing, \({F}_{1}\) represents the effectiveness of the heat content discharge–recharge in controlling SST anomalies, and \({F}_{2}\) represents the discharge–recharge efficiency; \({{{\boldsymbol{\xi }}}}_{{{\rm{ENSO}}}}\) and \({{{\boldsymbol{\xi }}}}_{{{\rm{h}}}}\) are the residual terms encompassing non-resolved nonlinear processes and stochastic noise. The complex eigenvalue of the RO model operator \({{{\bf{L}}}}_{{{\rm{ENSO}}}}\) is the Bjerknes-Wyrtki-Jin (BWJ) index for the ENSO growth rate and periodicity and can be written as:

where the real part of the index is referred to as the ENSO Bjerknes stability (BJ) index in ref. 10, and the imaginary part as the reciprocal of the Wyrtki periodicity (WF) index in ref. 11.

Due to the strong seasonal dependence of ENSO, we explicitly incorporate seasonality by estimating the parameters as:

where ω = 2π/(12 months), and the subscripts 0 and 1 indicate the mean and annual cycle components, respectively. The parameters of the operators are estimated by multivariate linear regression. We applied the RO model fitting to each ensemble member of the AWI-CM3 simulation using a 21-year moving window.

To understand the climate mode interactions, we use a modified version of a recently developed extended Recharge Oscillator (XRO), which allows for two-way interactions between ENSO and the other modes24, which consists of a recharge oscillator model for ENSO coupled to seasonally-modulated stochastic-deterministic models for the other climate modes25:

The linear dynamical operator L contains four submatrices, organized as follows:

where the linear operator submatrix \({{{\bf{L}}}}_{{{\rm{ENSO}}}}\) describes the ENSO internal recharge-discharge dynamics, \({{{\bf{L}}}}_{{{\rm{M}}}}\) represents the internal processes and interactions among the other climate modes; \({{\bf{C}}}\) are coupling submatrices, with \({{{\bf{C}}}}_{2}\) describing the impact of ENSO on other climate modes and \({{{\bf{C}}}}_{1}\) describing the feedback of other modes on ENSO. Similar to the RO model fit, we explicitly incorporate seasonality by estimating the XRO parameters with Eq. (7). The noise parameters are determined from the residuals of the XRO fit. There are a total of 12 noise parameters, i.e., a noise amplitude and decorrelation time scale for each of the 6 state variables in the system. The noise amplitudes \({\sigma }_{{{\boldsymbol{\xi }}}}\) are estimated from the standard deviations of the residuals of the XRO fit. The decorrelation time scales are estimated as \({{{\boldsymbol{r}}}}_{{{\boldsymbol{\xi }}}}=-{\mathrm{ln}}({{{\boldsymbol{a}}}}_{1})/\delta t\), where \({{{\boldsymbol{a}}}}_{1}\) are the lag(−1 month) autocorrelations of the residual of the XRO fit. The range of observed noise time scales \({{{\boldsymbol{r}}}}_{{{\boldsymbol{\xi }}}}^{-1}\) are between 0.25 ~ 0.70 months.

Floquet theory is used to determine the stability of the coupled system with an annual cycle basic state. We determine the Floquet ENSO growth rate and periodicity using the RO model operator (\({{{\bf{L}}}}_{{{\rm{ENSO}}}}\)) or XRO model operator \({{\bf{L}}}\) via Floquet exponent analysis31. The Floquet exponents are determined numerically by integrating \(d{{\boldsymbol{Q}}}/{dt}={{\boldsymbol{L}}}\cdot {{\boldsymbol{Q}}}\) over 1 year with a time step of 3.65 days from an initial condition \({{\boldsymbol{Q}}}\left(0\right)={{\boldsymbol{I}}}\) to form a monodromy matrix \({{\boldsymbol{M}}}={{\boldsymbol{Q}}}\left(T\right),T=1\,{{\rm{year}}}\). The Floquet exponents (\({\sigma }_{j}\)) are calculated from the least damped complex eigenvalues \({\alpha }_{j}\) of \({{\boldsymbol{M}}}\) by using \({\sigma }_{j}=\frac{{\mathrm{ln}}{\alpha }_{j}}{T}\).

To quantify changes in atmospheric noise amplitude, we define atmospheric noise as surface zonal wind variability that is independent of SST-related variability, following ref. 62. Specifically, an EOF analysis was applied to monthly tropical SST anomalies to derive the leading modes of variability and their associated PCs. Multivariate linear regression was then performed, regressing the monthly surface zonal wind stress anomalies onto the first 15 leading PCs, which together account for approximately 75% of the variance in tropical SST anomalies. The time series of atmospheric noise was then defined as the residual wind stress, obtained from removing the SST-forced signals. Finally, the amplitude of noise is defined as the standard deviation of the residual wind stress.

To assess possible physical processes that control the changes of ENSO growth rate, we calculate the ocean mixed layer heat budget using a partial flux form63,64:

where the overbars denote the climatological monthly-mean seasonal cycle, and the primes denote anomalies; \(T\) is the ocean temperature, \(u\), \(v\), and \(w\) the ocean zonal, meridional, and vertical current velocities, \(Q\) the net surface heat flux effect on the ocean mixed layer, and \({Q}_{{Res}}\) the unresolved residual. The anomalous heat flux term \({Q}^{\prime}\) is calculated as:

where \(H\) is the ocean mixed layer depth (50 m), \(\rho\) is the seawater density (1025 kg m−3), \({C}_{p}\) is the specific heat capacity of seawater (3994 J kg−1 K−1), and \({Q}_{{{\rm{net}}}}^{{\prime} }\) represents the net surface heat flux, consisting of four components:

representing shortwave radiation, longwave radiation, latent heat flux, and sensible heat flux anomalies, respectively. The shortwave radiation transmitted through the bottom of the mixed layer (\({Q}_{{{\rm{bot}}}}^{{\prime} }\)) is parameterized following ref. 65 as:

Taking the volume-average by integrating both hand sides of Eq. (9) from the ocean mixed layer depth to the ocean surface and spatially over the eastern equatorial Pacific box where the SST variability of ENSO is dominant, the heat budget equation can be written as follows:

where the angle brackets denote volume/area-average variables over the eastern Pacific box (180°–90°W, 6°S–6°N), \({T}_{{{\rm{bot}}}}^{{\prime} }\) and \({\overline{w}}_{{{\rm{bot}}}}\) the anomalous temperature and climatological vertical velocity at the bottom interface of the ocean mixed layer, respectively. We group the various feedbacks on the right-hand side of Eq. (9) as thermal damping by the net surface heat flux (TD), dynamic damping by mean horizontal currents (DD), thermocline feedback (TH), zonal advective feedback (ZA), meridional advective feedback and vertical advective feedback (combined as Ekman feedback, EK), nonlinear dynamic heating (NDH), and sub-grid scale contributions (SG), respectively. Our definitions of DD and TH represent the advection of anomalous temperature by mean currents via lateral and bottom interfaces, respectively.

Next, we apply the following linear relationship between various oceanic processes with \(\left\langle {T}^{{\prime} }\right\rangle\) and h9 and replacing \(\langle {T}^{{\prime} }\rangle\) with \({T}_{{{\rm{e}}}}\) for simplicity:

Substituting these into the ENSO mixed-layer temperature equation, the equation reduces to:

From this, the total SST growth rate \(R\) and phase-transition rate \({F}_{1}\) are expressed as:

To estimate these parameters, we account for seasonality explicitly outlined in Eq. (6) using multivariate linear regression. Ensemble mean parameters are calculated by performing regression on concatenated results from all ensemble members. These derived parameters capture the contributions of each process and provide a comprehensive understanding of ENSO feedbacks and their contribution to the ENSO growth rate. The \({R}_{{{\rm{NDH}}}}\) and \({R}_{{{\rm{Res}}}}\) terms are combined as \({R}_{{{\rm{AllRes}}}}\), which consists of tropical instability waves and other unresolved processes.

We have also tested our analysis using different ocean mixed layer depths (30 m, 40 m, and 50 m) and alternative definitions of the eastern Pacific box (e.g., the Niño3.4 region). The results remain quantitatively similar and do not affect our conclusions.

The ENSO wind stress structure affects both the growth rate and periodicity of ENSO9,36. Here, we determine the ENSO wind stress pattern using linear regression of monthly zonal wind stress anomalies \(({\tau }_{x}^{{\prime} })\) onto the monthly ENSO SST anomaly index. Following ref. 36, the meridional width of \({\tau }_{x}^{{\prime} }\) is defined as the latitudinal distance between the meridional boundaries, the nearest local minima of \({\tau }_{x}^{{\prime} }\) on either side of the equator, based on the meridional profile averaged over 160°E–150°W (Fig. 2g). The zonal length is defined as the longitudinal distance between the zonal boundaries of \({\tau }_{x}^{{\prime} }\), determined from the zonal profile averaged over 5°S to 5°N across the tropical Pacific. The eastern boundary is identified as the zero-crossing point in the zonal profile; the western boundary is defined as the local minimum within the region from 140°E to 190°E; and zonal centroid location as the midpoint between zonal boundaries (Supplementary Fig. 5b).

Under the assumption that the zonal wind stress anomaly \({\tau }_{x}^{{\prime} }\) has a Gaussian meridional structure, the RO \(h\) equation can be reformulated to explicitly incorporate the wind stress structure36:

where \({\varepsilon }_{m}\) is a linear mechanical damping coefficient (2.5 yr)−1, the parameter \(\alpha\) characterizes the meridional structure of \({\tau }_{x}^{{\prime} }\), such that the meridional width of \({\tau }_{x}^{{\prime} }\) is proportional to \(1/\sqrt{\alpha }\), and \({x}_{c}\) denotes the nondimensional location of the center of wind stress anomalies along the equator measured from the western boundary (with \({x}_{c}\approx 0.35\), Supplementary Fig. 5b). A meridional widening of \({\tau }_{x}^{{\prime} }\) leads to a reduction in \(\alpha\), thereby weakening the damping from thermocline adjustment (\(\varepsilon\), Fig. 2h) and recharge/discharge efficiency (\({F}_{2}\), Fig. 2i). These changes enhance the growth rate and increase the periodicity of ENSO following the RO eigenvalue Eq. (5).

Phase synchronization characterizes how interactions between two different processes can lead to synergistic dynamical phase behavior (e.g., the temporal alignment of respective local maxima or minima). A special case of phase-synchronization is frequency-locking31, where two systems with normally independent oscillatory behavior develop a joint frequency and locked dynamics. In general, for phase-synchronized systems, the difference between the phases of the interacting processes, or multiples thereof, is statistically distinguishable from a uniform white noise process. In particular, phase synchronization can emerge in nonlinear dynamical systems, which include product terms between two signals.

Practically, phase relationships between two processes, which are represented by their timeseries \(x\left(t\right)\) and \(y\left(t\right)\) can be calculated using their complex analytical signals66,67 \({z}_{1}\left(t\right)={A}_{1}\left(t\right){e}^{i{{{\rm{\phi }}}}_{1}\left(t\right)}=x\left(t\right)+i{x}_{H}\left(t\right),\) and \({z}_{2}\left(t\right)={A}_{2}\left(t\right){e}^{i{{{\rm{\phi }}}}_{2}\left(t\right)}=y\left(t\right)+i{y}_{H}\left(t\right)\), where \({x}_{H}\left(t\right),\) \({y}_{H}\left(t\right),\) represent the Hilbert transforms of \(x\left(t\right),y(t)\) and \({{{\rm{\phi }}}}_{1}\left({{\rm{t}}}\right),{{{\rm{\phi }}}}_{2}({{\rm{t}}})\) are the respective phases of the signal. The only requirement for the two signals \(x\left(t\right),y(t)\) is that they satisfy Bedrosian's Product Theorem68. This can be achieved by appropriate band-pass filtering. To quantify m:n phase synchronization (m, n are integers), we calculate \(\delta {{{\rm{\phi }}}}_{\left\{{{\rm{n}}},{{\rm{m}}}\right\}}={{\rm{n}}}{{{\rm{\phi }}}}_{1}\left({{\rm{t}}}\right)-{{\rm{m}}}{{{\rm{\phi }}}}_{2}(t)\). For two un-synchronized (decoherent) processes, we would expect (1) the time evolution of the unwrapped phases \(\delta {{{\rm{\phi }}}}_{\left\{{{\rm{n}}},{{\rm{m}}}\right\}}\) to essentially increase, without any long periods of phase “friction”, which can be characterized as consistent plateaus of near constant \(\delta {{{\rm{\phi }}}}_{\left\{{{\rm{n}}},{{\rm{m}}}\right\}}\); (2) the probability distribution of \(\delta {{{\rm{\phi }}}}_{\left\{{{\rm{n}}},{{\rm{m}}}\right\}}\) (without unwrapping procedure) to be indistinguishable from a uniform distribution between 0–360 degrees66,69. Respectively, for m:n synchronized signals, (1) we would expect to see long periods of little growth in unwrapped phase differences; (2) the frequency histogram of \(\delta {{{\rm{\phi }}}}_{\left\{{{\rm{n}}},{{\rm{m}}}\right\}}\) (without unwrapping procedure) across all angles (0–360°) should deviate statistically (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) from a uniform distribution.

We use this approach to calculate the 1:1 difference of unwrapped phases between timeseries characterizing different climate modes simulated by the AWI-CM3 model. All time series were bandpass filtered between 2.5 months and 10 years using a Butterworth filter prior to the analysis to focus on annual to interannual variability and to satisfy Bedrosian's theorem. We use the standard deviation of the phase difference PDF, \(\sigma [{{\rm{PDF}}}(\delta {\Phi }_{1,1})]\), as a measure of the synchronization strength. If there is no synchronization, the phase differences are uniformly distributed, yielding a flat PDF and \(\left.\sigma [{{\rm{PDF}}}(\delta {\Phi }_{1,1})]\right)\approx 0\) (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b). In contrast, if there is strong synchronization, the phase differences concentrate around a preferred value (−π/2 for the example shown in Supplementary Fig. 8c, d), producing a sharply peaked PDF, resulting in a larger \(\sigma [{{\rm{PDF}}}(\delta {\Phi }_{1,1})]\) (Supplementary Fig. 8c, d).

The Fisher z-transformation was used to test statistical significance of the correlation differences as follows:

where \({r}_{1}\) and \({r}_{2}\) are the correlation coefficients, \({n}_{1}\) and \({n}_{2}\) are the sample sizes of the first and second group samples. The absolute value |Z| is then compared against a critical value from the t-distribution for a two-tailed test. We rejected the null hypothesis that the two correlations are not significantly different at a 90% confidence level if |Z| exceeds the critical value. The Student's t test was used to test statistical significance of the regression coefficient.

Given small sample sizes, we apply a bootstrap method to assess whether changes in ENSO regularity are statistically significant. Specifically, the 21-year moving-window values of ENSO regularity are randomly resampled with replacement to generate 10,000 synthetic realizations. From these realizations, we compute the standard deviation of the resulting distribution of mean values.

Microsoft saved its most powerful AI tools for paying customers in the first phase of its AI evolution. Now, the company has announced a series of Copilot features coming to all Windows 11 PCs, including Voice, Copilot Vision, and Copilot Actions.

Alongside the update, Microsoft is launching an ad campaign to expose people to these new features. The timing isn't an accident. Windows 10 support ended on October 14, and we're about to see a wave of people upgrade to Windows 11; Microsoft seems intent on putting advanced Copilot features at the fingertips of as many people as possible—and convincing them they're worth using.

“Hey, Copilot.” That's the wake word for the AI assistant in voice mode, now coming to all Windows 11 computers. Whether you like it or not, Microsoft wants you to start talking to your computer. The company is introducing new Copilot features across all Windows 11 devices, featuring direct voice interaction with Copilot in apps and throughout the operating system. This capability has been available on smartphones for many years with varying degrees of success, as well as Microsoft's own Copilot+ line of laptops.

“It's been almost four decades since the PC changed the way you interact with it, which is primarily mouse and keyboard,” says Yusuf Mehdi, consumer chief marketing officer at Microsoft. “But what if you can go beyond that and talk to it? In our minds, voice would become the third input mechanism to use with your PC.”

The push to speak directly to your PC has some data behind it. Mehdi cited Microsoft's own observations of how people interact with its PCs via voice, such as through dictation, note-taking, voice typing, and transcriptions. Mehdi also says people use the Copilot app twice as much when using voice instead of typing, due to ease of use. “People talk through their computer, they don't talk to their computer or with their computer,” he says. “But we think that's what's actually going to change a lot.”

With voice-powered Copilot arriving on all Windows 11 computers, Microsoft hopes people will begin using its AI features more. The point isn't to replace mouse and keyboard altogether, but instead to make voice “additive,” as Mehdi puts it.

Mehdi seemingly forgot to mention “touch” as an input mechanism from his history lesson. Microsoft famously invested quite a lot in trying to transform the PC into a touch-first operating system with Windows 8 and its push into Windows tablets (and Windows Phone), which was ultimately abandoned outside of specific devices like the Surface Pro. Maybe things will be different with voice.

The more prompting and context you give AI, the more it can do. That's not exactly intuitive with voice, but that's where Copilot Vision comes into play. Copilot Vision allows AI to view your screen and offer assistance based on this context. It's been a feature of Copilot+ PCs since June, but now it'll be available broadly across all Windows 11 computers, even those without an NPU (neural processing Unit). Google recently added a similar capability to its Chrome browser.

One of the most prominent use cases for Copilot Vision has been for tutorials in applications. If you're looking for a certain action or menu in a complicated piece of software, Copilot Vision can quickly point you in the right direction. It's a floating toolbar that can follow you around to any app or part of Windows, given the context of what's on your screen, whether that's the whole desktop or just a particular window.

That means less prompting, and combined with voice control, it's more akin to having a knowledgeable friend standing over your shoulder. Microsoft calls it “Highlights,” which can be triggered just by asking Copilot to “show me how,” whether that's while editing a photo, checking your calendar, or writing a grocery list. In some apps, like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, Copilot Vision can even “see” what's beyond your actual screen, such as slides in a presentation or pages in a Word doc that aren't in full view.

Mehdi also talked about Gaming Copilot, which brings Copilot Vision into the world of gaming, whether on a PC or a device like the new ROG Xbox Ally. I saw a demo of it in action, with the assistant offering directions to a player about what missions to take next in an open-world adventure.

It's when Copilot Vision is combined with Copilot Actions that things get interesting. This is Microsoft's take on AI agents. Copilot Actions can do things on your behalf locally with an app or operating system, just by following natural language instructions. So, rather than have Copilot Vision show you where to find that obscure setting in Adobe Photoshop, Copilot Actions can just go turn it on for you. You can have Copilot Actions make the same edit on a folder full of photos or extract information from a large PDF.

Microsoft also showed a preview of where Copilot Actions are heading, which highlights the vision of “rewriting” Windows 11 for AI. A feature called Connectors, available now for Windows Insiders, lets you take actions locally on your PC directly from the Copilot app, such as opening files from OneDrive, opening emails, or even creating a PowerPoint presentation. Microsoft says third-party applications like Google Calendar or Gmail will work within the Copilot app.

For example, you can ask Copilot to find details of a dentist appointment or find a specific file by describing it. So long as you've permitted Copilot to have access to those apps, Copilot can not only locate those apps and files, but it can also take action on them or in them. While this replicates some of the functionality of Recall, the security-troubled AI feature exclusive to Copilot+ PCs, Microsoft says they will live side by side. Other features specific to Copilot+, like Click to Do, will remain exclusive to devices with more powerful on-device NPUs for faster AI processing.

Copilot Actions have been a part of Microsoft's 365 Copilot enterprise tools since late 2024, but this is the first time they'll be rolled out widely to average Windows users. Microsoft says it'll be available “in the coming months,” and this time you'll be able to use Copilot Actions with text prompts instead of just voice.

The idea of taking action on apps from within a search is not dissimilar to what Apple is doing with Spotlight Actions and shortcuts in macOS Tahoe. But Microsoft's ambitions seem much more grand. For now, Copilot is still something you have to call up, whether with voice or by clicking the app (built into the Taskbar search bar). But it's not hard to imagine Copilot growing into the primary interface of Windows.

Will any of this actually get people to use Copilot more? That's hard to say. For a myriad of reasons, the Windows crowd tends to change behavior slowly, and moving from Windows 10 to Windows 11 has already proven to be a challenge.

You're constantly leaving your fingerprint all over the internet. You leave it with the personal information you share willingly, the personal information you share unknowingly, and with the mountain of data that gets sent to each website you load. Maybe you know a thing or two about privacy and decided to pick up a VPN to keep your browsing private. Even then, you're a lot less private than you expect.

Your PC and the millions of servers that make up the internet share a lot of information, but the vast majority of it doesn't fall under the umbrella of personally identifiable information. For instance, a website might know that your default system language is English, so it loads the English version of its website. That's not personally identifiable. Sure, the website knows English is your preferred language, but the same is true for hundreds of millions of others.

In isolation, this data doesn't mean much of anything. Together, however, it can identify you. This is the data that makes up your browser fingerprint, and it can be used to track you across the internet, even when visiting different websites, opening different browsers, and when you have a VPN turned on. Here's everything you need to know.

The best way to describe a browser fingerprint is to show you. Go to AmIUnique and wait a minute or two for the test to run. You can see all the information your browser sends, as well as a similarity score based on all the results in the AmIUnique database. If you can't be bothered, my fingerprint on a PC running Windows and Chrome—by far the most common operating system and browser—is unique out of over 4 million entries in the AmIUnique database.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has its own fingerprinting tester called Cover Your Tracks, and it puts the information in a slightly different way. I'm using Linux on my PC, and according to this test, that's true of about one out of six PCs the EFF has tested; not unique at all. However, my WebGL fingerprint—details about how graphics are rendered in my browser—is very unique. Only one in over 33,000 browsers has the same WebGL fingerprint.

Your browser fingerprint is a collection of innocuous information about your PC that, when put together, is unique enough that it could identify an individual. Some of the components of your browser fingerprint include your computer's hardware, your browser and version, the various versions of software you have running in your browser, the fonts you have installed on your PC, your time zone, your system language, your keyboard layout; the list goes on. Out of the dozens of pieces of information, none of them could identify you individually. It's when this data is bundled together that your fingerprint becomes unique.

There are some situations where that could be a problem. If you are a particularly high-profile figure with a big cybersecurity target on your back, someone could identify and track you, waiting for a key vulnerability to show up before attacking.

Most of us aren't high-profile figures. No, your browser fingerprint isn't used for an attack; it's used for advertising. Most targeted advertising is straightforward. You visit a website, opt into or out of cookies, and whatever cookies remain identify you to serve you ads. Fingerprinting works in a way that doesn't require cookies. Advertisers can get around needing a unique identifier (a cookie) to track your behavior online.

Advertising agencies have used fingerprinting to bypass cookies too. In a ProPublica exposé, it was revealed that AddThis, a company that made social sharing tools, was using canvas fingerprinting behind the scenes. This type of tracking draws invisible images on your screen and then uses how those images are rendered and displayed to create a unique identifier. AddThis, according to the report, was in use everywhere from the official White House website to YouPorn, and it started using canvas fingerprinting without the knowledge of the websites that used its tools.

Is Browser Fingerprinting Legal?

There aren't any laws banning browser fingerprinting. Although the individual components of your fingerprint aren't covered by privacy regulations like the GDPR, the collection of them is. All of the components of your browser fingerprint are transmitted without your consent. However, if a company plans on managing that data to create a unique identifier, it needs to comply with GDPR, including acquiring consent.

Is Browser Fingerprinting Accurate?

Browser fingerprinting is probabilistic. Unlike a cookie, which is an unambiguous identifier that can follow you across the internet, your browser fingerprint is a collection of data that, on their own, can't identify you. When put together, however, this data is usually unique enough to identify you.

It's tough to say how accurate browser fingerprinting is exactly, but a 2019 meta-analysis found anywhere from 35 percent to over 95 percent accuracy. The paper concludes that accuracy can vary wildly based on the device and the websites a user commonly visits.

What Browser Blocks Fingerprinting?

The two main browsers that block fingerprinting are Brave and Firefox. Both use lighter fingerprinting protections, where some information may be shared, but not so much as to upend the browsing experience. This lighter approach can reduce the accuracy of browser fingerprinting, even if it doesn't fully obfuscate the data your browser sends with each request.

There are other browsers more resistant to fingerprinting, such as Tor and Librewolf. Both come with limitations, however, ranging from slow speeds to broken websites.

Fingerprinting is used all over the internet, and it's not always for nefarious purposes. The most well-known tool for fingerprinting is the aptly-named FingerprintJS, made by Fingerprint, which says its software is in use at companies like Dropbox, Western Union, TikTok, and Trustpilot.

Fingerprint says its software can help prevent fraud. Instead of blocking a login or payment from a specific location, a fingerprint creates a more intelligent blocking mechanism. Or maybe you could use it in a game to prevent cheaters from spoofing the accounts of real users. And, if you need a cynical example, you could use it to prevent account sharing, which we've seen ad nauseam from streaming services.

The problem with browser fingerprinting is that it's probabilistic in nature. It looks at a treasure trove of data to track you online, not any individual piece of information. A VPN, for instance, can hide your IP address and make you appear in a different location. If enough of the other data in your fingerprint is consistent, however, it can still be used to track you. Your IP address may be different, but just about everything else about your browsing is not.

There may be practical use cases for fingerprinting, but you really don't have much say in the matter. Even with protections like the GDPR, the moment you load a website, there are likely a few dozen (if not more) trackers copying the information your browser shares for their own purposes. Services like Fingerprint leverage that information to create an identifier, but make no mistake, the data is always there.

You can't get around browser fingerprinting, at least not without significant compromises to your browsing experience (more on that later). Even if you were to spoof or obfuscate every piece of data your browser sends along, that'd probably work against you. The goal with avoiding fingerprinting is to become a Jane Doe online; you want to disappear in the crowd, so every piece of data that makes you stand out sends up a red flag.

The best way to fight back against fingerprinting is to hide or rotate enough information so that it's more difficult to track you, not impossible. And that starts with a VPN, though it doesn't make you fully anonymous. The clearest online fingerprint you leave is your IP address and physical location, and VPNs hide both. More importantly, many of the best VPNs today include additional tools to combat fingerprinting.

ProtonVPN, which is what I use myself, includes NetShield to block trackers, ads, and malware. It doesn't prevent fingerprinting, but NetShield can at least capture and block requests from well-known trackers to make you a bit more private online. NordVPN has a similar feature, as does Surfshark.

The most robust version of this type of blocker comes from Windscribe. Through its browser extension, you can do things like rotate your browser's user agent to make it appear as if you're using a different browser, as well as spoof your language, time zone, and GPS information to match the VPN server you're connected to. Again, this will not make you fully anonymous online. But an extension like the one Windscribe offers makes tracking your fingerprint more difficult.

On top of a VPN, you can use a tracking-resistant browser like Brave or Firefox. Brave combats fingerprinting by blocking or randomizing values that are returned to trackers, dealing with the issue by making instances of Brave look as similar as possible while also ensuring that identifiers aren't able to track you across sessions and websites.

Firefox has similar protections in place, as well as features like the Multi-Account Containers add-on. With it, you can have several containers in your browser that live independently of each other but within the same browser window. For example, you might have all of your social media websites in one container, your shopping in another, and your news in a third. These should all be isolated enough that what you interact with on social media isn't suddenly influencing the ads you see on news websites.

You can get around browser fingerprinting if you absolutely need to, but the juice isn't worth the squeeze for most people. It involves using a browser that's slow, clunky, and will often break or refuse to load the websites you want to visit. Browser fingerprinting really becomes problematic when it's used to track you across websites, browsers, and sessions. Restricting all of your browsing to a browser designed to get around browser fingerprinting isn't practical in most cases.

But I have some options if you want to go crazy. First things first: Regardless of the browser you're using, you need to disable JavaScript. The vast majority of data collected through your browser is through JavaScript. You can disable it on just about any browser, including Chrome, but it'll break some websites. Nearly every website uses JavaScript, and only some of them are designed to work with JavaScript disabled.

With JavaScript disabled, you need a VPN and a browser built to get around tracking. The most popular is undoubtedly Tor. Tor routes your traffic through the Tor network, which is a series of nodes to mask the origin of your traffic. It's incredibly slow, often blocked, and clunky to use. You don't use the Tor network for casual browsing. Other options include browsers like Librewolf, which is a fork of Firefox. And, once again, you'll have to deal with slow load times and websites breaking due to blocking certain APIs.

There are so-called anti-detect browsers available, which are less about protecting individual privacy and more about skirting the terms of service of most websites. They're set up for people using multiple accounts—read, bot farms—and you'll need to pay a monthly fee to use one.

As you can hopefully tell, this game of privacy starts to break down quickly. If you're going through all this effort to mask your browsing online, you'll also need to give up on extensions, other software you use that's connected to the internet, and even your OS. Windows and macOS track you, after all. You can do a lot to safeguard your privacy and make it more difficult to track you online. But if you really need privacy, you need to log off.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","One Republican Now Controls a Huge Chunk of US Election Infrastructure","https://www.wired.com/story/scott-leiendecker-dominion-liberty-votes/","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 14:01:00 GMT","

The news last week that Dominion Voting Systems was purchased by the founder and CEO of Knowink, a Missouri-based maker of electronic poll books, has left election integrity activists confused over what, if anything, this could mean for voters and the integrity of US elections.

The company, acquired by Scott Leiendecker, a former Republican Party operative and election director in Missouri before founding Knowink, said in a press release that he was rebranding Dominion, which has headquarters in Canada and the United States, under the name Liberty Vote “in a bold and historic move to transform and improve election integrity in America” and to distance the company from false allegations made previously by President Donald Trump and his supporters that the company had rigged the 2020 presidential election to give the win to President Joe Biden.

The Liberty release said that the rebranded company will be 100 percent American-owned, that it will have a “paper ballot focus” that leverages hand-marked paper ballots, will “prioritize facilitating third-party auditing,” and is “committed to domestic staffing and software development.” The press release provided no details, however, to explain what this means in practice.

Dominion, the second leading provider of voting machines in the US, whose systems are used in 27 states—including the entire state of Georgia—has developed its software in Canada and Belgrade, Serbia, for two decades. A search on LinkedIn shows numerous programmers and other workers in Serbia who claim to be employed by the company.

The Liberty statement does not say whether the company plans to rewrite code developed by these foreign workers—which would potentially involve rewriting hundreds of thousands of lines of code—or whether the company will move foreign developers to the US or replace them with American programmers. (Dominion has a US headquarters in Colorado.) A Liberty official, who agreed to speak on the condition that they not be named, told WIRED only that Leiendecker “is committed to 100 percent … domestic staffing and software development.” An unnamed source told CNN, however, that Liberty will continue to have a presence in Canada, where its machines are used across the country.

Philip Stark, professor of statistics at UC Berkeley and a longtime election-integrity advocate, says Liberty's assurance about domestic-only workers is a red herring. “If the claim is that this is somehow a security measure, it isn't. Because programmers based in the US also … may be interested in undermining or altering election integrity,” he tells WIRED.

With regard to third-party audits mentioned in the press release, a Liberty official told WIRED this means the company will conduct a “third-party, top-to-bottom, independent review of [Dominion] software and equipment in a timely manner and will work closely with federal and state certification agencies and report any vulnerabilities” to give voters assurance in the machines and the results they produce. The company didn't say when this review would occur, but a Liberty representative told Axios it would happen ahead of next year's midterm elections, and the company would ""rebuild or retire"" machines as needed.

But Stark and other election experts believe this is unrealistic and appears to be aimed just at making the company “look good” to right-wing critics. “There isn't time between now and 2026 to design, test, and certify new voting equipment,” Stark says. Federal and state testing and certification is expensive and can take months, depending on what changes a company makes to its voting systems. And many states have legal limitations on how close to an election updates to voting systems can occur. If Liberty plans to replace foreign Dominion workers with US ones, this will likely also slow down any review and rebuilding.

What's more, Stark, who developed procedures for risk-limiting audits used in some jurisdictions to verify the integrity of election results, says the only audits that can provide assurances about election outcomes are postelection audits of paper ballots. An audit of voting software can't even provide assurance that a voting machine hasn't been subverted, because the software and machine configurations can be altered after auditing and certification. A software audit can only identify existing vulnerabilities, but many of these have already been identified by third-party computer security experts who examined Dominion code in the past. And if Liberty were to rewrite any Dominion code, it would need to be audited for new vulnerabilities introduced by the recoding.

News of the acquisition apparently caught Dominion customers off guard last week. Leiendecker reportedly held a conference call on Friday with Colorado county election clerks who were angry that they'd learned of the sale from media reports instead of the company. The election clerks reportedly grilled Leiendecker about conspiracy claims about Dominion and his plans for the company. The company's sparse new website currently has only a brief note from Leiendecker on the homepage announcing that the company is “100% American‐owned.”

Leiendecker's acquisition of Dominion is not a big surprise, however. Knowink and Dominion have worked together closely for a while. Dominion has used Knowink as a subcontractor when bidding for election contracts in order to offer customers a turnkey election solution that includes voting machines and poll books. And Leiendecker's acquisition continues a long history of consolidation in the voting industry.

For the past two decades, there have only been three primary makers of voting machines in the US, the identities of which have changed frequently through mergers and acquisitions. Currently, the top three are Election Systems & Software, Dominion (now Liberty Vote), and Hart InterCivic, in that order.

Dominion was founded in 2003 in Toronto and was not a big player in the US until 2010, when it acquired two other voting firms—Premier Election Solutions (formerly Diebold Election Systems) and Sequoia Voting Systems. Premier/Diebold, like Dominion, exited the elections business after being beleaguered by security problems with its systems and lingering mistrust over the company's close ties to the Republican Party (the former CEO had been a fundraiser for President George W. Bush). Sequoia left in large part due to financial issues. In acquiring Dominion, Leiendecker also acquires any remaining remnants of Premier/Diebold and Sequoia—equipment, software, and people—that Dominion may still possess.

With the Dominion acquisition, Leiendecker gains control of election equipment in more than half of the states. Dominion equipment is used across 26 states plus Puerto Rico. Knowink electronic poll books, which replace traditional paper poll books used to verify the eligibility of voters when they sign in at precincts, are used in 29 states plus the District of Columbia. But there are jurisdictions across 14 states, covering 20 million registered voters, that use both Dominion and Knowink systems. This gives companies that Leiendecker controls ownership of equipment that covers the entire election process in those jurisdictions—from the verification of registered voters to the casting of ballots and tabulation of results. And Georgia uses Knowink and Dominion systems statewide. Knowink poll books even interact with Dominion voting machines since a voter smart card inserted into the poll books gets encoded and then inserted into voting machines to pull up a digital ballot for the voter.

Nonetheless, some might be confused about why Leiendecker would want to acquire Dominion, since the voting machine industry has never been particularly lucrative. A 2017 study estimated it to be a $300 million-a-year business, with Dominion's annual revenue estimated at the time to be about $100 million. Unlike IT systems that get replaced every three to five years, election systems get replaced once in a decade or longer. Voting equipment vendors often rely on long-term maintenance and election-services contracts to stay solvent while vying for new equipment contracts.

It's not clear how much Dominion is worth today. In 2018, Dominion's management team partnered with Staple Street Capital, a private equity firm, to acquire a controlling stake in the company. Staple estimated the company's value at $80 million at the time. A more recent report produced by an accounting firm hired by Dominion to support its claim for damages in Fox defamation lawsuit said the company would have been worth about $741 million in December 2020 if not for Fox's false election-rigging claims.

The Liberty official who spoke with WIRED would not disclose the price Leiendecker paid or whether other parties contributed funds. He said only that Leiendecker “is the sole owner and he privately financed” the acquisition.

On social media, users have expressed concern about Leiendecker's close ties to the Republican Party as a possible reason for his interest in buying Dominion, raising questions about whether he sides with conspiracy theories about Dominion and the 2020 election. Recent settlements in Dominion lawsuits against conspiracy theorists raises further questions about this, as have Leiendecker's connection to Trump ally Ed Martin. Leiendecker didn't respond to questions about these concerns.

Following the 2020 election in which right-wing Trump supporters accused Dominion of having ties to Venezuela—apparently confusing the company with Smartmatic, a voting machine company founded by Venezuelan engineers—and rigging the election, Dominion filed defamation lawsuits against right-wing news outlets Fox News and One America News Network for $1.6 billion for amplifying the false claims. It also filed suit against MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, and former Trump campaign lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, for $1.3 billion each.

In 2023, Fox News settled its suit for $787.5 million, and Newsmax recently settled for $67 million. But last month, Dominion reached agreements with OAN, Powell, and Giuliani for undisclosed terms. These latest settlements were a condition of Leiendecker's acquisition of Dominion. Dominion still has pending lawsuits against Lindell and former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne. The Liberty official who spoke with WIRED says these will be ending soon as well. “All litigation has been resolved or is in the process of being resolved,” the official wrote in an email. But Stefanie Lambert, Byrne's attorney, wrote in an email to WIRED: “There is no settlement. Dr. Byrne is looking forward to trial.” A lawyer for Lindell did not respond to an inquiry but Lindell told Infowars this week that he will never settle with Dominion.

The settlements raise questions about whether Leiendecker simply didn't want to be saddled with lawsuits or if he was doing right-wing defendants a favor by forcing Dominion into settlements favorable to them. Leiendecker didn't respond to a question about the undisclosed settlement terms.

While Leiendecker hasn't directly addressed the issue around conspiracy theorists and election manipulation publicly, his response to allegations of vote-rigging made more than a decade ago suggests he considers election integrity to be paramount, even when doing so might not be politically advantageous. Leiendecker was appointed by Missouri's Republican secretary of state to investigate St. Louis elections administration after problems arose in the 2000 election there, according to Axios. Leiendecker was then hired by Ed Martin to be the Republican director of the St. Louis City Board of Election Commissioners from 2005 until 2009

Martin, now a staunch Trump ally and supporter of his stolen-election claims, is currently the US pardon attorney and prior to this served under the current Trump administration as the interim US attorney for DC, where he demoted prosecutors who worked on January 6 insurrection cases. But in 2005, he was chair of the St. Louis City Election Board when he hired Leiendecker. Five years after hiring Leiendecker, Martin ran unsuccessfully as a GOP candidate for a congressional seat against the Democratic incumbent and was backed by the St. Louis Tea Party. Similar to what occurred following Trump's 2020 presidential loss, Martin alleged there were irregularities in the vote counting. A Tea Party spokeswoman called the election “stolen,” and Martin refused to concede the election. Leiendecker, instead of supporting his former boss, disputed the stolen election claim at the time, saying there were ""no shenanigans” and challenged the critics to prove otherwise. St. Louis Public Radio reported that he directed this challenge at Martin.

During his time as director of the St. Louis elections board, Leiendecker was widely credited by both political parties for improving the election board's procedures and ensuring that it processed votes more efficiently than previous boards.

When it comes to future elections, Leiendecker has said in Liberty's press release and media statements that the company is committed to providing election technology that leverages “hand-marked paper ballots” in “compliance with President Trump's executive order.”

Trump, acting on his false vote-rigging claims, has called for all-paper elections, and his March executive order has called for all voting systems to use or produce a voter-verifiable paper ballot that voters can review to ensure machines didn't alter their votes. Some media outlets have interpreted Leiendecker's statements to mean he aligns with Trump's stance to ban systems that don't produce a paper record. The Liberty official who spoke with WIRED says Leiendecker meant only that Liberty will offer products that “enable compliance with federal and state standards”—whatever those standards may be. Current voting system standards advise states to use systems that produce a paper record but cannot require this; states decide on their own what voting systems they use. Similarly, Trump has no authority to decide what voting systems states use; the Constitution gives this authority to states alone, and the EO is currently being litigated in court.

Notably, Trump's EO also wants states to stop using paper ballots that have bar codes or QR codes to record and tabulate votes, because the codes are not human-readable. These ballots are produced by so-called ballot-marking devices, or BMDs—voting systems that allow voters to make selections through a touchscreen tablet or other assistive device, which then prints a paper ballot showing the voter's selections that the voter can read to verify that the machine marked their votes correctly. The ballot is then passed through an optical scanner to record and tabulate the results.

Many BMDs print ballots with a bar code or QR code on them that is encoded with the voter's choices; it is this encoded portion that the scanner reads to record and tabulate the votes, not the human-readable portion of the ballot that the voter can verify. Ironically, like Trump, election-integrity activists (on the left and right) have long opposed the use of paper ballots with bar codes or QR codes for security reasons: Someone could theoretically program the systems to print a voter's choices on the human-readable portion while encoding something else in the bar code or QR code that the scanner reads and tabulates. Dominion makes a BMD called the ImageCast X, most of which produce ballots with QR codes, which is used in all or parts of 15 states, according to Verified Voting, which tracks election equipment usage in the US. They are used statewide in Georgia, an important swing state that was the subject of much controversy in the 2020 election.

Many election-integrity activists want states that use these types of ballots to tabulate only from the human-readable portion of the ballot, not the QR code or bar code, or simply have voters fill out regular paper ballots by hand instead. Trump is seeking the latter.

Photographs: Michelle Groskopf

Aside from a MAGA hat, there is likely no object that feels more emblematic of US President Donald Trump's return to the White House than the Tesla Cybertruck. The blunt angles and steel doors look futuristic, for sure, but only if the future looks a lot like RoboCop. To some, it's a metallic status symbol. To others, it's fascism on wheels. Either way, heads turn.

Cybertruck owners see things differently. “To me, it's just a vehicle that I love,” says Andrew Castillo, a stock trader from Los Angeles. “It has no political affiliations at all to me.”

We're standing in the parking lot of McCormick's Palm Springs Classic Car Auctions. All around us, a dozen Cybertruck owners—and their cars—bake in the 100 degree heat. They've arrived for a meetup organized by Michael Goldman, who runs the 53,000-person Facebook group Cybertruck Owners Only. Though suspicious of the media, they're eager to set the record straight about the car that they love. WIRED is here to learn how it feels to be out in public in such a politically charged vehicle. Has the past year or so changed anyone's minds about owning the truck? Do owners like the attention—or are they adding bumper stickers decrying Elon Musk?

As we're talking, a woman drives by in a small sedan. “Your cars are fucking ugly!” she screams before peeling off. Castillo smiles. “Some people just aren't playing with a full deck of cards,” he says serenely.

Interviews have been edited and condensed for clarity.

Name: Michael GoldmanAge: 37Location: Palm SpringsJob: Entrepreneur and owner of a construction company.Cybertruck's nickname: “Beastie”

What does your wife think about the car?

When I first got it, my wife really made fun of me for it. She actually made a T-shirt. It says “It looks like a brick and moves like a beast.”

Once she took the kids out in it and we went off-roading and she saw that I was towing my big dump trailers for work and everything else, she was like, “OK, this thing's actually pretty cool. I'm not a fan of the way that it looks, but it's pretty cool and all the features are great.”

What's the craziest interaction you've had with someone while driving the car?

A while back, I went into Whole Foods to drop off an Amazon package. And usually I wear work boots because I do construction. So I go in, and of course a lady in an electric Mustang comes and puts this note on my car. [It read: “This is an extension of your small dick.”] She doesn't know these cars record 24/7. So it recorded her putting the note on, and when I came out, I saw the note, and naturally I'm looking to see who put the note on my car. And sure as heck she's right there.

So I got out and said to her, “Why'd you feel the need to put a note on my car?” She said, “That's because you're driving this and I'm offended.” She called me a Nazi!

So we start talking and she says, “Well, I saw you get out of your truck with your boots, and you're like a big white man. I guess I just assumed because Elon's a Nazi and you fit the profile …” I stopped her and I was like, “My last name is Goldman, what heritage do you think that is?” She's like, “That's Jewish. My wife is Jewish.” I said, ‘OK, so you just accused me of being a Nazi when I'm a Jew. And you said that your wife was Jewish, so I'm assuming you're gay. Is that a safe assumption?” She said yes, and I said, “OK, so did you ever get profiled anytime in your life for being gay?” And she says, “Yeah, all the time. I hated it.” And I was like, “Well, do you realize that you just profiled me based off of the vehicle that I drive and me wearing work boots and being a big white guy as being a Nazi when it's completely something totally different?” And she broke down in tears and apologized. I'm a huge supporter in the gay community out here. So to call me a Nazi homophobe, it just blew my mind.

Name: Russ TaylorAge: 44Location: Ladera Ranch, Orange County, California.Job: Runs a business called Smugglers Runs, which does “postapocalyptic off-road” rallies

When did you order your truck?

When I first saw it come out, [Elon Musk] was like, “Go to Cybertruck.com.” Before he even finished the sentence, I was already there and put in my reservation. I loved just the style, the look, it's totally unique for sure. And obviously there's total polar opposites of people on the design scale, but I loved it. I've always been kind of a cyberpunk, so I fell in love with it right away.

How do you feel about becoming a political lightning rod?

People occasionally just flip [me] off or whatever, but nobody's come up to me and tried to make a statement about anything. Personally, it's kind of dumb. It's just a vehicle. So it's ironic that it would even become a political statement, but nonetheless it is. [Editor's note: Taylor was arrested and plead guilty to conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding in the January 6 attack on the Capitol. He was later pardoned by President Trump.]

Names: Frank Brabec and Diane BrabecAges: Frank, 58; Diane, 63Location: Indio, CaliforniaJobs: Frank is a consultant in the health care industry; Diane is a dog mom and former zookeeperCybertruck Nickname: “Computruck”

Did you like the car from the jump?

Frank: It took me really about three days to get used to the truck, because it's so different to drive. For one thing, it's the only vehicle [in the US] that has a steer by wire, meaning there's no physical connection between the wheel and the tires. It's all electronic. That takes a bit of getting used to. When you put it in sport mode, it squats down and tightens the suspension, and with that 600 horsepower and everything—I'm whipping up the 74. It's a sports car.

What's your favorite thing about it?

Frank: We have two Old English sheepdogs, and it's just a huge area back there for them. Right now it's in dog mode, so the air conditioning blows right on them. It's awesome.

What reactions do you get from people when you drive it?

Diane: We've only been flipped off like three times. Maybe four.

Frank: And they all really seem like angry people just in general. I'm just amused because, first of all, little kids flip out. And I've got little toys in the truck, and I give them out, and kids pose in front of [the car] for pictures. People cheer. I've never had people cheer, and I've had some pretty nice cars. For the most part, it's been this love that I've never experienced in other cars. So when people give negativity, I'm just like, ‘OK.'

Diane: We just laugh and wave.

Name: Jose ReynosoAge: 55Job: Small business ownerLocation: Palm Springs, California

Why did you decide to get the car?

For the marketing. And that's what the truck is used for, for marketing and advertising events. [Reynoso's car is wrapped in his business logo.]

How did you feel about Elon Musk when you bought it?

We didn't know what was coming, the storm that was coming with Elon. By then I had already spent the money on the truck and accessories and all that. So it was sad to see that.

What was sad?

Well, for the CEO of a company that makes a product that a lot of Americans buy and use on a daily basis to put us in the middle of everything because of his controversies. Because when everything was going on, we were the targets. We saw wives and kids being harassed and affected by strangers just because we were driving a Tesla. There was so much hate coming in. So it was shocking, and it was hard to describe and just fear. But thankfully that went by. And among all that, there's a lot of love.

So why isn't it your daily driver?

Well I renovate homes. And I noticed that people, especially with the big controversy, my clients probably don't want to see a vehicle like that with such high controversy come in and be a part of their experience.

Name: Andrew CastilloAge: 40Location: Los AngelesJob: Stock trader

When did you get your truck?

I'd preordered the Cybertruck when it was first announced. Then they released the rendering three months later, and I saw the way it looked and I'm like, nope, cancel. Ugly. I'm not driving that thing around.

Then I got my wife the Model S for Christmas. I started driving that around, and I'm like, I kind of like this. I put an order back in for the Cybertruck and I started building the excitement after that.

How do you feel about it now?

Oh, I love it. Now, everything else to me—and I'm not talking down on anybody else's stuff, I still love a lot of other vehicles out there—but everything else, to me, those soft lines and everything, it all kind of blends together. And the Cybertruck obviously stands out. I mean, we take the trailer out a lot, and I can go to a campground and there's 50 kids that come out: “Cybertruck, Cybertruck, Cybertruck.” I carry little toys inside the frunk so I can pass them out and give them to kids, and they love it. It's a lot of fun.

Anything you don't like about it?

I can't really see the front out of the windshield because it's so long.

What's the Cybertruck community like?

When I had my Bentley and I met other people with Bentleys or Rolls-Royces, it was exclusive. They were a little standoffish to other people with other vehicles. I've learned that with Cybertruck owners, it's like, “Hey, you want to see it? Come on. You want to test drive? Come on.” They're more inclusive.

What's the biggest reaction you've gotten from someone while driving it?

A couple of months ago, I think it was in Idaho, my son and I stopped at this place where they had a bunch of bears. It was almost infested with bears, it was kind of gross. This person literally drove through the grass, through the bears, and cut off the other cars and was behind me following me out. And I'm like, dude, who the heck is this?

I pulled off because I don't know their intentions. That was a pretty wild move. So I pulled off, and my son was with me, and then a little boy jumped out and was like, “Cybertruck Cybertruck!” And I'm like, oh, OK. You guys are cool. The mom was like, “My son loves Cybertrucks. He's autistic, and he's watching Cybertrucks on his iPad right now.” So he got inside, it was hot, my son was in the backseat, and the air conditioner was on in the truck. We were standing outside, and it was hot. And I just remember not rushing the kid, just letting him have his fun. We're literally out there for two hours. That was one of the good moments.

Name: Landon CastilloAge: 8 years oldLocation: Los Angeles

What do you like about the car?

It's made by Tesla.

Are you a fan of Elon Musk?

Yeah.

Do you get a big reaction from other kids when you drive the mini Cybertruck?

Yeah.

Name: Roger DavisLocation: San DiegoAge: Not givenJob: Entrepreneur

What do you like about the truck?

What I love about the truck is just how it's so polarizing. The shape of it, the body of it, the manufacturing technique with the body panels and everything. I just love that it's completely outside of the box.

And are you married?

I was married, but I'm not married anymore. Women don't like the vehicle.

In July, Tesla rolled out a software update to integrate Grok into many of its vehicles. Do you use it?

Her name is Aura, and I use her as a therapist. When I'm driving, I'll ask questions, and it actually gives really good therapy advice.

What's the craziest experience you've had in the car?

In June of this year, I wanted to put the truck through its paces. The Rubicon is a very famous, 22-mile, off-road trail, and it usually takes two to three days. We decided to try to be the first EV truck and Cybertruck to cross the Rubicon. We built out the truck, I think we spent about $50,000 kitting out the car, and then we went.

So three days into the trip, we were only five miles into the trail. It was way more difficult than I could have ever imagined. On the third day, we were coming down Big Sluice, which is probably the hardest part of the trail. And we had just finished and I was in the vehicle by myself, and I was driving along a little stream, and all of a sudden through the trees I felt the light hit me. And I'm going to call it a miracle, because it was. Imagine if you're flush, like how your face blushes, but over my whole body. And then I just felt the presence of God and a deep peace and love. It really broke me down. It really reset my life at that point, is what it did.

Names: Shawn Hyman and Nannette VaglicaAges: Shawn, 63; Nannette, 62Jobs: Shawn sells window coverings; Nannette is a branch manager for a credit unionLocation: Palm Desert, California

What do you like about the Cybertruck?

Shawn: Well, there's the quietness.

Nanette: It's a different feeling than a gas car

Shawn: The way it rides. The instant-

Nanette: There's no shifting. You know? So it's just supersmooth.

Shawn: Instant power.

Nanette: Instant power.

Shawn: Instant torque.

How big a factor was Elon Musk in your decision to buy the car?

Shawn: Well, I've been a huge fan of Elon Musk for years. I mean, with what he's done with SpaceX …

Nanette: I just think he's a brilliant mind.

Shawn: He is. He's an incredibly intelligent man, and he seems to push the right buttons most of the time. I didn't have a problem with his politics, anyway. I don't care about that, because that's just a sideline. That's not what he does. I mean, he's running these corporations, and he's building some really neat stuff. Even Tesla's basically just going to be a technology company that builds cars.

Name: Alex FergusonAge: 32Location: Austin, TexasJob: Cybertruck wrapper

How did you get into wrapping Cybertrucks?

When Tesla announced this vehicle was going to come out, I went in and I bought all the domain variations of “wrapping Cybertrucks.”

How has it been, business-wise?

I believe I've wrapped the most in the country. I've done over 400.

What's the most popular design?

A lot of people really like space designs. So even with the back of this truck, it's got a black hole. It's usually Tesla fans or space fans or engineering people. So that's what we try to go for now. But yeah, we've done a lot of really cool space ones that people love.

When I started hiking, big leather boots were the only real option. They were burly, stiff, and difficult to break in, but one pair would last you decades. Technology has mercifully caught up, however. If you head to the trails today, most hikers and backpackers are opting for more lightweight, low-cut options. While an influx of new shoes from brands like Hoka, Merrell, Danner, and Salomon has transformed the footwear industry, that doesn't mean the hiking boot has had its day. It just depends on what you're looking to do and when you're doing it.

Which shoes should you pick to go out for the day? I tested countless pairs of great hiking boots, trail runners and hiking shoes, across a variety of terrain, from forest trails and coastal paths, to high alpine terrain. To get a better understanding of the differences between the many options available—and which is right for you—I grilled Ingrid Johnson, a leading footwear product specialist at REI. (For what it's worth, Johnson's personal recommendation is the Salomon XA Pro).

When you've chosen your next pair of trail running shoes (or hiking boots), be sure to check out more of WIRED's outdoor guides, like the Best Running Shoes, Best Puffer Jackets, and Best Hiking Backpacks.

If you're carrying a heavy pack over rough terrain, or if it's wet or snowy, you need hiking boots. They tend to be higher at the ankle, with stiff midsoles, protective toe caps, and are generally made from very durable materials like leather and tough synthetic fabrics like Cordura. Hiking boots prioritize stability, protection, and durability.

Boots generally have thick, deep lugs, tougher soles, stronger toe guards, sturdier ankle support. They protect you from rock impact, uneven ground, moisture, and often colder conditions. The high cut designs also offer more ankle support, something I found reassuring when coming back from a recent injury.

But don't think that hiking boot brands are stuck in the dark ages. Borrowing lightweight features and materials from trail running, brands are able to offer technical boots with cushioning, grip and stability. They're still heavy, but featherweight compared to a traditional leather boot. Hoka's Kaha 3 GTX ($240) is one of the best boots available, blending soft nubuck leather, Vibram Megagrip sole and bags of cushioning. Here are a few other picks.

Salomon

Amazon

REI

Backcountry

Salomon

Perennially popular for good reason, these Salomons boast superb levels of comfort and support without the bulk typically associated with traditional walking boots. They feel like ski boots, but that's not a criticism, the height and support is most welcome when walking all day carrying a full pack.

The suede leather and rubberized toe-cap make them impressively robust, they're easy to clean, and the Gore-Tex liner offers complete waterproofing. The outsole is deep, aggressive, and impervious to unexpected slips, and top marks go to the metal lacing system, especially the middle eyelet that grips the laces securely. They're not as forgiving underfoot as many of the newer running-shoe-inspired designs, but there's plenty of shock absorption in the ball and heel.

You pay handsomely for the privilege, but the Kopec is a hugely versatile, waterproof boot for all seasons. Made from 100 percent nylon Cordura, the upper is very durable and gives the boot quite a stiff, secure feel, despite weighing just 11.9 ounces for a size eight.

Designed for day hikes over varied terrain, they impressed me with a great mix of stability and cushioning. If you're not a fan of the pillowy feel of trail running shoes, these hit the sweet spot. They have out-the-box comfort, which is rare with a stiffer boot, and they feel really secure when scrambling and walking. The security in the heel and ankle is matched by a Vibram Megagrip rubber sole with mud loving 4-mm lugs. I'm a big fan of this rubber compound, and here the lugs have been arranged to give the most grip for the least weight.

After months of regular wear—on and off the trails—they still look remarkably fresh, and I appreciate being able to simply hose them down to wash away the mud. Yes they're expensive for day hikers, but the materials used do offer a genuine crossover between old and new designs, without compromising on style or performance.

Mammut

Backcountry (Men's)

Mammut (Women's)

Mammut

Serious alpine terrain demands respect, and if you're going to be encountering snow, ice, rocks and steep climbs, you need a mountaineering boot. Weighing 1 pound, 5.8 ounces per boot (9.5) the Kento Tour, from Swiss pioneers Mammut, offers a surprisingly agile mix of stiff soled support, grip and protection. Given the height and stiffness, it's a remarkably comfortable boot, and despite the big 11 millimeter drop, it's easy to stick to your natural stride.

This is about as far from a trail running shoe as you can get—it's crampon-compatible, for one thing—but it does have out-of-the box comfort, and just enough flex to stop it feeling like a ski boot. Gore-Tex takes care of the waterproofing, and the velour leather upper and approach shoe style lacing system means you can really dial in the fit.

Tested on a snow covered glacier in freezing conditions, I was impressed by the warmth offered, and the Vibram Hexa Tech sole made me feel more mountain goat than amateur mountaineer. I've also used these boots on scrambling rocky ascents, and they just instill confidence in every step.

If you're on a day hike, carrying a daypack, and moving quickly, you're much likelier to be happier in trail runners. Trail running shoes are much lighter, more flexible, and built for speed or covering long distances fast. They have more breathable uppers and softer, more cushioned midsoles.

Most trail running brands offer a choice of waterproof (typically Gore-Tex) or breathable models. Breathable options are ideal for dry weather, and if you're running distances, as they drain quickly if you have to get wet. Waterproof options are great for splashing through puddles, but they do trap heat, which is great in the winter but sweaty in the summer.

It's worth noting that not all trail running shoes are great for hiking. Just as carbon plates are wasted on daily trainers, other features are a waste when you will be mostly walking, instead of running. I love the lightweight feel, grip and cushioning of the Adidas Terrex Agravic Speed ($160), but the rocker design only really works when you're running, not walking.

Hoka

Hoka (Men's)

Hoka (Women's)

Hoka (Men's)

I'm not going to run a hundred-mile race or chase UMTB podiums, so on paper the race-focused, ultra endurance Hoka Mafate X are not for me. I do not care. They are impossibly comfortable and the enormous 49-mm heel dual density foam cushioning (with an 8-mm drop) make them nimble and fun to wear almost anywhere.

The sole is made from the ever-reliable Vibram Megagrip, and the 4-mm lugs grip well. The forked carbon fiber plate adds a propulsive feel, making climbs and descents, at walking or running pace appreciably less punishing. I've worn these shoes for countless hours across all surfaces, and my feet and legs remain remarkably fresh.

They're not designed for hiking, and some people might dislike the fact you feel very little underfoot, but personally, I can't get enough of that sensation. The protective cushioning encourages me to go further, and smooths out the path ahead. Yes, they'll be a bit wobbly if you're balancing along ridgelines, or needing to be precise, but when the path's clearly marked, these will triumph. Annoyingly, they are expensive. Despite some nice toe protection, and a decent sole, they wear much more like a sneaker than a boot.

Salomon has pimped up their excellent Aero Blaze 3 road running shoe and turned it into a multipurpose, multi-surface design. The GRVL moniker refers to gravel, and the idea that, like a gravel bike, the shoes can go anywhere. Yes, it's a marketing ploy, but one I've been impressed with so far (Craft is also leaning into it with the excellent Xplore 2 ($150) and one that should help reduce clutter in the shoe cupboard.

The most noticeable change here is the Gravel ContaGrip outsole with lovely, deep chevron-shaped lugs that work on everything from dirt trails and grass to slippery roads. They're not designed to cope with deep mud or technical rocky climbs, but the reinforced toe area does provide a bit of protection. I live one mile from a forest and, unlike wearing many trail running shoes, I do not hate my time on the asphalt.

The 8-mm drop, foam midsole, and gentle reverse camber shape offers plenty of cushioning, and a nice smooth journey. They lack the plushness of the Hoka Mafate X, but foot fatigue is minimal. They're not specifically aimed at hikers, but I've had no issues wearing them on weekend walks, runs and trips to the shops. The Gore-Tex upper keeps my feet dry too, although the white sample I've been wearing didn't stay that way for long.

Altra

Altra (Women's)

The Altra Lone Peak shoe first launched in 2011 and now has a cultish following, particularly with thru-hikers looking to go the distance. Weighing 11.15 ounces for men's (9.3 ounces for women's), the shoe is light and comfortable, and the reinforced toe and heel offers excellent protection from nature's trip hazards. I tested the waterproof version (non waterproof are $20 less), which survived sloppy puddles and grass, and was impressed by the neat little Velcro strip on the heel for attaching gaiters.

Being an Altra, it's a zero-drop design and has a super wide toe box to encourage natural movement. While this does give the sneaker a rather orthopedic look, the comfort is hard to argue with. As someone developing bunions from too many hours in climbing shoes, the Lone Peak 9 are a blessed relief. Be warned though, you will need to train your legs to adapt to a zero-drop design before taking on any serious distances.

The midsole here doesn't offer super-shoe levels of cushioning, and that's no bad thing, as they remain balanced and responsive over all types of terrain. There's a rock plate too, which really makes a difference. The MaxTrac rubber outsole grips well in mixed condition, and the 3.5 millimetre lugs are well positioned and eat up the trail. There is also a marginally heavier Lone Peak 9+ ($155) which has a Vibram Megagrip sole for even greater grip.

While not advertised as such, the Columbia Konos Trillium ATR looks and feels like a trail running shoe, and in my experience, can happily do both, assuming you're not looking to try and win the Barkley Marathon. But they are good for long days on mixed terrain and at 11.9 ounces per shoe (US men's 9) they're light, yet still feel more supportive than a dedicated runner.

The midsole borrows the most from running tech, with plush cushioning and an 8 millimeter drop that helps smooth out your stride, even when the trail turns rocky or loose underfoot. Yes, the added squish does impact on stability if you're a heel striker, but they're great on packed dirt, gravel and woodland paths.

They're not perfect for everything. On very wet or technical terrain, I'd want more side support and stiffness, and if I were carrying a heavy pack over multiple days, I'd still choose boots. But for faster hikes, day trips and mixed-surface adventures, they're a great shoe at a great price.

If you're moving through technical terrain—lots of gravel or scree, anything where your foot placement really matters—you should consider a hiking shoe. Hiking shoes are sort of a middle ground between boots and trail runners. They're more flexible than full boots, but stiffer than trail runners. They often share many protective features from boots including thick soles, good toe protection and liberal use of leather and tough synthetic materials. They are however generally more agile and comfortable, with a quicker break-in period.

They're also heavier than trail runners, but much lighter than boots. What you lose in speed, you tend to gain with added support. The soles too tend to be stiffer than trail runners, and lack the plush responsiveness. This isn't always the case, as I discovered with the Merrell Speedarc Matis GTX ($210), which blends the two features well.

Hiking shoes offer good protection from rocky terrain and tree roots, with thicker soles and reinforced toe bumpers keeping your feet from harm, but they are still vulnerable to deep puddles or snow. Trail running shoes are often designed for enhanced breathability, and drainage, so you can run through streams and shed water quickly. This is great if you are actually running, as they will dry quickly, but a bit soggy for a casual hike.

Merrell

Merrel (Men's)

Available in a non-waterproof shoe, GTX, and mid-height Gore-Tex boot, these futuristic-looking hiking shoes from Merrell might not appeal to a traditionalist, but they are extremely capable across a huge variety of terrain. At 12.87 ounces for a US 9, they're quite heavy—especially compared to trail runners—but they have a surprising amount of heft to them and excellent Vibram MegaGrip outsole with mud-shelling 3 millimetre lugs that are great on slippery roots, gravel, trails, grass and generally scrambling about.

There's a plate included here between the funky two-part midsole, which makes the shoe quite stiff—again, compared to trail runners—and I love it. It's rare to find a combination of trail running plushness with the security of a stiffer hiking boot. I'd not suggest you carry a heavy pack over rocky terrain for days with them, but they're a great option for moving fast on the trails, with your feet well protected. They look like a cool trail running shoe too, so you can still look good popping out for your Cortado.

It's a bold design departure for Merrell, who has a brilliant track record making boring but brilliant hiking shoes and boots. The Moab Speed 2 GTX ($170) remains a firm favorite, and while they lack the ‘trail running' aesthetic they're padded, grippy and offer all-day stability.

Hoka

Hoka (Men's)

Hoka (Women's)

They look big on my feet, but impressively weigh a mere12.64 ounces per shoe (US men's 8) while still offering the plushest level of cushioning, and confidence boosting support across a wide range of terrain. They also have excellent breathability, which makes them ideal for dry, warm weather adventures and breezy toes.

Given the chunky dimensions some might be tempted to size down, but in truth, I'd actually take at least half a size up. My US 11 sample had generous width, but only just enough length, which is unusual. Once you've found your size, though, the shoe's Vibram MegaGrip sole and well-organized 5-mm lugs provide superb traction. Hoka has also incorporated a 100 percent recycled polyester upper here, as well as a sockliner made with 50 percent soybean oil.

The Anacapa Breeze Low (also available in a GTX waterproof model) are a few years old now, and as such, often heavily discounted. They look enough like trail runners for you to keep up (in the style stakes) with the cool kids.

I've tested at least 40 pairs of hiking boots, shoes and trail runners since I first wore these Danners, yet they remain a regular for trips out, day hikes and general mooching about. I wouldn't hike the 2,650 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail in them, despite being named after it, but they are comfortable and supportive, with impressive protection underfoot from rocks and uneven ground.

On the heel, you'll notice a funny plastic bumper. This is actually a clever way to add lateral stability without impacting on comfort. I've had no issues with either, so I have to assume it works. Danner offers a Gore-Tex option here, which I've also tested, but the membrane did make the shoe stiffer, and tighter, so maybe go half a size up. My preferred upper is made from suede that softens over time, molding to my foot. It also looks great, although it does hold onto the water if wet, unlike the latest trail runners.

Keen

At 13.4 ounces per shoe, these new style Keen aren't as featherweight as the Arc'teryx Kopex, but they do have a more trail runner style feel, despite the ankle height. They're agile, with plenty of spring from the midsole, with the added bonus of a bit of support over uneven ground. They're not a pretty shoe, but performance is impressive nevertheless.

They're far less clunky than a traditional boot, but solid enough that I never get compromised on slippery or technical surfaces, and the Keen-Dry waterproof membrane hasn't failed me yet. The multidirectional 4-mm lugs gripped well on slippery autumnal trails, and I liked the inclusion of traditional boot eyelets. It's a small detail., but one that makes getting higher boots on much easier.

Over a four hour hike without any prior breaking in, I found the cushioning is forgiving, with no hotspots, and the toe box generous. I've only tried the mid-height option, but imagine the low design is equally as comfortable and will feel even more like a well supportive trail runner.

Adding another option to the outdoor footwear mix, approach shoes are hybrid walking shoes with technical features borrowed from climbing shoes. They're specifically made to tackle the technical approach to the start of a rock climb and boast sticky rubber outsoles which grip well on rock.

Climbing brands like La Sportiva, Scarpa, and Arc'teryx offer these shoes but the fit is slightly different. Senior commerce editor Adrienne So loves these because the fit is snug, so you can wear them on the iffiest terrain, and there's not much cushioning (which feels much better if you're used to wearing barefoot-style shoes). The lack of cushioning and the protective rubber rand is good if you like a versatile shoe that can work for multiple outdoor sports, like skateboarding and mountain biking.

The Black Diamond Prime that she recommends here also has a stomp-down heel which makes it an ideal camp shoe for slipping on and off easily.

What factors matter most when considering which pair of shoes you should get?

I consulted Ingrid Johnson from REI who noted a couple of key factors that are important to consider. Durability is important. Johnson notes that “trail running shoes tend to wear out faster than hiking boots, especially ones with a foam midsole like a road running shoe rather than a harder rubber sole.” Leather also tends to last longer than fabric uppers, especially mesh.

Trail running shoes are typically made from fabric and boots, typically leather, but there is some overlap between categories. Some hiking shoes are almost identical to boots, just without the mid-height ankle. Approach shoes have the shortest lifespan, especially on the sole, as the sticky rubber wears out fast. The soles are thinner and offer more direct contact with the rock.

The faster you are trying to move or the more miles you are trying to cover in a day, the more the weight of your shoes matters, as extra ounces on your feet add up to thousands of reps for your hip flexors. However, Johnson says, “it is not worth sacrificing function just to shave weight, for boots or any other type of gear. If your fitness level, pack weight, body weight, or the terrain call for more stiff, supportive footwear, you will be more comfortable and perhaps actually able to travel faster because you are more confident in your footing compared to going with too light a shoe.”

Hiking boots weigh around 2.5 to 3-plus pounds per pair, while trail running shoes start from around 1 to 1.5 pounds. Ultralight models like the Nnormal Kjerag 01 for $140 weigh just 8 ounces per shoe for a size 9, but don't expect them to last as long as those with greater levels of protection.

Salesforce used Dreamforce 2025 to do more than launch products. It declared a philosophical shift in how companies will operate — what Salesforce's longtime CEO Marc Benioff called the “agentic enterprise.”

At its core, this is Salesforce's vision for a world where AI agents not only assist humans but also work alongside them in every workflow, every function, and every customer touchpoint. Rather than replacing sales teams, Salesforce presents AI as an amplifier of human capability.

Benioff's opening words made the point clear: “AI doesn't care. But we do. The real miracle isn't building machines that think like us. It's building an enterprise where people can become everything they're capable of being.”

That framing truly matters. It distances Salesforce from the dystopian narrative that AI automates people out of jobs. Instead, it positions AI as a human enabler, freeing employees from repetitive tasks so they can focus on strategy, relationships, and creativity.

Salesforce refers to this fusion of humans and AI as “agentic,” and it's building the infrastructure to make it a reality.

The centerpiece of Dreamforce 2025 was the unveiling of Agentforce 360, a fully unified AI layer built across all Salesforce applications — Sales, Service, Marketing, Commerce, Slack, Tableau, and even ITSM.

Benioff described it as “the next revolution after cloud, mobile, and social — the agentic AI revolution.”

Agentforce 360 isn't just another automation tool. It's an ecosystem of intelligent agents — what Salesforce calls “Agentforce” — that can interpret context, access data from multiple systems, and act autonomously. The platform combines natural language with deterministic logic through a new feature called Agent Script, enabling enterprises to design predictable and auditable AI workflows.

Salesforce EVP of Product and Industries Marketing, Patrick Stokes, demonstrated this with Agentforce Vibes, a developer tool that lets anyone “vibe code” applications by simply describing what they want to build. In minutes, Stokes created a real-time Dreamforce command center dashboard without writing a single line of code. He told the audience, “For the first time, our people, our AI, our business, and our ideas all speak the same language.”

That statement captures Salesforce's broader goal — to make AI accessible not only to data scientists but to sales reps, marketers, and service teams. The company wants every employee to be able to build, customize, and deploy their own digital co-worker.

Salesforce's pitch to sales organizations was simple: AI will turn selling from manual execution into intelligent orchestration.

Benioff noted that over the past two decades, Salesforce has digitized the sales process — pipeline tracking, CRM, lead scoring, and account management. But those tools have often overwhelmed sales teams with data instead of empowering them.

The agentic model promises that AI will now interpret that data, summarize customer context, recommend subsequent actions, and even initiate conversations.

During the keynotes, several examples illustrated how this might work:

This convergence underpins Salesforce's argument for an AI-enabled sales strategy. The mechanics of the funnel no longer burden sales reps. Instead, they're elevated into strategic advisors who spend more time nurturing relationships and less time toggling between systems.

Benioff called this “humans and agents driving customer success together.”

It's an evolution of Salesforce's original CRM promise, from managing relationships to activating them through AI-driven insight.

One subtle yet essential theme running through both keynotes was the concept of purpose. Salesforce didn't just talk about speed or efficiency. It spoke of meaning.

Benioff reflected that many people feel disillusioned by the grind of modern work — buried in data entry, inboxes, and dashboards. AI, in his telling, restores time and energy for higher-value contributions. “More time to solve. More energy to connect. More humanity in the loop,” he said.

This emotional framing aligns with Salesforce's culture of “Ohana” and its long-standing 1-1-1 philanthropy model. It also serves a strategic purpose: while competitors like Microsoft and Google emphasize raw AI power, Salesforce differentiates through its narrative of trust, ethics, and human-centric design.

That trust theme was reinforced repeatedly. The company positioned Einstein Trust Layer as the safety net that ensures customer data never leaves Salesforce's secure environment. The new Agent Script feature also reflects this focus on control, providing admins with deterministic guardrails so AI doesn't “hallucinate” or make rogue decisions.

For enterprise sales teams handling sensitive customer data, that's a persuasive argument. AI may be powerful, but without trust and governance, it's unusable. Salesforce wants to be the company that delivers both.

Dreamforce 2025 also introduced Agentforce Voice, giving AI agents a conversational layer across the contact center and sales workflows.

In one demo, an AI agent handled customer inquiries through natural dialogue, understood product history, and scheduled appointments, all while syncing with Salesforce data. The magic wasn't just in voice recognition; it was in context continuity.

Benioff emphasized that context is the secret sauce. “You don't have your data, you don't have your context,” he said. Agentforce 360 unifies that context across every channel — voice, chat, email, or field service — ensuring that the AI knows the customer's journey end-to-end.

For sales representatives, this means they can join or hand off a conversation without losing the history. Imagine an inside sales agent who's briefed automatically on what an AI discussed with a prospect, what pain points emerged, and which proposal templates were most effective. Instead of scrambling through CRM notes, the rep can walk into the next call fully informed.

It's easy to see how that kind of continuity could lift close rates and improve customer satisfaction.

Across both keynotes, Salesforce executives emphasized that AI's true power lies in the feedback loops between humans and agents.

Every time an agent answers a question, generates a campaign, or drafts a proposal, it feeds more intelligence into the system. Over time, the agent learns from the human's edits, decisions, and tone. That feedback loop, what Salesforce calls “agentic learning”, gradually improves both sides of the equation.

This approach is especially transformative for sales organizations where training and ramp-up time can be expensive. An AI agent that learns the company's top-performing sales techniques and embeds them into future interactions can scale expertise across an entire organization.

As Benioff framed it, “We've already seen over a million customer service requests handled by Agentforce. That's a million times our people were empowered to drive greater value.”

The implicit message: imagine what happens when that scale reaches sales, marketing, and beyond.

While most of the spotlight was on Agentforce, Salesforce's follow-up announcement with Anthropic earlier in the week signaled something bigger: a broadening ecosystem strategy.

Salesforce will now expand Anthropic's Claude models deeper into regulated industries, such as financial services, healthcare, and government, all integrated through its Einstein AI Platform.

This partnership matters for two reasons.

First, it cements Salesforce's neutral-model approach. Rather than tying customers to a single LLM vendor, Salesforce is building an “open model orchestration layer” that allows enterprises to use OpenAI, Anthropic, or their own custom models, depending on the sensitivity of the data.

Second, it provides Salesforce with a credible answer to the governance question that has hindered the adoption of generative AI in highly regulated sectors. By combining Anthropic's “Constitutional AI” framework with Salesforce's trust architecture, the company is effectively saying: “We can bring AI to your industry without violating your compliance boundaries.”

That's a powerful message to large B2B sales organizations, especially those in finance, pharma, and insurance, that have hesitated to deploy AI due to risk concerns.

Dreamforce keynotes have always been part product showcase, part revival meeting. This year was no different. The energy in San Francisco's Moscone Center was unmistakable: part excitement, part relief.

The relief stems from a sense that Salesforce has found its footing with AI after a period of uncertainty. The company was late to the generative AI race in 2023, but it's now leveraging its greatest asset: decades of customer data and workflow expertise.

By framing AI as “agentic,” a term still emerging in the mainstream, Salesforce has carved out its own linguistic niche, one that seamlessly blends technology with humanity. It's a story that resonates with both IT buyers and front-line sales leaders.

Still, challenges remain. Execution will depend on how well Salesforce can deliver on seamless data integration, reduce AI hallucinations, and manage cost at scale. Competitors like Microsoft (with Copilot) and HubSpot (with Sales Hub AI) are racing toward the same goal, aiming to make sellers more productive through context-aware automation.

Salesforce's differentiator will likely be its depth — the completeness of its CRM, data cloud, and now its agent layer.

Dreamforce 2025 painted a bold vision of the future of sales: one where every rep has an intelligent partner that listens, learns, and acts.

Sales teams won't be replaced. They'll be augmented and equipped with agents that prepare meetings, qualify leads, update records, and surface insights in real-time. The mundane disappears. The strategic re-emerges.

As Benioff summed it up, “AI, when built with trust, elevates your people. It helps them move faster, think deeper, and connect more meaningfully.”

If Salesforce can deliver on that promise, the agentic enterprise may indeed become the next great evolution of the modern sales organization, not a story of machines taking over, but of people finally getting back to what makes them irreplaceable.

Brook.ai, a Seattle-area health technology startup that uses AI to help clinical teams to deliver remote care, raised a $28 million Series B round led by UMass Memorial Health and Morningside. 

Founded in 2015, Brooks' platform combines data analytics, automated nudges, and support from clinicians and health coaches to help patients manage chronic conditions from home.

The company says its approach can cut hospital readmissions — such as for congestive heart failure — and improve metrics like hypertension control. It promotes its platform as a turnkey system that can be deployed in 30 days.

Brook reported 204% patient growth over the past year, and an 82% retention rate.

Brook began as a diabetes management startup, combining data from devices and coaching to support glucose control. It later broadened its scope, layering in hypertension, metabolic health, and general chronic disease care.

The company is expanding amid reimbursement and policy shifts that increasingly favor remote and home-based care. But the sector faces hurdles, including complex data integration, long sales cycles, and regulatory burdens.

The broader remote healthcare market is projected to expand from roughly $69 billion in 2024 to over $219 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research.

Brook co-founder and CEO Oren Nissim sold his previous company, mobile and location services company Telmap, to Intel in 2012. He co-founded Brook with the company's chief product officer, Kit Macgillivray, a longtime strategy consultant and executive who worked with Nissim at Telmap for several years.

A project to build one of the nation's first next-generation nuclear facilities has just announced its name — the Cascade Advanced Energy Facility — and shared renderings of the plant. The effort includes a coalition of partners coming together to deploy the reactors engineered by X-energy and Amazon is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to get the effort off the ground.

The question now is will it be enough to kick off a new wave of U.S. nuclear energy innovation — a field that America largely soured on by the 1980s?

“This is not for the faint of heart,” said Ben Reinke, senior vice president for global business development and deputy commercial officer for X-energy. “This is a difficult thing — to take on new technology like this and bring it to market.”

Since 2020, X-energy has been in talks with Energy Northwest, a consortium of Washington public utilities and the operator of the Pacific Northwest's only operating nuclear plant, trying to get the initiative to coalesce.

Then a year ago, Amazon publicly entered the picture, leading a $700 million investment round in X-energy and committing to spend $334 million to fund essential, early stages of deployment, including development, licensing and construction. 

“We said, ‘We want that power enough, and we wish to be an enabler of this technology, so we'll fund it,'” said Daniel Gross, director of Amazon's Climate Pledge Fund. 

Amazon — like other tech giants — is hungry for massive volumes of energy to fuel its data centers, which are growing rapidly as artificial intelligence increases computational demands. Nuclear is attractive because it doesn't produce carbon emissions and can operate 24/7, unlike wind and solar power that is available intermittently.

The facility will be located near Richland, Wash., near Energy Northwest's Columbia Generating Station nuclear plant. The initial goal is to install a cluster of four small modular reactors (SMRs) that can produce up to 320 megawatts of power, but the overall vision is to construct 12 reactors total, with a capacity of nearly one gigawatt. 

If all the funding, permitting and public support come together, construction should start within the next five years, with the plant coming online in the 2030s.

The U.S. doesn't have any operating SMRs — China and Russia do — but the expectation is they'll be quicker and cheaper to build than previous reactor designs. That said, the facilities will cost billions of dollars and take years to complete. 

X-energy's first nuclear facility is planned for Seadrift, Texas, and is being built in partnership with Dow to power a chemical manufacturing site. The project has submitted engineering and preliminary designs for the project and a construction permit application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for approval.

The hope is the Washington project will come together a little more easily than the first-of-a-kind project in Texas. 

“You don't want to start construction or start moving dirt until your design is fully ready to go. As soon as you start putting a lot of people and a lot of work on the site, that's when the costs start accruing,” said Greg Cullen, vice president of energy services and development at Energy Northwest. “So you want to make sure you're ready.”

Cullen didn't put a price on the initial phase of the project but indicated it would be more than $2 billion. He said the effort is seeking additional funding from the U.S. Department of Energy's Loans Program Office. 

While X-energy is providing the technology for its Xe-100 reactors, Energy Northwest will lead the construction. Cullen said the organization will soon announce a coalition of companies that will perform the work.

And in August, X-energy and Amazon signed a “strategic collaboration agreement” with South Korea's Doosan Enerbility and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power to accelerate SMR construction by supporting supply chain and manufacturing processes.

For Amazon, its support of the Cascade Advanced Energy Facility is part of a much bigger initiative. The company has set a goal of deploying 5 gigawatts of nuclear power in the U.S. by 2039.

“One thing that Amazon does well is scale technology,” said Brandon Oyer, Amazon Web Services' head of power and water for North and South America. “We've done this over and over again … We'll go and make an investment and then learn how to scale that up, drive out cost, make it more readily available.”

Targeting SMRs for amplification was a “natural fit,” Oyer added. 

The company believes nuclear aligns with its climate ambitions. Amazon matches all of its electricity use with clean power and is the largest corporate purchaser of wind, solar and other renewable sources. That said, it is struggling to cut its carbon footprint to reach a goal of net-zero emissions by 2040 as the AI-boom stokes energy use. Amazon reported that its carbon footprint grew by 6% last year.  

Amazon has dibs on half of the 320 megawatts of electricity that will be generated by the first four reactors at the Washington site, but will take all of it if the power prices are too high for local utilities to afford. 

Cullen said that if everything goes well with the initial phase, it would be straightforward to build the other eight reactors as the permits will encompass the complete build out. The added reactors would produce enough electricity for about one million homes and should come at a lower cost. 

“Amazon recognizes the role they can — and are willing — to play,” Cullen said. The company can take some of the early risk and bring that catalytic capital, he said, which is “very, very difficult for utilities to do.”

“Are you talking to your computer?”

That line from a new Microsoft Windows ad, spoken by a confused bystander, will double as a litmus test for the company's latest attempt to bring its flagship operating system into the era of artificial intelligence.

Microsoft announced a series of new and updated AI features for Windows 11 on Thursday morning, aiming to move people beyond typing and clicking toward more human-like interactions with computers.

Among the new features:

It's part of a larger push by Microsoft to redefine the personal computer around AI. Company executives say the shift to conversational input and autonomous capabilities could prove as significant to personal computing as the arrival of the mouse and keyboard decades ago. 

“In our minds, voice now will become the third input mechanism to use in your PC,” said Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft's consumer chief marketing officer, in a briefing with reporters. “It doesn't replace the keyboard and mouse, necessarily. It's an additive thing. But this will be pretty profound.”

More broadly, the company is betting that Windows users will begin treating their PCs less as tools and more as collaborators.

After pushing AI into its Office apps and cloud services, Microsoft is now embedding it directly into the OS. It's a way of making AI unavoidable on the PC, and testing whether the idea of the “AI computer” will resonate with everyday users rather than just early adopters.

The PC is also the battleground that Microsoft still controls. The company largely missed the smartphone era and has struggled for relevance on mobile devices that run on operating systems from Apple and Google. With AI quickly becoming the next major platform shift, Microsoft wants that transition to start on Windows, not somewhere else.

Apart from the new voice interactions, the biggest update is the expansion of Copilot Actions agentic capabilities across the PC. Microsoft says it will launch as an experimental feature in Copilot Labs for people enrolled in the Windows Insider program, starting with a narrow set of use cases.

This agentic feature also creates new security risks. Microsoft says it has built a new security framework for Copilot Actions, which is disabled by default and runs the AI agent in its own contained workspace and dedicated user account with limited access to user folders.

More broadly, the announcement signals a change in Microsoft's AI strategy for Windows. The company's big “AI PC” push began last year with the announcement of Copilot+ PCs, which have a special NPU chip designed for AI tasks. However, the rollout has been rocky, and its flagship “Recall” feature was delayed repeatedly over security and privacy concerns.

With these latest updates, Microsoft is now focusing more on AI features that will work on any Windows 11 PC, not just the models with special hardware. 

Microsoft insists it isn't abandoning the NPU strategy but simply broadening the AI capabilities to reach all Windows 11 users. Copilot+ PCs will get some exclusive features to set them apart, like a new integration for scheduling Zoom meetings using the “Click to Do” feature.

The timing of these announcements is notable, as Microsoft recently ended support for Windows 10, the version of the operating system that debuted in 2015. Part of the goal is to give millions of legacy Windows users a new reason to upgrade to new hardware.

Helion Energy has secured a Conditional Use Permit from a Central Washington county to start the next phase of development for what it hopes will be the world's first commercial fusion plant.  

The company broke ground in July at the site, located in the town of Malaga near the Columbia River. It's building a 50 megawatt fusion facility named Orion that aims to harness the same nuclear reactions that fuel the sun and stars.

The new permit from Chelan County allows for construction of the fusion generator building and follows a public notice and comment period. The facility is being built on land that Helion is leasing from the Chelan County Public Utilities District.

“As a company of builders with a single-minded focus on making electricity from fusion commercially practical, we couldn't be more excited to move into this next phase of construction for the Orion power plant,” said Helion CEO David Kirtley in a statement. 

The project previously received a Mitigated Determination of Non-Significance from the state's comprehensive environmental review process, or SEPA.

RELATED: Helion breaks ground on what could be the world's first fusion plant despite significant uncertainty

Chelan County Commissioner Kevin Overbay acknowledged Helion's significant community engagement with the region ahead of permitting and construction, and cheered its role as an energy pioneer. 

“Central Washington is known as the Buckle of the Power Belt for its foresight decades ago of bringing hydropower to the state,” Overbay said. “To be the home of fusion energy would enhance the legacy of our area as a continued leader in clean energy production.” 

While construction continues, Helion is still working at its Everett, Wash., headquarters to develop the technology needed to commercially generate power from fusion — a feat that no one has yet accomplished. 

The company has spent 12 years on R&D and building prototypes and raised more than $1 billion from investors. It has a deal with Microsoft to buy the electricity from the plant, provided all goes as planned. The energy will power data centers in the region. 

In related fusion news, Google DeepMind shared today that it's partnering with Boston-based Commonwealth Fusion Systems to use its AI in pursuit of fusion energy.

Medal, a platform for uploading and sharing video game clips, has spun out a new frontier AI research lab that's using its trove of gaming videos to train and build foundation models and AI agents that can understand how objects and entities move through space and time – a concept known as spatial-temporal reasoning.

Called General Intuition, the startup is betting that Medal's dataset – which consists of 2 billion videos per year from 10 million monthly active users across tens of thousands of games – surpasses alternatives like Twitch or YouTube for training agents. 

“When you play video games, you essentially transfer your perception, usually through a first-person view of the camera, to different environments,” Pim de Witte, CEO of Medal and General Intuition, told TechCrunch.  He noted that gamers who upload clips tend to post very negative or positive examples, which serve as really useful edge cases for training. “You get this selection bias towards precisely the kind of data you actually want to use for training work.” 

This data moat is what reportedly attracted the attention of OpenAI, which late last year attempted to acquire Medal for $500 million, per The Information. (Neither OpenAI nor General Intuition would comment on the report.) 

It's also what has led to General Intuition's raising a whopping $133.7 million in seed funding, led by Khosla Ventures and General Catalyst with participation from Raine. 

The startup intends to use the funds to grow its team of researchers and engineers focused on training a general agent that can interact with the world around it, aiming for initial applications in gaming, and search and rescue drones.  

De Witte says the founding team has already made strides: General Intuition's model can understand environments it wasn't trained on and correctly predict actions within them. It's able to do this purely through visual input; agents only see what a human player would see, and they move through space by following controller inputs. This approach, the company says, can transfer naturally to physical systems like robotic arms, drones, and autonomous vehicles, which are often manipulated by humans using video game controllers.  

General Intuition's next milestone is two-fold: generating new simulated worlds for training other agents, and autonomously navigating entirely unfamiliar physical environments.  

That technical approach is shaping how the company plans to commercialize its technology, and sets it apart from competitors building world models.  

While General Intuition is also building world models on which to train its agents, such  models aren't the product. Unlike other world model makers like DeepMind and World Labs, which are selling their world models Genie and Marble for training agents and content creation, General Intuition is focusing on other use cases to avoid copyright issues.  

“Our goal is not to produce models that compete with game developers,” de Witte said.  

Instead, the startup's gaming applications center around creating bots and non-player characters that can surpass traditional “deterministic bots,” or preprogrammed characters that produce the same output every time. 

“[The bots] can scale to any level of difficulty,” Moritz Baier-Lentz, a founding member of General Intuition and partner at Lightspeed Ventures, told TechCrunch. “It's not compelling to create a god bot that beats everyone, but if you can scale gradually and fill in liquidity for any player situation so that their win rate is always around 50%, that will maximize their engagement and retention.” 

De Witte also has a background in humanitarian work, which informs the startup's focus on powering search and rescue drones, that sometimes have to navigate unfamiliar environments and extract information without GPS. 

Ultimately, de Witte and Baier-Lentz see General Intuition's core functionality – spatial-temporal reasoning — as a crucial piece in the race toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). While major AI labs focus on building ever more powerful large language models, General Intuition believes true AGI requires something LLMs fundamentally lack.  

“As humans, we create text to describe what's going on in our world, but in doing so, you lose a lot of information,” de Witte said. “You lose general intuition around spatial-temporal reasoning.”

Amazon One Medical, the retailer's primary care provider acquired in 2022, is launching a pay-per-visit virtual healthcare service for children ages 2 to 11, the company announced on Thursday. Message-based visits start at $29, and video visits cost $49.

The healthcare service doesn't require insurance or a One Medical membership and can help treat issues like pink eye, lice, and more than 10 skin-related issues, including eczema, bug bites, contact dermatitis, fungal rashes, and more. The service also covers EpiPen and asthma medication renewals.

Amazon started offering a pay-per-visit virtual healthcare service for adults in 2024.

“This service isn't meant to replace a family's relationship with their child's pediatrician, but rather to serve as a convenient option for those ‘in-between' moments for parents with time-sensitive concerns who don't already have on-demand access through a One Medical membership,” said Natasha Bhuyan, MD, family physician and national medical director for Amazon One Medical, in a press release. 

The move comes as companies like Walgreens, CVS, and Walmart are scaling back their retail health services. 

Amazon last week debuted prescription vending machines at its One Medical clinics, starting in Los Angeles. The kiosks have a range of commonly prescribed medications, including antibiotics, inhalers, and blood pressure medications.

These new kiosks could disrupt brick-and-mortar pharmacy businesses, which are already struggling. For instance, Rite Aid recently closed all of its remaining stores; CVS has closed more than 1,000 stores since 2021; and Walgreens closed 500 stores over the past year.

The launch of the new pay-per-visit service for kids marks Amazon's latest move to expand its presence in the healthcare sector. In 2018, Amazon purchased online pharmacy PillPack for $750 million and then launched Amazon Pharmacy in 2020. Two years later, it bought One Medical for $3.9 billion.

Spotify on Thursday announced a series of deals with major record labels to develop new AI products designed ensure fair compensation and center artists and songwriters in the experience. In partnership with Sony, Universal, Warner, and Merlin, the streamer said it would develop “responsible AI” products that respect copyright, but also allow the artists to choose whether or not they want to allow the use of AI tools.

Spotify didn't delve into the specifics of how the new tools would operate, but the company already offers generative AI experiences for users, including with its AI DJ that plays a personalized selection of songs and others that allow users to request playlists using AI prompts, for instance. 

Spotify was recently criticized for allowing an AI-generated band's music to go viral on its service, raising questions about whether the future of music would push human artistry to the side.

Last month, the company revamped its AI policy to cut down on spam, particularly users who upload AI content at mass scale, create duplicates, and manipulate the search and recommendations systems. Spotify also said it would adopt the music labeling system DDEX to label when AI was used as part of the music creation process.

The upcoming gen AI features follow that promise by allowing artists to opt in to using AI tools if they choose. In all likelihood, the upcoming system would allow artists to identify when their music is used in AI-generated tracks and collect some sort of payment. Spotify notes the system will expand beyond artists to include other rightsholders and distributors over time.

“Some voices in the tech industry believe copyright should be abolished. We don't. Musicians' rights matter. Copyright is essential,” Spotify shared in its announcementment. “If the music industry doesn't lead in this moment, AI-powered innovation will happen elsewhere, without rights, consent, or compensation. Together with rightsholders, artists, and songwriters, we are making significant investments in AI research and product development,” it read.

In addition, Spotify said it has begun building a generative AI research lab and product team focused on building out new technologies that reflect its principles that artists should be able to choose if and how they participate in the AI music ecosystem. It says work on the first products has already started, and more tools will be on the way.

Between infinitely scrolling job boards and the puzzling rise of fake applicants using AI to apply en masse, job-searching has quickly become one of the most bewildering experiences the internet has to offer. Listings are posted and re-posted across different platforms as applications go unanswered, creating a spam-like flood of activity on both sides.

“If you put a job on LinkedIn, you might get 1,000 people applying for that job within the first six hours,” says Matt Wilson, a London-based serial entrepreneur. “Some companies don't even review the applicants that apply for those jobs, because the signal to noise ratio is very, very low.”

Wilson's new solution is Jack & Jill, a new platform that uses conversational AI to reinvent the recruitment process from the ground up. The company announced $20 million in seed funding today, led by EU investor Creandum, but it's hardly been in stealth. Service is already live in London, where the outfit has garnered nearly 50,000 users — and Wilson wants to use the influx of cash to fuel a US expansion and take Jack & Jill to a new level.

“There hasn't been a major change in how people find jobs since LinkedIn and Indeed came on the scene 20 years ago,” says Wilson. His bet is that, with AI chatbots changing workplaces across the world, now might be the time to shake things up.

As you might guess from the name, Jack & Jill is a two-part platform. The “Jack” side of the platform handles the applicant side, giving users a 20-minute, AI-powered profile interview before providing them with a select list of roles pulled from online databases. From there, Jack can be used for mock interviews or more involved professional coaching. “Jill” works with employers, building a profile of a particular role and elevating candidates that match its requirements. Like LinkedIn, part of the goal is for both workers and hiring managers to keep an active presence on their respective apps, letting the app pull players off the sidelines as needed. The service takes a standard commission from any successful hire, and as the scope of the platform grows, Wilson hopes to make Jack & Jill indispensable for both sides.

That might sound like a standard recruiting system with a little AI sprinkled on top, but Wilson thinks conversational chatbots are more important than a simple matching algorithm. By building the process around chatbot interviews, he believes he's found a scalable alternative to the endless shuffle of listings and resumes, potentially reinventing the basic elements of the contemporary hiring process.

Using AI systems to conduct first-round interviews is increasingly common in many parts of the world — particularly in China, where many multinational corporations have used the practice for hiring local roles. But while a surprise interview with an AI hiring manager might seem alienating, Wilson hopes that Jack & Jill's approach will result in more intelligence applied to job placement overall.

“I think the way that we are mapped to the companies we work for, and vice versa, is just extremely inefficient,” Wilson says. “There are billions of people out there that could be in better jobs for them. And that's a mission worth working on.”

An earlier version of this piece was published with an erroneous figure in the headline. TechCrunch regrets the error.

Ke Yang, the Apple executive leading the iPhone maker's efforts to build AI-driven web search, is heading to Meta, according to a Bloomberg report.  

Yang's departure marks the latest in a string of exits from Apple's AI unit, putting the company into jeopardy in the lead-up to a much-anticipated Siri revamp scheduled for March. Ruoming Pang, Apple's former head of AI models, left for Meta earlier this year. Roughly a dozen team members on Apple's AIML (AI and machine learning) team also left the company. Several members joined Meta's new Superintelligence Labs. 

A few weeks ago, Yang began overseeing the Answers, Knowledge, and Information (AKI) team, which is tasked with improving Siri's functionality by allowing it to pull information from the web so Apple can better compete with rivals in the AI search market, like OpenAI, Perplexity, and Google. The new Siri also promises to be able to tap into personal data for more complex tasks.  

Bloomberg reports that Apple's remaining team members expect more AI team members to jump ship in the coming months. 

TechCrunch has reached out to Apple and Meta for comment.

Indian quick-commerce startup Zepto said it has raised $400 million in a funding round led by a new investor, California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), a U.S.-based pension fund. The round, which is a mix of primary and secondary investment, also has participation from existing investors, including Avenir, Avra, Lightspeed, Glade Brook, The Stepstone Group, and Nexus Venture Partners. After this funding, the company plans to go public next year.

Zepto competes with other quick commerce players such as Eternal's (formerly Zomato) BlinkIt, Swiggy Instamart, and Tata-owned BigBasket — all part of publicly listed companies. The startup has been on a funding spree as it picked up $1.3 billion in a span of several months last year. Since Zepto's last funding round in November 2024, Swiggy made its public debut on India's stock exchange, and Blinkit surpassed Zomato in gross order value (the total value of customer orders) for Q1 2025.

The company also faces competition from legacy ecommerce players such as Flipkart and Amazon, which have started their own quick commerce delivery services. 

Startups are also looking at verticalized e-commerce offerings. Accel-backed Swish and Zing are operating in the food delivery space; publicly listed Nykaa, Flipkart-owned Myntra, Silkk, and Blip want to deliver apparel to customers in an hour; Lightspeed-backed Snabbit is allowing users to book home services like cleaning within 10 minutes; and startups like FirstClub are taking a curation approach to grocery delivery. 

Zepto and CEO Aadit Palicha are confident about the startup's growth. Palicha said that the company has scaled from 500,000 daily orders five quarters ago to 1.7 million daily orders and predicted that the growth will continue.

“The key metric for this round of funding was our ability to turn dark stores profitable while acquiring over 10 million new monthly transcating users. We obviously invested incrementally in customer acquisition and store launches. But even as you were doing that, we were able to keep turning stores profitable,” Palicha told TechCrunch.

BlinkIt, Instamart, and Zepto operate in many of these spaces, with food delivery being the most notable one. However, Zepto had to pause its Zepto Cafe offering in 44 cities due to staff challenges. While the company didn't specify how many cities it has resumed operations in but it said Zepto Cafe is a business of over $110 million in run rate and growing rapidly.

Signs for the quick commerce market are encouraging in India. Morgan Stanley predicts the quick commerce market could reach $42 billion by 2030. Bernstein said in a note in March that it could reach $100 billion in a decade. The analyst firm also noted that in target markets, quick commerce is the primary way people are buying groceries now.

Zepto has largely concentrated on major cities in India in terms of expanding services. J.P. Morgan noted earlier this month that BlinkIt has its dark store network of warehouses to fulfill online orders in more than 204 cities, compared to Swiggy Instamart in over 104, and Zepto in over 80 cities in India. Zepto has over 1,000 stores in these cities and plans to add hundreds of stores over the next 12 months.

The startup noted that while the majority of its business comes from metro cities, it is now receiving close to 20% of total order volume from smaller cities.

On its app, Zepto has focused on showing off its offerings like Super Saver, which gives users additional discounts on groceries for large orders, and highlighting categories like electronics, fashion, and decor. But this has made the app cluttered. Palicha acknowledeged that and said that the company will make changes to interface to simplify the app in coming months.

The investment is a notable one for CalPERS. The pension fund typically invests in venture capital through intermediary funds rather than leading direct investments in startups. CalPERS has been aggressively expanding its venture exposure since 2022 after what officials called a “lost decade” of underperformance, scaling its venture allocation from around $800 million to a targeted $5 billion. The fund's decision to lead a round in an Indian quick-commerce startup seemingly signals strong institutional confidence in India's rapid delivery sector and perhaps CalPERS' growing appetite for direct venture investments in emerging markets, too. Notably, CalPERS is also an investor in funds of Zepto's existing backers, like Lightspeed and General Catalyst.

> The enduring power of pivot tables is their robustness, simple usage, and fast, interactive response. It's the Lingua Franca of data if you are not fluent in the language of SQL or Python. A common language everyone understands: the top management, domain experts, and developers. It's an interface to data; it's the first no-code interface. Instead of the multidimensional query language MDX or the newer DAX, people can use a simple drag-and-drop interface. It democratized data analysis.

It seems like the page updates the page url every time you scroll to a new section, which means you end up with 10+ history entries for the page if you scroll all the way through. To exit out of the page you'd have to click back 10+ times to go through those history entries. Google maps does something similar, where it adds a new entry to history every time you pan, which means your history is polluted with entries for google maps.

There are all sorts of data that are nearly impossible to get into Excel because of the ways that it tries to turn everything into a date.  There has been so much silent data corruption because of random misfeatures that were added decades ago and now they will never back out of the system. The string OCT4 amongst a column of alphanumeric identifiers will get changed into a date, silently, on import, and it's nigh on impossible to find out how to import without that silent conversion. It's better to write your own Python code to get data into Excel than to use its built in foot guns.

It suffers from trying to do too many things at once, though. Excel 3 is enough for those use cases without being a complete nightmare for everyone else. Electronic spreadsheets as a concepts are genius, it's the implementation I hate.

WHY wouldn't Microsoft just run it in the local interpreter on the machine?

reply

Probably to tighten vendor lock-in.

reply

But using a spreadsheet to store data is completely reasonable. We delude ourselves as technically experienced people when we imply otherwise. When Excel fucks up data (perhaps the most unforgivable sin in all of software) with unexplainably bad defaults and UX for auto-formatting (i.e. ""trying to be clever""), it's absolutely out of touch to point the finger at the end user.

As a developer, the flow is:
1) Build AI Chat Assistants or AI Workflows with the TypeScript SDK 2) Run `inkeep push` from your CLI to publish 3)Edit agents in the visual builder (or hand off to non-technical teams) 4) Run `inkeep pull to edit in code again.We built this because we wanted the accessibility of no-code workflow builders (n8n, Zapier), but the flexibility and devex of code-based agent frameworks (LangGraph, Mastra). We also wanted first-class support for chat assistants with interactive UIs, not just workflows. OpenAI got close, but you can only do a one-time export from visual builder to code and there's vendor lock-in.How I've used it: I bootstrapped a few agents for our marketing and sales teams, then was able to hand off so they can maintain and create their own agents. This has enabled us to adopt agents across technical and non-technical roles in our company on a single platform.To try it, here's the quickstart: https://go.inkeep.com/quickstart.We leaned on open protocols to make it easy to use agents anywhere:
An MCP endpoint, so agents can be used from Cursor/Claude/ChatGPT
A Chat UI library with interactive elements you can customize in React
An API endpoint compatible with the Vercel AI SDK `useChat` hook
Support for Agent2Agent (A2A) so they work with other agent ecosystemsWe made some practical templates like a customer_support, deep_research, and docs_assistant. Deployment is easy with Vercel/Docker with a fair-code license and there's a traces UI and OTEL logs for observability.Under the hood, we went all-in on a multi-agent architecture. Agents are made up of LLMs, MCPs, and agent-to-agent relationships. We've found this approach to be easier to maintain and more flexible than traditional “if/else” approaches for complex workflows.The interoperability works because the SDK and visual builder share a common underlying representation, and the Inkeep CLI bridges it with a mix of LLMs and TypeScript syntactic sugar. Details in our docs: https://docs.inkeep.com.We're open to ideas and contributions! And would love to hear about your experience building agents - what works, hasn't worked, what's promising?

Details in our docs: https://docs.inkeep.com.We're open to ideas and contributions! And would love to hear about your experience building agents - what works, hasn't worked, what's promising?

How I've used it: I bootstrapped a few agents for our marketing and sales teams, then was able to hand off so they can maintain and create their own agents. This has enabled us to adopt agents across technical and non-technical roles in our company on a single platform.To try it, here's the quickstart: https://go.inkeep.com/quickstart.We leaned on open protocols to make it easy to use agents anywhere:
An MCP endpoint, so agents can be used from Cursor/Claude/ChatGPT
A Chat UI library with interactive elements you can customize in React
An API endpoint compatible with the Vercel AI SDK `useChat` hook
Support for Agent2Agent (A2A) so they work with other agent ecosystemsWe made some practical templates like a customer_support, deep_research, and docs_assistant. Deployment is easy with Vercel/Docker with a fair-code license and there's a traces UI and OTEL logs for observability.Under the hood, we went all-in on a multi-agent architecture.

You can always ""pull"" a project to a staging folder so you can resolve conflicts in code manually if someone made changes in visual while you made changes in code.

inkeep isn't open source with a Elastic License 2.0, why not just go with OpenAI agents sdk (MIT)?

Re:OpenAI agents builder - there is a hard one-time ejection to code. You can export to their TypeScript or Python SDKs (in some limited use cases), but it's a one-way fork. Their visual canvas is meant to stay visual canvas.Their SDK is open source -- it's basically for calling the OpenAI APIs downstream. But their visual builder / orchestration layer is not.

Being able to handle off and give the same system to other engineers or non-engineers in a visual format for them to own and edit makes it easy to make these agents portable and explainable.

reply

reply

Architecturally, n8n is good for deterministic workflows and adding some LLM nodes for data transformations and tool calling, but because their system is not truly multi-agent, then a) it's not good for conversational experiences like chatbots or copilots and b) agents can't actually go back and forth with each other to solve problems with a shared conversation history, etc.

reply

That said - for devs, you still get the TypeScript representation, so you can always interface with the system that way if you prefer.

reply

The visual UI + code is really cool, addresses the weaknesses of both approaches.

reply

That said, yes, we deal with a lot of customer support use cases so conversational experiences were a top priority for us. It's nice to be able to interact with an agent as a workflow or conversationally.

Seems to be a common theme in 2025: Actually-healthy companies cosplaying as struggling companies, as an excuse to justify layoffs and other activities that transfer wealth and power from employees to management and shareholders. Like, does anyone think any of these BigTech (and MediumTech) companies who are all doing layoffs are really ""struggling"" and ""vulnerable""? It's always just an unbelievable excuse.

reply

I've actually always liked working for companies in which the objective was straight forward. None of this ""we're a family"" stuff. You should be kind, and all the places I was at were kind. But layoffs are a reality and reducing headcount at times is part of that. You need a way to get rid of dead wood, otherwise you would be too afraid to grow and hire when you need to.

reply

And, yes, of course layoffs are something that need to be justified, just as with firing an individual employee, as you know -- the ""employee is not being productive"" is a justification.

reply

However the best work I ever did was done when I didn't have a pressure of being fired for offending the wrong person, and that I had the psychological safety to think longer term- since a short term ""time-waste"" often converted to better long term outcomes for everybody.

I felt the same way until I worked at a company where almost nobody ever got fired or laid off. Anyone who was hired was basically guaranteed their job until the end of time because the leadership didn't like letting anyone go.It only took a couple years until every time you needed to do something you'd run into some employee somewhere who wasn't doing their job. Even many people who seemed capable and appropriately skilled started slacking off when they realized there were never any consequences at all.It was like a broken windows theory for the workplace. As people looked around and saw that others were doing almost no work, it started to spread. The people who liked actually shipping things started leaving, turning it into a snowball effect.So there's a balance. Always working under threat of layoff and seeing good coworkers let go when you're already overburdened isn't good. Working in a company where there is no pressure at all to perform isn't good either.

There's a sort of apathy osmosis that happens when you realise that you can't actually do anything because everyone else is sort of checked out... so the you, yourself, sort of check out too.I get anxiety and ""itchy"" if I don't move towards my goals with any kind of swiftness.

To the point I even had a boss say that part of this happens because nobody is there to spank adults when they need it (seriously), rather than intervene too strongly and have to find a replacement or hurt feelings or something. Or another contract worker, I got an apology from said boss... but he insisted she's better now than she used to be, the latest incident is mild compared to incidents before I arrived. As though that fixes it.

Layoffs are a signal to markets of struggles, and firms absolutely do, in practice, need to justify them (and their scale and focus) to avoid the risk of a self-fulfilling market perception that they signal a problems that they do not fully resolve. (If there is already a problem narrative, much of the justification is obvious, and the firm just needs to cover explaining how the layoffs address the problem.)

reply

Another factor is that retained employees that learn of companies layoff frequently become concerned about their own position and the treatment of the workers that were laid off, reducing employee morale. High performers may start looking for another job in order to avoid expected future layoffs.Then there's the impact on potential future employees, who will also know about the layoffs. These employees will be aware of recently layoffs and will expect more money from said company who will also have to train the new employee that replaced the one they laid off before.Finally, you have the impact on potential customers or existing customers. Some customers have relationships with employees that are laid off, and this can be jarring. The customers may become concerned about the liability of the company or the management of the company, potentially moving all our part of their business to another firm.All of these effects are not typically beneficial to the company or it's shareholders.

Alternatively, you can retrain the workers. Replacing workers has serious cost disadvantages: recruiting itself costs money (the HR staff dedicated to that, external headhunters, ""employer branding"" measures, job exhibition rents and swag), layoffs cost reputation, and new workers need to be trained in your company specific procedures from timetracking to expense refunds.Unfortunately, these costs are all too often hidden deep in the balance sheets, which makes just dumping off entire departments while hiring up other departments appear much more financially attractive than it is in reality, all costs considered.

Even if they feel they ARE being productive, they should be allowed to let them go. The ultimate point of a job is not to get paid, it is to produce work that accomplishes a goal set by the employers. So if they change those goals for some reason, then the letting-go should be allowed.I really wish there was some sort of UBI to disincentivize clinging to a near-useless (in terms of ultimate goals) job. Heck, just making unemployment not contingent on getting fired (another perverse incentive) would be an improvement.

So what companies do is over hire during growth and lay off later to capture the value created by these workers. Then rinse, repeat.

Corporations are greedy and let go of many good people. But they also let go of many people who deserved to go. It's really hard to get rid of bad people, even in the US. But you wouldn't believe how many bad people were in big tech because of the COVID over hiring.I've seen dozens, if not hundreds of people, who went to FAANG and added next to no value. As a manager in one of these companies, I had to deal with a mix of great people and many who were absolutely taking advantage of the company. I could write a book about it. Good for them, but it's not surprising that the party would end someday.

This has been my experience at two different companies in multiple cases with egregious underperformance. I suppose if an employee assaulted/harassed someone or was doing something else outright illegal like theft or embezzlement, they would be shown the door immediately. But if someone is half-assing their work and dragging the team down, everyone has to put up with it for months as they get second chances, micromanagement, and other special attention before they can actually be let go.I think it's due to the litigiousness of the US culture. Yes, US companies can fire people at will, but they can also file lawsuits at will, which are costly (time+money) no matter the outcome.

I was fired once, and there were no PIPs, no documentation, no warning, no nothing. Just ""We aren't doing this work anymore and don't need you"" and that was that.

reply

And if that employee can show that other people were allowed to wear green shirts without being fired, they can use that to support an illegal discrimination claim against the company.The reason it takes effort and documentation to fire people is because companies want to have a uniform set of rules that are applied equally to all employees. They also want documentation to support the firing. Having a consistent process, applied equally and with supporting documentation discourages people from even trying to bring frivolous lawsuits.Having additional process is also a check on managers. Some managers try to fire anyone they disagree with, dislike, or even to do things like open headcount so they can fill it with a nepotism hire. Putting process in place and requiring documentation discourages managers from firing people frivolously and adds another level of checks and balances to discourage gaming the system.

Then there's the perverse incentive that bigger teams usually equals a promotion. So if you're the honest manager who manages a tight team and fires people, you won't get promoted as often.Top management knows this, of course. To sidestep these misaligned incentives a company-wide one-time layoff is really effective.

But what you cannot do in any circumstance is let people go ""for any reason"". There are laws against that at any size, and you are looking for a lawsuit if you give a reason.It's best to just tell them their position has been eliminated due to restructuring (has to be provable if you're a big company), and give them no reason beyond that. If you don't give a reason, they have nothing to bring a lawsuit for.In summary, reasons are not always required, but are always a liability.

It was incredibly rough- a lot of people who weren't being told they needed to shape up or ship out were instead simply told they're being shipped out. The only upside is managers got better about supporting employees later on who weren't performing, including putting people on PIPs rather than letting them coast.

You can definitely argue it's not fair to pay somebody extra for not doing a job but the alternative seems to be you keep paying them even more to keep not doing a job (and possibly doing negative work).Rather than put somebody on a pip for x months just offer them x months of salary to quit. Same money, same work done.

There's no correlation. They hired expecting a certain type of growth. They fired because of AI. The narrative that they were getting rid of bad workers was their excuse, not the reason. Many great engineers got let go. Many project managers that had been with the company through ups and downs. One guy was let go after being poached from a FAANG after his 3rd day. So don't say anyone deserved it.

Marcin Jakubowski is compiling a DIY set of society's essential machines and making it open-source.

You live in a house you designed and built yourself. You rely on the sun for power, heat your home with a woodstove, and farm your own fish and vegetables. The year is 2025. 

This is the life of Marcin Jakubowski, the 53-year-old founder of Open Source Ecology, an open collaborative of engineers, producers, and builders developing what they call the Global Village Construction Set (GVCS). It's a set of 50 machines—everything from a tractor to an oven to a circuit maker—that are capable of building civilization from scratch and can be reconfigured however you see fit. 

Jakubowski immigrated to the US from Slupca, Poland, as a child. His first encounter with what he describes as the “prosperity of technology” was the vastness of the American grocery store. Seeing the sheer quantity and variety of perfectly ripe produce cemented his belief that abundant, sustainable living was within reach in the United States. 

If we're going to live on Mars we'll need a way to grow food in its arid dirt. Researchers think they know a way.

With a bachelor's degree from Princeton and a doctorate in physics from the University of Wisconsin, Jakubowski had spent most of his life in school. While his peers kick-started their shiny new corporate careers, he followed a different path after he finished his degree in 2003: He bought a tractor to start a farm in Maysville, Missouri, eager to prove his ideas about abundance. “It was a clear decision to give up the office cubicle or high-level research job, which is so focused on tiny issues that one never gets to work on the big picture,” he says. But in just a short few months, his tractor broke down—and he soon went broke. 

Every time his tractor malfunctioned, he had no choice but to pay John Deere for repairs—even if he knew how to fix the problem on his own. John Deere, the world's largest manufacturer of agricultural equipment, continues to prohibit farmers from repairing their own tractors (except in Colorado, where farmers were granted a right to repair by state law in 2023). Fixing your own tractor voids any insurance or warranty, much like jailbreaking your iPhone. 

Today, large agricultural manufacturers have centralized control over the market, and most commercial tractors are built with proprietary parts. Every year, farmers pay $1.2 billion in repair costs and lose an estimated $3 billion whenever their tractors break down, entirely because large agricultural manufacturers have lobbied against the right to repair since the '90s. Currently there are class action lawsuits involving hundreds of farmers fighting for their right to do so.

“The machines own farmers. The farmers don't own [the machines],” Jakubowski says. He grew certain that self-sufficiency relied on agricultural autonomy, which could be achieved only through free access to technology. So he set out to apply the principles of open-source software to hardware. He figured that if farmers could have access to the instructions and materials required to build their own tractors, not only would they be able to repair them, but they'd also be able to customize the vehicles for their needs. Life-changing technology should be available to all, he thought, not controlled by a select few. So, with an understanding of mechanical engineering, Jakubowski built his own tractor and put all his schematics online on his platform Open Source Ecology.  

That tractor Jakubowski built is designed to be taken apart. It's a critical part of the GVCS, a collection of plug-and-play machines that can “build a thriving economy anywhere in the world … from scratch.” The GVCS includes a 3D printer, a self-contained hydraulic power unit called the Power Cube, and more, each designed to be reconfigured for multiple purposes. There's even a GVCS micro-home. You can use the Power Cube to power a brick press, a sawmill, a car, a CNC mill, or a bioplastic extruder, and you can build wind turbines with the frames that are used in the home. 

Jakubowski compares the GVCS to Lego blocks and cites the Linux ecosystem as his inspiration. In the same way that Linux's source code is free to inspect, modify, and redistribute, all the instructions you need to build and repurpose a GVCS machine are freely accessible online. Jakubowski envisions a future in which the GVCS parallels the Linux infrastructure, with custom tools built to optimize agriculture, construction, and material fabrication in localized contexts. “The [final form of the GVCS] must be proven to allow efficient production of food, shelter, consumer goods, cars, fuel, and other goods—except for exotic imports (coffee, bananas, advanced semiconductors),” he wrote on his Open Source Ecology wiki. 

The ethos of GVCS is reminiscent of the Whole Earth Catalog, a countercultural publication that offered a combination of reviews, DIY manuals, and survival guides between 1968 and 1972. Founded by Stewart Brand, the publication had the slogan “Access to tools” and was famous for promoting self-sufficiency. It heavily featured the work of R. Buckminster Fuller, an American architect known for his geodesic domes (lightweight structures that can be built using recycled materials) and for coining the term “ephemeralization,” which refers to the ability of technology to let us do more with less material, energy, and effort. 

Jakubowski owns the publication's entire printed output, but he offers a sharp critique of its legacy in our current culture of tech utopianism. “The first structures we built were domes. Good ideas. But the open-source part of that was not really there yet—Fuller patented his stuff,” he says. Fuller and the Whole Earth Catalog may have popularized an important philosophy of self-reliance, but to Jakubowski, their failure to advocate for open collaboration stopped the ultimate vision of sustainability from coming to fruition. “The failure of the techno-utopians to organize into a larger movement of collaborative, open, distributed production resulted in a miscarriage of techno-utopia,” he says. 

Unlike software, hardware can't be infinitely reproduced or instantly tested. It requires manufacturing infrastructure and specific materials, not to mention exhaustive documentation. There are physical constraints—different port standards, fluctuations in availability of materials, and more. And now that production chains are so globalized that manufacturing a hot tub can require parts from seven different countries and 14 states, how can we expect anything to be replicable in our backyard? The solution, according to Jakubowski, is to make technology “appropriate.” 

Appropriate technology is technology that's designed to be affordable and sustainable for a specific local context. The idea comes from Gandhi's philosophy of swadeshi (self-reliance) and sarvodaya (upliftment of all) and was popularized by the economist Ernst Friedrich “Fritz” Schumacher's book Small Is Beautiful, which discussed the concept of “intermediate technology”: “Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius—and a lot of courage—to move in the opposite direction.” Because different environments operate at different scales and with different resources, it only makes sense to tailor technology for those conditions. Solar lamps, bikes, hand-­powered water pumps—anything that can be built using local materials and maintained by the local community—are among the most widely cited examples of appropriate technology. 

After decades of frustration, machine-learning tools are unlocking a treasure trove of acoustic data for ecologists.

This concept has historically been discussed in the context of facilitating economic growth in developing nations and adapting capital-intensive technology to their needs. But Jakubowski hopes to make it universal. He believes technology needs to be appropriate even in suburban and urban places with access to supermarkets, hardware stores, Amazon deliveries, and other forms of infrastructure. If technology is designed specifically for these contexts, he says, end-to-end reproduction will be possible, making more space for collaboration and innovation. 

What makes Jakubowski's technology “appropriate” is his use of reclaimed materials and off-the-shelf parts to build his machines. By using local materials and widely available components, he's able to bypass the complex global supply chains that proprietary technology often requires. He also structures his schematics around concepts already familiar to most people who are interested in hardware, making his building instructions easier to follow.

Everything you need to build Jakubowski's machines should be available around you, just as everything you need to know about how to repair or operate the machine is online—from blueprints to lists of materials to assembly instructions and testing protocols. “If you've got a wrench, you've got a tractor,” his manual reads.  

This spirit dates back to the '70s, when the idea of building things “moved out of the retired person's garage and into the young person's relationship with the Volkswagen,” says Brand. He references John Muir's 1969 book How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive: A Manual of Step-by-Step Procedures for the Compleat Idiot and fondly recalls how the Beetle's simple design and easily swapped parts made it common for owners to rebody their cars, combining the chassis of one with the body of another. He also mentions the impact of the Ford Model T cars that, with a few extra parts, were made into tractors during the Great Depression. 

For Brand, the focus on repairability is critical in the modern context. There was a time when John Deere tractors were “appropriate” in Jakubowski's terms, Brand says: “A century earlier, John Deere took great care to make sure that his plowshares could be taken apart and bolted together, that you can undo and redo them, replace parts, and so on.” The company “attracted insanely loyal customers because they looked out for the farmers so much,” Brand says, but “they've really reversed the orientation.” Echoing Jakubowski's initial motivation for starting OSE, Brand insists that technology is appropriate to the extent that it is repairable. 

Even if you can find all the parts you need from Lowe's, building your own tractor is still intimidating. But for some, the staggering price advantage is reason enough to take on the challenge: A GVCS tractor costs $12,000 to build, whereas a commercial tractor averages around $120,000 to buy, not including the individual repairs that might be necessary over its lifetime at a cost of $500 to $20,000 each. And gargantuan though it may seem, the task of building a GVCS tractor or other machine is doable: Just a few years after the project launched in 2008, more than 110 machines had been built by enthusiasts from Chile, Nicaragua, Guatemala, China, India, Italy, and Turkey, just to name a few places. 

Of the many machines developed, what's drawn the most interest from GVCS enthusiasts is the one nicknamed “The Liberator,” which presses local soil into compressed earth blocks, or CEBs—a type of cost- and energy-­efficient brick that can withstand extreme weather conditions. It's been especially popular among those looking to build their own homes: A man named Aurélien Bielsa replicated the brick press in a small village in the south of France to build a house for his family in 2018, and in 2020 a group of volunteers helped a member of the Open Source Ecology community build a tiny home using blocks from one of these presses in a fishing village near northern Belize. 

Jakubowski recalls receiving an email about one of the first complete reproductions of the CEB press, built by a Texan named James Slate, who ended up starting a business selling the bricks: “When [James] sent me a picture [of our brick press], I thought it was a Photoshopped copy of our machine, but it was his. He just downloaded the plans off the internet. I knew nothing about it.” Slate described having a very limited background in engineering before building the brick press. “I had taken some mechanics classes back in high school. I mostly come from an IT computer world,” he said in an interview with Open Source Ecology. “Pretty much anyone can build one, if they put in the effort.” 

Gretchen Daily is working to make the environment more of an element in economic decision-making.

Andrew Spina, an early GVCS enthusiast, agrees. Spina spent five years building versions of the GVCS tractor and Power Cube, eager to create means of self-­sufficiency at an individual scale. “I'm building my own tractor because I want to understand it and be able to maintain it,” he wrote in his blog, Machining Independence. Spina's curiosity gestures toward the broader issue of technological literacy: The more we outsource to proprietary tech, the less we understand how things work—further entrenching our need for that proprietary tech. Transparency is critical to the open-source philosophy precisely because it helps us become self-sufficient. 

Since starting Open Source Ecology, Jakubowski has been the main architect behind the dozens of machines available on his platform, testing and refining his designs on a plot of land he calls the Factor e Farm in Maysville. Most GVCS enthusiasts reproduce Jakubowski's machines for personal use; only a few have contributed to the set themselves. Of those select few, many made dedicated visits to the farm for weeks at a time to learn how to build Jakubowski's GVCS collection. James Wise, one of the earliest and longest-term GVCS contributors, recalls setting up tents and camping out in his car to attend sessions at Jakubowski's workshop, where visiting enthusiasts would gather to iterate on designs: “We'd have a screen on the wall of our current best idea. Then we'd talk about it.” Wise doesn't consider himself particularly experienced on the engineering front, but after working with other visiting participants, he felt more emboldened to contribute. “Most of [my] knowledge came from [my] peers,” he says. 

Jakubowski's goal of bolstering collaboration hinges on a degree of collective proficiency. Without a community skilled with hardware, the organic innovation that the open-source approach promises will struggle to bear fruit, even if Jakubowski's designs are perfectly appropriate and thoroughly documented.

“That's why we're starting a school!” said Jakubowski, when asked about his plan to build hardware literacy. Earlier this year, he announced the Future Builders Academy, an apprenticeship program where participants will be taught all the necessary skills to develop and build the affordable, self-sustaining homes that are his newest venture. Seed Eco Homes, as Jakubowski calls them, are “human-sized, panelized” modular houses complete with a biodigester, a thermal battery, a geothermal cooling system, and solar electricity. Each house is entirely energy independent and can be built in five days, at a cost of around $40,000. Over eight of these houses have been built across the country, and Jakubowski himself lives in the earliest version of the design. Seed Eco Homes are the culmination of his work on the GVCS: The structure of each house combines parts from the collection and embodies its modular philosophy. The venture represents Jakubowski's larger goal of making everyday technology accessible. “Housing [is the] single largest cost in one's life—and a key to so much more,” he says.

The final goal of Open Source Ecology is a “zero marginal cost” society, where producing an additional unit of a good or service costs little to nothing. Jakubowski's interpretation of the concept (popularized by the American economist and social theorist Jeremy Rifkin) assumes that by eradicating licensing fees, decentralizing manufacturing, and fostering collaboration through education, we can develop truly equitable technology that allows us to be self-sufficient. Open-source hardware isn't just about helping farmers build their own tractors; in Jakubowski's view, it's a complete reorientation of our relationship to technology. 

In the first issue of the Whole Earth Catalog, a key piece of inspiration for Jakubowski's project, Brand wrote: “We are as gods and we might as well get good at it.” In 2007, in a book Brand wrote about the publication, he corrected himself: “We are as gods and have to get good at it.” Today, Jakubowski elaborates: “We're becoming gods with technology. Yet technology has badly failed us. We've seen great progress with civilization. But how free are people today compared to other times?” Cautioning against our reliance on the proprietary technology we use daily, he offers a new approach: Progress should mean not just achieving technological breakthroughs but also making everyday technology equitable. 

“We don't need more technology,” he says. “We just need to collaborate with what we have now.”

A new field of science claims to be able to predict aesthetic traits, intelligence, and even moral character in embryos. Is this the next step in human evolution or something more dangerous?

Consider, if you will, the translucent blob in the eye of a microscope: a human blastocyst, the biological specimen that emerges just five days or so after a fateful encounter between egg and sperm. This bundle of cells, about the size of a grain of sand pulled from a powdery white Caribbean beach, contains the coiled potential of a future life: 46 chromosomes, thousands of genes, and roughly six billion base pairs of DNA—an instruction manual to assemble a one-of-a-kind human.

Now imagine a laser pulse snipping a hole in the blastocyst's outermost shell so a handful of cells can be suctioned up by a microscopic pipette. This is the moment, thanks to advances in genetic sequencing technology, when it becomes possible to read virtually that entire instruction manual.

An emerging field of science seeks to use the analysis pulled from that procedure to predict what kind of a person that embryo might become. Some parents turn to these tests to avoid passing on devastating genetic disorders that run in their families. A much smaller group, driven by dreams of Ivy League diplomas or attractive, well-behaved offspring, are willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars to optimize for intelligence, appearance, and personality. Some of the most eager early boosters of this technology are members of the Silicon Valley elite, including tech billionaires like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. 

Embryo selection is less like a build-a-baby workshop and more akin to a store where parents can shop for their future children from several available models—complete with stat cards.

But customers of the companies emerging to provide it to the public may not be getting what they're paying for. Genetics experts have been highlighting the potential deficiencies of this testing for years. A 2021 paper by members of the European Society of Human Genetics said, “No clinical research has been performed to assess its diagnostic effectiveness in embryos. Patients need to be properly informed on the limitations of this use.” And a paper published this May in the Journal of Clinical Medicine echoed this concern and expressed particular reservations about screening for psychiatric disorders and non-­disease-related traits: “Unfortunately, no clinical research has to date been published comprehensively evaluating the effectiveness of this strategy [of predictive testing]. Patient awareness regarding the limitations of this procedure is paramount.”    

Moreover, the assumptions underlying some of this work—that how a person turns out is the product not of privilege or circumstance but of innate biology—have made these companies a political lightning rod. 

As this niche technology begins to make its way toward the mainstream, scientists and ethicists are racing to confront the implications—for our social contract, for future generations, and for our very understanding of what it means to be human.

Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), while still relatively rare, is not new. Since the 1990s, parents undergoing in vitro fertilization have been able to access a number of genetic tests before choosing which embryo to use. A type known as PGT-M can detect single-gene disorders like cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and Huntington's disease. PGT-A can ascertain the sex of an embryo and identify chromosomal abnormalities that can lead to conditions like Down syndrome or reduce the chances that an embryo will implant successfully in the uterus. PGT-SR helps parents avoid embryos with issues such as duplicated or missing segments of the chromosome.

Those tests all identify clear-cut genetic problems that are relatively easy to detect, but most of the genetic instruction manual included in an embryo is written in far more nuanced code. In recent years, a fledgling market has sprung up around a new, more advanced version of the testing process called PGT-P: preimplantation genetic testing for polygenic disorders (and, some claim, traits)—that is, outcomes determined by the elaborate interaction of hundreds or thousands of genetic variants.

In 2020, the first baby selected using PGT-P was born. While the exact figure is unknown, estimates put the number of children who have now been born with the aid of this technology in the hundreds. As the technology is commercialized, that number is likely to grow.

The long-awaited results of the 2017 trial suggest that the approach can reduce the risk of mitochondrial disease—but not everyone is convinced.

Embryo selection is less like a build-a-baby workshop and more akin to a store where parents can shop for their future children from several available models—complete with stat cards indicating their predispositions.

A handful of startups, armed with tens of millions of dollars of Silicon Valley cash, have developed proprietary algorithms to compute these stats—analyzing vast numbers of genetic variants and producing a “polygenic risk score” that shows the probability of an embryo developing a variety of complex traits.  

For the last five years or so, two companies—Genomic Prediction and Orchid—have dominated this small landscape, focusing their efforts on disease prevention. But more recently, two splashy new competitors have emerged: Nucleus Genomics and Herasight, which have rejected the more cautious approach of their predecessors and waded into the controversial territory of genetic testing for intelligence. (Nucleus also offers tests for a wide variety of other behavioral and appearance-related traits.) 

The practical limitations of polygenic risk scores are substantial. For starters, there is still a lot we don't understand about the complex gene interactions driving polygenic traits and disorders. And the biobank data sets they are based on tend to overwhelmingly represent individuals with Western European ancestry, making it more difficult to generate reliable scores for patients from other backgrounds. These scores also lack the full context of environment, lifestyle, and the myriad other factors that can influence a person's characteristics. And while polygenic risk scores can be effective at detecting large, population-level trends, their predictive abilities drop significantly when the sample size is as tiny as a single batch of embryos that share much of the same DNA.

The medical community—including organizations like the American Society of Human Genetics, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine—is generally wary of using polygenic risk scores for embryo selection. “The practice has moved too fast with too little evidence,” the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics wrote in an official statement in 2024.

But beyond questions of whether evidence supports the technology's effectiveness, critics of the companies selling it accuse them of reviving a disturbing ideology: eugenics, or the belief that selective breeding can be used to improve humanity. Indeed, some of the voices who have been most confident that these methods can successfully predict nondisease traits have made startling claims about natural genetic hierarchies and innate racial differences.

What everyone can agree on, though, is that this new wave of technology is helping to inflame a centuries-old debate over nature versus nurture.

The term “eugenics” was coined in 1883 by a British anthropologist and statistician named Sir Francis Galton, inspired in part by the work of his cousin Charles Darwin. He derived it from a Greek word meaning “good in stock, hereditarily endowed with noble qualities.”

Some of modern history's darkest chapters have been built on Galton's legacy, from the Holocaust to the forced sterilization laws that affected certain groups in the United States well into the 20th century. Modern science has demonstrated the many logical and empirical problems with Galton's methodology. (For starters, he counted vague concepts like “eminence”—as well as infections like syphilis and tuberculosis—as heritable phenotypes, meaning characteristics that result from the interaction of genes and environment.)

Yet even today, Galton's influence lives on in the field of behavioral genetics, which investigates the genetic roots of psychological traits. Starting in the 1960s, researchers in the US began to revisit one of Galton's favorite methods: twin studies. Many of these studies, which analyzed pairs of identical and fraternal twins to try to determine which traits were heritable and which resulted from socialization, were funded by the US government. The most well-known of these, the Minnesota Twin Study, also accepted grants from the Pioneer Fund, a now defunct nonprofit that had promoted eugenics and “race betterment” since its founding in 1937. 

The nature-versus-nurture debate hit a major inflection point in 2003, when the Human Genome Project was declared complete. After 13 years and at a cost of nearly $3 billion, an international consortium of thousands of researchers had sequenced 92% of the human genome for the first time.

Today, the cost of sequencing a genome can be as low as $600, and one company says it will soon drop even further. This dramatic reduction has made it possible to build massive DNA databases like the UK Biobank and the National Institutes of Health's All of Us, each containing genetic data from more than half a million volunteers. Resources like these have enabled researchers to conduct genome-wide association studies, or GWASs, which identify correlations between genetic variants and human traits by analyzing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)—the most common form of genetic variation between individuals. The findings from these studies serve as a reference point for developing polygenic risk scores.

Most GWASs have focused on disease prevention and personalized medicine. But in 2011, a group of medical researchers, social scientists, and economists launched the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium (SSGAC) to investigate the genetic basis of complex social and behavioral outcomes. One of the phenotypes they focused on was the level of education people reached.

“It was a bit of a phenotype of convenience,” explains Patrick Turley, an economist and member of the steering committee at SSGAC, given that educational attainment is routinely recorded in surveys when genetic data is collected. Still, it was “clear that genes play some role,” he says. “And trying to understand what that role is, I think, is really interesting.” He adds that social scientists can also use genetic data to try to better “understand the role that is due to nongenetic pathways.”

Many on the left are generally willing to allow that any number of traits, from addiction to obesity, are genetically influenced. Yet heritable cognitive ability seems to be “beyond the pale for us to integrate as a source of difference.”

The work immediately stirred feelings of discomfort—not least among the consortium's own members, who feared that they might unintentionally help reinforce racism, inequality, and genetic determinism. 

It's also created quite a bit of discomfort in some political circles, says Kathryn Paige Harden, a psychologist and behavioral geneticist at the University of Texas in Austin, who says she has spent much of her career making the unpopular argument to fellow liberals that genes are relevant predictors of social outcomes. 

Harden thinks a strength of those on the left is their ability to recognize “that bodies are different from each other in a way that matters.” Many are generally willing to allow that any number of traits, from addiction to obesity, are genetically influenced. Yet, she says, heritable cognitive ability seems to be “beyond the pale for us to integrate as a source of difference that impacts our life.” 

Harden believes that genes matter for our understanding of traits like intelligence, and that this should help shape progressive policymaking. She gives the example of an education department seeking policy interventions to improve math scores in a given school district. If a polygenic risk score is “as strongly correlated with their school grades” as family income is, she says of the students in such a district, then “does deliberately not collecting that [genetic] information, or not knowing about it, make your research harder [and] your inferences worse?”

To Harden, persisting with this strategy of avoidance for fear of encouraging eugenicists is a mistake. If “insisting that IQ is a myth and genes have nothing to do with it was going to be successful at neutralizing eugenics,” she says, “it would've won by now.”

Part of the reason these ideas are so taboo in many circles is that today's debate around genetic determinism is still deeply infused with Galton's ideas—and has become a particular fixation among the online right. 

After Elon Musk took over Twitter (now X) in 2022 and loosened its restrictions on hate speech, a flood of accounts started sharing racist posts, some speculating about the genetic origins of inequality while arguing against immigration and racial integration. Musk himself frequently reposts and engages with accounts like Crémieux Recueil, the pen name of independent researcher Jordan Lasker, who has written about the “Black-White IQ gap,” and i/o, an anonymous account that once praised Musk for “acknowledging data on race and crime,” saying it “has done more to raise awareness of the disproportionalities observed in these data than anything I can remember.” (In response to allegations that his research encourages eugenics, Lasker wrote to MIT Technology Review, “The popular understanding of eugenics is about coercion and cutting people cast as ‘undesirable' out of the breeding pool. This is nothing like that, so it doesn't qualify as eugenics by that popular understanding of the term.” After going to print, i/o wrote in an email, “Just because differences in intelligence at the individual level are largely heritable, it does not mean that group differences in measured intelligence ... are due to genetic differences between groups,” but that the latter is not “scientifically settled” and “an extremely important (and necessary) research area that should be funded rather than made taboo.” He added, “I've never made any argument against racial integration or intermarriage or whatever.” X and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.)

Harden, though, warns against discounting the work of an entire field because of a few noisy neoreactionaries. “I think there can be this idea that technology is giving rise to the terrible racism,” she says. The truth, she believes, is that “the racism has preexisted any of this technology.”

In 2019, a company called Genomic Prediction began to offer the first preimplantation polygenic testing that had ever been made commercially available. With its LifeView Embryo Health Score, prospective parents are able to assess their embryos' predisposition to genetically complex health problems like cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Pricing for the service starts at $3,500. Genomic Prediction uses a technique called an SNP array, which targets specific sites in the genome where common variants occur. The results are then cross-checked against GWASs that show correlations between genetic variants and certain diseases.

In her new book, Second Life, journalist and culture critic Amanda Hess scrutinizes period-tracking apps, targeted ads, and birth myths that spread online.

Four years later, a company named Orchid began offering a competing test. Orchid's Whole Genome Embryo Report distinguished itself by claiming to sequence more than 99% of an embryo's genome, allowing it to detect novel mutations and, the company says, diagnose rare diseases more accurately. For $2,500 per embryo, parents can access polygenic risk scores for 12 disorders, including schizophrenia, breast cancer, and hypothyroidism. 

Orchid was founded by a woman named Noor Siddiqui. Before getting undergraduate and graduate degrees from Stanford, she was awarded the Thiel fellowship—a $200,000 grant given to young entrepreneurs willing to work on their ideas instead of going to college—back when she was a teenager, in 2012. This set her up to attract attention from members of the tech elite as both customers and financial backers. Her company has raised $16.5 million to date from investors like Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, and Armstrong, the Coinbase CEO.

In August Siddiqui made the controversial suggestion that parents who choose not to use genetic testing might be considered irresponsible. “Just be honest: you're okay with your kid potentially suffering for life so you can feel morally superior …” she wrote on X.

Americans have varied opinions on the emerging technology. In 2024, a group of bioethicists surveyed 1,627 US adults to determine attitudes toward a variety of polygenic testing criteria. A large majority approved of testing for physical health conditions like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Screening for mental health disorders, like depression, OCD, and ADHD, drew a more mixed—but still positive—response. Appearance-related traits, like skin color, baldness, and height, received less approval as something to test for.

Intelligence was among the most contentious traits—unsurprising given the way it has been weaponized throughout history and the lack of cultural consensus on how it should even be defined. (In many countries, intelligence testing for embryos is heavily regulated; in the UK, the practice is banned outright.) In the 2024 survey, 36.9% of respondents approved of preimplantation genetic testing for intelligence, 40.5% disapproved, and 22.6% said they were uncertain.

Despite the disagreement, intelligence has been among the traits most talked about as targets for testing. From early on, Genomic Prediction says, it began receiving inquiries “from all over the world” about testing for intelligence, according to Diego Marin, the company's head of global business development and scientific affairs.

At one time, the company offered a predictor for what it called “intellectual disability.” After some backlash questioning both the predictive capacity and the ethics of these scores, the company discontinued the feature. “Our mission and vision of this company is not to improve [a baby], but to reduce risk for disease,” Marin told me. “When it comes to traits about IQ or skin color or height or something that's cosmetic and doesn't really have a connotation of a disease, then we just don't invest in it.”

Orchid, on the other hand, does test for genetic markers associated with intellectual disability and developmental delay. But that may not be all. According to one employee of the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, intelligence testing is also offered to “high-roller” clients. According to this employee, another source close to the company, and reporting in the Washington Post, Musk used Orchid's services in the conception of at least one of the children he shares with the tech executive Shivon Zilis. (Orchid, Musk, and Zilis did not respond to requests for comment.)

I met Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder of New York–based Nucleus Genomics, on a sweltering July afternoon in his SoHo office. Slight and kinetic, Sadeghi spoke at a machine-gun pace, pausing only occasionally to ask if I was keeping up. 

Sadeghi had modified his first organism—a sample of brewer's yeast—at the age of 16. As a high schooler in 2016, he was taking a course on CRISPR-Cas9 at a Brooklyn laboratory when he fell in love with the “beautiful depth” of genetics. Just a few years later, he dropped out of college to build “a better 23andMe.” 

His company targets what you might call the application layer of PGT-P, accepting data from IVF clinics—and even from the competitors mentioned in this story—and running its own computational analysis.

“Unlike a lot of the other testing companies, we're software first, and we're consumer first,” Sadeghi told me. “It's not enough to give someone a polygenic score. What does that mean? How do you compare them? There's so many really hard design problems.”

Like its competitors, Nucleus calculates its polygenic risk scores by comparing an individual's genetic data with trait-associated variants identified in large GWASs, providing statistically informed predictions. 

Nucleus provides two displays of a patient's results: a Z-score, plotted from –4 to 4, which explains the risk of a certain trait relative to a population with similar genetic ancestry (for example, if Embryo #3 has a 2.1 Z-score for breast cancer, its risk is higher than average), and an absolute risk score, which includes relevant clinical factors (Embryo #3 has a minuscule actual risk of breast cancer, given that it is male).

The real difference between Nucleus and its competitors lies in the breadth of what it claims to offer clients. On its sleek website, prospective parents can sort through more than 2,000 possible diseases, as well as traits from eye color to IQ. Access to the Nucleus Embryo platform costs $8,999, while the company's new IVF+ offering—which includes one IVF cycle with a partner clinic, embryo screening for up to 20 embryos, and concierge services throughout the process—starts at $24,999.

“Maybe you want your baby to have blue eyes versus green eyes,” Nucleus founder Kian Sadeghi said at a June event. “That is up to the liberty of the parents.”

Its promises are remarkably bold. The company claims to be able to forecast a propensity for anxiety, ADHD, insomnia, and other mental issues. It says you can see which of your embryos are more likely to have alcohol dependence, which are more likely to be left-handed, and which might end up with severe acne or seasonal allergies. (Nevertheless, at the time of writing, the embryo-screening platform provided this disclaimer: “DNA is not destiny. Genetics can be a helpful tool for choosing an embryo, but it's not a guarantee. Genetic research is still in it's [sic] infancy, and there's still a lot we don't know about how DNA shapes who we are.”)

To people accustomed to sleep trackers, biohacking supplements, and glucose monitoring, taking advantage of Nucleus's options might seem like a no-brainer. To anyone who welcomes a bit of serendipity in their life, this level of perceived control may be disconcerting to say the least.

Sadeghi likes to frame his arguments in terms of personal choice. “Maybe you want your baby to have blue eyes versus green eyes,” he told a small audience at Nucleus Embryo's June launch event. “That is up to the liberty of the parents.”

On the official launch day, Sadeghi spent hours gleefully sparring with X users who accused him of practicing eugenics. He rejects the term, favoring instead “genetic optimization”—though it seems he wasn't too upset about the free viral marketing. “This week we got five million impressions on Twitter,” he told a crowd at the launch event, to a smattering of applause. (In an email to MIT Technology Review, Sadeghi wrote, “The history of eugenics is one of coercion and discrimination by states and institutions; what Nucleus does is the opposite—genetic forecasting that empowers individuals to make informed decisions.”)

Nucleus has raised more than $36 million from investors like Srinivasan, Alexis Ohanian's venture capital firm Seven Seven Six, and Thiel's Founders Fund. (Like Siddiqui, Sadeghi was a recipient of a Thiel fellowship when he dropped out of college; a representative for Thiel did not respond to a request for comment for this story.) Sadeghi has even poached Genomic Prediction's cofounder Nathan Treff, who is now Nucleus's chief clinical officer.

Sadeghi's real goal is to build a one-stop shop for every possible application of genetic sequencing technology, from genealogy to precision medicine to genetic engineering. He names a handful of companies providing these services, with a combined market cap in the billions. “Nucleus is collapsing all five of these companies into one,” he says. “We are not an IVF testing company. We are a genetic stack.”

This spring, I elbowed my way into a packed hotel bar in the Flatiron district, where over a hundred people had gathered to hear a talk called “How to create SUPERBABIES.” The event was part of New York's Deep Tech Week, so I expected to meet a smattering of biotech professionals and investors. Instead, I was surprised to encounter a diverse and curious group of creatives, software engineers, students, and prospective parents—many of whom had come with no previous knowledge of the subject.

The speaker that evening was Jonathan Anomaly, a soft-spoken political philosopher whose didactic tone betrays his years as a university professor.

Some of Anomaly's academic work has focused on developing theories of rational behavior. At Duke and the University of Pennsylvania, he led introductory courses on game theory, ethics, and collective action problems as well as bioethics, digging into thorny questions about abortion, vaccines, and euthanasia. But perhaps no topic has interested him so much as the emerging field of genetic enhancement. 

The “world's oldest baby” has been born from an ""adopted"" embryo created in 1994.

In 2018, in a bioethics journal, Anomaly published a paper with the intentionally provocative title “Defending Eugenics.” He sought to distinguish what he called “positive eugenics”—noncoercive methods aimed at increasing traits that “promote individual and social welfare”—from the so-called “negative eugenics” we know from our history books.

Anomaly likes to argue that embryo selection isn't all that different from practices we already take for granted. Don't believe two cousins should be allowed to have children? Perhaps you're a eugenicist, he contends. Your friend who picked out a six-foot-two Harvard grad from a binder of potential sperm donors? Same logic.

His hiring at the University of Pennsylvania in 2019 caused outrage among some students, who accused him of “racial essentialism.” In 2020, Anomaly left academia, lamenting that “American universities had become an intellectual prison.”

A few years later, Anomaly joined a nascent PGT-P company named Herasight, which was promising to screen for IQ.

At the end of July, the company officially emerged from stealth mode. A representative told me that most of the money raised so far is from angel investors, including Srinivasan, who also invested in Orchid and Nucleus. According to the launch announcement on X, Herasight has screened “hundreds of embryos” for private customers and is beginning to offer its first publicly available consumer product, a polygenic assessment that claims to detect an embryo's likelihood of developing 17 diseases.

Their marketing materials boast predictive abilities 122% better than Orchid's and 193% better than Genomic Prediction's for this set of diseases. (“Herasight is comparing their current predictor to models we published over five years ago,” Genomic Prediction responded in a statement. “Our team is confident our predictors are world-class and are not exceeded in quality by any other lab.”) 

The company did not include comparisons with Nucleus, pointing to the “absence of published performance validations” by that company and claiming it represented a case where “marketing outpaces science.” (“Nucleus is known for world-class science and marketing, and we understand why that's frustrating to our competitors,” a representative from the company responded in a comment.) 

Herasight also emphasized new advances in “within-family validation” (making sure that the scores are not merely picking up shared environmental factors by comparing their performance between unrelated people to their performance between siblings) and “cross-­ancestry accuracy” (improving the accuracy of scores for people outside the European ancestry groups where most of the biobank data is concentrated). The representative explained that pricing varies by customer and the number of embryos tested, but it can reach $50,000.

When it comes to traits that Jonathan Anomaly believes are genetically encoded, intelligence is just the tip of the iceberg. He has also spoken about the heritability of empathy, violence, religiosity, and political leanings.

Herasight tests for just one non-disease-related trait: intelligence. For a couple who produce 10 embryos, it claims it can detect an IQ spread of about 15 points, from the lowest-scoring embryo to the highest. The representative says the company plans to release a detailed white paper on its IQ predictor in the future.

The day of Herasight's launch, Musk responded to the company announcement: “Cool.” Meanwhile, a Danish researcher named Emil Kirkegaard, whose research has largely focused on IQ differences between racial groups, boosted the company to his nearly 45,000 followers on X (as well as in a Substack blog), writing, “Proper embryo selection just landed.” Kirkegaard has in fact supported Anomaly's work for years; he's posted about him on X and recommended his 2020 book Creating Future People, which he called a “biotech eugenics advocacy book,” adding: “Naturally, I agree with this stuff!”

When it comes to traits that Anomaly believes are genetically encoded, intelligence—which he claimed in his talk is about 75% heritable—is just the tip of the iceberg. He has also spoken about the heritability of empathy, impulse control, violence, passivity, religiosity, and political leanings.

Anomaly concedes there are limitations to the kinds of relative predictions that can be made from a small batch of embryos. But he believes we're only at the dawn of what he likes to call the “reproductive revolution.” At his talk, he pointed to a technology currently in development at a handful of startups: in vitro gametogenesis. IVG aims to create sperm or egg cells in a laboratory using adult stem cells, genetically reprogrammed from cells found in a sample of skin or blood. In theory, this process could allow a couple to quickly produce a practically unlimited number of embryos to analyze for preferred traits. Anomaly predicted this technology could be ready to use on humans within eight years.

“I doubt the FDA will allow it immediately. That's what places like Próspera are for,” he said, referring to the so-called “startup city” in Honduras, where scientists and entrepreneurs can conduct medical experiments free from the kinds of regulatory oversight they'd encounter in the US.

“You might have a moral intuition that this is wrong,” said Anomaly, “but when it's discovered that elites are doing it privately … the dominoes are going to fall very, very quickly.” The coming “evolutionary arms race,” he claimed, will “change the moral landscape.”

He added that some of those elites are his own customers: “I could already name names, but I won't do it.”

After Anomaly's talk was over, I spoke with a young photographer who told me he was hoping to pursue a master's degree in theology. He came to the event, he told me, to reckon with the ethical implications of playing God. “Technology is sending us toward an Old-to-New-Testament transition moment, where we have to decide what parts of religion still serve us,” he said soberly.

Criticisms of polygenic testing tend to fall into two camps: skepticism about the tests' effectiveness and concerns about their ethics. “On one hand,” says Turley from the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium, “you have arguments saying ‘This isn't going to work anyway, and the reason it's bad is because we're tricking parents, which would be a problem.' And on the other hand, they say, ‘Oh, this is going to work so well that it's going to lead to enormous inequalities in society.' It's just funny to see. Sometimes these arguments are being made by the same people.”

One of those people is Sasha Gusev, who runs a quantitative genetics lab at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. A vocal critic of PGT-P for embryo selection, he also often engages in online debates with the far-right accounts promoting race science on X.

The stigmatized idea could get a massive boost from “tech bros”—and some scientists are cheering them on.

Gusev is one of many professionals in his field who believe that because of numerous confounding socioeconomic factors—for example, childhood nutrition, geography, personal networks, and parenting styles—there isn't much point in trying to trace outcomes like educational attainment back to genetics, particularly not as a way to prove that there's a genetic basis for IQ.

He adds, “I think there's a real risk in moving toward a society where you see genetics and ‘genetic endowments' as the drivers of people's behavior and as a ceiling on their outcomes and their capabilities.”

Gusev thinks there is real promise for this technology in clinical settings among specific adult populations. For adults identified as having high polygenic risk scores for cancer and cardiovascular disease, he argues, a combination of early screening and intervention could be lifesaving. But when it comes to the preimplantation testing currently on the market, he thinks there are significant limitations—and few regulatory measures or long-term validation methods to check the promises companies are making. He fears that giving these services too much attention could backfire.

“These reckless, overpromised, and oftentimes just straight-up manipulative embryo selection applications are a risk for the credibility and the utility of these clinical tools,” he says.

Many IVF patients have also had strong reactions to publicity around PGT-P. When the New York Times published an opinion piece about Orchid in the spring, angry parents took to Reddit to rant. One user posted, “For people who dont [sic] know why other types of testing are necessary or needed this just makes IVF people sound like we want to create ‘perfect' babies, while we just want (our) healthy babies.”

Still, others defended the need for a conversation. “When could technologies like this change the mission from helping infertile people have healthy babies to eugenics?” one Redditor posted. “It's a fine line to walk and an important discussion to have.”

Some PGT-P proponents, like Kirkegaard and Anomaly, have argued that policy decisions should more explicitly account for genetic differences. In a series of blog posts following the 2024 presidential election, under the header “Make science great again,” Kirkegaard called for ending affirmative action laws, legalizing race-based hiring discrimination, and removing restrictions on data sets like the NIH's All of Us biobank that prevent researchers like him from using the data for race science. Anomaly has criticized social welfare policies for putting a finger on the scale to “punish the high-IQ people.”

Indeed, the notion of genetic determinism has gained some traction among loyalists to President Donald Trump. 

In October 2024, Trump himself made a campaign stop on the conservative radio program The Hugh Hewitt Show. He began a rambling answer about immigration and homicide statistics. “A murderer, I believe this, it's in their genes. And we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now,” he told the host.

Gusev believes that while embryo selection won't have much impact on individual outcomes, the intellectual framework endorsed by many PGT-P advocates could have dire social consequences.

“If you just think of the differences that we observe in society as being cultural, then you help people out. You give them better schooling, you give them better nutrition and education, and they're able to excel,” he says. “If you think of these differences as being strongly innate, then you can fool yourself into thinking that there's nothing that can be done and people just are what they are at birth.”

For the time being, there are no plans for longitudinal studies to track actual outcomes for the humans these companies have helped bring into the world. Harden, the behavioral geneticist from UT Austin, suspects that 25 years down the line, adults who were once embryos selected on the basis of polygenic risk scores are “going to end up with the same question that we all have.” They will look at their life and wonder, “What would've had to change for it to be different?”

Between October 11 and 13, the Sun unleashed a torrent of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Now, these powerful bursts of solar plasma and magnetic energy are on a collision course with Earth.

Space weather forecasters expect them to arrive tonight and cause the northern lights—or Aurora Borealis—to stretch farther south than usual. NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center issued a G2 (moderate) geomagnetic storm watch for Thursday, October 16, with the strongest impact expected between late Thursday night and Friday morning.

Geomagnetic storms—major disturbances in the Earth's upper magnetosphere—cause aurora to become brighter, more active, and move farther away from the poles. NOAA's aurora forecast for tonight shows 15 states above the aurora view line, meaning they have a decent chance of seeing the northern lights.

Those states include Alaska, Washington, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Wyoming, and Iowa.

If you're hoping to catch a glimpse of the aurora tonight, make sure to choose a viewing location with minimal light pollution, a clear view of the northern horizon, and cloudless skies. The best time to look up is between midnight and 2 a.m. local time, when skies are darkest.

It's been a wild week for solar activity. Sunspot region AR4246—a large, complex, and active grouping of sunspots—has been firing off a barrage of M-class (medium-sized) solar flares. One of these flares, which erupted on October 13, is associated with one of the CMEs currently heading toward Earth.

When an Earth-facing sunspot—a cooler region on the Sun's surface caused by a concentration of magnetic field lines—produces a CME, the ejected material hurtles toward our planet at breakneck speed. Once it reaches Earth's magnetic field, the influx of charged particles and energy can trigger a geomagnetic storm.

Depending on its severity, a geomagnetic storm may increase the likelihood of visible auroras, disrupt power grids, satellites, and other infrastructure, and cause radio blackouts.

The arrival of multiple CMEs in quick succession tonight could result in a “stacked” impact. This compounding effect can intensify a geomagnetic storm's strength and duration, making it more likely to disrupt technology and produce auroras at lower latitudes than usual.

That said, forecasters aren't anticipating any severe impacts from tonight's storm. In addition to helping the aurora appear a bit farther south, it may cause some manageable disruptions to technological infrastructure, according to NOAA.

Still, geomagnetic storm impacts are difficult to predict due to the complexity of the Sun's processes and the evolving nature of CMEs. There's always a chance that an oncoming storm could be stronger—or weaker—than anticipated. But for folks in the northern U.S. hoping to see some dazzling aurora this week, it certainly looks like tonight is the best chance.

The next version of Windows will be stuffed to the gills with AI. You may be asking, “Even more than before?” Yes, and Microsoft hopes to train you to quit using your keyboard and mouse to handle your PC. The company hopes you'll use your voice to command your PC, like you're some domineering captain on a ship and your crew is a hapless chatbot who's desperate to understand your vague whims.

Starting Thursday, Microsoft is pushing more “experimental” features and future apps that will put the company's Copilot AI directly in front of your Windows experience. Microsoft already ensured there would be a Copilot key on all new PCs that access Microsoft's chatbot. Now, once you enable it in the Copilot app settings, you can start talking to your computer by screaming “Hey, Copilot” at your screen.

If anybody still misses Cortana, now's your time to shed a single tear. Microsoft already had its Copilot Vision function available on Edge browsers, but now it's stretching its legs within the wider Windows software suite. Unlike past voice assistants, the new version of Copilot will have AI image recognition, and it should be able to comprehend what's happening on your screen. This should mean you may have to issue less detailed prompts to the AI to get it to do what you want. And what does Microsoft expect you to use AI for? Well, it could replace all those how-to articles you see online. If you tell Copilot, “Show me how to get better quality audio in Spotify,” Microsoft said it will highlight the setting you need to hit on your screen.

Microsoft sat me down for a demo with the new Copilot Vision feature, though I've yet to try it using my own voice. The Voice dialogue was surprisingly fast in responding to queries about a math problem or about buying a dress online. However, when the user tried to get the AI to point out the right controls for changing image resolution on their Shopify account, the AI circled the wrong part of the page. It's the curse of all live demos that something will likely go awry, but we can expect some idiosyncracies as Microsoft tries to get us talking to our Windows machines.

Microsoft said this AI vision system can look at an image on your screen and offer descriptions of what it sees. Apparently users would use this to type out a resume based on their own portfolio. In another example, Microsoft showed Copilot humming a mindless tune for a musician to riff off (no, the tune did not sound especially appealing). Copilot can now look at all your browser tabs at once and find products based on what you're looking at. Google has also promoted AI shopping, though with more virtual “try on” features that create an AI image of yourself to imagine your body in that dress.

You're going to start seeing new Copilot commercials real soon. These are designed to “teach” you about the fun and pleasure of using Copilot with your voice. But that's not all. There are more full-blown features supposed to get you using AI. Windows Insiders will be able to access beta features that will put a Copilot function crowding out the other functions on your taskbar, replacing the regular Windows search bar (you can still use it to search for files or settings, just as before).

Microsoft said users already talk to their PCs, though usually for the sake of dictation or notetaking. Plus, speech recognition is already a standardized feature for accessibility purposes. Still, there's a wide gulf between those use cases and literally talking to your PC without annoying your deskmates trying to work just a few feet away. Instead of offering the ability to type to Copilot Vision out of the gate, Microsoft is limiting it to Windows Insiders beta testers to start.

Beta testers will also be first to try out the newfangled Copilot Actions app. Microsoft described the application as an “AI agent” that can take actions for you across different apps and files. In AI circles, an “agent” is essentially multiple AI models working together to complete a more complicated task. On Windows, this means it could essentially take over your PC, run programs for you, and fulfill your demands. Anthropic's Claude AI showed off similar PC-takeover capabilities last year.

Over the last few years, Microsoft has tried promoting hardware-specific AI capabilities, first with “AI PCs” in 2023 and then “Copilot+ PCs” in 2024. Now, according to Microsoft, “every Windows 11 PC” is an AI PC once it's connected up with Microsoft's cloud-based AI. Microsoft itself admitted the AI PC “hasn't really come alive yet.” You could lay some of the blame for that at the Windows maker's feet. Last year, it tried to push Recall, a feature that would screenshot everything you do on a PC. An AI would scrape those screenshots and let users search through their past activity to find old web pages or documents they were working on.

Security researchers found the feature could screenshot sensitive data like bank info, and anybody with access to the PC could find it. Microsoft pulled Recall and didn't release it for an entire year. Even after a big push for security, the feature still isn't foolproof, and several companies have blocked it over fears it could lead to sensitive data being shared. The Copilot Actions app and all the other features are “opt in.” The Actions app is turned off by default, and you need to enable it through settings. Microsoft promised you can take control “at any time,” and the program may ask for permission for specific actions.

No matter what, since these features are cloud-based, your data will need to be processed on a foreign server, not on your device. Microsoft promises it isn't storing or abusing your prompts or whatever appears on your screen. After the Recall snafi, it's increasingly difficult to trust the Windows maker. Now that Microsoft wants you to put privacy concerns aside for the sake of its ever-present AI, it's going to have to offer a more compelling use case than an AI that hums on command.

Erebor, a new tech-focused bank to serve crypto and AI customers, has received conditional approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to begin operations, according to a press release. The list of backers is a real who's who of people who support President Donald Trump.

Erebor is based in Ohio and was founded by Palmer Luckey, the co-founder of military contractor Anduril and the VR headset company Oculus. Luckey, who's worth $3.6 billion according to Forbes, first thought of starting the bank after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023, according to reporting from July by the Financial Times.

The name Erebor comes from J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings series, referring to a “Lonely Mountain.” So it makes sense that his co-founder is Joe Lonsdale, who also co-founded Palantir, yet another Tolkien reference. Peter Thiel, still another Palantir co-founder, is also backing the new bank, according to the Financial Times.

The “preliminary and conditional” approval to begin operations happened in just four months, an unusually short period of time. But compliance and security checks are expected to take another few months before it can officially open. Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan V. Gould announced the approval in a statement Wednesday.

“Erebor is the first de novo bank to receive a preliminary conditional approval since I arrived at the OCC, said Gould. “I am committed to a dynamic and diverse federal banking system, and our decision today is a first but important step in living up to that commitment.”

“Today's decision is also proof that the OCC under my leadership does not impose blanket barriers to banks that want to engage in digital asset activities,” Gould continued. “Permissible digital asset activities, like any other legally permissible banking activity, have a place in the federal banking system if conducted in a safe and sound manner. The OCC will continue to provide a path for innovative approaches to financial services to ensure a strong, diverse financial system that remains relevant over time.”

An anonymous source “close to Erebor” told the Financial Times that Luckey's new bank didn't receive any special treatment, even though everyone assumes that's untrue in the transactional world of Trump. Business Insider reported in August that Erebor sent out a fundraising memo that explained it was anticipating approval in “less than 6 months” and bragged that “Palmer's political network will get this done.”

Luckey has donated heavily to Republican candidates, contributing over $400,000 to President Trump alone in 2020. It's unclear how much Luckey may have donated to Trump in 2024, though it was his political donations that caused controversy during Trump's first term. Oculus VR was acquired by Facebook in 2014, and Luckey stayed on after the purchase. But he was reportedly forced out of Facebook in early 2017 after donating $10,000 to a pro-Trump group in 2016.

Obviously, giving money to Trump is no longer controversial in Silicon Valley. In fact, guys like Mark Zuckerberg all do it quite openly now. Quite a lot can change in a decade.

There's something about watching a great movie or live concert that deserves better than tinny TV speakers: That's where a proper soundbar comes in and it turns average nights into something immersive, alive and full of detail. Amazon's Fire TV soundbar does exactly that, and it's now down to just $99, a big drop from its usual $119.99. For under a hundred bucks, you can transform your living room setup and even use it as a Bluetooth speaker when the TV's off.

See at Amazon

What puts the deal in the buy column isn't the price alone but the amount that Amazon was able to pack into this slim 24‑inch bar. The Fire TV soundbar is a 2.0‑channel system which means it has dual speakers that are meant to deliver richer sound, clearer dialogue and more substantial bass than the majority of built‑in TV speakers can even dream about. It's powered by DTS Virtual:X which is the same type of technology found in pricier home theater gear. That element gives the illusion of a large, nearly surround‑sound experience without having to clutter the room with additional speakers. Dolby Audio takes the fine points and ensures quiet scenes or soft dialogue are always crisp.

The bar pairs effortlessly with one HDMI cable – no complicated setup and no messy cables: Connect it to your TV's HDMI eARC/ARC port and you're good to go. Everything remains in perfect harmony once paired, from booming effects and quiet conversations. Because the Fire TV soundbar was designed specifically to pair effortlessly with Fire TV, you can pair the audio and your streaming menu with one remote.

Being Bluetooth-enabled, the soundbar isn't restricted to only broadcasting from the TV and streaming programs: It becomes your streaming speaker for music and more. Do you want the entire room rocking with your favorite playlist while preparing a hurricane in the kitchen or hosting buddies? Simply hook up your phone or tablet and press play: no need for the TV to be fired up.

Talking of size, the slim design is one of its best surprises: Measuring only 24 inches in width and a slim 2.5 inches in height, it slips easily beneath the majority of TV screens or comfortably accommodates narrower stands. You won't have to reconfigure your setup or move some furniture. What's more, Amazon claims the device consists of 18% recycled material which is a thoughtful move for the person who'd like their electronic goods to be a little more environmentally friendly.

The all-time-low price puts it among the simplest upgrades you can buy for your sound right now. Crisper dialogue, richer bass, wireless Bluetooth streaming, and fast setup – all at less than $100.

Windows 10 is no more (though you may still use the old OS for a bit longer with a free year of security updates). Microsoft's Copilot AI is growing like a weed on the old operating system's grave, infecting all of Windows 11 and beyond. While Microsoft is trying to get users talking to AI chatbots on their PCs, the tech giant wants you to do the same while you're gaming. The end result is a bot that's so good at stating the obvious it could actually make the gaming experience worse.

In multiple demos, Microsoft showcased its AI guiding a player in the direction of their objective in Final Fantasy XVI from 2023. “Looks like the quest is right down the stairs, literally right in front of you,” the AI stated in one such demonstration with the obtuse confidence of a child pointing to a toy in a shop window. The player asked, “Hey, how do I get to the blacksmith?” as they looked at their world map and ignored the store icon blaring on the screen.

In other words: Copilot seems to think gamers are dense dupes who can't follow instructions and don't actually want to play their games.

I tried the Gaming Copilot (still labeled “beta”) on the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X. The AI is built directly into the new Xbox Game Bar as part of the so-called full-screen experience. You can set Copilot to use multiple voice types, though “wise” comes out more lethargic and bored than philosophical, and “heroic” is literally just a British accent. If you hold down the Armoury Crate button (that toggle at the top left of the device), you can bring up options to either speak to or use the on-screen keyboard to type questions at the chatbot.

In Hades II, I asked Copilot how I could get the “Kudos” resources you can use to upgrade your camp's aesthetics. It told me I needed to complete more runs to get them. That's true, and it deserves a single Kudos for knowing the name of the resource, but it also ignored the fact that players can sell loose items to the Wretched Broker to obtain the material.

Discovery is one of those intrinsic features in games that doesn't exist in any other artistic medium. Sacrificing it for the sake of expedience could effectively ruin some games. It's the job of game designers to make navigating their worlds feel organic. Players need to feel like they're making choices without that belittling sense of hand-holding when they are being shepherded toward their goal like the lost sheep they are. A great example of this is in Naughty Dog's 2017 action-adventure game Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. On one level, players race after a convoy in a truck while being hunted by an armored vehicle with a machine gun. The player can take multiple paths as long as they keep heading downhill. Every player will eventually end up in the same place at the bottom, but the fun is in the creativity.

Now, imagine if I paused the action for a second to ask an AI, “How do I get to the bottom?” Not only does doing so break the flow of the game, but it also ignores the work the developers put into their design.

Using Copilot on an acclaimed title like Hades is one thing, but a tool like this applied to poorly designed games also risk becoming something more problematic: a band-aid over legitimate issues. But it also may not even be a great bandage, considering how often it gets things wrong.

As is constantly the case with AI, Gaming Copilot is great at confidently lying to you, and that's made all the worse when it's done with an authoritative British accent.

I asked the Copilot how I could swap or unequip weapons in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and it told me to use an “item wheel” when I hit the bumper button. That's just incorrect. The game uses the d-pad to swap weapons. Copilot also told me I need to “nudge the thumbstick” to lean around corners, but you actually need to click to the left or right to lean.

Gaming Copilot also cannot change your settings for you, at least not yet. I had a lengthy conversation with the AI about what I needed to tweak to achieve the best balance of frame rate and graphics quality in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on the Xbox handheld. Its end advice was simply to turn the graphics to medium and move the TDP to its “Turbo” setting. It also suggested I bump the resolution down to 720p, which seemed odd since I could nail around 40 fps at 1080p on the $1,000 handheld. That's just bad advice.

On the bright side, this program is still described as a “beta.” There's a chance it could eventually grow into something useful. Microsoft has already kicked off its beta test of a Copilot Actions app that can complete tasks on the PC on your behalf. If Microsoft wants to make PC gaming as console-like as possible, having an AI that can actually change device settings to enable the best possible performance would be a nice change of pace. That's what I really want an AI for: Not to do my gaming for me, but to alleviate the tedious parts of getting into a game on PC in the first place. Before it can do that, though, it needs to learn what the d-pad is.

Innovation can be a tough business, especially when it comes to mobile phones. While new form factors like Samsung's foldable Galaxy Z Fold and Z Flip have already been solidified with seven generations, other iterations (looking at you, iPhone Plus and iPhone Mini) haven't quite survived the test of time. Still, the pressure to deliver something new is always there, and it's apparently now the ultra-thin handset's turn. It's too early to know for sure precisely how that experiment will pan out, but rumblings in the here and now aren't exactly painting a rosy picture.

A report from South Korea's Newspim indicates that Samsung, one of two titans that's thrown its hat into the thin phone ring, may pull the plug on its Galaxy S26 Edge, the sequel to its 5.8mm Galaxy S25 Edge released this year. The reason? Lower-than-expected sales, according to the report. That makes practical sense from Samsung's part (if people aren't buying it, you probably shouldn't sell it), but given the unique challenges of making thin phones, there could also be more going on behind the scenes.

As Raymond Wong, Gizmodo's senior editor, consumer tech, already wrote, upgrading thin phones from generation to generation is likely to be quite difficult (and for that reason, you shouldn't count on the iPhone Air 2 having an ultrawide camera). A thin phone, quite simply, gives you less room to play around with. Apple, for example, shoved all of the camera hardware and computing power into one tiny sliver on the top of its iPhone Air, making the rest of the phone essentially a giant battery.

There's always room for a battery breakthrough that could help Apple shrink that brick and make room for more stuff inside the chassis, but that's more speculation than anything else. In the current reality, the constraints of thin phones may be too great—great enough that a generation-to-generation leap could require more research and development money than it's worth.

Given that thin phones are already difficult to make and that demand has proven low, thin phones may have a tougher time evolving than Samsung and Apple predicted they might. Don't get me wrong: I haven't used the iPhone Air at length, but I've messed around with it, and it's an impressive feat of engineering. The appeal of a device with such a small footprint was obvious to me the second I held it in my hand. That being said, this report—if true—may indicate that many consumers don't actually want a smaller, thinner device at all costs. Which would make sense: Many folks also care a lot about camera quality and battery life, and if the iPhone Air can't compete on those fronts, it may also have a limited audience.

Only time and concrete sales numbers will tell whether thin phones are here to stay, but to be honest, it didn't surprise me to hear this rumor: It already feels like thin phones are on thin ice.

Commercial shipments probably won't happen until sometime in 2027

Tachyum broke the silence Wednesday about its Prodigy universal processor for AI and HPC, announcing plans to boost the number of its cores to increase performance. The company also said it closed its Series C financing round with $220 million from a European investor, and inked a $500 million purchase order for Prodigy with that same investor. Finally, the company disclosed that its Prodigy processor has not been taped out and its final specification has not been frozen, suggesting that the unit is years away from mass production. 

The biggest news is that Tachyum's Prodigy processor will adopt a multi-chiplet design and each compute chiplet within that system-in-package (SiP) will feature 256 universal cores (up from 192 cores earlier this year, and from 128 cores initially). This suggests that the whole SiP will offer significantly more cores to fulfill the company's promise of '3X the performance of the highest-performing x86 processors, and 6X the performance of the highest-performing GPGPU for HPC.' There is a problem with this performance promise, however: the company still has not frozen specification of the CPU and, consequently, has not taped out the chip, so its actual performance remains to be seen. ""With the capital raised from this latest funding round, we are able to get complete Prodigy tape-out with the latest innovations and designs to meet ever-changing market demands,"" said Dr. Radoslav Danilak, founder and CEO of Tachyum. Tachyum will use the proceeds from its Series C financing round to finance finalizing the tape-out process and schedule. Tachyum intends to disclose 'upgraded specifications and performance' of its processor shortly — it hasn't revealed when, exactly, but we can make an educated guess that it will happen sometime in 2027.

Once funding is received (expected within a month), Tachyum can finalize RTL and physical design — assuming it does not add anything to it, run final validation, and tape out the Prodigy chip. Because Prodigy is expected to be made with TSMC's 5nm-class process technology, Tachyum will get the first silicon in 4 – 4.5 months (depending on how complex the design is, and how lucky the company is after sending in the GDSII file to its production partner — as it will take 1 – 1.5 months to write photomasks and then around three months to build the first wafer / wafers). If Tachyum submits its GDSII file to its manufacturer on Nov. 1, 2025, it will get its silicon in Feb. or March 2026. After laying their hands on the silicon, Tachyum engineers will bring up and validate the design to ensure that it functions as intended, and then tune firmware. If the chip works as planned, the process will be complete in six to seven months — sometime in Aug. 2026 (at the earliest), or Oct. 2026 if we're being conservative. Once engineering samples meet target specifications, Tachyum can supply them to early customers and partners receive for their evaluation and validation, which might take another 2 - 3 months. If everyone is happy with these samples, Tachyum will likely initiate mass production of its Prodigy in early 2027. If everything is fine with production ramp of the Prodigy processor, commercial shipments could begin in mid-2027. This timing aligns with Tachyum's mention of a potential IPO in 2027 — likely planned to coincide with the initial revenue from Prodigy.If Tachyum manages to release its Prodigy CPUs commercially in 2027, this will be the longest-developed processor in recent times — its development will have taken about 10 years. Prodigy was initially targeted for tape-out in 2019 and launch in 2020, but the schedule slipped repeatedly: first to 2021, then to 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, and, now, the company is looking forward to get the first samples of its chip in 2026. But the company is still optimistic about its development despite these setbacks.""We are seeing how the battle for AI supremacy is currently being waged and we are excited to bring to market a disruptive chip that will enable AI models with parameters many orders of magnitude larger than the synapses of the human brain at an affordable price at a fraction of cost of existing solutions,"" said Danilak.

The lowest price ever for an RTX 5070 returns


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Now might be the perfect time to invest in an Nvidia RTX 50-series GPU, especially if you're aiming for strong 1440p gaming performance. The MSI RTX 5070 Shadow 2X OC is currently down to its lowest price of $499 on Amazon, making it the most affordable RTX 5070 you can buy today.

The RTX 5070 originally launched with an MSRP of $549, but early listings were priced well above that, often around $640 or higher. It wasn't until last month that prices began to settle closer to MSRP, with a few models finally appearing at or below the official launch price

A mid-tier entry for the 50-series lineup, the RTX 5070 12GB comes with enough VRAM to play your favourite games. PCIe 5, 6144 CUDA cores, and a triple-fan cooling setup.

The RTX 5070 is Nvidia's mid-range graphics card aimed at delivering solid performance for most gamers, complete with support for the latest technologies like DLSS 4, Reflex 2, and improved ray tracing capabilities. The MSI RTX 5070 Shadow 2X OC features a fairly simple-looking dual-fan design with an all-black finish. It is also quite compact, making it suitable for small form factor builds. It packs 6,144 CUDA cores, 12GB of GDDR7 memory on a 192-bit bus, reaches boost clock speeds of up to 2,557 MHz, and a rated power draw of up to 250W.

In our review of the RTX 5070, we found that the GPU is capable of solid performance at 1440p, which offers an ideal balance between visual quality and smooth gameplay. While it can easily handle games at 1080p ultra settings and even 4K with the help of upscaling, 1440p remains its true sweet spot. Ray tracing is not its strongest suit though and most games at 4K require DLSS to maintain smooth frame rates around 60 FPS.

Looking at the gaming benchmarks, the GPU delivers a notable performance boost over its predecessor, offering 19% faster performance than the RTX 4070 at 1440p, with a wider gap of about 22% at 4K resolution. At its current price, the MSI RTX 5070 Shadow 2X OC should offer great value for gamers looking to upgrade or build a new gaming PC with an efficient 1440p GPU. Given that it's the first time the RTX 5070 has dipped below $500, this deal is unlikely to last long, so you better hurry.

And Copilot is coming for your Windows 11 Search Bar

Microsoft is pushing to make every Windows 11 PC an AI PC. In new updates, the company is focusing on further integrating AI into Windows 11 apps and experiences (not just chatbots), and making voice as much of an input option as the keyboard and mouse.

The idea, Microsoft says, is that AI on a PC should be easy and natural to interact with in either text or voice; that it should be able to see your screen and information and help; and that it should be able, with your permission, to ""take action on your behalf.""

""Voice will become the third input mechanism to using your PC,"" Microsoft executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer Yusf Mehdi said on a call with reporters ahead of the announcement. He mentioned that the idea is for talking to be additive, not replacing keyboards and mice altogether. Mehdi authored a blog post on the new features.

You will be able to talk to Microsoft's Copilot AI by invoking a ""Hey, Copilot"" wake word, or use the established Win+C shortcut or Copilot button. With your permission, Copilot will be able to see your screen and make suggestions or provide help. (To enable the feature, you'll have to opt in in settings.)

In example videos, we saw someone talk to Copilot in a music player app, and the AI walked the user through steps to get the best sound quality. In another, someone watched a YouTube video and asked Copilot to identify the microphone the host was using, and then the AI pointed out that Best Buy had it available.

This feature, among others that Microsoft is announcing today, won't require a Copilot+ PC (with one exception), but will instead work on any system running Windows 11.

When asked whether people will want to speak to their computers, particularly in offices with other people, Mehdi said that people already have all sorts of talk in these spaces, and that, between office chit chat and using headphones, workers will find ways to learn how to deal with it.

Microsoft is also making Copilot Vision available anywhere in the world where Copilot is offered. Windows Insiders will soon be able to interact with Copilot Vision using text (previously, you could only talk to it).

Microsoft is bringing a handful of new Copilot features to Windows Insider before they go wide, with plenty of opt-in security controls..These include a new feature to build Copilot into the taskbar, called ""Ask Copilot,"" that takes the place of the traditional search bar. Microsoft says this will let you use just one click to jump into chat, search for files, or use Copilot Voice or Vision. This, like many of Microsoft's Copilot features, is opt-in.There's also a new mode called Copilot Actions, which will let Copilot take action on your behalf. An experimental feature will go beyond the web and even let the AI use your local files, including sorting photos and finding information in documents.

 




Copilot Actions will let you observe every step it takes, and you can take over at any point. It will launch in Copilot Labs with a narrow set of use cases, and Navjot Virk, corporate vice president of Windows Experiences, said that these will include more complicated tasks as the model is trained. Actions will be turned off by default, and may request additional consent before doing anything deemed important.

Windows users will also be able to connect Copilot to services, including OneDrive and Outlook, as well as Google services like Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar. From here, Copilot will be able to see your calendar and other personal data to help you find personalized information like appointments, contact details, and documents.The Copilot Connections will also let you export text from Copilot to Microsoft 365, letting you put results into homework or presentations.

Lastly, Microsoft is integrating Manus, a general AI agent, into File Explorer. This AI, which is also available through a native app on Windows 11, can use your documents to complete tasks like creating a website, without you needing to code.

There's only one AI announcement for Copilot+ computers. The Click-to-Do feature will now be able to add actions from Zoom. For example, if you hover over an email address, there will be an option to invite that person to a Zoom meeting.

In other Windows news, earlier this week, Microsoft dropped support for Windows 10 and is encouraging customers to update to Windows 11 with new and improved devices. Extended support for Windows 10 is available to some customers as well as businesses.

The specialist camera was rated to 6,000m, but the lens and some of its components were probably damaged by the implosion.

Recovery teams working on the Titan submersible have found the vessel's specialist stills and video camera intact. Fascinatingly, while there was some damage to the camera's housing and internal components, tech and science enthusiast Scott Manley reveals that the internal SD card was “undamaged.” Contents of the memory card have since been investigated, and 12 stills and nine videos have been recovered.

Click 'See more' for images.

In the images, you can see a SubC-branded Rayfin Mk2 Benthic Camera, recovered from the wreckage of the ill-fated submersible operated by OceanGate. This still and video camera is rated to withstand depths up to 6,000m (19,685 feet, 3,281 fathoms). The titanium and synthetic sapphire crystal constructed device features both onboard and expansion memory (the titular SD card).

 




Inside the camera's tube-like form, it is observed that the PCBs had suffered some slight damage. For example, connectors between two boards were sheared off, and some surface mount components were similarly damaged.

In some images of the PCB that are shared, you will notice details are blurred at the request of the Canada-based underwater imaging specialist and Rayfin Mk2 Benthic Camera manufacturer. However, SubC's requested trade secret obfuscation hasn't stopped internet sleuths asserting that they know exactly what components have been redacted.

Picking through Manley's Tweet thread replies, the key PCBs in the camera were likely an Inforce 6601 System on Module (SoM) based on the Qualcomm SD820 processor, which comes with 4GB of RAM on board and 64GB of UFS storage. Another component is thought to be the Teensy 4.0 or 3.2, which acted as an MCU. Last but not least, the undamaged SD card is almost certainly a SanDisk Extreme Pro 512GB ($62.99 at the time of writing), though it was de-branded in the photos.

With an undamaged SD card, of course, investigators (and others) were interested in what details of the tragedy may have been captured and stored by this camera system. The first step was to make “an exact binary image of the SD card” so the original could be left untampered.

Check out Manley's Tweet thread, containing investigator report screengrabs, to take in the full gamut of back and forth between the data forensics investigator, Canada's Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB), and SubC. To cut a long technical story short, though, the parties eventually met up at a lab/office in Newfoundland, where a recovered NVRAM chip and SD card image were interfaced with a “surrogate SoM board.” This did the trick, and 12 still and nine videos were recovered!

Recovered images were at a resolution of 4,056 x 3,040 pixels, implying a pretty common 12.3MP sensor was used by the SubC Rayfin Mk2 Benthic Camera. Videos were at a more standard 3,840 x 2,160 pixels – commonly referred to as 4K Ultra HD (UHD) video.

Somewhat disappointingly, the images and videos shared in the report were taken in the vicinity of the ROV shop at the Marine Institute, also in Newfoundland. The location was the logistical base for Titanic dive missions. No deep-sea shenanigans around the Titanic wreck were revealed. Manley explains in his Twitter thread that “the camera had been configured to dump data onto an external storage device, so nothing was found from the accident dive.” Nothing particularly pertinent to the tragic accident, that is.

Export controls expand to knowledge, tools and equipment


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Last week, a new round of the U.S.-China trade war commenced. China imposed export controls on a new set of rare earth materials and the methods of their processing, which may impact a variety of products and industries. More importantly, China expanded its export control framework beyond raw materials, now reaching actual products and complex devices made outside of China. This means that a product produced anywhere in the world, but containing rare earth materials from China, may be subject to Beijing's export licensing regime if the value of rare earth materials in this product exceeds 0.1%. The U.S. was quick to retaliate with a 100% tariff on China-made products and a ban on 'critical software' for China-based entities.

Starting early November, China will add five heavy rare-earth elements to its export controls list, including erbium, europium, holmium, thulium, and ytterbium, as well as their alloys, oxides, compounds, and finished materials.

The controls explicitly cover magnetic powders, luminescent phosphors, fibre-optic materials, thermal-shield coatings, hydrogen storage, and magnetic alloys. These five elements and alloys on their base are used to build devices like displays, EV drivetrains, lasers, magnetic subsystems (hard drives), optical and photonic infrastructure, satellites, and more.

 




This round of China's export controls targets rare earth elements that generate, manipulate, and sense light or magnetism, which are critically important for dozens of devices and industries. By tightening export controls over these materials, China is increasing its influence over both the supply of rare earths and the foundational building blocks that the computing, defence, and telecommunication industries rely upon worldwide.

While companies in these industries have the flexibility to switch from one supplier to another, doing so is difficult and expensive because they have downstream partners that need to validate and qualify all the components they use.

 




China's export controls policy evolved from restricting fundamental semiconductor materials such as antimony, gallium, and germanium (Round I) to advanced interconnect metals (Round II), then to functional rare earths used in chipmaking, telco, and storage devices (Round III, scandium and dysprosium).

The October 2025 round extends this logic to the optical and magnetic layer of the value chain, covering materials that enable fiber-optic networks, display manufacturing, laser, and EV motors. This is clearly not an isolated move, but is a part of a multi-stage plan that now spans every level of the electronics and semiconductor ecosystem from wafer substrates to photonics and magnetics.

The fourth round of rare earths export controls expands the list of materials that will now require a dual-use export license from China's Ministry of Commerce. While this hurts several industries, it does not hurt them significantly more than the prior rounds (particularly the April 2025 round), so we could consider the new list as an expansion of the Round III rather than an all-new Round IV (more on this later), though for simplicity we will call it this way.

The big question is whether the industry outside of China can replace the People's Republic's rare earth supplies in a timely manner. While there have been conversations about replacing China-originated materials, from semiconductor production and broader industries, the main limitation seems to be the lack of efficient technologies for processing rare earth elements.

Over recent decades, China has not only perfected the mining of rare earth minerals but also the technologies required for the associated tools and processing. Therefore, companies and countries planning to switch from using materials from China to their own will have to buy equipment and technologies from Chinese companies. China's government now has everything covered.

 




The newly imposed export regulations now also include rare-earth production and processing equipment, covering over 20 types of industrial machinery. This includes centrifugal extraction units, acid-resistant roasting kilns, precipitation and crystallization reactors, electrolytic and vacuum furnaces, vacuum casting and sintering systems, isostatic and magnetic presses, laser and grinding machines, and crystal-growth furnaces used for high-purity rare-earth crystals.

Advanced crystal-growth furnaces are particularly important for antimony, gallium, germanium, and other rare-earth elements used in semiconductor manufacturing, though the exact purity levels and applications vary. High-purity materials are essential to minimize defects and ensure the consistent electrical properties demanded by process technologies. While it is theoretically possible to use different crystallization reactors, presses, and furnaces, the final material, although pure, will differ from that produced using standard tools.

This may require requalification of the semiconductor process technology, which might take months and incur significant costs. To that end, it will become difficult for foreign companies to mine and refine rare earth materials outside of China with the new regulation.

In addition, a new regulation introduced last week extends the same legal framework to the mining reagents, separation chemicals, and mineral feedstock required to produce or refine rare earths. Until now, China has mainly regulated exports of refined metals and oxides, while mining reagents and separation chemicals have been lightly monitored.

By adding these materials to the list of controlled items, China is closing an option for companies to buy Chinese reagents or ores and perform refining elsewhere. This means even if a foreign refinery exists, it cannot legally operate without a Chinese export license, which further reinforces China's control not just over mined output but over the mining and refining hardware, consumables, and chemical know-how.

The new export restrictions on five rare earth elements, mining and refining tools, and chemicals used for their mining and refining, clearly expand China's control over rare earth supplies and solidify the country's market share, the final set of restrictions is absolutely unprecedented as they expand export controls beyond China's borders.

 




Starting December 1, China will require foreign companies to obtain a dual-use Chinese export license if their products contain Chinese-origin rare-earth materials (≥ 0.1 % by value) or were manufactured using Chinese rare-earth mining, refining, or magnet-production technologies. The rule applies to all companies, regardless of geography.

The regulation outright prohibits exports to military users, to entities listed on China's export control or watch lists (and to their subsidiaries with 50% or more ownership), for end uses involving weapons of mass destruction, and terrorism, which is something to be expected.

However, the most painful part is that China's Ministry of Commerce will review export license applications related to the production or research of advanced logic (14nm and below), or 3D NAND (256-layer+ memory chips), as well as AI technologies with potential military applications. This means that China's ministry may refuse to supply materials to any chipmaker in the world, whether it is TSMC producing AI processors for Nvidia, or Micron producing 3D NAND memory for its latest SSD.

From a strategic point of view, Round IV of China's rare earth materials export restrictions marks China's shift from being the world's largest supplier of rare earths to the global watchdog over rare earth materials and products. In addition to restricting shipments of 20 metals from China, the country now controls exports of processing equipment and chemicals. The country will also govern how rare earth materials and China's mining and refining knowledge are used worldwide. As a result, Beijing has gotten a set of powerful instruments of industrial and geopolitical control.

China's latest announcement may not be the last blow to the global semiconductor trade. However, further export controls won't have as much of an impact as the announced proposals on rare earth materials.

China already controls exports of foundational materials like antimony, gallium, germanium, as well as crucially important bismuth, indium, molybdenum, and tungsten. The country can expand the list of controlled elements further, albeit not very significantly.

Furthermore, now that China intends to control the means of rare earth mining and refining, as well as applications that use rare earth metals, the next step could be controlling the particular end user of finished products, just like the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security controls end users of products made using American technologies.

This will require a global tracing system to identify Chinese rare-earth content across the supply chain, but the ongoing feud between China and the U.S. has demonstrated that both countries are willing to go great lengths to protect national interests.

The prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, has increased steadily over past decades. It now affects 38% of adults worldwide and numbers are rising rapidly. Although it presents few, if any symptoms, without treatment it can progress to more severe liver diseases.

The condition is strongly linked to cardiovascular disease, as the conditions share many of the same risk factors – unhealthy dietary habits, dysfunctional adipose tissue, insulin resistance, and subclinical inflammation. 

MASLD is often associated with overweight or obesity, so one of the most effective non-pharmacological treatments is weight loss. Studies suggest that for people with overweight or obesity losing 3-5% of their bodyweight can reduce the condition, while 10% weight loss can help reverse fibrosis of the liver.

However, if weight loss is ineffective, there are few pharmacological treatments for the condition.

Now, a new study has found that, in animal models of fatty liver disease, two commonly used heart drugs — pemafibrate, which is used to lower blood lipids, and telmisartan, a blood pressure medication — significantly reduced fat buildup.

In their study, published in Pharmacological Research, the researchers suggest that this finding supports the repurposing of telmisartan and pemafibrate for managing MASLD.

Marta Alegret, DPharm, one of the study authors, who is a pharmacology professor in the Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Medicinal Chemistry at the University of Barcelona, in Spain, told Medical News Today:

“We have used a dietary rat model which mimics the initial stage of MASLD, simple steatosis without inflammation or fibrosis. These phases are often neglected because it is believed that they are benign, but the truth is that the risk of mortality is already increased. The importance of our findings is that we demonstrate that telmisartan and pemafibrate, alone or combined, effectively reduce liver lipid levels in this model.”

The researchers used two models of hepatic steatosis — abnormal fat accumulation in the liver — one in rats and the other in zebrafish larvae.

In the rat model, the animals were randomly divided into five groups. For two months, a control group followed a regular diet, and four groups had a high-fat diet with free access to 10% fructose (sugar) solution.

For the third month, three of the high-fat diet groups were treated as follows:

At the end of the 3 months, the researchers collected blood samples for analysis.

Zebrafish have similar carbohydrate/lipid metabolism and liver physiology to mammals, so are often used as a quicker, cheaper alternative to mammal models. 

The researchers placed 5-day old zebrafish larvae into tanks with different feeding regimes — standard fed, overfed plus fructose, and overfed plus glucose. They then added telmisartan to the water in the overfed plus glucose tank.

After 5 days of treatment, researchers collected body image data and liver samples from the zebrafish for analysis.

In the rat model of fatty liver without obesity, both pemafibrate (0.5mg/kg/day) and telmisartan (10mg/kg/day) were highly effective in reducing liver triglycerides.

In zebrafish, telmisartan similarly reduced fat accumulation in the liver.

Notably, the researchers found that combining the drugs, each at half the normal dose, was equally effective in reducing fat accumulation in the liver.

Alegret told MNT: 

“The rationale of combining pemafibrate with telmisartan is based on their complementary mechanisms of action to reduce liver lipids: Pemafibrate essentially enhances lipid catabolism (breakdown), while telmisartan affects the pathways related to endogenous lipid synthesis in the liver. In addition, cardiovascular risk is high in patients with MASLD, and each one of these compounds target one different cardiovascular risk factor (dyslipidemia and hypertension). Therefore, their combination may result in a lowered cardiovascular risk.”

“Moreover,” she continued, “one of our key findings in the rat model of MASLD is that the combination of pemafibrate and telmisartan at half the dose used of each drug alone is as effective at reducing accumulation of hepatic fat as monotherapy. The possibility of using low doses of the compounds when they are combined would reduce the risk of adverse effects.”

Cheng-Han Chen, MD, a board-certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA, explained how the drugs are currently used:

“Pemafibrate is a drug closely related to the fibrate class of medications, and telmisartan belongs to the class of medications known as angiotensin II receptor blockers. Both of these categories of medications are commonly used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and have a favorable safety and efficacy profile,” Chen, who was not involved in this study, told MNT.

“Developing new drugs is a costly process that frequently ends in failure due to safety concerns. By repurposing drugs that have already demonstrated safety when used for other conditions, it may be possible to find effective treatments for certain unmet medical needs in a more efficient and cost-effective manner.”

– Cheng-Han Chen, MD

Alegret cautioned that their findings are an early stage in developing these drugs as a potential treatment for liver disease.

“From our results only, we can not recommend these drugs, alone or combined for the treatment of MASLD. It would be necessary to demonstrate their beneficial effects in a clinical assay in patients with this disease,“ she said.

“To our knowledge, some small clinical trials have reported improvements in MASLD markers, such as fatty liver index, with pemafibrate or telmisartan,” the study author added.

“However, to approve these drugs for the treatment of MASLD, it is necessary to perform assays with a larger number of patients, longer duration, and specific histologic endpoints — for example, improvement in fibrosis stage and reduction of liver fat content measured by imaging or biopsy,” she pointed out.

A new study found that the degree of immune enrichment predicted radiosensitivity. The radiosensitivity index (RSI), a validated genomic marker, was higher in pretreatment immune-enriched triple-negative breast cancers that did not achieve a pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant therapy, and these tumors showed increased predicted radiotherapy resistance.

“While radiotherapy doses after neoadjuvant systemic therapy are often prescribed based on pretreatment clinical distribution of disease, radiographic and/or pathologic evidence of treatment response, and extent of surgery, our results suggest that integration of therapy-induced genomic and immunologic changes may allow a more personalized approach to radiotherapy,” the authors of the study concluded.

The study, led by Shane R. Stecklein, MD, PhD, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, was published online in International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics.

Paired posttreatment sequencing data were unavailable for 26 patients due to various factors, including unavailability of surgical specimens and disease progression during neoadjuvant therapy, which could affect the analysis comparing pre- and posttreatment changes.

Restricting access to a high-fat diet (HFD) in mice to either their active or inactive period promoted vastly different effects on their food preference and meal patterns that parallel behaviors observed in humans with dysregulated sleep-wake cycles.

“Our findings suggest that time-restricted access to high-fat diets promotes vastly different effects on feeding behavior, mainly food preferences and meal patterns, that parallel behaviors observed in humans dysregulated sleep-wake cycles (eg, night shift workers), a population that is at increased risk of developing obesity,” the authors of the study wrote.

NEWPORT, Wales – Ethnicity is more than the colour of a patient's skin, with a pressing need for greater cultural competency in primary care, according to a session addressing the management of dermatologic issues across different ethnic groups. 

Dr Catherine Fernando, a GP from East Scotland with a special interest in dermatology, presented a session dedicated to skin of colour at the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Annual Conference 2025. 

“As practitioners, we all need to remind ourselves to be aware of our own ethnicities and the impact that it has on consultations in the delivery of culturally sensitive care,” she said. 

“Of course, it is very important to recognise differences in presentation of dermatological conditions on skin of colour, but ethnicity is more than skin colour,” Fernando said. “It encompasses shared culture, language, ancestry, beliefs, traditions, history, and experiences, rather than just a single biological trait like skin colour.”

She also noted the importance of enquiring sensitively about complementary and alternative therapies to avoid misinterpretation or inadvertently alienating patients. 

“As practitioners, we need to be aware of cultural misconceptions about skin disease and not assume patient knowledge.”

Fernando called for greater representation of skin tones in medical teaching, particularly to seed change from early in clinical careers. “Dermatology education always needs to include images of different skin tones in teaching, while the representation of different skin colours and ethnicities also needs to increase,” she pointed out. 

Dermatology was developed as a clinical specialty in Europe in the 1800s, and despite the considerable time that has passed, people with darker skin tones are still underrepresented in textbooks and digital educational materials. “Unfortunately, this has yielded a cohort of doctors who are not confident diagnosing skin disease in skin of colour,” she said.

To illustrate the issue, Fernando showed a photo of 4-year-old Calvin, who lives in a damp London flat with mould on the walls and has an itchy, scaly rash on his extensor surfaces. Delegates were asked to identify the diagnosis from options including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, scabies, and dermatitis herpetiformis.

“What do you think is the diagnosis here?” she asked, adding, “Please don't worry if you're wrong, because diagnoses in skin of colour are really difficult. It's undertaught at all stages of medical training.” 

Calvin's diagnosis was atopic dermatitis. “But the reason a lot of people here thought that he had psoriasis was because traditionally, we've all been taught about atopic dermatitis and how it presents in White skin,” she explained. In skin of colour, the condition often affects extensor rather than flexural surfaces.

She also noted that postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation can have significant psychological impacts, while periorbital circles and Dennie-Morgan folds are common in darker skin tones with eczema.

The 2022 Global Report on Atopic Dermatitis found that Black Caribbean babies born in London were twice as likely to develop atopic dermatitis as White children born during the same period in the same city. In the US, data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveyshowed higher prevalence and severity of the condition among Black children compared with other skin tones. “ When it comes to research, historically, people with skin of colour have always been underrepresented in dermatological clinical trials, and typically, 70%-80% of patients in trials have White skin,” Fernando said.

Erythema is not noticeable on dark skin, she highlighted. “It is often seen as either a violaceous hue or a darker brown colour, and this can be misdiagnosed. Instead of seeing it as an active skin problem, it can be misdiagnosed as a postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.”

Fernando emphasised that erythema is an important factor in grading inflammatory dermatitis such as eczema or psoriasis. “There's the EASI score, which is Eczema Area Severity Index, and the PASI score, which is Psoriasis Area Severity Index, and both of them rely very heavily on erythema. Since we don't see erythema in very dark skin tones, these patients are often very much underestimated in research as well as practice.”

In discussing the delivery of culturally competent care, Fernando advised clinicians to “enquire sensitively about any traditional therapies, and also know that some cultural healing practices may cause mild trauma, including lichenification, hyperpigmentation, and Koebnerisation [appearance of new skin lesions on previously unaffected skin secondary to trauma].”

She also pointed out that, anecdotally, Black women are most affected by scalp psoriasis and “when choosing treatment, consider that daily hair washing is not practical; and in cultural terms, hair texture and hair-styling practices are important and may mean certain treatment regimens may be difficult to adhere to.”

Commenting on the issue of managing patients with skin of colour, the chair of the session, Dr Scott Jamieson, a GP in Kirriemuir, Scotland, remarked, “Diagnosing in skin of colour is an issue for a lot of us. I suspect we've got delegates in the room who say they see lots of people with skin of colour and others who are not confident.” 

He added, “In the north of Scotland, where I work, we don't see a lot of people with skin of colour, I have to say, so it's actually really difficult when you get somebody through the door and it's something that I have to scratch my head about at times. I think for both those of us that are seeing this issue commonly, and those of us who see it less commonly, this talk has had a huge amount of relevance.”

State-level legalization of cannabis has been linked to a sharp rise in use among those with psychosis, a new study showed.

Among those with psychosis, past-month cannabis use increased by 9.53 percentage points in states with legal recreational use. No changes were identified for weekly or more frequent cannabis use among this population.

“Given how cannabis can negatively affect illness course and health service utilization in individuals with psychosis, these results should be considered by regulators designing policies around taxation, potency, advertising, and health warnings,” the investigators, with first author, Andrew S. Hyatt, MD, Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston, wrote.

The study was published online on October 8 in JAMA Psychiatry.

To date, 24 states have legalized cannabis for recreational use. The growing commercialization of the drug is “a cause for concern” for individuals with psychosis who have experience higher symptom burden and relapse rates than nonusers, the investigators noted.

Previous studies have shown that cannabis use is associated with an increased risk for psychosis. However, this study is the first to investigate how recreational legalization affects cannabis use in those with psychosis.

Investigators analyzed data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health study from 2014 to 2022. The study sample consisted of 1856 individuals (mean age, 36.6 years, 50.2% White, 58.2% female) who reported a diagnosis of psychosis or psychotic disorder.

Difference-in-differences models were used to assess changes in cannabis use associated with recreational legalization. States that have not legalized cannabis were the reference group for the analysis.

Further sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate changes in cannabis use before and after retail outlets opened, as well as for more frequent use and legal age restrictions.

After adjusting for covariates including race, ethnicity, receipt of antipoverty assistance, sex, and age, past-month cannabis use in individuals with psychosis rose after legalization by 9.53 percentage points (95% CI, 3.05-16.00; P = .004).

Similar results were obtained when the analysis was restricted to those aged 21 or above.

“Current cannabis use did not significantly increase before the retail outlets opened but did increase significantly afterward,” the investigators wrote. The increase was 10.51 percentage points (95% CI, 3.56-17.46). They found no significant changes for more frequent or weekly cannabis use.

A limitation of the study was that psychosis diagnoses were self-reported. In addition, the sample size consisted of a higher number of women than other studies of people with psychosis which could restrict generalizability.

Health warnings on cannabis products for those with a history of psychosis and taxation by potency could help prevent negative impacts on this population, the researchers suggested.

The authors reported no disclosures. This work was supported by grants K23DA062173 (Hyatt) and R01DA060795 (Flores) from the National Institute on Drug Abuse as well as grant P50MH126283 (Flores, Cook) from the National Institute on Mental Health.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a global public health threat. Recent reports estimated that 4.95 million deaths in 2019 were associated with AMR. Beyond antibiotics, it has also been shown that the use of nonantibiotic medications (NAMs), such as diuretics, statins, and proton pump inhibitors, contributes to the emergence of AMR.

Australian researchers led by Henrietta Venter at the University of South Australia, Adelaide, conducted laboratory experiments to determine whether commonly used NAMs, at concentrations similar to those found in the intestinal environment of nursing home residents, could enhance ciprofloxacin-induced mutagenesis in Escherichia coli.

The drugs tested included ibuprofen, diclofenac, acetaminophen (paracetamol), furosemide, metformin, atorvastatin, tramadol, temazepam, and pseudoephedrine. The findings were published in npj Antimicrobials and Resistance, part of the Nature portfolio.

The researchers chose nursing homes as a model environment because older adults often take multiple medications, not only antibiotics but also analgesics, sleep aids, and antihypertensive drugs. Some individuals may take up to nine different medications per day. This population also represents one of the highest consumers of antibiotics, which are frequently overused in long-term care facilities for treating urinary and respiratory infections.

Because NAMs are often prescribed alongside antibiotics, the team measured mutation frequencies in the presence of ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic known to induce genetic mutations and widely used to treat urinary tract infections, among the most common bacterial infections in older adults. The frequent use of ciprofloxacin has already led to the emergence of ciprofloxacin-resistant E coli, posing a growing threat in nursing home settings.

To test the effect of the nine NAMs, as well as combinations of two NAMs, researchers evaluated mutation frequency in two E coli strains: E coli BW25113 (a derivative of the standard laboratory strain E coli K-12) and E coli 6146, which was isolated from the feces of a nursing home resident. The antimicrobial susceptibility of mutants induced by NAM exposure was then assessed, and the genetic mechanisms of resistance were analyzed through whole-genome sequencing.

Overall, the results showed that two commonly used painkillers, ibuprofen and acetaminophen, can significantly exacerbate antibiotic resistance through mutation at concentrations relevant to the gut. This was reflected in an increased number of bacterial mutants and higher maximum cell density.

Other NAMs, such as diclofenac and furosemide, also increased mutation frequency compared with the control group (ciprofloxacin with dimethyl sulfoxide). In contrast, temazepam, tramadol, and pseudoephedrine had minimal impact on mutation frequency in both E coli strains tested.

The study found that diclofenac increased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin, ruling out the possibility that its effect on mutation frequency was simply due to reduced antibiotic availability. When bacteria were exposed to both ibuprofen and acetaminophen, the resulting mutation frequency was similar to that of ibuprofen alone, suggesting no cumulative effect from combining the two drugs.

However, mutants derived from exposure to two NAMs showed higher levels of resistance to ciprofloxacin. In addition, mutants from both E coli strains, BW25113 and 6146, exhibited reduced sensitivity (atleast fourfold) to multiple antibiotics. The increase in resistance was particularly marked for ciprofloxacin, reaching up to 32-fold in some cases.

Resistance was not limited to fluoroquinolones. It also extended to beta-lactam antibiotics such as amoxicillin, ceftazidime, and meropenem, as well as to levofloxacin and minocycline.

Most patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) showed partial non-adherence to antidiabetic therapy, with about one fourth of those prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor not taking it. Partial non-adherence rose with the number of prescribed antidiabetic agents and was linked to poorer glycaemic control and a higher prevalence of diabetes-related comorbidities.

""Our findings emphasize the importance of individualized treatment approaches,"" the authors of the study wrote.

""Particular attention should be given to drugs with lower adherence rates, ensuring that patients understand their benefits and addressing any misconceptions or concerns that may lead to partial non-adherence,"" they added.

This study was led by Vojtěch Škop, MD, Centre for Experimental Medicine, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic. It was published online on October 10, 2025, in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism.

Plasma drug measurements reflected only a single timepoint and may not have accurately represented long-term adherence. Patient behaviour could have been influenced by blood sampling as some individuals might have taken their medication before their medical checkup despite instructions. The study population consisted exclusively of European participants, potentially limiting the generalisability of the findings to other populations.

Frailty increased during the first year after the initiation of dialysis in patients with end-stage kidney disease. Pre-dialysis frailty was associated with an increased risk for hospitalisation, and an increase in the frailty score during the first 6 months of dialysis was linked to a higher risk for mortality.

""[The study] findings underline the importance of pre-dialysis frailty screening in order to inform prognosis and patient counselling in ESKD [end-stage kidney disease]. Our data suggests that those with a CFS ≥ 5 are at increased risk and would benefit from early identification,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Kerry-Lee Rosenberg, University College London, London, England. It was published online on October 08, 2025, in Scientific Reports.

A major limitation of this retrospective study was missing data; the timing and frequency of CFS score recordings were based on clinical judgement. Moreover, variation in the application of the CFS score may have existed between clinical staff. This study did not assess the level of available social support, which may have influenced frailty trajectory and hospitalisation.

This study did not report any source of funding. The authors declared having no competing interests.

One in four hepatologists in the United States screened positive for unhealthy alcohol use in a survey study conducted by UCLA. Researchers say the findings underscore the critical need for accessible physician wellness programs and reduced stigma around doctors seeking help.

The research, published in the journal Hepatology Communications, surveyed 185 practicing transplant hepatologists across the U.S. Of these, 26.3% screened positive for unhealthy alcohol use, a rate nearly identical to the 25.5% rate for the U.S. general population. Meanwhile, general hepatologists had lower rates of unhealthy alcohol use (11.2%) compared to U.S. physicians overall, (15.3%).

Transplant hepatologists regularly counsel their patients on evidence-based treatments for alcohol use disorder, yet our findings suggest that many within this specialty may themselves benefit from similar support. We need to normalize access to confidential, high-quality treatment and remove the stigma and fear of professional consequences that often prevent physicians from seeking help.""

The survey, conducted among American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases members, provided several insights into alcohol use behaviors of hepatologists including:

Patel said the findings underscore the need to create systemic support structures to encourage hepatologists to reduce their alcohol intake. Among the recommendations in the study: normalizing access to physician wellness and treatment programs; confidential access to counseling and alcohol use disorder treatments; and reducing stigma about attending state physician health wellness programs, which Patel said have shown success.

""Physicians deserve access to the same high-quality, evidence-based care they provide to their patients,"" Patel said. ""Creating a culture that supports self-referral and early intervention is crucial for physician health and, ultimately, patient care.""

Potential limitations to the study include response bias and underreporting due to stigma concerns. Patel said this may suggest the prevalence of unhealthy alcohol use may be higher than reported in the survey.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Astrocytes revealed as key players in stabilizing long-term emotional memories","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251015/Astrocytes-revealed-as-key-players-in-stabilizing-long-term-emotional-memories.aspx","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 00:33:00 GMT","

Why are we able to recall only some of our past experiences? A new study led by Jun Nagai at the RIKEN Center for Brain Science in Japan has an answer. Surprisingly, it turns out that the brain cells responsible for stabilizing memories aren't neurons. Rather, they are astrocytes, a type of glial cell that is usually thought of as a role player in the game of learning and memory. Published in the scientific journal Nature on Oct 15, the study shows how emotionally intense experiences like fear biologically tag small groups of astrocytes for several days so that they can re-engage when a mouse recalls the experience. It is this repeated astrocytic engagement that stabilizes memories.

Astrocytes have traditionally been thought to have a supporting role in the brain, literally. But when it became clear that engrams-the actual memory traces that exist in neurons-cannot alone account for stabilized, long-term memories, Nagai and his team turned to astrocytes for a solution. Neurons produce a protein called Fos when activated, and experiences can also trigger Fos production in some astrocytes. To monitor how astrocytes across the whole brain respond during learning and recall, the researchers developed a new system that can fluorescently label astrocytes with active Fos, but not neurons, and only if Fos is active during a specific time period, which is controlled by giving an animal a shot of 4-OHT.

With this system in place, they taught mice to associate a certain cage with an unpleasant experience. After learning the association, when mice were returned to the cage several days later, their reaction showed whether or not they remembered the past event. The key finding was that unlike in neurons, the researchers observed strong Fos activity in astrocytes only during recall, but not during the initial learning. Further experiments showed that Fos activity in these astrocytes requires input from the neurons in the amygdala that form the fear-memory engram in question, as well as simultaneous input from neurons that use the compound noradrenaline as a transmitter.

But engram activity and noradrenergic input happen during both learning and recall. So why does the Fos activity in astrocytes only happen during recall? Single-cell RNA sequencing of the astrocytes revealed that in the days following the emotional experience, the astrocytes began to produce alpha and beta adrenoreceptors, which are activated by noradrenaline. The extra adrenoreceptors can be thought of as a tag that identifies which astrocytes should be activated-produce Fos-the next time the animal recalls the experience and the neural engram is activated. To confirm their theories, when the researchers blocked Fos⁺ astrocyte signaling during recall, the mice had unstable memories and did not react as if they remembered anything during the recall test. On the flip-side, when the team forced the astrocytes to activate, animals were able to recall only mildly unpleasant experiences as if they were very unpleasant and even generalized their recalled experiences to other cages where they never experienced anything unpleasant.

Nagai says that in the short term, their discovery could help us understand PTSD and related conditions in which emotionally intense memories persist abnormally or are activated by overgeneralized objects in the environment. As he explains, ""these findings could lead to new therapeutic approaches that target the astrocytic memory switch, leading to therapies that gently dampen traumatic memories while sparing others.""

Beyond biology, the astrocyte-tagging process might inspire AI models that mimic human memory filtering. Current AI systems are data-hungry and energy-intensive; by learning from astrocytes-which select memories efficiently based on emotional salience and recurrence-we may design more energy-efficient, context-aware AI systems that remember just enough.""

Jun Nagai at the RIKEN Center for Brain Science 

The team's next goal is to figure out how astrocytes become ""eligible"" to gate memory stabilization and to test whether specific types of memories can be suppressed or enhanced by manipulating them.

Imposter participants threaten the integrity of health research and, by extension, the policies and clinical decisions built on it, warn experts in The BMJ.

Eileen Morrow and colleagues at the University of Oxford say the research community ""must acknowledge the problem and dedicate resources to testing and implementing safeguards .. to ensure that the data guiding clinical care reflect the real patient voice.""

Imposter participants are individuals who provide deceptive or inaccurate data to take part in health research or automated computer 'bots' that mimic human behavior and responses.

The issue has grown in recent years as online recruitment has become central to modern health research and can impact all types of studies, from surveys to randomized controlled trials.

The motivations of imposter participants remain unknown, explain the authors. Although some reports suggest that monetary benefit is a driver, not all studies offer financial incentives, so other motives, such as boredom, curiosity, or even an ideological intent to disrupt research, may also play a role.

Yet their impact is demonstrable. A 2025 review showed that 18 of 23 studies that looked for imposter participants in their data sets found them, with rates ranging from 3% to a high of 94%.

Researchers should routinely integrate imposter participant detection and prevention into online research, while considering the potential effect on their study population, write the authors. 

Common safeguards include identity verification procedures or CAPTCHA tests (asking participants to complete a task, such as to read and type distorted letters).

At a minimum, they say studies should transparently report which safeguards were used and acknowledge their limitations, and journals should encourage consistent and transparent reporting of these safeguards. 

Funders and institutions should also invest in infrastructure and training to help researchers keep pace with evolving tactics, while clinicians and policymakers should be cautious when interpreting studies that use online recruitment if imposter participant prevention is not mentioned.

They concluded, ""Imposter participants are more than a nuisance; they are a systemic threat to health research. Their effect is demonstrable and their detection inconsistent. In an age where online recruitment underpins everything from randomized controlled trials to surveys, they risk undermining the integrity of health research and the decisions built on it.""

The prevalence of obesity in the United States could rise sharply under a new definition of obesity released earlier this year by the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology Commission.

Researchers from Mass General Brigham found that when applying the new criteria, which expands upon the traditional use of body mass index (BMI) to include measures of body fat distribution, the prevalence of obesity increased from about 40 percent to about 70 percent among over 300,000 people included in their study. The rise was even more pronounced among older adults.

Additionally, the researchers found that those newly added individuals also had a higher risk of adverse health outcomes. Their results are published in JAMA Network Open.

We already thought we had an obesity epidemic, but this is astounding. With potentially 70 percent of the adult population now considered to have excess fat, we need to better understand what treatment approaches to prioritize.""

Lindsay Fourman, MD, Study Co-First Author and Endocrinologist, Metabolism Unit, Endocrinology Division, Department of Medicine, Mass General Brigham 

Traditionally, obesity has been defined by BMI, which estimates body fat based on a person's weight and height. But other anthropomorphic measures-such as waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, or waist-to-hip ratio-may further account for fat distribution and aid in differentiation between muscle and fat mass.

Under the new framework, a person is classified as having obesity if they have a high BMI plus at least one elevated anthropometric measure (a condition the authors term ""BMI-plus-anthropometric obesity""), or if they have a normal BMI and at least two elevated anthropometric measures (a condition termed ""anthropometric-only obesity"").

The new definition also distinguishes between preclinical and clinical obesity, with clinical obesity defined as the presence of obesity-related physical impairment or organ dysfunction. At least 76 organizations have endorsed the new guidelines, including the American Heart Association and The Obesity Society.

The study analyzed participants in the National Institutes of Health All of Us Research Program's cohort of over 300,000 Americans. Obesity prevalence was 68.6 percent with the new definition, versus 42.9 percent under the traditional BMI-based definition. This increase was entirely driven by the inclusion of individuals with anthropometric-only obesity. Obesity rates varied by sex, race, and especially by age-affecting nearly 80 percent of adults over 70.

Importantly, the study found that those with anthropometric-only obesity – who would not have been classified as having obesity by the traditional definition – had a higher risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality than people without obesity. About half of all individuals who met the new obesity criteria had clinical obesity, and this proportion was only slightly lower in the anthropometric-only obesity group compared with the BMI-plus-anthropometric obesity group.

""We have always recognized the limitations of BMI as a single marker for obesity because it doesn't take into account body fat distribution,"" said senior author Steven Grinspoon, MD, Chief of the Metabolism Unit in the Endocrinology Division of the Mass General Brigham Department of Medicine. ""Seeing an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in this new group of people with obesity, who were not considered to have obesity before, brings up interesting questions about obesity medications and other therapeutics.""

The researchers emphasize that further studies are needed to better understand the causes of and optimal treatments for anthropometric-only obesity. The research team previously developed a therapeutic that reduces waist circumference and plans to explore the utility of different treatment strategies in this newly defined population.

""Identifying excess body fat is very important as we're finding that even people with a normal BMI but with abdominal fat accumulation are at increased health risk,"" Fourman said. ""Body composition matters – it's not just pounds on a scale.""

People with excess body fat who build and keep muscle may be less likely to develop obesity-induced heart, liver, or kidney damage or die early, according to a new study published in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.

Despite clear evidence that excess body fat can directly cause illness, obesity is often viewed as a risk factor for heart disease and diabetes rather than a chronic disease.

Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher. BMI is a calculation that uses a person's height and weight to classify weight status and assess their potential health risks. However, it is not a direct measure of body fat. Excess body fat refers to an abnormal or excessive accumulation of adipose tissue that impairs health by increasing the risk of metabolic, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and certain cancer-related conditions, which is now newly defined as ""preclinical obesity.""

Additional measures such as waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, or direct assessments of body fat percentage are often used alongside BMI to more accurately characterize excess adiposity and its associated health risks.

Our findings show that muscle strength is a powerful, early sign of who is most at risk of developing obesity-induced organ dysfunctions among people with excess body fat. Because grip strength is easy to measure and strength can be improved with weight training, this research points to a practical, low‑cost way to identify at‑risk individuals and to act early.""

Yun Shen, M.D., study author of Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, LA

The authors studied 93,275 participants from the UK Biobank to determine the association between grip strength and the progression to obesity-induced organ dysfunctions or death. They studied people in a ""preclinical obesity"" stage, which is when body fat and size measures are higher than average, but obesity has not yet resulted in ""obesity-induced organ dysfunctions.""

The researchers found participants with a stronger handgrip, a simple test of muscle strength, were less likely to progress to obesity and to die during follow‑up a mean follow-up of 13.4 years.

""This protective link was consistent in multiple checks using other muscle metrics, including the muscle‑to‑weight and lean‑to‑weight ratios,"" Shen said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New AI system connects hidden clues in medical records to transform diagnosis","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251015/New-AI-system-connects-hidden-clues-in-medical-records-to-transform-diagnosis.aspx","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 00:03:00 GMT","

Doctors often must make critical decisions in minutes, relying on incomplete information. While electronic health records contain vast amounts of patient data, much of it remains difficult to interpret quickly-especially for patients with rare diseases or unusual symptoms.

Now, researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and collaborators have developed an artificial intelligence system, called InfEHR, that links unconnected medical events over time, creating a diagnostic web that reveals hidden patterns. Published in the September 26 online issue of Nature Communications, the study shows that Inference on Electronic Health Records (InfEHR) transforms millions of scattered data points into actionable, patient-specific diagnostic insights.

We were intrigued by how often the system rediscovered patterns that clinicians suspected but couldn't act on because the evidence wasn't fully established.By quantifying those intuitions, InfEHR gives us a way to validate what was previously just a hunch and opens the door to entirely new discoveries."" 

Girish N. Nadkarni, MD, MPH, senior corresponding author, Chair of the Windreich Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health, Director of the Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health, the Irene and Dr. Arthur M. Fishberg Professor of Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Chief AI Officer of the Mount Sinai Health System

Most medical artificial intelligence (AI), no matter how advanced, applies the same diagnostic process to every patient. InfEHR works differently by tailoring its analysis to each individual. The system builds a network from a patient's specific medical events and their connections over time, allowing it to not only provide personalized answers but also to ask personalized questions. By adapting both what it looks for and how it looks, InfEHR brings personalized diagnostics within reach, the investigators say.

In the study, InfEHR analyzed deidentified, privacy-protected electronic records from two hospital systems (Mount Sinai in New York and UC Irvine in California). The investigators turned each patient's medical timeline-visits, lab tests, medications, vital signs-into a network that showed how events connected over time. The AI studied many of these networks to learn which combinations of clues tend to appear when a hidden condition is present.

With a small set of doctor-confirmed examples to calibrate it, the system checked whether it could correctly flag two real-world problems: newborns who develop sepsis despite negative blood cultures and patients who develop a kidney injury after surgery. Its performance in identifying patients with the diagnosis was compared with current clinical rules and validated across both hospitals. Notably, the system could also signal when the record lacked sufficient information, allowing it to respond ""not sure"" as a safety feature.

The study found that InfEHR can detect disease patterns that are invisible when examining isolated data. For neonatal sepsis without positive blood cultures-a rare, life-threatening condition-InfEHR was 12–16 times more likely to identify affected infants than current methods. For postoperative kidney injury, the system flagged at-risk patients 4–7 times more effectively. Importantly, InfEHR achieved this without needing large amounts of training data, learning directly from patient records and adapting across hospitals and populations.

""Traditional AI asks, 'Does this patient resemble others with the disease?' InfEHR takes a different approach: 'Could this patient's unique medical trajectory result from an underlying disease process?' It's the difference between simply matching patterns and uncovering causation,"" says lead author Justin Kauffman, MS, Senior Data Scientist at the Windreich Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health at the Icahn School of Medicine.

Importantly, in addition, InfEHR flags how confident it is in its predictions. Unlike other AI that may give a wrong answer with certainty, InfEHR knows when to say, 'I don't know'-a key safety feature for real-world clinical use, say the investigators.

The team is making the coding of InfEHR available to other researchers as it continues to study uses of the system. For example, the team will next explore how InfEHR could personalize treatment decisions by learning from clinical trial data and extending those insights to patients whose specific characteristics or symptoms were not fully represented in the original trials. 

""Clinical trials often focus on specific populations, while doctors care for every patient,"" Mr. Kauffman says. ""Our probabilistic approach helps bridge that gap, making it easier for clinicians to see which research findings truly apply to the patient in front of them.""

The paper is titled ""InfEHR: Clinical phenotype resolution through deep geometric learning on electronic health records."" The study's authors, as listed in the journal, are Justin Kauffman, Emma Holmes, Akhil Vaid, Alexander W. Charney, Patricia Kovatch, Joshua Lampert, Ankit Sakhuja, Marinka Zitnik, Benjamin S. Glicksberg, Ira Hofer, and Girish N. Nadkarni.

Prof. Dr. Elif Nur Fırat Karalar from Koç University's Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics and her team have uncovered the molecular mechanisms responsible for regulating a structure that plays a critical role in how cells communicate with their environment. Their new study has been published in Communications Biology.

Found on the surface of almost every cell, the primary cilium is a tiny antenna-like projection that enables the cell to sense environmental signals. Through this structure, cells regulate essential processes such as growth, development, and adaptation. For healthy functioning, primary cilia must maintain the correct length, stability, and morphology.

The research highlights the role of DYRK kinases, a family of enzymes that regulate intracellular processes. The findings of Dr. Fırat Karalar and her team show that these kinases are essential for maintaining the length, stability, and shape of primary cilia. When DYRK kinases malfunction, cilia may become abnormally long, structurally deformed, or unstable. In such cases, the cell loses its ability to properly sense and process external signals.

This discovery not only advances our understanding of fundamental cell biology but also provides new perspectives on health conditions linked to ciliary dysfunction, such as developmental disorders, kidney diseases, and vision loss. Moreover, it may open new avenues for addressing complex diseases in the future by uncovering potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Combination of prebiotics and probiotics offer superior anti-inflammatory benefits compared with omega-3 or prebiotics alone","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251016/Combining-prebiotics-and-omega-3-is-key-to-better-immune-and-metabolic-health.aspx","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 06:47:00 GMT","

A new study, led by experts at the University of Nottingham, has found that combining certain types of dietary supplements is more effective than single prebiotics or omega-3 in supporting immune and metabolic health, which could lower the risk of conditions linked to chronic inflammation.

The findings of the study, which are published in the Journal of Translational Medicine, show that a synbiotic - a combination of naturally fermented kefir and a diverse prebiotic fiber mix - produces the most powerful anti-inflammatory effects among the three common dietary supplements tested.

The kefir and prebiotic mix was provided by Chuckling Goat Ltd. It contains a mix of naturally occurring probiotic bacteria and yeasts, which form during the traditional fermentation of goat's milk with live kefir grains. These grains are living cultures that house dozens of beneficial microbial species.

When kefir (rich in live beneficial microbes) is combined with a diverse prebiotic fiber (which feeds them), a synbiotic effect is obtained - the fiber nourishes the microbes, helping them thrive and produce beneficial metabolites like butyrate, which has anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating effects throughout the body.

Over six weeks, healthy participants taking the synbiotic saw the broadest reduction in inflammation-related proteins compared to those taking omega-3 or fiber alone. The findings suggest that pairing beneficial microbes with prebiotic fiber could help support immune and metabolic health more effectively than single supplements.

Systemic inflammatory markers are signals in the blood that show how much inflammation is happening throughout the body, not just in one specific area, like the gut or an infection. The findings of the study showed that the participants' overall levels of inflammation across their whole body went down, suggesting an improvement in general immune balance and lower risk for conditions linked to chronic inflammation (like heart disease or other metabolic conditions).

The next stage of the research would be to test the supplements on people with certain conditions to see their effectiveness.

The study was led by Dr Amrita Vijay in the School of Medicine at the University of Nottingham.

Our study shows that while all three dietary approaches reduced inflammation, the synbiotic - combining fermented kefir with a diverse prebiotic fiber mix - had the most powerful and wide-ranging effects. This suggests that the interaction between beneficial microbes and dietary fiber may be key to supporting immune balance and metabolic health.""

Boston Children's Hospital, along with Broad Clinical Labs and Roche Sequencing Solutions, has demonstrated that rapid genomic sequencing and interpretation are achievable in a matter of hours. This milestone not only sets a GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS™ for the fastest human whole genome sequencing to date but represents a significant clinical development that would expedite more precise treatments to critically ill babies in the NICU. The team's pilot data was published today in New England Journal of Medicine.

Current clinically available rapid genomic sequencing options take days (from sample receipt to report) at best, yet many critical care decisions in the NICU need to occur within a matter of hours. While there have been prior demonstrations of genome-sequencing within hours, none up to now have been scalable or feasible for routine use.

Our pilot simulates a workflow through which we could feasibly send out a genome sequencing sample from a baby in the morning and have the diagnosis/report that same afternoon. This would truly be game-changing for rare disease diagnoses for our families, who are currently waiting for a week -at best - for diagnoses for their critically ill babies.""

Broad Clinical Labs team used Roche Sequencing Solutions' sequencing by expansion (SBX) prototype to sequence and analyze 15 human samples, including 5 historical cases from the Boston Children's Manton Center (where Dr. Wojcik is the Medical Director) and 7 from the Boston Children's NICU. They achieved remarkable speed in processing the samples, with the fastest taking less than four hours to get data on the genetic variants from the extracted DNA.

""In the NICU, a few hours could mean the difference between unnecessary procedures and targeted, life-saving treatment,"" continued Wojcik. ""The results of this study bring geneticists and clinicians one step closer to integrating point-of-care genome sequencing into the standard of care for critical care settings.""

More than 7 million Americans live with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), supported by 12 million unpaid family caregivers whose contributions are valued at $413 billion annually. As the U.S. population continues to age, the number of people with dementia and their caregivers will nearly trip by 2050. Innovative solutions to support family caregivers are urgently needed. 

Now, with a $3 million grant from the National Institute on Aging (NIA), digital health intervention researcher, Y. Alicia Hong, is poised to change that. Hong led an interdisciplinary team to develop the Wellness Enhancement for Caregivers (WECARE) as a culturally tailored, digital health intervention to enhance caregiving skills and improve the wellbeing of dementia caregivers. The new grant will allow her team to further refine WECARE using AI technology and evaluate it with a randomized controlled trial. 

WECARE is one of the first personalized digital interventions for dementia caregivers. Though it is designed for Chinese American dementia caregivers, it can be adapted for other groups and serve the growing demand for digital support for dementia caregivers in an aging society.""

Y. Alicia Hong, professor in the College of Public Health Department of Health Administration and Policy, George Mason University

The 7-week program will provide participants with informational ADRD multimedia content, quiz games, social networking with other caregivers, personalized feedback, and additional individualized resources. WECARE's success will be evaluated by measuring the depressive symptoms reported by participants. The project also intends to identify barriers to and facilitators of WECARE's adoption and long-term use. 

This resource comes at a critical time as the aging population grows, and more people with ADRD require caregivers. Additionally, most family caregivers have chronic conditions due to prolonged and intensive dementia caregiving, causing an increased need for resources that sustain the health of family caregivers. 

Hong's grant entitled ""WECARE: A Personalized Intervention for Underserved Chinese American Dementia Caregivers"" will take place from September 2025 to August 2030, for a total of $3,088,427. WECARE is directly responsive to NIA's priority of effective interventions for ADRD-affected populations.

A groundbreaking international study changes the view that exposure to the toxic metal lead is largely a post-industrial phenomenon. The research reveals that our human ancestors were periodically exposed to lead for over two million years, and that the toxic metal may have influenced the evolution of hominid brains, behaviour, and even the development of language.

Moreover, the study – published in Science Advances – adds a piece to the puzzle of how humans outcompeted their cousins, the Neanderthals. Brain organoid models with Neanderthal genetics were more susceptible to the impacts of lead than human brains, suggesting that lead exposure was more harmful to Neanderthals.

Led by researchers from the Geoarchaeology and Archaeometry Research Group (GARG) at Southern Cross University (Australia), the Department of Environmental Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital (New York, USA), and the School of Medicine at the University of California San Diego (UCSD, USA), the research combined novel fossil geochemistry, cutting-edge brain organoid experiments, and pioneer evolutionary genetics to uncover a surprising story about lead's role in human history.

Until now, scientists believed lead exposure was largely a modern phenomenon, linked to human activities such as mining, smelting, and the use of leaded petrol and paint. By analysing 51 fossil teeth from hominid and great ape species, including Australopithecus africanus, Paranthropus robustus, early Homo, Neanderthals, and Homo sapiens, the team discovered clear chemical signatures of intermittent lead exposure stretching back almost two million years.

Using high-precision laser-ablation geochemistry at Southern Cross University's GARG Facility (located in Lismore, NSW) and Mount Sinai's Exposomics state-of-the-art facilities, the researchers found distinctive 'lead bands' in the teeth, formed during childhood as the enamel and dentine grew. These bands reveal repeated episodes of lead uptake from both environmental sources (such as contaminated water, soil, or volcanic activity) and from the body's own bone stores, released during stress or illness.

Our data show that lead exposure wasn't just a product of the Industrial Revolution – it was part of our evolutionary landscape.""

Professor Renaud Joannes-Boyau, Head of the GARG research group, Southern Cross University

""This means that the brains of our ancestors developed under the influence of a potent toxic metal, which may have shaped their social behaviour and cognitive abilities over millennia.""

The team also turned to the lab to explore how this ancient exposure might have affected brain development. Using human brain organoids, miniature, lab-grown models of the brain, they compared the effects of lead on two versions of a key developmental gene called NOVA1, a gene known to orchestrate gene expression upon lead exposure during neurodevelopment. The modern human version of NOVA1 is different from that found in Neanderthals and other extinct hominids, but until now, scientists did not know why this change evolved.

When organoids carrying the archaic NOVA1 variant were exposed to lead, they showed marked disruptions in the activity of FOXP2 – expressing neurons in the cortex and thalamus – brain regions that are critical for the development of speech and language. This effect was far less pronounced in organoids with the modern NOVA1 variant.

""These results suggest that our NOVA1 variant may have offered protection against the harmful neurological effects of lead,"" said Professor Alysson Muotri, Professor of Pediatrics/Cellular & Molecular Medicine and Director of the UC San Diego Sanford Stem Cell Institute Integrated Space Stem Cell Orbital Research Center.

""It's an extraordinary example of how an environmental pressure, in this case, lead toxicity, could have driven genetic changes that improved survival and our ability to communicate using language, but which now also influence our vulnerability to modern lead exposure.""

Genetic and proteomic analyses in this study revealed that lead exposure in archaic-variant organoids disrupted pathways involved in neurodevelopment, social behaviour, and communication. The altered FOXP2 activity in particular points to a possible link between ancient lead exposure and the evolutionary refinement of language abilities in modern humans.

""This study shows how our environmental exposures shaped our evolution,"" said Professor Manish Arora, Professor and Vice Chairman of Environmental Medicine.

""From the perspective of inter-species competition, the observation that toxic exposures can offer an overall survival advantage offers a fresh paradigm for environmental medicine to examine the evolutionary roots of disorders linked to environmental exposures.""

While lead exposure today is mostly due to human industry, it remains a serious global health issue, particularly for children. The findings underscore how deeply intertwined environmental toxins and human biology have been and warn that our vulnerability to lead may be an inherited legacy of our past.

""Our work not only rewrites the history of lead exposure,"" added Professor Joannes-Boyau, ""it also reminds us that the interaction between our genes and the environment has been shaping our species for millions of years, and continues to do so.""

The study analysed fossil teeth from Africa, Asia, Europe, and Oceania, using advanced geochemical mapping to identify patterns of childhood lead exposure. Laboratory experiments with brain organoids carrying either modern or archaic NOVA1 genes examined the effects of lead on brain development, with a focus on FOXP2, a gene central to speech and language. Genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data were integrated to build a comprehensive picture of how lead may have influenced the evolution of hominid social behaviour and cognition.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Researchers discover new genetic cause of hereditary optic atrophy","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251016/Researchers-discover-new-genetic-cause-of-hereditary-optic-atrophy.aspx","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 15:06:00 GMT","

A research team from the Medical University of Vienna and the Medical University of Graz has discovered a previously unknown genetic cause of hereditary optic atrophy, a degenerative disease of the optic nerve associated with gradual loss of vision. The results, currently published in the journal Genetics in Medicine, open up new possibilities for the genetic diagnosis of this disease and provide important approaches for future research into the underlying disease mechanisms.

The starting point for the research was the genetic examination of a large Austrian family in which seven individuals across three generations suffered from optic atrophy. Genome-wide sequencing revealed a previously undescribed variant in the PPIB gene (peptidylprolyl isomerase B). This gene contains the blueprint for an enzyme that helps proteins in the body to adopt their correct structure and breaks down proteins with faulty structures.In cultured cells from affected individuals, the research team showed that this gene variant impairs the function of mitochondria - the ""power plants"" of cells. Impaired mitochondrial function is detectable in most known forms of hereditary optic atrophy. By analysing archived genome data, a total of twelve additional affected individuals carrying the same genetic mutation were identified in eight other families.

""We have thus succeeded in describing the PPIB gene as a new optic atrophy gene,"" says study leader Wolfgang M. Schmidt from the Center for Anatomy and Cell Biology at MedUni Vienna, summarising the results of the research. ""The identification of this genetic variant creates the possibility of a genetic diagnosis, which has been lacking in many cases,"" adds co-study leader Thomas P. Georgi from the Department of Ophthalmology at Med Uni Graz. This is important in order to be able to provide targeted advice to affected families and tailor medical care to the individual needs of those affected.

Optic atrophy is a degenerative disease of the optic nerve that leads to gradual damage to the retinal ganglion cells - the nerve cells that transmit visual signals from the retina to the brain. The first symptoms are usually reduced visual acuity, impaired colour perception or central visual field defects. The disease can be inherited; around 20 forms of optic atrophy are currently known. Most variants involve a disturbance of mitochondrial function. Despite advances in genetic diagnostics, the exact genetic cause remains unclear in around 60 percent of those affected.This study - a collaboration between the Center for Anatomy and Cell Biology at MedUni Vienna, the Department of Ophthalmology and Optometry at MedUni Vienna, the Center for Cancer Research at MedUni Vienna and the University Eye Clinic at MedUni Graz - has now filled this gap with regard to the PPIB gene. Future studies will clarify how exactly the PPIB variant influences cell metabolism and whether further genetic changes in this gene are associated with optic atrophy.

While plowing a wheat field in rural Washington state in the 1990s, William Wallace spotted a gray plane overhead that he believed was releasing chemicals to make him sick. The rancher began to suspect that all white vapor trails from aircraft might be dangerous.

He shared his concern with reporters, acknowledging it sounded a little like ""The X Files,"" a science fiction television show.

Academics cite Wallace's story as one of the catalysts behind a fringe concept that has spread among adherents to the Make America Healthy Again, or MAHA, movement and is gaining traction at the highest levels of the federal government. Its treatment as a serious issue underscores that under President Donald Trump, unscientific ideas have unusual power to take hold and shape public health policy.

The concept posits that airplane vapor trails, or contrails, are really ""chemtrails"" containing toxic substances that poison people and the terrain. Another version alleges planes or devices are being deployed by the federal government, private companies, or researchers to trigger big weather changes, such as hurricanes, or to alter the Earth's climate, emitting hazardous chemicals in the process.

Several GOP lawmakers and leaders in the Trump administration remain convinced the concepts are legitimate, though scientists have sought to discredit such claims.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is planning to investigate climate and weather control, and is expected to create a task force that will recommend possible federal action, according to a former agency official, an internal agency memo obtained by KFF Health News, and a consultant who helped with the memo.

The plans, along with comments by top GOP lawmakers, show how rumors and conspiracy theories can gain an air of legitimacy due to social media and a political climate infused with falsehoods, some political scientists and researchers say.

""When we have low access to information or low trust in our sources of information, a lot of times we turn to our peer groups, the groups we are members of and we define ourselves by,"" said Timothy Tangherlini, a folklorist and professor of information at the University of California-Berkeley. He added that the government's investigation of conspiracy theories ""gives the impression of having some authoritative element.""

HHS is expected to appoint a special government employee to investigate climate and weather control, according to Gray Delany, former head of the agency's MAHA agenda, who said he drafted the memo. The agency has interviewed applicants to lead a ""chemtrails"" task force, said Jim Lee, a blogger focused on weather and climate who Delany said helped edit the memo, which Lee confirmed.

""HHS does not comment on future or potential policy decisions and task forces,"" agency spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in an email.

The memo alleges that ""aerosolized heavy metals such as Aluminum, Barium, and Strontium, as well as other materials such as sulfuric acid precursors, are sprayed into the atmosphere under the auspices of combatting global warming,"" through a process of stratospheric aerosol injection, or SAI.

""There are serious concerns SAI spraying is leading to increased heavy metal content in the atmosphere,"" the memo states.

The memo claims, without providing evidence, that the substances cause elevated heavy-metal content in the atmosphere, soil, and waterways, and that aluminum is a toxic product used in SAI linked to dementia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, asthma-like illnesses, and other chronic illnesses. The July 14 memo was addressed to White House health adviser Calley Means, who didn't respond to a voicemail left by a reporter seeking comment.

High-level federal government officials are presenting false claims as facts without evidence and referring to events that not only haven't occurred but, in many cases, are physically impossible, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California.

""That is a pretty shocking memo,"" he said. ""It doesn't get more tinfoil hat. They really believe toxins are being sprayed.""

Kennedy has previously promoted debunked chemtrail theories. In May, he was asked on ""Dr. Phil Primetime"" about chemicals being sprayed into the stratosphere to change the Earth's climate.

""It's done, we think, by DARPA,"" Kennedy said, referring to a Department of Defense agency that develops emerging technology for the military's use. ""And a lot of it now is coming out of the jet fuel. Those materials are put in jet fuel. I'm going to do everything in my power to stop it. We're bringing on somebody who's going to think only about that.""

DARPA officials didn't return a message seeking comment.

Deploying chemtrails to poison people is just one of many baseless conspiracy theories that have found traction among Trump administration health policy officials led by Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist before entering politics. He continues to promote a supposed link between vaccines and autism, as well as make statements connecting fluoride in drinking water to arthritis, bone fractures, thyroid disease, and cancer. The World Health Organization says fluoride is safe when used as recommended.

Delany, who was ousted in August from HHS, said Kennedy has expressed strong interest in chemtrails.

""This is an issue that really matters to MAHA,"" said Delany, referring to the informal movement associated with Kennedy that is composed of people who are skeptical of evidence-based medicine.

The memo also alleges that ""suspicious weather events have been occurring and have increased awareness of the issue to the public, some of which have been acknowledged to have been caused by geoengineering activities, such as the flooding in Dubai in 2024."" Geoengineering refers to intentional large-scale efforts to change the climate to counteract global warming.

""It is unconscionable that anyone should be allowed to spray known neurotoxins and environmental toxins over our nation's citizens, their land, food and water supplies,"" Delany's memo states.

Scientists, meteorologists, and other branches of the federal government say these assertions are largely incorrect. Some points in the memo are accurate, including concerns that commercial aircraft contribute to acid rain.

But critics say the memo builds on kernels of truth before veering into unscientific fringe theories. Efforts to control the weather are being made, largely by states and local governments seeking to combat droughts, but the results are modest and highly localized. It isn't possible to manipulate large-scale weather events, scientists say.

Severe flooding in the United Arab Emirates in 2024 couldn't have been caused by weather manipulation because no technology could create that kind of rainfall event, Maarten Ambaum, a meteorologist at the University of Reading who studies Gulf region rainfall patterns, said in a statement on the floods. Similar debunked claims emerged this year after central Texas experienced devastating floods.

The Government Accountability Office concluded in a 2024 report that questions remain as to the effectiveness of weather modification.

Research into changing the climate has been conducted, including work by one private company that engaged in field tests. Still, federal agencies say no ongoing or large-scale projects are underway. Study of the concept remains in the research phase. The Environmental Protection Agency says there are no large-scale or government efforts to affect the Earth's climate.

""Solar geoengineering is not occurring via direct delivery by commercial aircraft and is not associated with aviation contrails,"" the agency says on its website.

Misperceptions about weather, climate control, and airplane contrails extend beyond the Trump administration, scientists said.

In September, a congressional House committee hearing titled “Playing God With the Weather — A Disastrous Forecast"" involved two hours of debate on the once-fringe idea. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who chaired the hearing, has introduced legislation to ban weather and climate control, with a fine of up to $100,000 and up to five years in prison.

Some Democrats objected to the nature of the discussion. Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) accused Greene of using ""the platform of Congress to proffer anti-science theories, to platform climate denialism.""

Frequently citing chemtrails, GOP lawmakers have introduced legislation in about two dozen states to ban weather modification or geoengineering. Florida passed a bill to establish an online portal so residents can report alleged violations.

""The Free State of Florida means freedom from governments or private actors unilaterally applying chemicals or geoengineering to people or public spaces,"" GOP Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a press statement this spring.

Meanwhile, the chemtrail conspiracy has permeated popular culture. The title track on singer Lana Del Ray's seventh studio album is entitled ""Chemtrails Over the Country Club."" Bill Maher dove into the chemtrail myth on his podcast ""Club Random,"" saying, ""This is nuts. It's just nuts."" And ""Chemtrails,"" a psychological thriller, wrapped filming in July.

Social media has given wing to the chemtrails concept and other fringe ideas involving public health. They include an outlandish belief that Anthony Fauci, who advised both Trump and President Joe Biden on the government response to the covid-19 pandemic, created the AIDS epidemic. There is no evidence of such a link, public health leaders say.

Researchers say another false belief by those on the far right holds that people who received covid vaccines could shed the virus, causing infertility in the unvaccinated. There is no evidence of such a connection, scientists and researchers say.

More severe weather events due to global warming may be driving some of the baseless theories, scientists say. And risks occur when such ideas take hold among the general population or policymakers, some public health leaders say. Climate researchers, including Swain, say they've received death threats.

Lee, the blogger, said he disagrees with some of the more far-fetched beliefs and is aware of the harm they can cause.

""There are people wanting to shoot down planes because they think they are chemtrails,"" said Lee, adding that some believers are afraid to venture outside when plane vapor trails are visible overhead.

There is also no evidence that plane contrails cause health problems or are related to intentional efforts to control the climate, according to the EPA and other scientists.

The memo and focus at HHS on climate and weather control are alarming because they perpetuate conspiracies, said David Keith, a professor of geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago.

""It's unmoored to reality,"" he said. ""I expected there were documents like this, but seeing it in print is nevertheless shocking. Our government is being driven by nonsensical dreck from dark corners of social media.""

A new clinical trial co-led by researchers at FutureNeuro and RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences is investigating how advanced brain monitoring could improve the diagnosis and management of epilepsy. Led in Ireland by consultant neurologists Professor Norman Delanty of RCSI and Beaumont Hospital and Dr Daniel Costello of Cork University Hospital (CUH) – two of the country's busiest neurology departments – the trial involves multiple sites across Europe, with Irish patients making up more than half of those enrolled. 

Traditional diagnostic methods for epilepsy face significant limitations. Short-term EEGs (typically around 30 minutes) and seizure diaries can be unreliable, especially when seizures are infrequent or hard to classify. While inpatient video-EEG in Epilepsy Monitoring Units (EMUs) remains the gold standard, it is resource-intensive and difficult to access. Ireland has just six dedicated EMU beds, and patients often require hospital stays of up to eight days. 

The trial in collaboration with Danish medical technology company UNEEG Medical A/S, focuses on the use of UNEEG EpiSight, a subcutaneous EEG (sqEEG) system that enables remote monitoring of brain activity for up to 36 months in people with epilepsy. Designed as a complementary tool within epilepsy services, the UNEEG EpiSight records continuously, including during sleep, and transmits data wirelessly to support clinical decision-making. Implantation is performed through a brief outpatient procedure, carried out by Consultant Neurosurgeons Mr Kieron Sweeney at Beaumont and Beacon Hospitals, and Mr Wail Mohammad at Cork University Hospital, along with their expert teams. 

The innovation builds on promising findings from a previous study led by Professor Delanty, Consultant Neurologist at Beaumont Hospital, FutureNeuro Investigator and Honorary Clinical Professor at RCSI, recently published in Epilepsia, which showed that an earlier version of the technology reliably detected all recorded seizures and 90% of significant brain abnormalities in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Until now, this level of detailed monitoring has only been possible through admissions to Epilepsy Monitoring Units (EMUs). 

This trial will assess whether long-term, outpatient sqEEG monitoring can address these challenges. By capturing brain activity in real-world settings over extended periods, the system could help clinicians detect seizure patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed, particularly those that happen at night, support earlier diagnosis, and reduce the need for repeated hospital visits. 

Professor Delanty said: ""FutureNeuro's involvement reflects our commitment to embracing the huge progress in the safe use of technology in clinical practice. This trial will help us better understand the clinical impact of long-term brain monitoring, with the potential for significant downstream benefits – such as reducing inpatient admissions, shortening time to diagnosis, and avoiding unnecessary treatments. By improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, this type of technology could ease pressure on epilepsy services, support better resource allocation, and ultimately lead to more personalised and cost-effective care for patients."" 

Dr Daniel Costello added: ""This diagnostic tool holds significant potential for clinical care. It could help detect seizures that go unrecognised, provide a clearer picture of seizure frequency, and reveal the cumulative impact on brain function. Just as importantly, it may offer reassurance when seizures are well-controlled and help distinguish between epileptic seizures and other events. The potential to monitor brain activity long-term, outside of hospital, is an important step forward."" 

We are excited by the potential of this trial and delighted that so many Irish patients are involved, highlighting the world-class epilepsy research taking place here. Epilepsy is highly individual, and finding the right treatment often requires trial and error. The more accurate information clinicians have, the better the chances of identifying the right treatment sooner. This innovative technology could provide that insight without long hospital stays or lengthy waiting lists, improving quality of life for people with epilepsy while easing pressures on hospital services. We will follow this important trial closely and look forward to its findings."" 

Peter Murphy, Epilepsy Ireland CEO

This trial represents a fundamental shift toward precision medicine in epilepsy care, where treatment decisions can be based on comprehensive, objective data rather than limited traditional monitoring methods. The strong Irish participation in this international study reflects FutureNeuro's established position in translating brain research discoveries into clinical practice, demonstrating how Irish research centres are driving innovation in global epilepsy care.

Community sporting clubs must rethink how they engage parents if they want to stop the slide in young people dropping out of sport, according to new Flinders University research.

The study – published in Sport, Education and Society – highlights how early-season interactions between parents and clubs can make or break a family's ongoing involvement in community sport.

It calls on clubs and sporting organizations to prioritize personalized onboarding, clear communication, and visible recognition of parents' contributions to foster stronger family connections and retain participants.

Lead researcher Associate Professor Sam Elliott says the findings should encourage clubs, governing bodies, and policymakers to see parents not as ""sideline problems"" but as essential partners in creating safe, supportive, and enjoyable environments for children.

Our research shows that parents are often left feeling dismissed or undervalued by clubs at the very start of a season.""

Sam Elliott, Study Lead Researcher and Associate Professor, Flinders University

He added, ""When clubs provide personalised communication, check-ins, and clear expectations, families feel supported – and children are far more likely to stay engaged in sport long-term.""

The study examined four sports – Australian football, netball, swimming, and tennis – using 320 hours of field observations and 41 interviews with parents, coaches, and club leaders. To achieve improved retention rates among youth, sporting clubs should develop:

These insights align with the Australian Sports Commission's Play Well strategy, which emphasizes building inclusive, welcoming environments that keep young people engaged.

""Clubs often assume disengaged parents are lazy, but in reality, many are navigating vague expectations, inconsistent communication, and a lack of recognition,"" Associate Professor Elliott added.

""Small shifts in how clubs welcome and support parents can transform family experiences, strengthen volunteer workforces, and ultimately reduce dropout.""

""Not all the burden should be placed on coaches. Club leaders, including presidents, coordinators, and team managers and administrators, can all make an enormous contribution to these aspects of parent engagement early on,"" concluded Associate Professor Elliott.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Researchers uncover TRAT1's central role in T helper cell function","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251016/Researchers-uncover-TRAT1s-central-role-in-T-helper-cell-function.aspx","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 06:08:00 GMT","

Researchers at the Medical University of Vienna have taken a closer look at a previously largely unknown component of the immune system: the protein molecule TRAT1 (T Cell Receptor Associated Transmembrane Adaptor 1) plays a central role in how so-called T helper cells (a specialised subgroup of immune cells) distinguish between attack and self-control - an important mechanism for restraining inflammation and preventing autoimmune diseases. The findings have recently been published in the journal Cell Communication and Signaling.

T helper cells are the ""conductors"" of the immune defence, controlling the function and specialisation of other immune cells and thus ""tailoring"" the immune response to the respective pathogen. The T helper cell compartment is divided into effector T helper cells, which actively fight intruders, and regulatory T cells (Treg), which prevent an excessive immune response. Until now, only part of how this balance is controlled was understood.

A research team at the Medical University of Vienna, led by Ralf Schmidt and Klaus Schmetterer (Department of Laboratory Medicine), has now been able to show that TRAT1 acts like a switch in these processes. In the ""attack"" cells (effector T cells), TRAT1 ensures that activation proceeds in a controlled manner. If TRAT1 is switched off using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tool, these cells become more active but lose their ability to produce certain inflammatory messengers such as interleukin-17.

In the ""protective"" cells (Treg), on the other hand, TRAT1 supports their inhibitory function - but in a complex way: it enhances the suppression of other immune cells, but not uniformly for all cell types.

Our data show that TRAT1 is a dual regulator of the immune system. On the one hand, it dampens excessive immune activity, but at the same time it strengthens the targeted immune suppression by regulatory T cells.""

Klaus Schmetterer, Study Leader and Professor, Medical University of Vienna

However, these results, which were determined in cell culture, also have high clinical relevance: altered expression patterns of TRAT1 were found in data series of immune cells from patients with graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and systemic lupus erythematosus. This suggests that signal filtering in T helper cells is defective in these diseases.

""In the long term, these findings could also help to develop new cell-based immunotherapies - such as tailor-made CAR-Treg cells that specifically prevent unwanted immune reactions. We have already been able to prove this in a novel 3-dimensional cell culture model for transplant rejection,"" explains Tobias Frey, first author of the study. https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/web/en/ueber-uns/news/2025/news-in-october-2025/new-insights-into-the-control-of-the-immune-system-trat1-protein-acts-as-a-switch-between-defence-and-self-regulation/

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","U.S. Soccer recommends extending NCAA season","https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46615055/us-soccer-stretch-men-ncaa-season-full-academic-year","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 15:02:00 GMT","

Gab Marcotti and Craig Burley explain the struggle to balance making Club World Cup games available for the global audience with making it safe for the players. (2:52)

A committee working on behalf of U.S. Soccer has recommended that men's college soccer switch to a season that stretches across the full academic year beginning fall 2026.

The recommendation comes after U.S. Soccer tasked the 17-person ""NexGen College Soccer Committee"" with finding solutions to evolve college soccer to, among other things, better prepare players to turn professional and compete at the international level.

The committee recommended that more time is needed to evaluate the best future construct of women's college soccer, although the result could be the same recommendation as the men's game. Regardless of how the college game evolves, the committee said in its report, which was released on Thursday, that it ""believes strongly that any of these [four proposed] options are far superior to the status quo.""

Any changes, which still need clear the major hurdle of NCAA approval, would overhaul a college soccer system that has historically served as a development pathway for American pro players -- especially women -- but has not evolved with the modern professional game. Longstanding issues with college soccer include a truncated season played entirely in the fall, which puts heavy demand on athletes during that time and leaves them largely without competition for most of the year.

""The recommendations were designed to be able to deliver a better student athlete experience, to be able to provide financial stability, and to provide player development opportunities -- which are the three things that everyone in college sports said they wanted,"" U.S. Soccer CEO and secretary general JT Batson told ESPN. ""We're optimistic for this to be able to move at pace.""

Batson was not part of the committee. Dan Helfrich, principal and former CEO of Deloitte Consulting, chaired the group, which included club and league leaders from MLS, NWSL and USL, as well as athletic directors and a school president, among other stakeholders.

Under the proposal for men's soccer, all 213 Division 1 men's programs would still compete for the same championship, but in place of their traditional conferences, they would play regionally and within tiers of similarly competitive teams. Those tiers could change over time in a system similar to promotion and relegation.

Preliminary estimates in the committee's report say that such a system could save programs $25,000 to $350,000 annually in operational costs depending on their current travel. Many current conferences, driven by college football, have been realigned with disregard for geography, creating cross-country trips for in-conference games.

Helfrich said two major ""pain points"" for college soccer are the condensed schedules that limit athlete recovery, as well as increasing costs associated with travel and preseason starting prior to convocation of schools.

-How Berhalter revived Chicago Fire after USMNT fired him
-Pochettino's turnaround has USMNT no longer dreading World Cup
-NWSL U-19 ranking: Thompson, Hutton lead top young players

""The ultimate solution is a response to that,"" he said.

The changes would only apply to NCAA Division 1 soccer.

Preseason would begin in mid-to-late August and the regular season would run until April, with a break from games and training in December and January. Games would largely be played on weekends, rather than the current structure of jamming multiple games into each week between August and December.

A championship would be played in May, which Helfrich said would give it a greater platform by not overlapping other college championships. That, too, Helfrich said, would have commercial benefits and give college soccer a greater platform for fan support, media visibility and sponsorship.

This proposed model would be better for everyone in college soccer, Helfrich said, not just the select few who are chasing professional careers.

""The experiences and the implications on all 14,000-15,000 Division 1 American soccer players, versus the hundreds that will or could play professionally, was a dominant part of the committee's debate,"" Helfrich told ESPN. ""That was front of mind always: How do we make sure the solutions that we build are thoughtful to both of those constituencies?""

The 17-person committee held mostly virtual meetings every few weeks this year to work on the proposal and analyze four different potential options for college soccer's evolution. The most conservative option that was analyzed, which could still happen on the women's side, is a slightly expanded fall season with an added spring competition for elite teams.

Federation president Cindy Parlow Cone, who won three NCAA titles at North Carolina in addition to winning a World Cup and a pair of Olympic gold medals, initially brought the idea to Batson & VP of strategy Emily Cosler to see how the federation could help. Cone had been speaking with University of North Carolina athletic director Bubba Cunningham about the team's budget and realized how unsustainable it was in the current model. That was Cone's first ""What if?"" moment.

The women's game is unique in several ways, including that it's much larger at the college level with 350 D-1 programs -- and the gap in quality between the national contenders and mid-major schools is much wider.

Batson said it is ""a huge red flag"" that American women's players in that college age range (roughly 18-22 years old) are not playing the same number of minutes as their peers in Europe.

Cone and Helfrich both said they hope to have a recommendation in place to implement in women's college soccer for the 2027-28 academic year.

""There are more challenges on the women's side, so we feel like we needed to have more discussions, more learnings there, until we put out, 'this is best for the women's game,'"" Cone told ESPN. ""It could be different from the men's game. It could be exactly the same. But we need to take a look at it, as Emma [Hayes, USWNT coach] likes to say, through the female lens. There's still more to do there, so we are going to do that work.""

The next challenge in the entire process is the NCAA, which has historically been slow to evolve and included significant bureaucratic red tape, as evidenced with how women's college basketball had to force structural changes in recent years. There have been major overhauls of late in the NIL (name, image, likeness) era, however, which has left everyone at U.S. Soccer confident that these changes could be implemented quickly. Cone said everyone in the process is ""leaning in.""

Helfrich said the next step in the men's college soccer process should be the committee holding formal conversations with NCAA soccer sub-committees in the coming weeks, and that wider group drafting legislative proposals and timelines before the end of the calendar year. The goal is to have the new system launch next August.

""I will tell you confidently that neither the conferences nor the NCAA will be surprised by this release, because we've been collaborative,"" Helfrich said. ""Part of the reason we've done that is to create a smoother on-ramp to governance conversations.""

Among the ideas in the proposal is increased flexibility around player eligibility, which is specifically a pain point in soccer, where players sometimes turn professional as teenagers and sacrifice their college eligibility. The ideas include a ""second chance"" pathway for players have a stalled professional career, as well as increased opportunities with professional teams without sacrificing college eligibility.

These proposals come at a time when development leagues continue to sprout up in the U.S. MLS Next and multiple tiers of USL already exist on the men's side, while the NWSL has said it plans to launch a second division in the coming years, in addition to WPSL Pro -- which combined would add over 1,000 new professional roster spots on the women's side.

U.S. Soccer believes these can all co-exist with college soccer -- and that the federation's responsibility is to unite them.

""It's an example of when you bring all of the parts of the American soccer ecosystem together, you can come up with ways to drive greater impact and greater outcomes,"" Batson said. ""The American soccer market has grown tremendously over the last couple of decades.

""However, there's a lot of fragmentation. The role of U.S. Soccer here is one of a convener, an aligner, and ultimately our goal is to catalyze that great energy into the outcomes that everyone cares about. We want soccer everywhere in this country, and we want our teams to win. We are now a soccer country.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

ATLANTA (Oct. 16, 2025) – Twenty-four players have been called up to the U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team training camp outside of Philadelphia, Pa. that will run from Oct. 20-28. From Oct. 20-23, the camp will run concurrently with the U.S. Women's National Team's time in Philadelphia so U.S. head coach Emma Hayes and her staff can observe trainings. The U-23s will also attend the USA vs. Portugal match on Oct. 23 at Subaru Park in Chester, Pa. The U-23s will stay in the Philadelphia area to train after the USWNT leaves for Connecticut and then Kansas City to finish its October slate of matches.

The U-23 programming in Philadelphia is another step in U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes' emphasis on this age group and its importance along the player pathway to the full National Team. This will be the third USWNT training camp of the year to feature concurrent programming with the U-23s, following camps in Los Angeles and Denver. Hayes also held a “Futures Camp” last January alongside the USWNT in Florida. Orlando Pride assistant coach Yolanda Thomas will serve as head coach for this camp.

Eight players on the USA's October training camp roster have seen time with the U.S. U-23s this year or attended January's “Futures Camp,” a clear example of the symbiosis with the senior side. 

“We've been preparing players to not only help us qualify for the 2027 World Cup but also with a view to the ‘28 Olympics and beyond, and this is one of the reasons the Under-23 program is so valuable,” said Hayes. “Along with the senior team roster, we want to prepare 50-plus players every camp so there is dual messaging, exposure to our principles of play and the alignment around our framework. The great thing about this is when players move among the two teams in the system, there is clarity and hopefully a better understanding of what is expected at the highest level.”

This U.S. U-23 WNT roster features players with five birth years ranging from 2006 to 2002, which is the age cut-off for players to be a part of the U.S. U-23 WNT this year. 

Goalkeepers (3): Liz Beardsley (Houston Dash; Lakeland, Fla.), Leah Freeman (Bay FC; Berkeley, Calif.), Neeku Purcell (Seattle Reign; Seattle, Wash.)

Defenders (9): Natalie Bain (Xavier University; Alexandria, Ky.), Eva Gaetino (Paris Saint-Germain FC, FRA; Dexter, Mich.), Ella Hase (Racing Louisville FC; Orland Park, Ill.), Emily Mason (Seattle Reign; Flemington, N.J.), Quincy McMahon (San Diego Wave; Highland Ranch, Colo.), Ayo Oke (CF Pachuca, MEX; Lawrenceville, Ga.), Jayden Perry (Portland Thorns FC; Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif.), Evelyn Shores (Angel City FC; Atlanta, Ga.), Gisele Thompson (Angel City FC; Studio City, Calif.)

ATLANTA, GA – U.S. Soccer and the NextGen College Soccer Committee (NGCS) released a comprehensive white paper outlining recommendations to modernize Division I men's and women's college soccer.

This is a critical step toward ensuring the sport's continued relevance, sustainability, and impact within the broader U.S. Soccer ecosystem. The NextGen White Paper, developed over the past year with input from college athletic directors, coaches, players, professional league executives, and governance leaders, provides a roadmap to align college soccer with today's rapidly changing athletic and professional landscape.

“This isn't about rewriting college soccer, it's about renewing it,” said JT Batson, CEO of U.S. Soccer. “The goal is simple: keep what's great, improve what's not, and make sure the system works for today's student-athletes and tomorrow's game.”

For decades, college soccer has been one of the most important player development platforms in the United States, producing generations of players, coaches, referees, and administrators who have shaped the sport at every level. The recommendations, which span competition structure, scheduling, and operational alignment, aim to strengthen that foundation while adapting to new realities such as NIL, conference realignment, and expanded professional leagues.

“College soccer has had a massive impact in developing generations of players, coaches, and leaders across the sport, but with the game evolving rapidly on both the men's and women's side of the game we need to proactively determine changes that will have a positive impact,” said Cindy Parlow Cone, President of U.S. Soccer. “That's why U.S. Soccer is committed to helping college soccer modernize and strengthen its role within the development pathway, while still providing student-athletes the educational and community experiences that make the college game so special. These recommendations are the first step in working together with people across all levels of the game to build out a roadmap that ensures college soccer continues to thrive for years to come.”

The NextGen College Soccer Committee, composed of 17 leaders across college athletics, professional soccer, and business, was convened by U.S. Soccer to ensure a diversity of perspectives guided the process. The Committee anchored on three core outcomes: ensuring academic, physical, and mental well-being of student-athletes, strengthening the financial position of institutions, and enhancing the identification and development of elite players. The recommendations call for:

“Our job was to listen, analyze, debate, and recommend,” said Dan Helfrich, Chair of the NextGen Committee and former CEO at Deloitte Consulting. “The result isn't disruption for disruption's sake. It's a modernization plan that strengthens well-being, reduces costs, and creates new opportunities for growth. If we do this right, college soccer will thrive for decades and serve as a model for other sports facing similar pressures and opportunities.”

The release of the white paper marks the beginning of a broader movement, not the end of the conversation. In the coming months, U.S. Soccer and the Committee will collaborate with the NCAA, conferences, and institutions to translate recommendations into actionable policy proposals and pilot programs, with implementation targeted for the 2026–27 academic year.

HERRIMAN, Utah (Thursday, October 16, 2025) - Utah Royals FC announce that 4 players have been called up to their national squads for the FIFA/International match window from October 20th through October 29th 2025.

Goalkeeper Mandy McGlynn has been called up to the U.S. Women's National Team by Head Coach Emma Hayes for a trio of matches including a pair against Portugal on October 23 and 26th. Forward Mina Tanaka has received a call up from Japan. Defender Janni Thomsen has been named to Denmark's squad after a successful run in the 2025 EURO's where she scored for her country. Forward Aisha Solórzano for the third consecutive international window. Lastly, recently acquired striker Lara Prašnikar will be joining the Slovenian National Team.

The U.S. Women's National Team will host three matches in the October FIFA window, facing Portugal on October 23rd in Chester, Pennsylvania, and again on October 26th in East Hartford, Connecticut, before heading to Kansas City, Missouri to take on the New Zealand Football Ferns on October 29th at 6pm MT.

McGlynn was featured in the roster for the USWNT roster for the last international window where she was the starting goalkeeper in the 4-0 victory against the Republic of Ireland and earned a clean sheet for the squad. McGlynn's consistent performances at the club and international level have contributed to her regular call-ups to the U.S. Women's National Team, where she continues to play a significant role on and off the field.

Tanaka has received a call up to Japan for the fifth consecutive international window. The veteran forward started in the squads first match against Spain on June 27th and recorded the teams lone goal in the 30th minute. The goal added yet another to her impressive tally of 44 goals over 92 appearances on the senior team. Coming off of a hot streak with the Utah Royals in the last few months where Tanaka has scored four goals in as many matches. She scored a 13th minute banger in the 3-2 victory over Racing Louisville. The goal was a master class by the striker, who took a touch over her defender before striking the ball out of the air and volleying it with power into the back of the net. Her next came in Chicago where Tanaka scored her first NWSL brace which consisted of a well placed shot and a penalty kick. Her most recent goal was a perfectly placed volley into the bottom left corner of the net in URFC's 3-2 loss to San Diego last Saturday, October 11th. Tanaka's form continues to impress and earn her a spot at the international level.

Thomsen returns to Denmark's national team for the fourth consecutive time since joining Utah Royals FC. Most recently a part of the roster for the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 where Thomsen recorded a 59th minute goal in the 3-2 loss to Poland. The Danish midfielder has since scored three goals in four matches for URFC. The first coming in the 3-2 victory over Racing Louisville with a perfectly placed finish from the right side of the box into the far left corner and out of the reach of the goalkeeper. Her second goal came one week later in the 9th minute of the 2-0 win over Bay FC on September 27th, with an almost identical shot, further showcasing the midfielders ability to place the ball in the perfect spot. Her most recent strike came this past weekend against San Diego in the 9th minute, with a left footed shot into the left side of the goal. Thomsen and Denmark will compete in two Nations League Play-off matches against Finland, away on October 24 and at home on October 28, 2025.

Solórzano joins the Guatemalan National Team for a third consecutive international window. The forward started in the 4–0 loss to Ecuador on June 28. Recently, she scored her first goal with the Royals on Saturday, September 27th along with Thomsen in the 2-0 victory against Bay FC, becoming the first Guatemalan to score in the NWSL. The score came after a deflection off of a shot from Tanaka, showcasing the relentless style of play Solórzano has come into matches with all season. She will look to carry that form into the national team as they aim to bounce back from a challenging run of results this year.

Prašnikar joined the Royals in August of this year from German side Eintracht Frankfurt, becoming the first Slovenian player in NWSL history. The striker arrived in Utah with a prolific international record, having scored 205 goals across all competitions since 2013. Most notably, she netted 48 goals in 88 appearances for the Slovenian senior national team. Her striking ability was a key factor in her move to Utah and will no doubt remain a major asset as she continues to grow with URFC.

Utah Royals FC hit the road to take on the Seattle Reign on Friday, October 17th. Kickoff is scheduled for 8 p.m. MT and will be streaming on NWSL+. After the away match, URFC will close out the season at home with a match against Trinity Rodman and the Washington Spirit on Sunday, November 2nd, kickoff time will be determined after this weekend's matches and tickets are available for purchase here.","{'href': 'https://www.rsl.com', 'title': 'Real Salt Lake'}","soccer"

U.S. Women's National Team (USWNT) legend and Angel City Football Club (ACFC) forward Christen Press has announced her retirement from professional soccer, concluding one of the most accomplished and influential careers in the modern era of the sport.

With over a decade representing the United States, Press earned 155 international caps and scored 64 goals, ranking among the top scorers in USWNT history. Known for her technical precision, creativity in attack, and relentless work ethic, she played a key role in helping the U.S. capture back-to-back World Cup titles in 2015 and 2019 and earned an Olympic bronze medal in 2021.

At the club level, Press's career spanned both domestic and international success. After a standout collegiate career at Stanford University, where she won the Hermann Trophy and set multiple scoring records, she went on to compete in Sweden's Damallsvenskan, winning the Golden Boot with Tyresö FF. In the NWSL, she represented the Chicago Red Stars, Utah Royals FC, and, most recently, Angel City FC, where she was the first player signed to the expansion team in 2022 and acted as an ambassador for the club's mission of equity and inclusion.

Reflecting on her retirement, Press shared:

“It's hard to find the words to say goodbye to a sport that has defined my life for over three decades. Football has given me everything, and I will miss being on the pitch so very much. Thank you to my family, friends, teammates, coaches, and community for this beautiful ride. I promise we will continue to reimagine sports in this next life!”

Beyond her on-field achievements, Press has been a driving force in athlete advocacy and the evolution of women's sports. Through her company RE—INC, she has championed athlete ownership, creative expression, and social progress, continuing to shape the landscape of sport long after the final whistle.

ACFC CEO and Co-Founder Julie Uhrman shares: “Christen retires as one of the most decorated and respected forwards in U.S. soccer history, a pioneer whose legacy is woven into the very fabric of our club. As Angel City's first signing, Christen's contributions to the club have been unparalleled. From her extraordinary skill and relentless competitiveness on the pitch to her unwavering commitment to making the game and our community more equitable, inclusive, and impactful. On behalf of everyone at Angel City, we thank Christen for everything she has given to the sport, our club, and future generations of athletes and fans.”

Christen Press retires as one of the most decorated and respected forwards in U.S. soccer history — a player whose impact will continue to influence the game for generations to come.

Former USWNT star Christen Press announces on ""Good Morning America"" that she will retire from professional soccer at the end of the NWSL season. (1:24)

The floodgates haven't opened entirely to teenage signings in the NWSL, but they are no longer so rare that the mere age of a player turns heads.

The NWSL still lacks a unified academy system, but with the college draft being abolished and combines -- including a youth combine to scout talent as young as 13 -- age is not holding recruitment back as it did in years past. Now, more teams are increasingly identifying young players who can make a difference -- and several already are, in big ways. So we've again ranked every player in the league age 19 and under -- including those on inbound and outbound loans -- to look at who's got next in one of the best leagues in the world.

The best of the bunch have already cracked into their senior national teams. Others are tearing it up at the youth international level, or slowly chipping away at growing into their future selves.

Several of the stars in the making from last year's U19 rankings have aged out of this category: U.S. women's national team stars Alyssa Thompson, Jaedyn Shaw and Olivia Moultrie, and Japan international Manaka Matsukubo have all since turned 20. (Thompson left the NWSL in September in a blockbuster transfer to Chelsea, anyway.)

Still, there are four more teenagers in the NWSL's pool this year than in last year's ranking. Who is the best right now? And who has shown potential for the future? Let's get to it.

Age: 18
Position: Defender
Club: Houston Dash (on loan with Dux Logroño)
Country: USA

Matthews is on loan in Spain until June 30, 2026, which the Dash hope will allow the 18-year-old to gain the necessary minutes to step into a bigger role with Houston come next summer. She's a regular with the U.S. youth national teams after training with Jamaica's senior team in the past.

Age: 18
Position: Defender
Club: Kansas City Current
Country: USA

Scott is still finding her way in the league, having played in just two matches. Her place on the best and deepest team in the league doesn't help with earning game time right now, but it is a great long-term development tool.

The Current loaned Scott to Racing Louisville in August, but the defender was recently recalled without making an appearance. She has played for the U.S. at several youth national team levels.

Age: 15
Position: Forward
Club: NJ/NY Gotham FC
Country: USA

Still the youngest player in the league, Whitham has earned minutes in six league games as well as several Concacaf Champions Cup games. Those minutes, particularly in Concacaf, should prove invaluable in her development.

Age: 16
Position: Forward
Club: Utah Royals
Country: USA

Ream signed with Utah as a 15-year-old and in August, she became the youngest goal-scorer in NWSL history -- a game-winner over the Portland Thorns in Providence Park, to boot. The Utah native is part of the U.S. team set to compete at the U17 World Cup later this month.

Age: 17
Position: Forward
Club: Chicago Stars FC
Country: USA

The Stars have had a difficult season in a myriad of ways, but Johnson offers some hope for the future. She scored her first pro goal earlier this month before departing for the U17 World Cup. Chicago signed her to a long-term deal, so she is part of another rebuild there.

Age: 18
Position: Midfielder
Club: Seattle Reign FC
Country: USA

Earning regular minutes is a major part of development at such a young age, and McCammon has quietly chipped away at that task in Seattle. With no goal contributions, her stats don't jump off the page, but 14 matches played -- including five starts -- for a team contending for a home playoff game shows the trust that Reign head coach Laura Harvey has in the young midfielder.

Age: 18
Position: Midfielder
Club: Houston Dash (pre-contract with Boston Legacy for 2026)
Country: USA

Ricketts will get a fresh start next year with NWSL expansion team Boston Legacy FC, who signed the midfielder to a two-year deal with a mutual option for 2029. Ricketts plays with a flair on the wing that can excite any casual observer.

Her reality in Portland was that of a teenager -- who is already wrapping up her third professional season! -- fighting for minutes on one of the most talented teams in the league. Boston's start-up nature should mean more gametime and more meaningful development. The potential has been there in glimpses.

Age: 17
Position: Forward
Club: Kansas City Current
Country: USA

It was just last year that Pfeiffer burst onto the scene and scored for the Kansas Current in her debut as a 16-year-old. She plays with the swagger and confidence of a young player who knows no limits.

She'd be higher on this list too, if not for a knee injury that cut her 2024 season short and kept her out for half of 2025.

Age: 18
Position: Forward
Club: Kansas City Current
Country: USA

Long, the daughter of Current co-owners Angie and Chris, has slowly built up first-team minutes in her debut season after leaving Duke University as a freshman to turn pro. She has been a regular at the U.S. youth level and helped the U17s finish third at the 2024 World Cup. She has one assist in nine appearances for Kansas City -- no small feat considering the team's depth of international firepower up top.

Age: 17
Position: Winger
Club: San Diego Wave FC
Country: USA

Barcenas is probably the most viral player on this list. Odds are if you follow the NWSL, you've seen a clip of her crossing up a defender with a stepover move or a spin turn.

Her next challenge is and has been about production -- completing those plays to turn them into serious scoring opportunities for her team. She has done more of that in 2025 as a reliable substitute (even with limited minutes).

Age: 18
Position: Forward
Club: Angel City FC (on loan to Djurgården)
Country: South Korea

Progress has been incremental for Phair, who signed a long-term extension this summer and immediately went on loan to Sweden's Damallsvenskan. She has earned more minutes there than she had at Angel City in the first half of the season, but Phair is still fighting for first-team appearances.

It's worth remembering that Phair turned pro at 16 and had already played at a senior World Cup for South Korea. She has a nose for goal, and those around Angel City expect that to start to pay off in the NWSL.

Age: 18
Position: Forward
Club: Portland Thorns FC
Country: Colombia

Portland invested significantly in signing Loboa -- her contract runs through 2028 with a club option for 2029 -- after she scored her first international goal and played in all six games at Copa America this summer for finalists Colombia. That included a full 90 in the group stage against Brazil and starting the final against Brazil.

Loboa debuted in her home country as a 14-year-old and while NWSL fans haven't yet seen much of her, the forward's experience at Copa America for a relatively strong team speaks to her potential.

Age: 18
Position: Midfielder
Club: Portland Thorns FC (on loan from Arsenal)
Country: England

Harbert's entire Arsenal senior career to date has been spent on loan, but those around the club have high expectations for the England youth international and expect she will eventually make it to the Lionesses' senior team.

Her loan to Portland is only through the end of the 2025 NWSL season, meaning it's brief, but it's also the highest level of first-team exposure she's had to date outside of Arsenal. Even if Portland proves to be a pit stop, Harbert's ceiling is high.

Age: 18
Position: Defender
Club: San Diego Wave FC
Country: USA

Armstrong is strong in duels and growing into her own as a center-back. Granted, San Diego's 31 goals conceded this season isn't great, but Armstrong, in large part, was tasked with filling the gigantic shoes of Naomi Girma, who left for Chelsea in the offseason.

Armstrong started the year as a 17-year-old thrown straight into the center-back role, and she has largely shown she has the ability to handle it.

Age: 19
Position: Forward
Club: Seattle Reign FC
Country: USA

Adames leads all teenagers this year with six goals, achieving that in just 989 minutes while coming off the bench half the time. Adames has game-changing abilities on the ball and can change matches off the bench. Her late game-winner in San Diego in June was a taste of how special she can be on the ball:

Emeri Adames finds the top corner to give the Seattle Reign a late lead vs. the San Diego Wave.

Age: 17
Position: Forward
Club: San Diego Wave FC
Country: USA

Ascanio has drawn comparisons to a young Tobin Heath -- who happens to be her childhood idol. Ascanio's production is up from last year, with four goals and an assist for a Wave team that has generally struggled going forward.

Ascanio's style is just different -- free-flowing, smooth, confident -- in a way that might draw comparisons to a young Heath. It's a rare combination, especially in the USWNT pool.

Age: 19
Position: Midfielder
Club: North Carolina Courage
Country: USA

Have you seen that assist on Manaka Matsukubo's recent goal for the North Carolina Courage? That was Riley Jackson doing what she does on the ball. Her final pass can be exquisite:

Manaka Matsukubo gets on the scoresheet for North Carolina Courage

Yes, that was her lone assist of the year, but she leads all players on this list in expected assists (3.77), which speaks to her potential. North Carolina has also struggled as a team this season, but that dip is not indicative of Jackson's potential.

Age: 18
Position: Midfielder
Club: Angel City FC
Country: USA

Kennedy Fuller gets on the scoresheet for Angel City FC

Fuller's four goals and three assists have been a bright spot in an inconsistent season filled with change for Angel City. Still, Fuller has the makings of a long-term No. 10 for club and, potentially, for country.

Fuller is a dynamic playmaker whose decision making at speed is exceptional for her age. She is also productive for a midfielder -- regardless of age -- with seven total goal contributions. Fuller has made tremendous gains in her second season as a professional.

Age: 19
Position: Defender
Club: Seattle Reign FC
Country: USA

Multiple coaches have compared Bugg's skill set to that of USWNT defender Naomi Girma, who landed at No. 2 on ESPN's ranking of the top 50 players last year. Need we go on? (OK, we will.)

Bugg is the central anchor to Seattle Reign FC's defense, and she recently got her first cap with the senior USWNT. She possess the subtle balance of vision and technical skill of an elite center back, and she is also good for an epic highlight.

Age: 19
Position: Defender
Club: Angel City FC
Country: USA

Thompson's older sister, Alyssa, is better known internationally -- especially after her blockbuster transfer to Chelsea on England's deadline day -- but Gisele is also a talented player turning heads within the NWSL and U.S. Soccer.

She has made her name thus far at fullback and has five assists for Angel City, which is tied for the NWSL lead. Her best position in the long term might still be higher up the field.

Age: 19
Position: Midfielder
Club: Kansas City Current
Country: USA

Hutton's days as a teenager are dwindling, but her bright career as a pro and U.S. international is only just beginning.

She is the starting defensive midfielder and a key cog for what might become the best NWSL team in history. Hutton is a brave, two-way midfielder who can protect the back line with crunching tackles and spark the attack with progressive passes.

Gab Marcotti and Craig Burley explain the struggle to balance making Club World Cup games available for the global audience with making it safe for the players. (2:52)

A committee working on behalf of U.S. Soccer has recommended that men's college soccer switch to a season that stretches across the full academic year beginning fall 2026.

The recommendation comes after U.S. Soccer tasked the 17-person ""NexGen College Soccer Committee"" with finding solutions to evolve college soccer to, among other things, better prepare players to turn professional and compete at the international level.

The committee recommended that more time is needed to evaluate the best future construct of women's college soccer, although the result could be the same recommendation as the men's game. Regardless of how the college game evolves, the committee said in its report, which was released on Thursday, that it ""believes strongly that any of these [four proposed] options are far superior to the status quo.""

Any changes, which still need clear the major hurdle of NCAA approval, would overhaul a college soccer system that has historically served as a development pathway for American pro players -- especially women -- but has not evolved with the modern professional game. Longstanding issues with college soccer include a truncated season played entirely in the fall, which puts heavy demand on athletes during that time and leaves them largely without competition for most of the year.

""The recommendations were designed to be able to deliver a better student athlete experience, to be able to provide financial stability, and to provide player development opportunities -- which are the three things that everyone in college sports said they wanted,"" U.S. Soccer CEO and secretary general JT Batson told ESPN. ""We're optimistic for this to be able to move at pace.""

Batson was not part of the committee. Dan Helfrich, principal and former CEO of Deloitte Consulting, chaired the group, which included club and league leaders from MLS, NWSL and USL, as well as athletic directors and a school president, among other stakeholders.

Under the proposal for men's soccer, all 213 Division 1 men's programs would still compete for the same championship, but in place of their traditional conferences, they would play regionally and within tiers of similarly competitive teams. Those tiers could change over time in a system similar to promotion and relegation.

Preliminary estimates in the committee's report say that such a system could save programs $25,000 to $350,000 annually in operational costs depending on their current travel. Many current conferences, driven by college football, have been realigned with disregard for geography, creating cross-country trips for in-conference games.

Helfrich said two major ""pain points"" for college soccer are the condensed schedules that limit athlete recovery, as well as increasing costs associated with travel and preseason starting prior to convocation of schools.

-How Berhalter revived Chicago Fire after USMNT fired him
-Pochettino's turnaround has USMNT no longer dreading World Cup
-NWSL U-19 ranking: Thompson, Hutton lead top young players

""The ultimate solution is a response to that,"" he said.

The changes would only apply to NCAA Division 1 soccer.

Preseason would begin in mid-to-late August and the regular season would run until April, with a break from games and training in December and January. Games would largely be played on weekends, rather than the current structure of jamming multiple games into each week between August and December.

A championship would be played in May, which Helfrich said would give it a greater platform by not overlapping other college championships. That, too, Helfrich said, would have commercial benefits and give college soccer a greater platform for fan support, media visibility and sponsorship.

This proposed model would be better for everyone in college soccer, Helfrich said, not just the select few who are chasing professional careers.

""The experiences and the implications on all 14,000-15,000 Division 1 American soccer players, versus the hundreds that will or could play professionally, was a dominant part of the committee's debate,"" Helfrich told ESPN. ""That was front of mind always: How do we make sure the solutions that we build are thoughtful to both of those constituencies?""

The 17-person committee held mostly virtual meetings every few weeks this year to work on the proposal and analyze four different potential options for college soccer's evolution. The most conservative option that was analyzed, which could still happen on the women's side, is a slightly expanded fall season with an added spring competition for elite teams.

Federation president Cindy Parlow Cone, who won three NCAA titles at North Carolina in addition to winning a World Cup and a pair of Olympic gold medals, initially brought the idea to Batson & VP of strategy Emily Cosler to see how the federation could help. Cone had been speaking with University of North Carolina athletic director Bubba Cunningham about the team's budget and realized how unsustainable it was in the current model. That was Cone's first ""What if?"" moment.

The women's game is unique in several ways, including that it's much larger at the college level with 350 D-1 programs -- and the gap in quality between the national contenders and mid-major schools is much wider.

Batson said it is ""a huge red flag"" that American women's players in that college age range (roughly 18-22 years old) are not playing the same number of minutes as their peers in Europe.

Cone and Helfrich both said they hope to have a recommendation in place to implement in women's college soccer for the 2027-28 academic year.

""There are more challenges on the women's side, so we feel like we needed to have more discussions, more learnings there, until we put out, 'this is best for the women's game,'"" Cone told ESPN. ""It could be different from the men's game. It could be exactly the same. But we need to take a look at it, as Emma [Hayes, USWNT coach] likes to say, through the female lens. There's still more to do there, so we are going to do that work.""

The next challenge in the entire process is the NCAA, which has historically been slow to evolve and included significant bureaucratic red tape, as evidenced with how women's college basketball had to force structural changes in recent years. There have been major overhauls of late in the NIL (name, image, likeness) era, however, which has left everyone at U.S. Soccer confident that these changes could be implemented quickly. Cone said everyone in the process is ""leaning in.""

Helfrich said the next step in the men's college soccer process should be the committee holding formal conversations with NCAA soccer sub-committees in the coming weeks, and that wider group drafting legislative proposals and timelines before the end of the calendar year. The goal is to have the new system launch next August.

""I will tell you confidently that neither the conferences nor the NCAA will be surprised by this release, because we've been collaborative,"" Helfrich said. ""Part of the reason we've done that is to create a smoother on-ramp to governance conversations.""

Among the ideas in the proposal is increased flexibility around player eligibility, which is specifically a pain point in soccer, where players sometimes turn professional as teenagers and sacrifice their college eligibility. The ideas include a ""second chance"" pathway for players have a stalled professional career, as well as increased opportunities with professional teams without sacrificing college eligibility.

These proposals come at a time when development leagues continue to sprout up in the U.S. MLS Next and multiple tiers of USL already exist on the men's side, while the NWSL has said it plans to launch a second division in the coming years, in addition to WPSL Pro -- which combined would add over 1,000 new professional roster spots on the women's side.

U.S. Soccer believes these can all co-exist with college soccer -- and that the federation's responsibility is to unite them.

""It's an example of when you bring all of the parts of the American soccer ecosystem together, you can come up with ways to drive greater impact and greater outcomes,"" Batson said. ""The American soccer market has grown tremendously over the last couple of decades.

""However, there's a lot of fragmentation. The role of U.S. Soccer here is one of a convener, an aligner, and ultimately our goal is to catalyze that great energy into the outcomes that everyone cares about. We want soccer everywhere in this country, and we want our teams to win. We are now a soccer country.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

COLUMBUS – The Columbus Crew and U.S. Soccer announced today the that 17-year-old Crew Academy striker Chase Adams has been named to the United States Under-17 Men's National Team's roster for the 2025 FIFA U-17 World Cup held in Doha, Qatar.

A native of Naperville, Ill., Adams most recently joined the national team camp in Fayetteville, Ga. in preparation for the FIFA U-17 World Cup. He also represented the team in Noordwijk, Netherlands as they played two friendly matches against Netherlands.

During the Concacaf U-17 World Cup Qualifiers, Adams was named to the Best XI and earned best-player honors. He finished the competition as the top scorer after tallying 10 goals against U.S. Virgin Islands in a World Cup Qualifying match on Feb. 11. Adams scored again four days later against Cuba to bring his total to 11 goals in just two matches as the team topped Group F.

Adams earns the opportunity after his first double-digit scoring season in MLS NEXT Pro, when he led Crew 2 with 10 goals in 1,582 minutes while adding two assists.

ATLANTA (Oct. 16, 2025) – Twenty-four players have been called up to the U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team training camp outside of Philadelphia, Pa. that will run from Oct. 20-28. From Oct. 20-23, the camp will run concurrently with the U.S. Women's National Team's time in Philadelphia so U.S. head coach Emma Hayes and her staff can observe trainings. The U-23s will also attend the USA vs. Portugal match on Oct. 23 at Subaru Park in Chester, Pa. The U-23s will stay in the Philadelphia area to train after the USWNT leaves for Connecticut and then Kansas City to finish its October slate of matches.

The U-23 programming in Philadelphia is another step in U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes' emphasis on this age group and its importance along the player pathway to the full National Team. This will be the third USWNT training camp of the year to feature concurrent programming with the U-23s, following camps in Los Angeles and Denver. Hayes also held a “Futures Camp” last January alongside the USWNT in Florida. Orlando Pride assistant coach Yolanda Thomas will serve as head coach for this camp.

Eight players on the USA's October training camp roster have seen time with the U.S. U-23s this year or attended January's “Futures Camp,” a clear example of the symbiosis with the senior side. 

“We've been preparing players to not only help us qualify for the 2027 World Cup but also with a view to the ‘28 Olympics and beyond, and this is one of the reasons the Under-23 program is so valuable,” said Hayes. “Along with the senior team roster, we want to prepare 50-plus players every camp so there is dual messaging, exposure to our principles of play and the alignment around our framework. The great thing about this is when players move among the two teams in the system, there is clarity and hopefully a better understanding of what is expected at the highest level.”

This U.S. U-23 WNT roster features players with five birth years ranging from 2006 to 2002, which is the age cut-off for players to be a part of the U.S. U-23 WNT this year. 

Goalkeepers (3): Liz Beardsley (Houston Dash; Lakeland, Fla.), Leah Freeman (Bay FC; Berkeley, Calif.), Neeku Purcell (Seattle Reign; Seattle, Wash.)

ATLANTA, GA – U.S. Soccer and the NextGen College Soccer Committee (NGCS) released a comprehensive white paper outlining recommendations to modernize Division I men's and women's college soccer.

This is a critical step toward ensuring the sport's continued relevance, sustainability, and impact within the broader U.S. Soccer ecosystem. The NextGen White Paper, developed over the past year with input from college athletic directors, coaches, players, professional league executives, and governance leaders, provides a roadmap to align college soccer with today's rapidly changing athletic and professional landscape.

“This isn't about rewriting college soccer, it's about renewing it,” said JT Batson, CEO of U.S. Soccer. “The goal is simple: keep what's great, improve what's not, and make sure the system works for today's student-athletes and tomorrow's game.”

For decades, college soccer has been one of the most important player development platforms in the United States, producing generations of players, coaches, referees, and administrators who have shaped the sport at every level. The recommendations, which span competition structure, scheduling, and operational alignment, aim to strengthen that foundation while adapting to new realities such as NIL, conference realignment, and expanded professional leagues.

“College soccer has had a massive impact in developing generations of players, coaches, and leaders across the sport, but with the game evolving rapidly on both the men's and women's side of the game we need to proactively determine changes that will have a positive impact,” said Cindy Parlow Cone, President of U.S. Soccer. “That's why U.S. Soccer is committed to helping college soccer modernize and strengthen its role within the development pathway, while still providing student-athletes the educational and community experiences that make the college game so special. These recommendations are the first step in working together with people across all levels of the game to build out a roadmap that ensures college soccer continues to thrive for years to come.”

The NextGen College Soccer Committee, composed of 17 leaders across college athletics, professional soccer, and business, was convened by U.S. Soccer to ensure a diversity of perspectives guided the process. The Committee anchored on three core outcomes: ensuring academic, physical, and mental well-being of student-athletes, strengthening the financial position of institutions, and enhancing the identification and development of elite players. The recommendations call for:

“Our job was to listen, analyze, debate, and recommend,” said Dan Helfrich, Chair of the NextGen Committee and former CEO at Deloitte Consulting. “The result isn't disruption for disruption's sake. It's a modernization plan that strengthens well-being, reduces costs, and creates new opportunities for growth. If we do this right, college soccer will thrive for decades and serve as a model for other sports facing similar pressures and opportunities.”

The release of the white paper marks the beginning of a broader movement, not the end of the conversation. In the coming months, U.S. Soccer and the Committee will collaborate with the NCAA, conferences, and institutions to translate recommendations into actionable policy proposals and pilot programs, with implementation targeted for the 2026–27 academic year.

United States President Donald Trump has taken aim at the city of Boston over safety concerns ahead of FIFA World Cup 2026 football fixtures.

By News Agencies and Kevin Hand

United States President Donald Trump has threatened to relocate FIFA World Cup 2026 matches set to be played next year in suburban Boston, after suggesting that parts of the city had been “taken over” by unrest.

Foxborough, Massachusetts, home to the NFL's New England Patriots and about 48km (30 miles) from Boston, is set to stage matches as the US cohosts the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada. Trump was asked about Boston's Mayor Michelle Wu, a Democrat whom he called “intelligent” but “radical left”.

“We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup games. “I love the people of Boston, and I know the games are sold out. But your mayor is not good.”

Trump has previously made similar threats against San Francisco and Seattle. He repeated his Boston threats on Wednesday.

Trump has previously suggested he could declare cities “not safe” for the 104-game football tournament and alter a detailed hosting plan that FIFA confirmed in 2022. It includes games at NFL stadiums near New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

World Cup host sites aren't up to Trump. The 11 US cities – plus three in Mexico and two in Canada – are contracted with FIFA, which would face significant logistical and legal issues to make changes in the eight months before the June 11 kickoff.

“It's FIFA's tournament, FIFA's jurisdiction, FIFA makes those decisions,” the football body's vice president Victor Montagliani said earlier this month at a sports business conference in London.

The organisation seemed to soften its stance somewhat on Wednesday, saying in a statement that “safety and security are the top priorities at all FIFA events worldwide” and noting that precautions are “obviously the governments' responsibility, and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety”.

“We hope every one of our 16 Host Cities will be ready to successfully host and fulfil all necessary requirements,” the FIFA statement added.

Trump has insisted that “if somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni – the head of FIFA who's phenomenal – and I would say, ‘Let's move into another location', and they would do that.”

The president meant FIFA head Gianni Infantino, a close ally. Trump said Infantino “wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily”.

Speaking on a local podcast on Wednesday, Wu questioned how Trump could take away the games with less than a year to go. She said most everything is already “locked down by contract” so no single person “even if they live in the White House currently can undo it”.

“There's no ability to take away the World Cup games,” Wu said. “There's no real threat when it comes to saying cities are so unsafe that they can't host the games.”

Among the seven matches that will be played at Gillette Stadium in the Boston suburb of Foxborough will be five group stage matches, one match in the round of 32, and a quarterfinal match on July 9, 2026. The news of so many big games was a surprise to local organisers.

“The later in the tournament, the more eyeballs,” said Mike Loynd, head of Boston's World Cup organising committee, when the schedule was announced last year. “For us, it's just a matter of excitement. … For us, it's a perfect schedule. I don't think FIFA could have done a better job.”

The tournament is expected to bring $1.1bn in local economic impact, create over 5,000 jobs, and generate more than $60m of tax revenue throughout the region, according to organisers. They also expect that more than two million visitors will come to New England throughout the tournament's 39-day span.

Gillette Stadium is operated by Robert Kraft, who owns the NFL's New England Patriots and Major League Soccer's New England Revolution.

Kraft served as honorary chair of the United Bid Committee to help bring the World Cup back to the US. In a 2024 interview on the podcast The Breakfast Club, he described himself as a “social friend” of Trump beginning in the 1990s shortly after he purchased the Patriots. He said in that interview that the only donation he'd ever made to Trump was a “strong donation to his inauguration” following his 2016 election.

But Kraft also gifted the president a diamond-encrusted Super Bowl ring during his first term after the Patriots won the NFL's championship to cap the 2016 season. Sitting presidents typically receive gifts from sports teams during celebratory White House visits — a personalised jersey is standard — but Kraft gave Trump a ring as well, the team confirmed at the time.

Kraft decided after the team's April 2017 visit to have a ring made for Trump so he would have something special to display in his presidential library, the team said. But Kraft said in that same 2024 Breakfast Club interview that he hadn't spoken to Trump since the January 6, 2021 attack by Trump supporters on the US Capitol.

Boston and its mayor have been frequent targets of the Trump administration for much of the year.

Trump and his allies have focused their attacks on the city's so-called sanctuary city polices and how much police should support deportations. In September, the Trump administration sued the city, arguing its sanctuary city policies are illegal under federal law and the city's refusal to cooperate with immigration authorities has resulted in the release of dangerous criminals who should be deported.

The Trump administration has already deployed US National Guard troops to Washington and Memphis, and efforts to do so in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, have sparked legal fights. Democratic and Republican leaders across Massachusetts have pushed back against the National Guard deployment in Boston, and Wu, who is running unopposed for re-election, often cites the city's historical low crime rates.

Wu touts the fact that gun violence fell to the lowest level on record in her first year in office and has continued to decline. Boston saw a historical low number of homicides in 2024, a total 24 — but the city has surpassed that number so far in 2025 with 27, the police department said.

Colin Udoh reveals the role he played in 'helping' Nigeria secure a World Cup play-off place after their 4-0 win over Benin. (1:47)

South Africa's 3-0 win over Rwanda that booked them a place in the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico was not only a strong footballing performance but also a symbol of the resilience that coach Hugo Broos has instilled in the team.

Bafana Bafana faced a self-made crisis heading into the final game, as they trailed Benin by two points at the top of Group C. After relinquishing top spot by having their March win over Lesotho overturned for fielding the ineligible Teboho Mokoena, they dropped two more points in a 0-0 draw with Zimbabwe on Saturday.

However, Benin 's 4-0 defeat by Nigeria left Bafana with a fighting chance: Victory over Rwanda was all they needed to progress. In the past, this is the sort of opportunity that South Africa had become accustomed to squandering.

When Broos watched Bafana Bafana lose a decisive 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier to Sudan five years ago, when they needed only a draw to make the tournament in Cameroon, he saw a team backed by a relative abundance of resources but foiled by a lack of mental fortitude.

That match led to the departure of his predecessor, Molefi Ntseki, and the Belgian's subsequent appointment as head coach. Almost five years later, he has delivered on his mission to overhaul Bafana Bafana's belief in their own abilities -- with his focus on youth paying off.

""I saw the game against Sudan, and Bafana Bafana needed only one point, and when I see the way they played the game there in Sudan... I couldn't understand it,"" Broos told ESPN in 2021 after making early progress in changing the results and culture of the team. ""You go until the end -- until you die -- but you need that point. This was not the mentality I saw.

""So then I started to see who was playing. There were so many players of 27, 28, 29 years old. Afterwards, there was someone who was telling me: 'Yes, coach, but those players are experienced.'

""I said: 'Yes, that's right, but if you do not play the younger players, then when are they going to have experience?'

""So, therefore, I started also with young players who had quality. This is the first thing they need to have, and that's why we have such good results.""

That process has now paid dividends, with a dominant performance led by young players who were cool, calm and collected from the first whistle to the last. Bafana led 2-0 at halftime, courtesy of a long-range Thalente Mbatha strike and a curling finish by Oswin Appollis, before Evidence Makgopa's 72nd-minute header sealed the win that saw South Africa qualify for their fourth World Cup -- and their first since they hosted the tournament in 2010.

Broos, alone, cannot take credit for the development of players such as Mbatha, Appollis and Makgopa -- Orlando Pirates stars in their mid-20s -- but the former Cameroon head coach, who won the 2017 AFCON against all odds, was a driving force for South Africa's nationwide shift in attitudes towards young players. Makgopa, in particular, was a beneficiary, as he scored a brace on his Bafana Bafana debut in Broos' first match in charge -- a 3-2 win over Uganda in June 2021. Then at Baroka FC, Makgopa had not been fancied to lead the line at international level, but Broos took a chance on him and it paid off.

Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns -- the two dominant clubs in South Africa over the past decade -- also deserve their fair share of credit.

Sundowns have invested heavily under the ownership of Confederation of African Football president Patrice Motsepe, who bought a controlling stake in 2003 and then the remaining shares the following year. However, the culture of the club changed specifically during Pitso Mosimane's tenure as head coach from 2012 to 2020.

Off the back of a disappointing spell in charge of Bafana Bafana, a reinvigorated Mosimane led Sundowns to their first CAF Champions League title in 2016 -- only the second by a South African club; Pirates previously won it in 1995.

That triumph -- and Sundowns' dominance of the South African Premiership under Mosimane and successors Manqoba Mngqithi, Rhulani Mokwena and Miguel Cardoso -- forced their rivals to level up and take continental competitions more seriously.

None could quite match the financial might of Sundowns, but Pirates improved their talent development and recruitment structures -- and their streamlined squad has closed the gap on a Sundowns side now struggling with fatigue and player discontent after the FIFA Club World Cup, a tournament that saw them impress on the global stage but face struggles keeping their players away from prying eyes elsewhere in the world.

Broos has often encouraged Bafana Bafana players to move overseas, but facing an injury crisis heading into a decisive qualifier, he started with an entirely locally-based XI. South Africa started five Sundowns players -- Ronwen Williams, Khuliso Mudau, Aubrey Modiba, Mokoena and Thapelo Morena -- five Pirates players -- Mbatha, Appollis, Makgopa, Nkosinathi Sibisi and Sipho Mbule -- and one from TS Galaxy, Khulumani Ndamane.

That, alone, speaks volumes of the quality in South Africa's club football.

However, this is nothing new.

What is new -- first and foremost -- is the apparent end of the days when South African players were viewed as too comfortable and pampered to win when the going got tough.

Having finished third at AFCON 2023 in Ivory Coast, Bafana are among the favorites for the tournament in Morocco in December and January. At the World Cup, the goal will be to make the knockout rounds for the first time.

The qualification campaign exposed that the South African Football Association still has a long way to go before it can offer Bafana the support they need to reach their full potential; but if the mentality in the upper echelons of the organization still needs to change, the players and coach are now embodiments of the promise of what South African football is capable of being.","{'href': 'https://africa.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Josh Lawless

The precedent set for moving the Olympics has been revealed amid Donald Trump's threat to move the Games and the World Cup next year if he sees fit.

The United States will host 78 games in the showpiece which they will stage alongside Mexico and Canada, including the final at MetLife Stadium.

It follows on from the US hosting the Club World Cup won by Chelsea in the summer of 2025, and precedes the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.

Advert

President Trump was front and centre at the Club World Cup final and has a strong relationship with FIFA President Gianni Infantino.

But on two occasions in recent times, the 79-year-old has threatened to take World Cup games away from host cities.

His threats in September focused on Seattle and San Francisco following recent demonstrations, as he said, ""If any city we think is going to be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup ... because they're playing in so many cities, we won't allow it. We'll move it around a little bit. But I hope that's not going to happen.”

Trump said the cities are ""run by radical left lunatics and that don't know what they're doing"" and recently turned his attention to Boston.

Advert

On Tuesday, Trump was asked about Boston in a press event following a ""street takeover” where police officers were attacked and a police car was set alight.

He was also asked if he would work with Michelle Wu, the Democratic mayor of Boston, but proceeded to criticise her.

""We could take them away,” Trump said in regards to possible moving of World Cup games.

“Their mayor is not good … She's radical left, and they're taking over parts of Boston. That's a pretty big statement, right?”

Advert

He added: “If someone is doing a bad job, and I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni [Infantino], the head of Fifa, who is phenomenal, and say let's move it to another location.

“And he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it. Very easily, he'd do it.”

Wu has responded by stressing that FIFA's host cities are ""locked down by contract so that no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it"".

Advert

Indeed, while there is public government involvement, is is technically a private business deal that Trump does not have the authority to get involved with.

Trump also touched on the Olympics, which takes place in Los Angeles in 2028. LA were awarded the Olympics in 2017 and need to raise $7 billion for the event, which is set to bring 15 million visitors.

But when City of Angels was ravaged by wildfires earlier this year, there were calls for Trump to move the Games elsewhere in the US - though it would not be his decision alone as he would have to consult the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

“If I thought LA was not going to be prepared properly, I would move it to another location if I had to,” Trump explained.

Advert

“On that one I'd probably have to get a different kind of a permission, but we would do that.”

In August, Trump signed an executive order to create a White House taskforce who will focus on smoothing out any issues related to the Games, including security, visas for athletes and coaches and transportation.

In the past the Olympics have been cancelled due to wars, while the Tokyo 2020 showpiece was postponed a year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

But you have to go back to 1908 for the last time host cities changed. Rome were slated to host the event but the eruption of Mount Vesuvius led to it being moved to London

LA is also a World Cup host city, while the SoFi Stadium in Inglewood is pencilled in for the Super Bowl in 2027.

FC Bayern München 

News

Double anniversary

Thu | 16/10/25 | 14:03

Postponed doesn't mean cancelled: After Herbert Hainer was unable to attend the milestone anniversaries of the ‘Wildenau' (25 years) and the ‘Stiftland Bazis Schönkirch' (20 years) fan clubs in the summer due to the Club World Cup in the USA, the FCB president's visit was simply rescheduled and made into a large joint celebration. Hainer got involved by wielding the baton as conductor while the brass band played. ""It was a wonderful day, very much in the Bavarian spirit, with an atmosphere like at the Oktoberfest. I felt very much at home,"" said the president, who joined in the celebrations for several hours and answered questions, posed for selfies and signed autographs: ""Our fans, especially in Bavaria, carry this club.""

Under the watchful eyes of the two fan club chairmen Marcus Fritsch and Markus Preisinger, Hainer signed the Golden Book of the market town of Plößberg, three hours away from Munich, and thanked them for their invitation and hospitality. ""Anyone born a Bayern fan can count themselves lucky,"" he said, speaking from the heart of those present: he himself had always been a fan of the Reds, ever since the days of Franz Beckenbauer, he said during the event, ""and I just love the way people have been passionate about this unique club for generations. I applaud the tireless commitment of the fans. I can only quote the fan anthem again and again with enthusiasm: 'Onwards and upwards, FC Bayern!' Nothing is possible without the fans.""

25 and 20 years ago respectively, when the two fan clubs were founded, FC Bayern was a traditional German club with great national appeal, Hainer said, pointing out the joint development: The club management led by Uli Hoeneß and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge established the supporting pillars of financial solidity, down-to-earth values and strong regional roots. On this basis, FC Bayern became a global brand, ""while at the same time never forgetting where the foundation stands: our fans, especially in the Munich area, carry this club. That much was evident again today at this doubl celebration.""

FC Bayern now has over 410,000 members and 330,000 fan club members worldwide, making it the largest club in the world, and Hainer stressed: ""This popularity doesn't come about by itself"" - the club has established many dialogue formats and introduced a volunteer programme called 'PACK MA'S', among other things, which allows members to actively get involved in the club. Among other things, the 'Stiftland Bazis' fan club has already hosted the German record champions' touring exhibition 'FC Bayern during National Socialism: Victims, Followers, Perpetrators' which explores the club's history during the Nazi era.

“It's important to me that our club maintains a dialogue with its fans, in all its facets, especially as you always take important input back to Säbener Straße. That's what I stand for with the entire executive committee"", emphasised Hainer again and again. The two fan clubs had even organised Meisterschalen and Champions League trophies specially for the resident's visit - a glittering backdrop for a glittering event.

The FC Bayern Show in Berlin was a special evening for members and fans alike:

...

Trent Alexander-Arnold's move to Real Madrid was one of the standout stories of the summer, but his first few months in Spain have been anything but straightforward. After a mixed start to life in La Liga, the former Liverpool defender is edging closer to a return from injury, offering Real Madrid a timely boost ahead of a hectic schedule.

Since completing his £10 million transfer to Real Madrid in June, Alexander-Arnold has faced the demanding expectations that come with joining one of Europe's elite clubs. Initially set to arrive on a free transfer at the end of his Liverpool contract, Madrid moved swiftly to pay a small fee to ensure he could participate in the FIFA Club World Cup.

The England international has made ten appearances across all competitions for Real Madrid, showcasing glimpses of his trademark passing range and attacking influence. However, his adaptation to Xabi Alonso's tactical system has required patience, with the 27-year-old starting only two La Liga matches before a hamstring injury halted his progress in mid-September.

Photo IMAGO

Alexander-Arnold sustained the injury during Madrid's 2-1 Champions League victory over Marseille, leaving the pitch visibly frustrated after just 23 minutes. The setback ruled him out of five consecutive fixtures, including key domestic and European encounters.

Real Madrid's medical department initially feared a longer absence, with the right-back a doubt for the Champions League clash against his former club Liverpool on 4 November. However, recent developments suggest his recovery is progressing ahead of schedule.

During the international break, Alexander-Arnold was spotted back in light training at Valdebebas, participating in individual drills and short passing sessions. The player also shared updates on Instagram, including a photo of himself on the training pitch and another giving a thumbs-up from an ice bath — a sign of his growing confidence in his recovery.

According to reports from Spain, Real Madrid's medical team are cautiously optimistic that Alexander-Arnold could be fit in time for El Clásico against Barcelona on 26 October. His inclusion in such a high-profile fixture would mark a major milestone in his return to full fitness.

Madrid face a demanding run of fixtures following the international break — away to Getafe on 19 October, at home to Juventus in the Champions League three days later, then Valencia at the Bernabéu on 1 November. Should his recovery continue without complications, Alexander-Arnold could play a part in at least one of those matches before the anticipated reunion with Liverpool at Anfield.

A potential return to his former home would undoubtedly be emotional. Alexander-Arnold spent over a decade at Liverpool, rising through the academy to become a central figure in the club's modern era of success. His decision to join Real Madrid marked the end of an iconic chapter, and his comeback game could see him face the team he once captained on European nights.

For Madrid, his recovery could not come at a better time. Xabi Alonso's side have managed well in his absence but are aware of how Alexander-Arnold's creativity and composure can elevate their play. With Real Madrid battling on multiple fronts, the England star's availability could prove decisive in the weeks ahead.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

U.S. President Donald Trump reveals that the draw for the 2026 World Cup will take place at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. (1:21)

FIFA has acknowledged that the United States government has the final say on determining the safety of World Cup host cities.

The news comes after U.S. president Donald Trump said FIFA president Gianni Infantino would ""very easily"" move 2026 World Cup matches away from designated host cities if Trump asked him to.

Trump also indicated he would seek to move the 2028 Olympic Games away from Los Angeles if he felt the city was not safe.

The U.S. president has previously spoken about moving World Cup matches away from what he deemed ""dangerous"" cities, previously naming Seattle and San Francisco.

""Safety and security are the top priorities at all FIFA events worldwide,"" a FIFA spokesperson said. ""Safety and security are obviously the governments' responsibility and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety.

""We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to successfully host and fulfil all necessary requirements.""

On Thursday, Trump said there had been ""street takeovers"" in Boston and claimed FIFA would move matches for next summer's finals if he asked.

""If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there are unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, 'Let's move it to another location',"" he told reporters in the U.S. on Tuesday.

""And he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily.

""He'd do it and this is the right time to do it.

""I could say the same thing for the Olympics. If I thought L.A. was not going to be prepared properly, I would move it to another location.

""If I had to on that one, I'd probably have to get a different kind of a permission, but we would do that.""

FIFA president Infantino has developed a close relationship with Trump and most recently attended a Middle East peace summit alongside him in Egypt earlier this week.

FIFA vice president Victor Montagliani said ""FIFA makes those decisions"" when asked earlier this month about Trump's original threat to move matches.

Montagliani told Leaders Week London: ""With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them and football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans.""

FIFA is understood to believe there are no issues with any of the 16 host cities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

A spokesperson for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said in response to Trump's comments: ""The Olympic Games LA28 have the full support of the President of the United States, the Governor of California and the Mayor of Los Angeles.

""All of them are being extremely helpful in the preparations for these Games. This is mirrored on the operational level of the administration. There are three years to go and we are confident that LA28 will be great Olympic Games.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

United States President Donald Trump has taken aim at the city of Boston over safety concerns ahead of FIFA World Cup 2026 football fixtures.

United States President Donald Trump has threatened to relocate FIFA World Cup 2026 matches set to be played next year in suburban Boston, after suggesting that parts of the city had been “taken over” by unrest.

Foxborough, Massachusetts, home to the NFL's New England Patriots and about 48km (30 miles) from Boston, is set to stage matches as the US cohosts the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada. Trump was asked about Boston's Mayor Michelle Wu, a Democrat whom he called “intelligent” but “radical left”.

“We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup games. “I love the people of Boston, and I know the games are sold out. But your mayor is not good.”

Trump has previously made similar threats against San Francisco and Seattle. He repeated his Boston threats on Wednesday.

Trump has previously suggested he could declare cities “not safe” for the 104-game football tournament and alter a detailed hosting plan that FIFA confirmed in 2022. It includes games at NFL stadiums near New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

World Cup host sites aren't up to Trump. The 11 US cities – plus three in Mexico and two in Canada – are contracted with FIFA, which would face significant logistical and legal issues to make changes in the eight months before the June 11 kickoff.

“It's FIFA's tournament, FIFA's jurisdiction, FIFA makes those decisions,” the football body's vice president Victor Montagliani said earlier this month at a sports business conference in London.

The organisation seemed to soften its stance somewhat on Wednesday, saying in a statement that “safety and security are the top priorities at all FIFA events worldwide” and noting that precautions are “obviously the governments' responsibility, and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety”.

“We hope every one of our 16 Host Cities will be ready to successfully host and fulfil all necessary requirements,” the FIFA statement added.

Trump has insisted that “if somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni – the head of FIFA who's phenomenal – and I would say, ‘Let's move into another location', and they would do that.”

The president meant FIFA head Gianni Infantino, a close ally. Trump said Infantino “wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily”.

Speaking on a local podcast on Wednesday, Wu questioned how Trump could take away the games with less than a year to go. She said most everything is already “locked down by contract” so no single person “even if they live in the White House currently can undo it”.

“There's no ability to take away the World Cup games,” Wu said. “There's no real threat when it comes to saying cities are so unsafe that they can't host the games.”

Among the seven matches that will be played at Gillette Stadium in the Boston suburb of Foxborough will be five group stage matches, one match in the round of 32, and a quarterfinal match on July 9, 2026. The news of so many big games was a surprise to local organisers.

“The later in the tournament, the more eyeballs,” said Mike Loynd, head of Boston's World Cup organising committee, when the schedule was announced last year. “For us, it's just a matter of excitement. … For us, it's a perfect schedule. I don't think FIFA could have done a better job.”

The tournament is expected to bring $1.1bn in local economic impact, create over 5,000 jobs, and generate more than $60m of tax revenue throughout the region, according to organisers. They also expect that more than two million visitors will come to New England throughout the tournament's 39-day span.

Gillette Stadium is operated by Robert Kraft, who owns the NFL's New England Patriots and Major League Soccer's New England Revolution.

Kraft served as honorary chair of the United Bid Committee to help bring the World Cup back to the US. In a 2024 interview on the podcast The Breakfast Club, he described himself as a “social friend” of Trump beginning in the 1990s shortly after he purchased the Patriots. He said in that interview that the only donation he'd ever made to Trump was a “strong donation to his inauguration” following his 2016 election.

But Kraft also gifted the president a diamond-encrusted Super Bowl ring during his first term after the Patriots won the NFL's championship to cap the 2016 season. Sitting presidents typically receive gifts from sports teams during celebratory White House visits — a personalised jersey is standard — but Kraft gave Trump a ring as well, the team confirmed at the time.

Kraft decided after the team's April 2017 visit to have a ring made for Trump so he would have something special to display in his presidential library, the team said. But Kraft said in that same 2024 Breakfast Club interview that he hadn't spoken to Trump since the January 6, 2021 attack by Trump supporters on the US Capitol.

Boston and its mayor have been frequent targets of the Trump administration for much of the year.

Trump and his allies have focused their attacks on the city's so-called sanctuary city polices and how much police should support deportations. In September, the Trump administration sued the city, arguing its sanctuary city policies are illegal under federal law and the city's refusal to cooperate with immigration authorities has resulted in the release of dangerous criminals who should be deported.

The Trump administration has already deployed US National Guard troops to Washington and Memphis, and efforts to do so in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, have sparked legal fights. Democratic and Republican leaders across Massachusetts have pushed back against the National Guard deployment in Boston, and Wu, who is running unopposed for re-election, often cites the city's historical low crime rates.

Wu touts the fact that gun violence fell to the lowest level on record in her first year in office and has continued to decline. Boston saw a historical low number of homicides in 2024, a total 24 — but the city has surpassed that number so far in 2025 with 27, the police department said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","1M World Cup tickets bought during first window. Here's when to sign up again.","https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/worldcup/2025/10/16/world-cup-tickets-second-buying-phase-october/86726228007/","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 16:32:17 GMT","

Over 1 million tickets for the FIFA World Cup were sold during the first buying phase in the VISA Presale Draw, the soccer organizing body announced on Thursday, Oct. 16.

FIFA says fans from the three host nations – the United States, Canada and Mexico – ""have been at the front of the queue, snapping up more tickets than anyone else.""

England, Germany, Brazil, Spain, Colombia, Argentina and France round out the Top 10 countries in terms of ticket sales, while fans from 212 countries and territories have already purchased tickets.

While fans have experienced long waiting times to purchase tickets and seen exorbitant ticket prices on third-party websites, FIFA says about 6 million tickets will be available for the World Cup with three more ticket-buying phases later this year.

The tournament begins at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City on June 11, 2026, and will end with the final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey on July 19, 2026.

So far, 28 of the 48 teams have qualified for the World Cup as of Oct. 15.

""As national teams across the globe compete for a place at the historic FIFA World Cup 26, I am thrilled so many football-loving fans also want to be part of this watershed event in North America,"" FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a statement.

""Today, we celebrate the sale of more than 1 million FIFA World Cup tickets following the Visa Presale Draw. It's an incredible response, and a wonderful sign that the biggest, most inclusive FIFA World Cup in history is capturing the imagination of supporters everywhere. Already, tickets have been purchased by fans in over 200 countries and territories, led by our enthusiastic hosts in Canada, Mexico and the United States of America.""

Phase 2 to sign up to buy tickets will be during the Early Ticket Draw, which is Oct. 27-31. Fans will be informed in mid-November to early December when they can purchase tickets.

Similar to the first phase, this will consist of an application, followed by a randomized selection process. Successful applicants will receive a time slot to purchase tickets (subject to availability).

Single-match tickets to all 104 games, along with venue- and team-specific tickets will be available during this draw.

Phase 3 will coincide shortly after the Dec. 5 World Cup Draw, where all 48 teams will be placed in groups and the matchups will be set.

During this phase, fans will be able to submit applications for specific matches after the final draw has revealed most of the group-stage matchups.

More than 4.5 million people signed up for the Visa Presale Draw from Sept. 10 to 19, including 1.5 million on the first day.

FIFA began sending emails to fans who were not selected for the Visa Presale Draw on Wednesday, Oct. 15.

The email read: ""Dear Football Fan, thank you for your interest in purchasing FIFA World Cup 26™ tickets during the Visa Presale Draw. Unfortunately, your entry was unsuccessful, and you have not been allocated a time slot to purchase tickets during this sales phase.""","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

President Donald Trump's threats to relocate matches scheduled in the Boston-area for the 2026 FIFA World Cup could become a reality after the international soccer organization said that the U.S. government has the final say when it comes to the safety of host cities. 

A FIFA spokesperson told ESPN that governments have final say in deciding ""what is in the best interest for public safety.""

""Safety and security are the top priorities at all FIFA events worldwide,"" the spokesperson told the outlet. ""Safety and security are obviously the governments' responsibility, and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety.

""We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to successfully host and fulfill all necessary requirements.""

Fox News Digital reached out to FIFA for comment. 

The situation surrounding Boston's standing as one of the host cities for next year's tournament began this week when Trump suggested that he would have games moved out of Boston while discussing an incident that occurred in the city this week when a group of people took over one of the city's streets in a violent display. 

""We can take them away. I love the people of Boston. And I know the games are sold out, but the mayor is not good. There are worse than her. At least she's intelligent. You know, some are extremely low IQ. Those bother me more. She's intelligent, but she's radical left,"" Trump said of Boston Mayor Michelle Wu.

TRUMP REPEATS THREAT TO MOVE WORLD CUP GAMES AWAY FROM BOSTON AFTER MAYOR BOASTS CURRENT HOSTING RIGHTS

The president added that he could call on FIFA President Gianni Infantino to make the relocation happen if he felt it was necessary. 

""The answer is yes, if somebody's doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location,' and he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it – very easily he'd do it. And this is the right time to do it."" 

Trump doubled down on his threat Wednesday, adding that, ""We have the right to do that with FIFA"" if the city doesn't ""straighten it out."" 

""If we think there's any reason that, whether it's Boston or anywhere else, that they're not doing their job, we're going to take those World Cup games and move them someplace else.""

North America's World Cup is going to be a crypto-fueled mess.

FIFA is already one of the most corrupt, greedy, and short-sighted governing bodies in sports — but even they've found a way to top themselves. With the 2026 FIFA World Cup set to take place in the United States, Mexico and Canada in 2026 information about the ticketing process is being revealed, and it's the most disgusting, money-grabbing mess imaginable. It's so bad that I hope fans will boycott the event to ensure it looks like the farce it is.

Tickets to a global sporting event like the World Cup were always going to be high, but FIFA is pushing those figures into the stratosphere. Every single stage of the event is being priced out for sports fans, with tickets being offered for prices that vastly exceed what they were in Qatar for 2022.

For example, a first round match at Qatar would have set you back anywhere from $11 USD in the low-cost fan section, which represents a tiny fraction of tickets sold — then escalating to the highest price tickets costing $200 USD. For the next World Cup those same affordable fan tickets are rising to $60 each, a 545% increase. Again, these are for a tiny fraction of the stadium known for not really being attainable because it requires a lottery.

So, what's the next cheapest seat you can buy? $200. Yep, the most expensive group stage ticket in Qatar is now the cheapest option in North America — and this is only for games featuring teams people don't really want to see. If there's a specific team you're hoping to catch, then good luck. The majority of seats for the first game featuring the USMNT are selling for the $2,700, with many selling for even more than that.

This is because FIFA is introducing what it's calling “variable pricing,” similar to booking an Uber during a surge period. Instead of simply pricing the event and adding on a premium for, say, England vs. France — instead they're waiting to see what the demand for tickets is going to be, and then pricing tickets accordingly. FIFA's idea is: If you don't pay it, someone else will — and who cares if soccer fans can't afford it?

If this sounds extremely shitty, it's because it is. Don't worry though, because it gets much, much worse.

For the first time ever FIFA is selling RTB vouchers, or “Right to Buy.” These are vouchers which grant you the ability to then purchase a guaranteed ticket for a game. It's an NFT of course, because FIFA decided to make this as obnoxious as possible.

Right now you can go onto their official website and purchase an NFT for a quarter final game in Kansas City with prices starting at $549. Once again, this is not a ticket — and does not get you entry. It's just a voucher giving you the right to buy a ticket at a price set by FIFA at a later date.

This is one of the cheaper options. Semi-final vouchers in Dallas begin at $1,196 — and because greedy crypto chuds got in on this, there are NFTs for New York City starting at a cool $100,000.

Let's go back to this Kansas City example. Let's say you've purchased your dumb NFT for $549, because that's the only way to get a ticket. Then as the event approaches you get an email from FIFA saying you can now buy your ticket for the quarter final for $4,000. You decide that's too expensive, because of course it is. Don't worry, because you can re-sell your NFT through the FIFA site and perhaps recoup your money! The bad news is that FIFA is taking a 15% transaction fee on every resold RTB token.

These unbelievably ghoulish morons have turned the simple process of buying a ticket for an event into a cryptocurrency scheme. It's almost as if a global sporting event was organized by someone who pays for a checkmark on Twitter.

FIFA is ensuring it's going to be impossible for anyone in an average income bracket to take their family to the World Cup. If you assume two adults and two kids, and we'll pick a non-elite market like Seattle, and the group stage. Out of the gate the cheapest option right now is to purchase two NFTs for June 26 and $244 — for a total of $488. No idea what time the game is, forget who's playing. You luck out and get two teams nobody cares about, because this keeps the price lower. It will now cost that family of four a minimum of $1,288. That is the absolute best-case scenario. These are for the cheapest seats, to the cheapest game, outside of a giant market.

Every ounce of excitement I had for this next World Cup is gone. Instead it's been replaced with a white-hot passion to see all this stupidity go down in flames.

Global soccer body FIFA issued a statement to multiple news outlets on Wednesday confirming the U.S. government has the ability to move 2026 World Cup matches amid recent comments from President Donald Trump regarding host city safety.

Question marks surrounding moving World Cup games—78 of 104 are slated to take place in the U.S. next year—have arisen as Trump has questioned the safety of cities including Boston and Chicago. FIFA, seemingly going against comments made by vice president Victor Montagliani, sided with the U.S. government and Trump in a new statement.

“Safety and security are the top priorities at all FIFA events worldwide. Safety and security are obviously the governments' responsibility, and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety. We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to successfully host and fulfill all necessary requirements,” FIFA said to The Athletic among others.

Montagliani, also president of Concacaf, had previously said FIFA holds “jurisdiction” around moving games. “With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them and football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans,” he said.

The U.S. president turned his attention to Boston and city mayor Michelle Wu on Tuesday during a meeting with Argentinian President Javier Milei. “We can take them away. I love the people of Boston. And I know the games are sold out, but the mayor is not good,” Trump said.

“... If somebody's doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni [Infantino], the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location,' and he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it, very easily he'd do it. And this is the right time to do it.”

Mayor Wu responded to Trump's remarks on “Java with Jimmy” this past Wednesday.

“Much of it is locked down by contract so that no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it,” Wu said. “We're in a world where for drama, for control, for pushing the boundaries ... ongoing threats ... are issued to individuals and communities who refuse to back down and comply or be obedient to a hateful agenda.“

President Trump first cast doubt over World Cup host cities in September, saying, “It will be safe for the World Cup. If I think it isn't safe, we'll move it to a different city. Absolutely ... it's actually a very fair question. If I think it's not safe, we're going to move it out of that city.”

It remains unclear how the U.S. government and/or FIFA would go about moving games, which cities would serve as secondary locations and more. The World Cup group stage draw is set to take place Friday, Dec. 5 at the John F. Kennedy Center in Washington D.C.

MIAMI (AP) — More than 1 million tickets have already been sold for next year's World Cup, FIFA said Thursday in its first update on numbers since the official start of sales began earlier this month.

The highest demand, as would be expected, were from buyers in the US, Canada, and Mexico — the three nations that will play host to the tournament. FIFA said people from 212 different countries and territories have already purchased, even though only 28 of the 48 spots in the field have been filled.

Rounding out the top-10 countries in terms of tickets purchased already: England, Germany, Brazil, Spain, Colombia, Argentina and France, in order, FIFA said. The tournament runs from June 11 through July 19.

“As national teams across the globe compete for a place at the historic FIFA World Cup 26, I am thrilled so many football-loving fans also want to be part of this watershed event in North America,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a release.

He added, “It's an incredible response, and a wonderful sign that the biggest, most inclusive FIFA World Cup in history is capturing the imagination of supporters everywhere.”

FIFA did not reveal any specific figures about how many tickets have been sold for certain matches, or offer any breakdowns by host site.

The buyers who purchased the tickets in this first round of availability were selected out of 4.5 million applicants in a lottery that took place last month. The entry period for the next draw will open to fans on Oct. 27, FIFA said, noting that single-match tickets to all 104 games, along with venue- and team-specific tickets, will be released.

Based on the listed stadium attendance figures, there are roughly 7.1 million seats to fill for the 104 matches for the tournament around 16 North American venues. It is unknown how many of those seats will be available for sale to the public.

Ticket data has shown that the lowest-priced seats — set at $60 — were available for at least 40 matches. Most matches, and almost all seats, were set at a much higher price. The opening match for the U.S., to be played at Inglewood, California, had prices ranging from $560 to $2,735 when sales opened.

Fans with the option to purchase could choose seats in one of four categories; Category 1 is the best seats, Category 4 is somewhere around the tops of stadiums. Ticket costs are expected to fluctuate as soccer's biggest event utilizes dynamic pricing for the first time.

Winners in the second phase of the ticket draw will be able to purchase from mid-November to early December. A third phase, termed a random selection draw, will start after the final draw of teams on Dec. 5 determines the World Cup schedule.

Tickets also will be available closer to the tournament “on a first-come, first-served basis.” FIFA also said Thursday that it has opened its official resale platform for tickets.

World Cup 2026

Countdown

President Donald Trump's suggestion that he could move 2026 World Cup games out of U.S. cities he deems unsafe rippled through soccer and political circles in late September. Then he doubled down in mid-October, repeating his assertions.

The idea, previously unexplored, was first raised by a reporter at the White House and entertained by Trump. It sparked a wide range of reactions, many tinged with confusion, because the U.S. government had no official role in choosing World Cup host cities; and it does not have any explicit authority to relocate World Cup games.

Nonetheless, Trump's comments elicited responses from host city mayors and World Cup organizers. Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell ripped Trump's “ignorance,” and said in a statement: “We're working every day to make the World Cup a safe, welcoming, and fun experience.”

The following is a rundown of what else has been said and whether games could actually be moved.

Trump did not proactively make the suggestion. In fact, he initially seemed to resist it. During a press session in the Oval Office, when the reporter prefaced his question with “immigration, crime and the World Cup,” Trump interjected with a hint of humor: “That's a lot — that's a lot of questions.”

The reporter continued: “You have a number of cities that are pushing back against your immigration and deportation, as well as your crime initiatives.”

Trump interjected again: “I don't think they're very much pushing back at all.”

The reporter went on: “But some of those cities have World Cup games. Seattle, San Francisco.”

Trump cut him off yet again: “They're gonna be very secure.”

But the reporter continued: “Could those games move if they don't cooperate with your crime initiatives and your immigration initiatives?”

Trump then spoke for two minutes and 45 seconds. He began: “Well, that's an interesting suggestion. I guess. But we're gonna make sure they're safe.”

He continued on a tangent about cities who, he said, are “run by radical left lunatics that don't know what they're doing.” He spoke about Washington, D.C., which is not hosting World Cup games. He spoke about Memphis and Chicago. “It will be safe for the World Cup,” he said, despite both Memphis and Chicago also being uninvolved. (Chicago pulled out of the running for World Cup games during the bid phase, citing “FIFA's inflexibility” and taxpayer risk.)

“If I think it isn't safe, we'll move it into a different city, absolutely,” Trump said. “It's actually a very fair question. If I think it's not safe, we're going to move it out of that city.”

He then went on another tangent about JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, who has accused Trump of deploying National Guard troops to Democrat-controlled cities in an effort to exert “authoritarian” control ahead of next year's midterm elections.

Trump concluded: “If any city we think is gonna be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup … we won't allow it to go to [those cities], we'll move it around a little bit. But I hope that's not going to happen.”

When repeating his remarks in another Oval Office media session, Trump said he would call in a personal favor with FIFA president Gianni Infantino.

“If I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni — the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal — and I would say, ‘let's move it to another location,' and he would do that.” Trump said. “He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily.”

The World Cup is owned and operated by FIFA, soccer's global governing body. FIFA, years ago, signed “host city agreements” and “stadium agreements” with entities in various U.S. markets, and chose 11 of them — plus three in Mexico and two in Canada — to host games.

The federal government, meanwhile, signed various declarations and guarantees when the three North American countries were bidding to host the World Cup back in 2018, during the first Trump administration. But it had no role in selecting the cities or negotiating their contracts, which were originally signed in 2017 and updated with addendums in 2022.

“The federal government is not a direct party to these agreements,” Nathan O'Malley, an attorney at Musick, Peeler & Garrett and co-leader of the firm's Olympics & World Cup practice group, told The Athletic.

Trump, therefore, cannot unilaterally cancel those contracts and move games to other cities.

The contracts, some of which have been obtained via public records requests, do require cities to implement robust security and public safety measures. If FIFA deems a city unsafe, it could, potentially, terminate the agreements and relocate matches. Trump, in theory, could pressure FIFA to do so.

But leaders in most or all 11 cities have stated their confidence in the security plans being developed.

“Public safety officials, including our Republican-appointed Police Board, are working daily to ensure the games in Kansas City are safe for all,” Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas told The Athletic in a statement via a spokeswoman. “I am confident in their work. FIFA loves Kansas City and Kansas City loves FIFA. We'll be fine.”

Trump has a direct line to FIFA's president, his “great friend” Infantino, who has publicly supported and praised Trump repeatedly. In December will bring the World Cup Draw to Washington, D.C., largely so that Trump can be involved.

Trump, in theory, could leverage this relationship and push Infantino to pull games out of cities whose mayors resist him, which is what he insinuated in his Oct. 14 remarks. It's unclear how Infantino and FIFA would respond. After the initial suggestion, FIFA did not give a statement, but in responding to a query from The Athletic following Trump's doubling-down, a FIFA spokesperson said, “Safety and security are of the utmost importance at all FIFA events worldwide and it is ultimately the government's responsibility to decide what's in the best interest of public safety. We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to fulfill all necessary requirements for a successful 2026 World Cup.”

Trump's other potential lever is the $625 million in security funds that Congress allocated to World Cup cities this summer. That money will be split proportionally — not equally — among the 11 U.S. host cities, depending on their needs. The cities will submit their costs and requests for reimbursement, according to Andrew Giuliani, head of the White House's World Cup task force. It's unclear if Trump, who chairs the task force, could potentially politicize and withhold some of that funding.

Trump has clashed with Democratic mayors throughout his second term over immigration policy and other topics. His latest push is on crime. After his federal takeover of D.C., he has threatened to send troops to Chicago and other cities, even as many mayors and governors say that crime is not out of control and federal assistance is not necessary or welcome.

The World Cup host cities in left-leaning states with Democratic mayors that Trump could target would include Seattle, San Francisco and the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Boston. Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas and Kansas City are also led by Democrats. The U.S. men's national team is due to play its group games in L.A. and Seattle.

At this stage, eight-and-a-half months out from the World Cup opener, finding new host cities would be unrealistic. The 11 chosen cities have already spent years preparing for matches and adjacent events, plus the thousands of visitors they'll bring. It would be extremely difficult for a 12th city to cram all that planning into eight months. And especially after the Dec. 5 draw, relocation would anger fans and teams who've planned travel to a specific city.

Perhaps some of the 11 cities could take on additional games, if one or two cities were forced out of the rotation. But even that would be a massive disruption. FIFA set the World Cup schedule, complete with dates and locations, in 2024. It has already sold hospitality packages to specific stadiums, and opened ticket sales earlier this month.

According to one person briefed on the planning efforts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose details, FIFA has previously told local organizers that it will not be relocating games.

The 11 U.S. cities and stadiums slated to host the 2026 World Cup are:

In Mexico, Monterrey, Guadalajara and Mexico City are the three hosts. The two in Canada are Toronto and Vancouver.

Most mayoral offices and local World Cup host committees have declined to comment or did not respond to The Athletic's inquiries. Representatives in a few cities, however, have spoken.

Harrell's words were the strongest. Seattle's mayor said in a statement published on his website: “President Trump continues to display his ignorance about our city. We are doing the hard work to prepare for this once-in-a-generation opportunity to welcome the world to Seattle.

“The facts are clear: violent crime is down 20% in Seattle. We are making record-breaking progress on police hiring with nearly 130 officers hired this year. My proposed 2026 budget also makes additional investments in safety preparations for the World Cup, including new removable vehicle barriers at Pike Place Market and Seattle Center campus.

“While we are doing our part to make safety improvements ahead of hosting games, the Trump administration has made our city less safe by withholding critical funding for counterterrorism tools. While the City's lawsuit has successfully released a portion of this funding, President Trump's words about safety don't align with his administration's actions.

“We're working every day to make the World Cup a safe, welcoming, and fun experience for both residents and visitors to our city and will continue to advance plans with local partners to ensure we make the most of this special event.”

A spokesperson for Harrell had previously told KOMO News: “While the president continues to peddle baseless, divisive, and empty threats, our administration is doing the hard work to prepare for this opportunity. We're working every day to make the 2026 World Cup a safe, welcoming, and fun experience for residents and visitors. We're advancing plans with FIFA and local partners to ensure Seattle is a destination and that we make the most of this special event.”

Hana Tadesse, a spokeswoman for the Seattle World Cup host committee, wrote in a statement to The Athletic: “We are committed to ensuring a safe, welcoming, and memorable experience for fans, players, visitors, and residents alike. Since being selected by FIFA as a host city, we've worked closely with them, the White House Task Force for FIFA World Cup 26, community partners, and law enforcement, and are confident in our planning and coordination in advance of next summer's matches. Seattle looks forward to shining on the world stage and hosting an event that is not only spectacular, but safe for all.”

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, who has previously said that “Boston will not back down” from the Trump administration amid legal threats over immigration policies, initially said in response to a question about Trump's World Cup comments: “We are very excited for the summer that Boston will have next year. It's going to be an incredible show of what our city's made of as we welcome people from all over the world [for the World Cup and other events]. We are very proud, and hold ourselves to the high standards of being the safest major city in the country. And that takes work every day, but we have the record and the results to prove it.”

With Boston specifically targeted in Trump's latest threat, Wu simply said, “Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions.”

Natalie Hamilton, a spokeswoman for the New York/New Jersey host committee, wrote in a statement to The Athletic: “Formal agreements are in place between each Host City and FIFA, and we continue to work closely with FIFA and our local, state, and federal partners to ensure a safe and secure tournament, which remains our top priority. Planning for World Cup is already underway, and we are fully committed to delivering an unforgettable tournament that this country, and this region, will be proud of well beyond 2026.”

Philadelphia Soccer 2026 said in a statement to The Athletic: “We appreciate President Trump's commitment to safety and security for this global event, and we share that same commitment, as do our colleagues across the nation. Safety is paramount to the City of Philadelphia, and we have every confidence in the significant planning that is ongoing between City, State, and Federal officials as well as the White House Task Force. Just as Philadelphia was for the political conventions, Papal Visit and NFL Draft, we will be ready to welcome the world and deliver a safe, exceptional experience for fans and residents alike.”

There was more than just a hint of excitement in the air as the final stages of the match at Liberty Stadium approached in January 2013. The score was 0-0 between the home team Swansea City and Champions League holders Chelsea. But with the Swans having won the first leg of their League Cup semi-final 2-0 at Stamford Bridge, they were within touching distance of preparing for a final appearance at Wembley.

Time was running out for the Blues when the ball rolled out of play in the 79th minute, and uperstar Eden Hazard, at the time one of the best players in the world, ran after the ball to try and keep the game moving.

Shortly afterwards, television pictures showed a ball boy writhing in pain on the ground while the Belgian forward was shown a red card. It quickly became clear that Hazard had kicked the 17-year-old boy in the stomach as he threw himself on the ball to waste time, and the sending-off was justified on the grounds of violent conduct.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Valentin Vacherot's storybook run to the Rolex Shanghai Masters title was even crazier than the result itself.

Never in ATP Masters 1000 series history had a player ranked as low as Vacherot, then No. 204 in the PIF ATP Rankings, won a title. The 26-year-old had only earned one ATP Tour match victory before the tournament and in the second round of qualifying he was two points from defeat against Liam Draxil.

Vacherot's girlfriend, Emily Snyder, explained that behind the scenes there were plenty more interesting moments that made the Monagesque player's movie-like run even more riveting.

It started at Wimbledon, where Vacherot took a tumble on the grass during the first round of qualifying against Hamish Stewart, retiring during the second set. At the time, there was concern he had torn his ACL.

But Vacherot was able to return to action a month later, competing in several ATP Challenger Tour events, including one at the Rafa Nadal Academy by Movistar at the end of August. Shortly thereafter, Snyder messaged one of Vacherot's best friends about his progress.

“Shanghai doesn't know what's coming,” she wrote. “Shanghai he's making QF.”

Little did Snyder know what was coming. There was some uncertainty about whether she would join her partner in China because Vacherot was originally outside of the qualifying cut. But once they were there, one of the most improbable runs in the sport's history began.

After battling through qualifying, Vacherot joined his cousin, Arthur Rinderknech, in the main draw. Vacherot would play one day and then the next, Rinderknech would try to join him in the next round.

On days when Rinderknech played, Vacherot and his team would sit in the Frenchman's box. The group included coach and half-brother, Benjamin Balleret. 

“We would go watch Arthur's match. Arthur's match would finish. We would go all together to the [same] Italian restaurant because Arthur was only traveling with one other guy,” Snyder said. “For a lot of the other matches, Ben — Val's coach and half brother — would come, and he would sit and almost kind of be like a coach for Arthur, too.”

On 2 October, as Vacherot prepared to face 14th seed Alexander Bublik, he went with Snyder to Yuyuan Garden, a beautiful area to go shopping in the evening. They went for dinner and to the area near The Bund after. It was Golden Week in China, so there were many people on the streets and it was difficult to find a taxi.



The only method they had to pay for one was Vacherot's phone, which was down to five per cent. By the time they ultimately got back to the hotel, it was at one per cent. That was a “phew” moment. The next day Vacherot upset Bublik and his breakthrough tournament was becoming increasingly notable. The World No. 204 was playing at a significantly higher level than that.

“Every single night, we would get back to the hotel, and we would both just stand and stare at each other and then start laughing,” Snyder said. “We would be like, ‘Are we in a dream? Is this real life?'”

At the same time, Snyder faced a dilemma. Her transit visa was only good for 10 days and she had planned to visit a friend in Singapore.

But as Vacherot continued moving through the tournament, Snyder cancelled flights day after day until he defeated Tallon Griekspoor in the fourth round. At that point, she needed to leave the country for an evening.

“At 4 a.m. after he beat Griekspoor, we were sitting there and he was like, ‘Okay, you have to take a flight. We have to figure out where to go. What's the cheapest? What's the closest?'” Snyder recalled. “But honestly to some extent, it was such a routine that it had been happening so much that it was like, ‘Okay, what flight are we booking today?' Because almost every single day we were changing a flight or booking a new flight. And he's pretty calm in those situations. He doesn't really panic. It's more so me, that I [was] panicked.”

Snyder eventually flew to Osaka for a night and woke up early the next morning to return to China. After traveling back, there was barely enough time to get back to site for Vacherot's quarter-final match against Holger Rune. Another day, another win for the underdog story of the season.

“I think what helped the entire time. It was one match at a time,” Snyder said. “I've always asked him whenever we're watching other people play, I'll be like, ‘What would be going through your head at this moment?'” Snyder said. “And he [said] at any moment, during any match, he would usually say if he's winning, that he would probably be more stressed about keeping up the break instead of the opposite. 

“He's like, ‘You have nothing to lose if you're down, whereas if you're winning, then there's maybe a little bit more pressure, a little bit more stress'.”



That was a fitting mindset for Vacherot's tournament. He lost the first set in six of his nine matches and won them all.

“The entire time Val was like, ‘I have nothing to lose. I've made it this far, why would I stop now?'” recalled Snyder.

Vacherot never stopped, making history in Shanghai. Although he nor Snyder knew it at the time, they both were superstitious during the tournament. 

Shortly after the final, Snyder told Vacherot she used the same toilet every day to avoid changing things up.

“Then he tells me, ‘I'm not even kidding you, I used the same exact shower every single day, twice a day, same shower',” Snyder said. “On the car rides to and from the hotel, me, his coach, we all sat in the same exact seats. We refused to change it.  We were like, ‘Okay, routine is working, we're not going to change anything'.”

Everything led up to this moment… ⁰⁰Arthur & Valentin, what a magical story ❤️⁰⁰#ItAllAddsUp | #RolexShanghaiMasters pic.twitter.com/ortZfXbDIt

That certainly worked. They returned home to Monte-Carlo on Monday, more than three years after they met at a Monaco bar during the summer of 2022. Snyder was studying abroad in Barcelona — she attended the University of North Carolina — when she took a weekend trip to Monaco. Vacherot was only at the bar that evening because he was injured, struggling with a stress fracture in his foot.

When they arrived at the local airport, Vacherot's family members and closest friends from high school surprised him. On Tuesday when they went for lunch, three people stopped Vacherot after watching what he had accomplished in Shanghai. There was also a celebration at the Monte-Carlo Country Club, including a visit from Prince Albert II.

“Even now that we're back, I don't think it's hit either of us fully, what actually has happened,” Snyder said. “And obviously the fact that it was [with] his cousin too, it just makes it even crazier. And the entire time it was routine after routine. Val was supposed to go play five Challengers after Shanghai, which obviously that's not the case now.”

Daniil Medvedev gained revenge against Adam Walton on Thursday at the Almaty Open, where he overcame the Australian 7-5, 7-6(0) to reach the quarter-finals at the ATP 250.

Medvedev lost to the Australian in Cincinnati in August but ensured history would not repeat itself in Kazakhstan. The second seed trailed 1-4 in the second set and fended off four break points in the sixth game of the second set to avoid trailing 1-5.

After holding, Medvedev went on the charge. He upped his depth in the baseline exchanges and struck 12 winners in the second set to advance after one hour and 45 minutes. Medvedev reached the semi-finals in Shanghai and Beijing and has won eight of his past 10 matches. He will next play Fabian Marozsan.

 “It was a very tough match. The game at 1-4, I think I saved four or five break points. It was crucial because then I managed to break back and get back into my rhythm, so I am pleased to have defeated a tough opponent,” said Medvedev, who is level at 1-1 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Walton.

The 29-year-old, chasing his first title since 2023, is up one spot to 14th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and could still qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals for the seventh consecutive year. He trails eighth-placed Lorenzo Musetti by 1025 points. The Italian is in the final qualification spot.

Check out the odds for this weekend's United States Grand Prix, from pole position to the Grand Prix victory.

Formula 1 heads to Austin's Circuit of The Americas as the United States Grand Prix hosts Round 19 of the championship, but what do the odds say about who might come out on top? Read on to find out...

Odds are provided by F1's Official Betting Data Supplier ALT Sports Data, are subject to change and are presented in decimal form: for every $1 wagered you would win the figure represented by the odds; so, if Verstappen is favourite at 1.50, you would win $1.50 for every dollar bet.

Three races have passed since a McLaren driver took the chequered flag first, with Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris not looking quite as dominant as they were.

Since his win at Zandvoort, Piastri has registered a podium, a DNF, and a fourth-place finish, painting a bleak picture compared to his first 15 outings. The Aussie's record in Austin also leaves much to be desired, with one DNF and a fifth-place return in his two visits.

On the other side of the McLaren garage, Norris sits 22 points adrift of Piastri in the Drivers' Championship. COTA hasn't yielded the highest returns for the Brit over the years, but he did thrive in 2023, crossing the line second behind Max Verstappen.

Speaking of Verstappen, he's finding his rhythm in Red Bull's RB21, with four consecutive top-two finishes leading into this weekend – two of those races seeing him grab the lion's share of points.

Mercedes driver George Russell reminded us in Singapore what he is capable of at his best. He's fresh off his second triumph of the year and is tied with Verstappen for the best finishing average in the last five rounds at 3.0.

While you can't discount his chances for top honours, this isn't a Grand Prix at which he has shone in his career; his best result here is two fifth-place outcomes in 2022 and 2023. However, he's proved to be a regular contender for a top-three finish in 2025, collecting eight in 18 rounds.

Ferrari's Charles Leclerc returns to defend his Texan crown after a rocky season in the red car. He's only managed five podiums and remains win-less, but past performances at this venue may excite him. Leclerc has driven onto the rostrum twice in his last three visits.

Podiums have eluded his team mate this year, as Lewis Hamilton remains without any after 18 rounds. Despite his recent run, he's popped onto our radar because Ferrari have put a car inside the top three in the previous three trips to this track.

After a difficult run, Mercedes rookie Kimi Antonelli is finding his groove again with consecutive top-six outings. The Italian has been in this bracket at eight rounds, with the highlight being his third-place return in Montreal.

Carlos Sainz showed in Baku that he can still compete with the best, despite trading Maranello for Grove. It was his only top six to date in a Williams, but he returns to a track where he's joined in the champagne celebrations in his last two appearances.

Consistency hasn't been a strong point for Liam Lawson, but the Kiwi knows how to nudge his way into the top six. He's pulled it off twice in his past eight appearances.

Racing Bulls team mate Isack Hadjar also has two top-six finishes to his name, one of them a brilliant maiden podium at Zandvoort, while another driver to look out for is Alex Albon – a five-time top-six finisher this year.

Double World Champion Fernando Alonso collected his seventh top 10 of the season in Singapore. All seven have arrived in the last 10 rounds, highlighting solid improvements to the AMR25 towards the business end of the campaign.

Lance Stroll has also contributed five top 10s to Aston Martin's cause, with three of them coming in his last seven starts. The issue for the Canadian is consistency, which is highlighted by a 12.40 finishing average in his past five attempts.

Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda has displayed signs of improvement in recent appearances, recording two top 10s in the last four rounds.

Turning to the rookies, Ollie Bearman continues to quietly go about his business, snatching his second top 10 in four starts over in southeast Asia. Another youngster who we're tracking in this category is Gabriel Bortoleto. The Brazilian is a four-time top 10 finisher this season, earning all of them in his last eight Grands Prix.

Four-time reigning World Champion Verstappen will exit the pits for Qualifying with the most pole positions in 2025. The Red Bull star has stopped the clock the fastest in six sessions, one more than title rival Piastri.

Piastri last took pole in the Netherlands, which is better than his team mate, Norris, who previously did it in Belgium. Norris has lifted the Pirelli Pole Position Award four times this season, and he earned the honour here in Austin on his previous trip.

Russell handed Mercedes their second pole position of the year in Singapore, and subsequently their second Grand Prix win. However, he is definitely an outsider to replicate the performance in Texas.

If you're hunting outsiders, then Ferrari is worth a peek after producing the fastest qualifier in two of the past four editions. Sainz did it for the Italian team in 2022, and Leclerc followed suit in 2023. Leclerc has one pole position in the bank this term, which he captured in Hungary.

McLaren have typically headed the Teams' odds sheet this year, but they haven't produced the victorious car in the past three rounds. Austin also hasn't proven a happy hunting ground for them in over a decade, last putting up the winning car in 2012, which happened to be Hamilton's final triumph for the team.

Red Bull have looked like a much-improved outfit in the previous four rounds, prevailing in 50% of them. They also have history on their side, with three victories in Texas since 2021.

Ferrari are the defending winners, but they haven't properly challenged for top honours since Monaco, when Leclerc had a shot at toppling Norris. Besides that, they've had to settle for the minor podium places and points.

Mercedes check into the Lone Star State after winning 50% of the previous 10 races on this circuit. The last one arrived in 2019, courtesy of Valtteri Bottas. However, the outfit are in high spirits after claiming their second victory of the term a fortnight ago.

A step between tyre compounds will add another element to the mix for drivers and teams at the upcoming United States and Mexico City Grands Prix.

Pirelli Director of Motorsport Mario Isola has explained the thinking behind the manufacturer's split tyre compound choices for the next two rounds of the season in the United States and Mexico, with the move aimed at mixing up race strategies.

Austin is the second venue that Pirelli are bringing non-consecutive compounds to this season (the last being Spa-Francorchamps for the Belgian Grand Prix), and the available tyres will again be the C1 as the hard, the C3 as the medium and the C4 as the soft.

A week later in Mexico City, the Italian supplier will provide the C2 as the hard, the C4 as the medium and the C5 as the soft, given the different characteristics and demands of the Circuit of The Americas and the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.

It compares to the traditional method of Pirelli picking three consecutive compounds out of their slick-tyre range: in 2025, from hardest to softest, that being the C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 and C6.

Speaking after those choices were confirmed, Isola opened up on Pirelli's goals with the step approach and what was learned from the first test in Belgium – even if adverse weather conditions impacted the weekend.

“It's difficult to come to a conclusion for Spa where we had the weather that was not helping at all, but I believe the idea was good, and that's why we decided to have the same approach for Texas and Mexico where we skip a compound between hard and medium,” said Isola.

“Basically, the target is always the same: to have a variation in strategies and to have teams planning a one-stop or two-stop, so different approaches to the race.

“We made some simulations, and we believe that creating a bigger gap between the hard and the medium means that if one team wants to use the hard and target a one-stop race, they are penalised by a slower tyre. While if a team wants to be aggressive, and that means moving to a two-stop strategy, at that time you can use the medium and the soft that are faster.

“So, this is the approach, and for Mexico and Austin we believe we can try this solution again.”

Elaborating on that belief, and why Austin and Mexico City were chosen as the next two events with a jump in compounds, Isola continued: “Because of the simulation we were running with our modelling department that is telling us the two-stop strategy is slightly quicker than the one-stop.

""Usually, if you have a one-stop and two-stop that are very close in terms of total race time, the teams choose a one-stop. They don't want to take a risk of an additional pit stop, traffic or a mistake during the stop, so they move in a natural way towards a one-stop race.

“That means in Mexico and Texas we have a simulation telling us the two-stop is a few seconds quicker.”

First practice for the United States Grand Prix, which features the Sprint format, will get under way at 1230 local time on Friday.

With Mercedes confirming George Russell and Kimi Antonelli for 2026, Lawrence Barretto explains whether the squad's line-up is set for the long term.

On the eve of the United States Grand Prix weekend in Austin, Mercedes have confirmed what most had expected – George Russell and Kimi Antonelli will form their line-up for 2026. F1 Correspondent Lawrence Barretto explains more...

Fresh from one of the most convincing wins of his career last time out in Singapore, Russell can stroll into the Austin paddock tomorrow knowing that after months of negotiating, he's all sorted for a drive for next year.

Once Max Verstappen became unavailable, when he confirmed he'd be staying put at Red Bull for 2026, it was always a case of when, not if, Russell would sign on the dotted line to extend his stay at Mercedes that began in 2022.

Williams, Racing Bulls, Haas, McLaren and Aston Martin are all set to run special liveries at the Circuit of The Americas in Austin.

1 / 12

Williams, Racing Bulls, McLaren, Haas and Aston Martin have all shown off special liveries that will adorn their cars at the 2025 United States Grand Prix.

At Williams, the team will pay homage to their 2002 livery, marking the year that title partner Atlassian were established – with Juan Pablo Montoya, who drove for Williams that year alongside Ralf Schumacher, unveiling the colour scheme in Austin.

Racing Bulls, meanwhile, opted for a tortoiseshell look, revealing it alongside multi-platinum singer Shaboozey, with Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson also showing off the team kit for this weekend which will feature the same theme.

Over at Aston Martin, the team's first ever bespoke livery sees them celebrate the “invisible science” of Formula 1, with the AMR25 adorned with mathematical formulas.

2025 Constructors' Champions McLaren went for what they were calling an “iridescent livery enhancement”, which will also feature on their car in Mexico – while American team Haas went for the classic ‘Stars and Stripes' look for Esteban Ocon and Ollie Bearman's VF-25s.

Check out all of the liveries in the gallery up top.

As F1 arrives in Austin for the United States Grand Prix, Need to Know is your all-in-one guide with statistics, driving pointers, strategy tips and more.

Formula 1 arrives at Austin's Circuit of The Americas this weekend for Round 19 on the 2025 calendar, the United States Grand Prix.

With the Sprint format in play, Free Practice 1 and Sprint Qualifying will take place on Friday, October 17, followed by the Sprint and Qualifying on Saturday, October 18, and the Grand Prix itself on Sunday, October 19.

Jolyon Palmer, former Renault F1 driver: The Circuit of The Americas is a great track that takes inspiration from parts of other legendary corners on the calendar.

The uphill Turn 1 is difficult at the race start as there are loads of different lines that can be taken, then you sweep through the first sector, which is a bit like Silverstone, where you're trying to find your rhythm.

After that, it's the long back straight and you've got to get your braking point right at the end of it…

Probably the hardest section on the circuit is Turn 13 through to Turn 15, which feels like an odd complex of corners behind the wheel. Turn 13 is conventional, but finding your line through to 15 is not easy, while that Turn 14 area puts a lot of load on the tyres.

You go through the quadruple right-hander after that, followed by Turn 19, which is a really nice corner – though track limits are an issue.

Finally, you stop for Turn 20, then it's a short burst to the line, but drivers need to be careful not to light things up as it's easy to break traction.

There are also plenty of overtaking opportunities during the race with DRS on the run to Turn 12 and Turn 1.

“The United States Grand Prix will be the second race of the season for which Pirelli is bringing three non-consecutive compounds, the last time being Spa-Francorchamps, and the available tyres will once again be the C1 as hard, the C3 as medium and the C4 as soft,” reads Pirelli's weekend preview.

“In Belgium, bad weather meant it was not possible to find out how this choice might have affected strategy, and so the event in COTA could be the first real test of this choice, which sees the use of a harder hard than last year at the American track, while the medium and soft are the same.

“The increased performance difference between the hardest compound and the middle one should, theoretically, give rise to two scenarios.

“If drivers prefer the C1, the slowest but also the most consistent of the three, then they could run a one-stop race combining it with the C3. On the other hand, using the latter along with the C4, with its improved resistance to degradation, would produce quicker lap times but would almost certainly require two stops.

“Another similarity with the Belgian round is that Austin is also running to the Sprint format, which means teams only have one hour to try the various options over long and short runs, which could add to the uncertainty as to how the weekend might pan out.”

While McLaren wrapped up back-to-back Teams' Championships at the Singapore Grand Prix, the race for the Drivers' title is far from settled.

Oscar Piastri arrives in Austin at the top of the standings, but team mate Lando Norris is now just 22 points adrift after gaining ground over the Monza, Baku and Marina Bay weekends.

One driver making even more of a move, though, is reigning four-time World Champion Max Verstappen, who has either won or finished second at the last four races amid an upturn in Red Bull performance.

Verstappen is now a much reduced 63 points behind Piastri, with 174 still up for grabs over the remaining six Grands Prix, which include three Sprints.

Mercedes' George Russell remains mathematically in contention after his supreme Singapore win and stellar 2025 season as a whole, along with Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc, but both would need an extreme turn of events to triumph from here.

However, Russell and Leclerc could both play a key role in the race for second in the Teams' Championship, with Mercedes holding 325 points to Ferrari's 298 and Red Bull's 290.

Elsewhere, Williams are still winning the fight for fifth position, with Carlos Sainz's recent podium and Alex Albon's consistent scoring giving them a solid lead over Racing Bulls and Aston Martin.

The inaugural Austin race back in 2012 was an exhilarating watch, with Lewis Hamilton chasing down Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel in his McLaren.

After Vettel lost momentum behind a backmarker, Hamilton sensed his opportunity to pounce for the lead – and the Briton duly took his chance.

They've conquered your feed, and now they're coming for Hollywood. Meet the digital disrupters and intriguing influencers who are reshaping culture, comedy and celebrity — and turning viral fame into serious real-world clout.


							By 

	Seija Rankin, Editor



	Not long ago, Hollywood set the trends, and social media followed. Now, it's the other way around. The creator economy has become one of the entertainment industry's most powerful engines — fueling studio talent pipelines, driving marketing strategies and redefining what it means to be a star. From Addison Rae's leap to He's All That and Emma Chamberlain's command of the Met Gala carpet alongside traditional actresses to Alix Earle's booming podcast and brand empire, digital fame is increasingly indistinguishable from traditional celebrity. With The Hollywood Reporter‘s second annual Creator A-List, we set out to spotlight the influencers, comedians, models and multihyphenates powering Hollywood's new ecosystem — not just as marketing muscle but as writers, producers and full-fledged brands in their own right. To compile this year's 44 honorees, THR scoured the web for the most influential voices across TikTok, YouTube, Instagram and Facebook. Yes, follower counts and brand deals mattered, as did agency affiliations. But we also searched for something less quantifiable: that rare mix of originality, charisma and creative instinct that separates the strivers from the stars. Throw in Quenlin Blackwell's razor-sharp comedy and Kareem Rahma's viral twist on the celebrity interview, and these are the creators capturing attention, shaping deals and proving that the new fame starts online.


Profiles written by Lexi Carson, Kirsten Chuba, Nicole Fell, McKinley Franklin, Ryan Gajewski, Mia Galuppo, Chris Gardner, Seija Rankin, Carly Thomas, Brande Victorian and Steven Zeitchik.


@alexconsani6.1 million followers on TikTok


	It's a tall task to summarize in 100 words or less why the supermodel, who stands at 6 feet, continues to captivate on every platform (and runway) she touches. Sure, it's the looks (she's been booked by Chanel, Gucci, Stella McCartney, Alexander McQueen, Givenchy, Tom Ford and more), the comedy and the activism (standing up for the trans community), but it's also the unpredictability of what she'll say off-duty that has made her a TikTok must-follow to the tune of 6.1 million. In December, she made history by being crowned model of the year at London's Fashion Awards, becoming the first transgender model to earn the trophy.


@alixearle7.5 million followers on TikTok


	After going viral in 2023 with glamorously chaotic TikToks, Earle, 24, parlayed her fame into Hot Mess, a podcast launched under Alex Cooper's Unwell Network — though that partnership flamed out this year amid reported friction between the two influencers. She's now taking her “hot mess” brand mainstream as a contestant on Dancing With the Stars season 34, twirling alongside pro Valentin Chmerkovskiy.


THE SOCIAL PLATFORM I COULD NEVER LIVE WITHOUT AND THE ONE I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE UP I can't live without TikTok, and I would get rid of Facebook.


THE THING THAT SURPRISES ME MOST ABOUT BEING A CREATOR “Becoming an investor in multiple brands at only 24 years old. That's never something I thought I would be capable of at this age.”


@ameliadimoldenberg3.3 million subscribers on YouTube


	For the 10th anniversary of Chicken Shop Date, the quick-witted Brit dropped a greatest-hits reel of her chicken-fueled flirt sessions with Cher, Billie Eilish, Paul Mescal, Bella Hadid and other stars who came for the nuggets but stayed for the banter. Her cult-y YouTube show launched her onto the Oscars red carpet (as the Academy's official social ambassador) and into brand deals and Time‘s 100 Creators list. Next up: Passenger Princess, a Formula 1-backed series where she learns to drive — on camera, of course.


@bomanizer2.2 million followers on TikTok


	The Canadian creator (also known as Bomanizer) became a pandemic breakout star by spoofing reality TV drama with hilariously over-the-top TikToks inspired by The Real Housewives and Keeping Up With the Kardashians. He's since made the leap to traditional TV with Made for TV, a 2024 mock­umentary on Canadian network Crave that continues his pop-culture sendup streak.


THE PLATFORM I COULD NEVER LIVE WITHOUT “It's kind of random, but Snapchat. I have maintained streaks with my friends, many of which exceed 1,000 days. I feel like my snap streaks keep me and my friends in each other's faces. If we didn't have a snap streak, would we still be friends? It's hard to say.”


@brittany_broski2.6 million subscribers on YouTube


	She first shot to fame in 2019 when a TikTok of her trying kombucha for the first time — and cycling through a series of meme-ready facial expressions — went viral, earning her the nickname “Kombucha Girl.” Since then, she has parlayed that internet fame into a full-fledged media career. Her medieval-themed interview series Royal Court has become a breakout press-tour staple, with celebs like Charli XCX, Saoirse Ronan and David Corenswet donning cloaks and swords to nerd out. (Corenswet's turn went viral for sheer enthusiasm.) She also is signed to Atlantic Records, with two singles out and more music planned for 2026.


	Their podcast may be called Brooke and Connor Make a Podcast, but what they've really made is a Gen Z cult hit. Averick and Wood bounce between pop-culture breakdowns, deadpan tangents and existential spirals — often within the same five minutes — and their clipped, chaotic rapport has struck a chord with chronically online 20-somethings. Averick also has made waves on BookTok and has a debut novel (Phoebe Berman's Gonna Lose It) coming in 2026. Wood's solo TikToks are equal parts sincere and absurd, sometimes in the same sentence — and he's used the success to launch a comedy career, accompanied by a sold-out standup tour. 


THE ONE THING I MISS ABOUT MY LIFE BEFORE I WAS A CREATOR 


AVERICK “My screen time being less than 11 hours a day.” 


CONNOR “I kind of miss my 9-to-5s! I was ultimately fired from every one of them as they weren't a part of my journey.”


@calebsaysthings1.1 million followers on TikTok


	Hearon took a reverse-engineered route to influencer status: stand-up first, social media second. After two unsuccessful Saturday Night Live auditions, Hearon pivoted to posting POV videos on Twitter and stand-up clips on TikTok — and blew up. Since then, he has parlayed that following into a full-on comedy career: the So True With Caleb Hearon podcast, a stand-up tour, an HBO special and roles in Jurassic World: Dominion, Sweethearts and the upcoming Devil Wears Prada sequel.


@delaneyrowe1.1 million followers on Instagram


	Rowe has been making a name for herself online for years, with her spot-on parodies of cinematic tropes like “The scrappy female reporter in every movie who's desperate to get the real story,” and, “The devastating last home video taken of the wife who dies in the beginning of the movie.” Lately, though, she's been showing up offline, too, splitting time between Los Angeles and New York and turning up at industry events and creator collabs — building visibility beyond her feed.


The social platform I could you never live without and the platform would I love to give up Pinterest is my religion. Instagram is like my sleep paralysis demon.


The person whose social media account I'd love to run for a day: Emily Ratajkowski.


The craziest place I've filmed content: My ex's bathroom.


The craziest place I've looked at social media: A funeral.


The one thing I miss about my life before I was a creator: Having my little brothers respect me.


The thing that has most surprised you about being a creator: The self-esteem is has rewarded me. I feel really good about what I can create.




@drewafualo8.2 million followers on TikTok


	Afualo doesn't post — she detonates. With a mix of razor-sharp humor and righteous outrage, she's turned calling out misogyny into a viral art form. Proudly Samoan, she has launched her hit podcast The Comment Section, written The New York Times best-seller LOUD: Accept Nothing Less Than the Life You Deserve and built a Hollywood presence as a red carpet correspondent at major awards shows.


THE ONE THING I MISS ABOUT MY LIFE BEFORE I WAS A CREATOR “Shopping around Trader Joe's without being perceived. Man, oh man, what I would give to loiter in those too-small aisles.”


@druski11 million followers on Instagram


	Druski has built a comedy empire from chaos — recording sketches in airports, at NASCAR events, even in the back of a McDonald's. His YouTube series Coulda Been Records, Coulda Been House and Coulda Been Love blend sketch comedy with livestream culture, often featuring drop-ins from the likes of Kevin Hart, Kai Cenat and other A-listers. “I fucking love this shit,” he says. “Why the fuck would I want to go back and be broke?”


THE PERSON WHOSE SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT I'D LOVE TO RUN FOR A DAY “Leonardo DiCaprio. I want to know who's running his Instagram because it can't be him! There's no chance! He's posting like dogs, cats, birds and trees.”


@dylanefron1.4 million followers on Instagram


	After starting his career as a production coordinator, Efron has parallel-pathed his way to stardom by supplementing his growing reality show appearances (he was a breakout star of The Traitors‘ third season) with his endearing and savvy social media presence. “I grew up pretty private and didn't even have social media until after I graduated college,” he says. “Instagram was the first platform I used, and it made me more comfortable at storytelling and being myself on camera — which led to opportunities like The Traitors and Dancing With the Stars.”


	He since has expanded to TikTok, posting wacky looks into his life — he's often out on a wilderness adventure, and occasionally shirtless while doing so — for millions of viewers. When he taps his A-lister older brother Zac to appear alongside him, the views skyrocket into the tens of millions. Efron says the biggest surprise of creator life is that it's actually fun to be vulnerable: “I think there's a fear that we always want to show success stories, but the best videos are ones that tell the journey of becoming your best.”


THE CRAZIEST PLACE I'VE FILMED CONTENT “Guyana. I shot a documentary on YouTube where my friend and I traveled to a remote village in the heart of the Amazon Rainforest to attempt to catch one of the largest fish in the world and tell a beautiful story of sustainability.”


THE CRAZIEST PLACE I'VE LOOKED AT SOCIAL MEDIA “Rock climbing. It always feels strange picking up my phone and filming or scrolling while on the side of a huge mountain.”


@emmachamberlain12 million subscribers on YouTube


	Chamberlain turned awkward jump cuts and oversharing into an aesthetic — and then into an empire. What began as a YouTube diary of caffeine jitters and self-deprecating chaos helped define Gen Z's online voice and made her one of fashion's most unexpected power players. Today, she runs Chamberlain Coffee, hosts the Anything Goes podcast and regularly partners with Vogue as a Met Gala correspondent while previously repping Louis Vuitton and Cartier on the global stage.


THE THING THAT SURPRISED ME MOST ABOUT BEING A CREATOR “How lonely it can be — I find I experience more nefarious intentions since I began this career.”


@gabby.windey1.5 million followers on Instagram


	Windey first went viral when she and Rachel Recchia were dumped in tandem on The Bachelor season 26 — and then co-led The Bachelorette season 19. She reentered the zeitgeist during season three of The Traitors, but it's her Jennifer Coolidge-esque podcast rants on Long Winded that cemented her status as a full-fledged social media sensation. 


THE ONE THING I MISS ABOUT MY LIFE BEFORE I WAS A CREATOR “Nothing! My life was meaningless before committing to a life of being chronically online.”


@hannah_berner2.9 million followers on TikTok


	After a rocky few seasons on Bravo's Summer House, Berner turned lemons into lemonade, shaking off her reality TV villain title as she and fellow SH alum Paige DeSorbo formed their hit Giggly Squad podcast — leading to a tour, book and the web series Hannah & Paige Try New Things. The 34-year-old also uses her platform — with 1.7 million Instagram followers in addition to her TikTok — to support her blossoming comedy career, posting clips from her nationwide stand-up tour that followed the success of her 2024 Netflix special, We Ride at Dawn.


THE CRAZIEST PLACE I'VE FILMED CONTENT IS “On the toilet.”


@hasanabi3 million followers on Twitch


	He wears a lot of hats: streamer, influencer, left-wing political commentator, TikToker, creator, host, Rutgers graduate and dedicated fitness fanatic, to name a few. On Instagram, where he counts 1.5 million followers, he calls himself simply “Turkish” and “politics guy” and goes live on Twitch nearly daily to dissect politics, culture and current events for his massive audience. Fans — who were eagerly anticipating his planned debate with the late Charlie Kirk — have even suggested he run for office. But as he recently told Wired: “You can't podcast your way out of this problem.”


THE PERSON WHOSE SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT I'D LOVE TO RUN FOR THE DAY “Donald Trump. I feel like I could embody his voice perfectly and solve a lot of the problems he caused.”


@jackhenryrobbins118,000 followers on Instagram


	Robbins — son of Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins — turned “nepo baby” discourse into satirical gold. He created an alter ego based on his own experience and recruited his famous parents, their friends and their friends' kids for scripted videos about Hollywood privilege. That blend of irony and access caught fire: He's now developing a comedy series for Hulu, with PEN15‘s Sam Zvibleman (a non-nepo baby) on board to exec produce.


WHAT SURPRISES ME MOST ABOUT BEING A CREATOR “My nightmare where my parents eat me at the Oscars has only become more frequent since going viral.”


@jack.schlossberg884,000 followers on TikTok


	The 32-year-old Harvard Law grad — and, by the way, JFK's only grandson — uses TikTok to champion voting rights and take bold swings at political targets, including recent jabs at Ryan Murphy's American Love Story, about John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy. Schlossberg slammed the upcoming series as “grotesque,” saying his family was never consulted. He also has moonlighted as Vogue‘s political correspondent during the 2024 election.


THE PERSON WHOSE SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT I'D LOVE TO RUN FOR A DAY “The pope!! I'd make my mother a saint, then I'd pray for J.D. Vance.”


@octopusslover83.8 million followers on TikTok


	A social media favorite for his absurdist humor and pop-culture riffs, Shane, 26, has turned offbeat relatability into a fast-rising career. Since appearing on this list last year, his momentum hasn't slowed. In March, he told THR he hopes to land more onscreen roles — and he's already started, with a guest spot in season four of HBO's Hacks. The New York native wrapped his 36-date Live With Jake Shane comedy tour in July and continues to grow his audience through the comedy podcast Therapuss With Jake Shane, where guests have included Glen Powell and Kaia Gerber.


THE CRAZIEST PLACE I'VE LOOKED AT SOCIAL MEDIA “During therapy, sorry.”


@kareem1.1 million followers on TikTok


	In a time when A-list talent is hesitant to offer any opinion (on anything), Rahma has earned a following by getting the likes of Ethan Hawke, Michael Shannon and Cate Blanchett to share their — albeit usually low-stakes — hot takes from the seat of an active New York City subway car (meaning they always have an audience of random straphangers). With a low concept and even lower production value, Subway Takes debuted only in 2023 and now has 2 million follows on Instagram and 1 million on TikTok and is catching up with other digital-native press stops like Hot Ones and podcasts like Call Her Daddy as places for famous people to hawk their onscreen wares.


	And while Rahma's biggest interviewees have gone from fellow NYC comedians to Oscar hopefuls and would-be box office stars, he continues to showcase his comedy chops in back-and-forths with average subway riders. His reach now extends far beyond entertainment. A July video with Zohran Mamdani covered the New York City mayoral candidate's stance on the city's policing, taxes and homelessness policies, while Rahma took the late Jane Goodall on a subway ride and spent the time talking about environmentalism and the importance of public transit.


BEFORE I BECAME A FULL-TIME CREATOR, I WAS … “A failed entrepreneur.”


THE BIGGEST PERK OF CREATOR LIFE “Having my work be seen by millions of people.”


THE CRAZIEST PLACE I'VE FILMED CONTENT “Inside the Washington Square Park fountain — naked.”


@kaicenat18 million followers on Twitch


	Twitch's most watched creator has turned his channel into a cultural circus, pulling in millions with celebrity skits, all-night gaming sessions and viral marathons like Mafiathon 3, where LeBron James famously gave him a haircut live on camera. In May, he launched Streamer University to mentor up-and-coming creators, and now Hollywood's calling: Cenat will star in the comedy thriller Livestream From Hell, alongside Kevin Hart and Druski. During a recent Hot Ones interview, Cenat advised future streamers: “What's not teachable is being yourself.”


@keith_lee12517 million followers on TikTok


	Going from MMA fighter to food critic isn't what you might call a common career path — but that's what makes Lee's story so compelling. He's turned the discipline he learned in the cage into a mission to uplift the underdog, reviewing mom-and-pop restaurants whose takeout he films from his car and sends viral overnight. With millions of followers across TikTok and Instagram, Lee's no-frills, to-camera reviews have made him one of social media's most trusted — and most unlikely — food critics.


@kinigra2.2 million followers on Facebook


	Deon calls it “cinematic storytelling” — producing full-blown, multicharacter, 20-minute comedy episodes for YouTube and Facebook using a crew trained in traditional TV. Think Tyler Perry for the digital age — a comparison she embraces. With expansion plans that include her own production studio, she's building a media empire without leaving the platforms that launched her.


THE CRAZIEST PLACE I'VE LOOKED AT SOCIAL MEDIA “Not craziest, but most inappropriate? During a heated argument with my husband … about social media. I literally paused the argument, checked my video numbers, then unpaused the argument and picked up where I left off. He was OVER it. I don't do that anymore, I promise.”


@RDCworld17.5 million subscribers on YouTube


	Phillips, co-founder of the sketch collective RDCWorld (Real Dreams Change the World), has built a following with wildly popular parody videos — but his social media habits are more relatable than aspirational. He once checked updates while attending a Lakers playoff game. His personal IG now has 3 million followers, but it's his knack for nailing hyperspecific fan obsessions — from anime logic to NBA locker-room drama — that keeps fans coming back.


@MKBHD20 million subscribers on YouTube


	Known as MKBHD, Brownlee, 31, started posting tech videos in high school — and now ranks among Time‘s 100 most influential people in AI. The Shorty Awards named him creator of the decade, and Trevor Noah recently called him “arguably the most influential person in the world of tech.” His channel has become a go-to for honest product reviews in an ever-evolving space. 


THE ONE THING I MISS ABOUT MY LIFE BEFORE I WAS A CREATOR “Watching a video without thinking about how it was made.”


@blaucomedy2.5 million followers on Facebook


	Blaustein is the current breakout comedian of Facebook, picking up more than 1 million followers just this past year and boasting 3.5 million followers on TikTok and 2 million on Instagram. He's known mostly for crowd work, with a penchant for asking audience members questions that deliver edgy, occasionally over-the-top conversations. His recent viral videos show his fans divulging everything from marrying their dad's friend to running a brothel.


THE CRAZIEST PLACE I'VE EVER FILMED CONTENT “At a Russian mobster's 60th birthday party. They hired me to do a 45-minute stand-up set, which was perfect because we all know how much Russian criminals love to giggle. I made fun of the birthday boy, and he immediately threw a vodka bottle at my head.”


@michellekhare5.3 million subscribers on YouTube


	In Challenge Accepted, she tackles feats that are equal parts physical and psychological — training for a week at the Secret Service Academy for one episode, re-creating Houdini's magic tricks in another. Possibly her biggest recent feat, though, was persuading the Television Academy to submit her YouTube series for the Emmy race. Next up? Re-creating Tom Cruise's Mission: Impossible airplane stunt — no parachute, of course.


@msrachel17 million subscribers on YouTube


	Ms. Rachel (and husband Aron Accurso, a Broadway music director) turned toddler tantrums and speech delays into viral gold with Songs for Littles, their gentle, lo-fi YouTube series packed with sing-alongs, sign language and development-friendly repetition. With parents and therapists singing her praises, Netflix snapped up a batch of episodes this year — and Ms. Rachel quietly became one of its most watched shows. Forget cartoons or Cocomelon: Ms. Rachel is the algorithm's answer to Sesame Street.


@naraazizasmith12 million followers on TikTok


	Smith's glam-meets-homestead lifestyle has captivated TikTok — from slow-pour baking videos to luxury domesticity with husband Lucky Blue Smith and their three (soon to be four) children. With nearly 5 million followers on Instagram, she has built a tradwife empire, complete with dreamy voiceovers, from-scratch meals and artfully curated family life.


THE CRAZIEST PLACE I'VE LOOKED AT SOCIAL MEDIA “Believe it or not, I don't spend that much time scrolling on social media, so usually I go on it at the end of the day in bed.”


@nickdigiovanni29 million subscribers on YouTube


	After becoming the youngest-ever finalist on MasterChef — at the ripe old age of 21 — DiGiovanni pivoted to food-fluencing, posting cooking videos on Instagram. But unlike most of the internet-famous folks of that era, his popularity just continues to grow. These days, he posts food content on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube to more than 50 million combined followers and collaborates with the likes of Selena Gomez, Paris Hilton and Tom Brady. He's also got a cookbook (Knife Drop: Creative Recipes Anyone Can Cook, an instant New York Times best-seller six times over) and a pantry products company to his name, as well as brand partnerships with Google and T-Mobile.


THE ONE THING I MISS ABOUT MY LIFE BEFORE I WAS A CREATOR “Having my privacy while eating at restaurants or out in public.”


@nickycbell362,000 followers on Instagram


	There's no shortage of fashion commentators sharing their opinions online — but few do it with the clarity, confidence and insider know-how of Campbell, who has done time as a menswear editor for Vogue, worked under Thom Browne and served as a director at the CFDA. He's parlayed that extensive résumé into viral red carpet commentary and now hosts the hit chat show Gloves Off, where guests have included everyone from Rita Ora to Lea Michele. 


THE ONE THING I MISS ABOUT MY LIFE BEFORE I WAS A CREATOR “Not being asked to judge everyone's outfit when I meet them.”


@noahbeck33 million followers on TikTok


	Beck became a TikTok star the old-fashioned way — by dancing shirtless. As the most polished member of Sway House (the L.A.-based content frat that ruled the app in 2020), he turned his athlete's abs and boy-next-door charm into a full-blown brand. These days, he's a go-to collaborator for major labels and recently starred in the sports-romance Sidelined: The QB and Me, which already has a sequel on the way.


THE THING THAT SURPRISES ME MOST ABOUT BEING A CREATOR “The amount of PR boxes … so much cardboard.”


@paige_desorbo1.7 million followers on Instagram


	The Summer House breakout known for her dry wit and loungewear obsession left reality TV behind this year — but she's still very much in the spotlight. She co-hosts the hit podcast Giggly Squad with Hannah Berner and recently launched a sleepwear brand, Daphne, which immediately sold out. Now she's channeling her fashion instincts and comedic voice into content that blends trend forecasting with off-the-cuff humor — delivering the kind of high-low fashion commentary that could only come from someone equally obsessed with The Row and reality TV.


THE CRAZIEST PLACE I'VE LOOKED AT SOCIAL MEDIA “A hospital room after I froze my eggs.”


@quenblackwell12.5 million followers on TikTok


	From her early days on Vine as a teenage comedian to becoming one of Gen Z's boldest multi-hyphenates, Blackwell builds content at the intersection of humor, aesthetics and chaos. Her Feeding Starving Celebrities series and its spinoffs blend cooking, celebrity guests and comedic banter — it's one of her standouts but by no means her only lane. She also publishes fashion and lifestyle content, shows up at runway shows and was tapped by PAPER magazine to document Burberry's Fall 2025 showcase. In addition to content, she's booked modeling gigs and a brand partnership with Off-White. 


THE CRAZIEST PLACE I'VE FILMED CONTENT “That would probably be in the hospital when I had a mystery illness. I made a video of me crying and singing, and it went viral.”


@guywithamoviecamera2.7 million followers


	Feldman, 27, is Hollywood's go-to TikTok whisperer — hired by nearly every studio and streamer to create viral behind-the-scenes content. This year, he racked up millions of views filming with the casts of The Summer I Turned Pretty and Superman and walked multiple red carpets, including as a correspondent at the Oscars. He recently stepped behind the camera, directing his first short film, Wait, Your Car?, starring Whitney Peak and Ruby Cruz.


THE SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT I'D LOVE TO RUN FOR THE DAY “Universal Studios. I would post an announcement that they have signed me to a five-picture deal and that I am now in charge of their horror department.”


@mythical51.47 million followers across all platforms


	With Good Mythical Morning, Rhett & Link have built one of YouTube's most enduring empires — 19.4 million subscribers, 4,200-plus episodes and counting. Their studio, Mythical, runs multiple channels with nearly 40 million combined subs and more than 100 employees. They've toured, dropped three best-sellers and run a thriving merch business. Plus, there's that hair!


THE ONE THING WE MISS ABOUT LIFE BEFORE WE WERE CREATORS “There not being a digital record of every bad haircut or outfit we've ever had.”


@rileygbarker1 million followers on Instagram


	Once an All-American swimmer at the University of Kentucky, Gaines became a prominent figure in conservative circles after tying in a meet with trans athlete Lia Thomas. Since then, she has testified before Congress, advised on a Trump administration executive order targeting trans athletes and addressed the 2024 Republican National Convention. A regular on the Turning Point USA speaking circuit, Gaines has become a Gen Z face of a cultural wedge issue — and one of the movement's most high-profile provocateurs. Gaines is also the host of OutKick's Gaines for Girls. 


@sabrina.cinoman.brier866,000 followers on TikTok


	Known for painfully accurate send-ups of zillennial behavior, Brier's sketch characters have gone from viral bits to full-blown IP. She turned her online persona into a multi-voice audiobook (That Friend) for Simon & Schuster and is developing a scripted version with AwesomenessTV. Brier has openly called Abbott Elementary creator and star Quinta Brunson her blueprint — and she's quickly following the same playbook. 


THE THING I MISS MOST ABOUT LIFE BEFORE I WAS A CREATOR “Not hearing my own voice so much that it now haunts me in my sleep.”


@firstwefeast15 million subscribers on YouTube


	With Hot Ones, Evans turned a simple gimmick — interview celebrities while they eat increasingly spicy wings — into a viral juggernaut and a must-stop on many promo tours. Recent guests have included everyone from Bad Bunny to Macaulay Culkin. The spinoff series Hot Ones Versus adds a competitive twist, with guests facing off in games and trivia challenges (and risking a final dab of hot sauce). As traditional press interviews lose their bite, Evans keeps turning up the heat — literally.


THE BIGGEST PERK OF CREATOR LIFE “Customer service interactions tend to go a lot better when the person you're dealing with watches your show.”

	Paul's venture into social media began during the pandemic, when she assembled a group of Utah-based momfluencers to shoot content, calling it #MomTok. But the thing that made her start to truly go viral was her infamous 2022 TikTok Live, where she exposed the “soft swinging” scandal (which is just what it sounds like) between her and the other married members of the Mormon creator group. The story went so wide, it prompted Hulu to create a reality show revolving around Paul and her confidantes. “We honestly just started [TikTok] for fun,” she recalls. “Never did I think it would lead to this.” 


The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives was an instant hit, debuting in September 2024. Season one chronicled Paul's life as a newly divorced mother, her controversial domestic violence arrest and her subsequent third pregnancy. While the show spotlights eight women, Paul serves as the narrative core, proving she's a star on any platform — whether it be on the small screen, earning an Emmy nomination, or online, where she boasts 7.5 million followers across TikTok and Instagram.


	She's known for her satirical wait-is-she-being-for-real content style. “When I post or do something, I want some type of reaction. I don't think that's a secret to anybody,” she explains.


	But ABC naming Paul season 22's Bachelorette was not a gotcha moment. It was a headline-driver, as she hails as the first lead from outside the franchise. On her season, The Bachelorette will trade its fairy-tale roots for an unapologetically honest mega-creator, reality star and mother of three. 


	“There's this stigma that the Bachelorette should be a little more classier, more maybe than I am. I'm like, ‘Do I need to say things in a different approach?' But then, I'm like, no. Because why would I do that?” Paul says. “Maybe that is why I was chosen — to be who I am. Maybe that does shake things up, and maybe that's what's needed, is a little bit of change. Because that's what I am going to do.”

	Since meeting on RuPaul's Drag Race season seven, Trixie Mattel and Katya Zamolodchikova (say that five times fast) have parlayed their onscreen chemistry into a sprawling comedy brand. Their cult YouTube series UNHhhh now fuels a larger media machine that includes the podcast The Bald and the Beautiful, Netflix's I Like to Watch, a best-selling advice book and a Trixie Cosmetics collab. Both also have found solo success — Trixie as a business mogul and musician, Katya as a published author and stage performer — but together, they remain queer internet icons.

THE SOCIAL PLATFORM I COULD NEVER LIVE WITHOUT AND THE ONE I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE UP “Considering it is the app I receive the most hate on (by far), I ironically could not live with X! Once you cut through the chaos on there, it is the fastest platform to get news, political updates, and unedited videos that may be censored or suppressed on other platforms. YouTube could kick rocks though –Respectfully.” 


THE ONE THING I MISS ABOUT MY LIFE BEFORE I WAS A CREATOR “When you're a political creator, people automatically assume that you're the most radical side of the party you represent. I am a MAGA Republican, but I love getting to know people with different views from me. I miss when people didn't try to make me defend myself against their own presumptions. I ultimately just want people to be healthy, happy, and pay low taxes.”

The latest addition to the ‘Drag Race' franchise will tap a slate of all Latin queens, following in the footsteps of WOW's recent success with ‘Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale.' 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



	World of Wonder has greenlit Drag Race Mexico: Latina Royale, the latest expansion of the Drag Race franchise, The Hollywood Reporter can exclusively reveal. 


Latina Royale will spotlight a cast of all Latin Queens from different shows across the global franchise. The new series notably follows in the footsteps of WOW's Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale, which featured a slate of Asian drag artists from various Drag Race installments. 




	A host for Slaysian Royale has not yet been revealed. (Lolita Banana and Taiga Brava currently serve as the co-hosts of Drag Race Mexico.)

	In addition to the reveal of the new series, WOW has renewed Drag Race Philippines for a fourth season. The news comes on the heels of Slaysian Royale breaking records, becoming the most-watched global premiere ever for its streamer, WOW Presents Plus. Additionally, the series drew in a 50 percent viewership increase compared to season three of Drag Race Philippines. 


	“World of Wonder is proud to continue spotlighting the many cultures which shape global drag, and celebrate Latin artistry with Drag Race Mexico: Latina Royale,” said WOW co-founders, Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato, in a statement. 


Drag Race Mexico: Latina Royale and Drag Race Philippines season four will each hit WOW Presents Plus in 2026. To celebrate the addition of Latina Royale, the Emmy Award-winning media company will debut Drag Race Mexico Rewind in December 2025, featuring highlights from the two seasons of the Mexico-based series.


	WOW recently announced the addition of Drag Race Down Under vs. the World to its growing worldwide slate. Featuring a cast of Queens from various foreign franchises, the Australia-based spinoff follows a format similar to that of Latina Royale, with Queens from around the globe competing for a chance to win a worldwide crown.

	











RuPaul's Drag Race UK vs. the World was the first Drag Race spinoff to enlist a cast of international former competitors. Last summer, RuPaul's Drag Race Global All Stars aired its first and only season, featuring one drag queen from 12 of the varying global Drag Race installments.

Star Finn Wolfhard on how the reaction to the HBO hit loomed over the final episodes of Netflix's show: ""Everyone was pretty worried"" given the way ""'Thrones' was torn to shreds."" 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	Endings are tough. Ending hugely popular hit fantasy shows is even tougher. 


Stranger Things star Finn Wolfhard says that the team making the Netflix hit's highly anticipated final season worried that the show could suffer the same fan backlash that greeted HBO's Game of Thrones. 




	“I think everyone was pretty worried, honestly,” Wolfhard tells Time magazine in a new feature story about the season (along with a cover image that's definitely … interesting). “The way that Game of Thrones got torn to shreds in that final season, we're all walking into this going, ‘We hope to not have that kind of thing happen' … But then we read the scripts. We knew that it was something special.”

Thrones famously ramped up the cinematic spectacle for its final two seasons and made longer and more expensive episodes — something Stranger Things likewise did for its previous fourth and upcoming fifth-and-final season. Yet fans clearly embraced the super-sized scope when season four premiered three years ago.


	“We were nervous about season four,” co-creator Ross Duffer said. It was one of the most expensive seasons of TV ever made, at a reported $30 million per episode. “It was such a relief when it got the viewership it did because you don't want to scale down for your final season … or an abbreviated final season … these were all possible realities.” The final season has been pegged at a reported $50 million to $60 million per episode.

	











	Co-creator Matt Duffer noted that he's been surprised that while the team is considering various ways to expand the franchise, Netflix hasn't exerted more pressure to come up with a direct sequel. “I'm kind of surprised there hasn't been more pressure [from Netflix],” he said. “They would love us to go in and pitch it, but they haven't forced us to do it.” Netflix chief Bela Bajaria added, “When they're ready, I'm ready.” (It also seems likely that such an idea would be kept under wraps until after the final episode airs to prevent spoilers.)


	As previously announced, Netflix is doing a unique release strategy for the final season, looking to own the holiday season by dropping four episodes the day before Thanksgiving, three more on Christmas and the movie-length series finale on New Year's Eve.

In addition to getting both services at a discount of more than 30 percent, Apple TV will add select Peacock programming, while Peacock will get selected Apple TV shows.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


Apple and NBCUniversal are teaming up on a new streaming bundle, one that they hope will drive subscription growth at their respective direct-to-consumer services.


	The “Apple TV and Peacock Bundle” will launch on Monday, Oct. 20, just ahead of the NBA tipoff on NBC and Peacock. The bundle will cost $14.99 per month for the Apple TV and Peacock Premium tier, or $19.99 for Apple TV and Peacock Premium Plus bundle, representing a discount of over 30 percent (Apple TV is currently $12.99 per month, while Peacock Premium and Premium Plus are $10.99 and $16.99, respectively).

	Apple is also offering select Apple One subscribers a subscription to Peacock Premium Plus for a 35 percent discount, the first perk outside of the Apple ecosystem for Apple One subscribers. Apple One currently includes Apple TV, Apple Music, Apple Arcade and iCloud+ storage.


	In another notable aspect of the deal, each streaming platform will also offer a curated selection of shows from the other's service, to help consumers sample programming and perhaps persuade them to subscribe.


	That means that Apple TV users will get up to three episodes of shows like Bel-Air, Twisted Metal and Happy's Place, while Peacock users till get up to three episodes of shows like Palm Royale, Stick and Slow Horses.


	The content on both services is largely complementary, with Peacock focusing on live sports and events, joined by a selection of original programming (like The Paper) and fare from NBC and Bravo, while Apple TV is almost all original, curated premium programming, closer to the HBO model. 

	











	“There is no more perfect combination of entertainment than the Apple TV and Peacock Bundle, with our complementary content portfolios featuring the best shows, movies, sports and live events,” said Matt Strauss, chairman of NBCUniversal Media Group, in a statement. “With this first-of-its-kind initiative with Apple, we're redefining what the customer journey should be for a streaming bundle with rich sampling and a smooth sign-up process, and we're broadening the reach of Peacock to even more audiences.”


	“We're thrilled to introduce this all-inclusive bundle of incredible programming and to bring Apple TV's beloved shows and movies to more viewers in more places,” added Oliver Schusser, vp of Apple TV, Apple Music, Sports and Beats. “From acclaimed originals to can't-miss live sports, the Apple TV and Peacock Bundle unites the best of entertainment in a simple and seamless experience.”


	Both Apple and NBCU had been reluctant to cut bundle or partner deals since launching their streaming services in 2019 and 2020, respectively. While they had worked with partners like cable companies and telcos to offer subsidized bundles, they had mostly avoided cutting direct partnerships.


	That has changed over the past year, with Peacock and Walmart inking a deal to add Peacock as an option for Walmart+ subscribers, and NBCU cutting deals with Amazon and Google to bring Peacock to Prime Video Channels and YouTube Primetime Channels (both deals were much broader than just Peacock, it's worth noting).

	











	Apple, meanwhile, rebranded Apple TV+ to just Apple TV earlier this week, and a year ago announced a deal to bring Apple TV to Amazon Prime Video Channels. The company also partnered with Chase to offer a complimentary subscription to Apple TV for its Sapphire Reserve credit card holders.


	“Selfishly, I think it's great because more people get to see our show,” Ben Stiller, whose show Severance streams on Apple TV, told THR earlier this year.


	The tech giant has been focused on building out its Apple One bundle of services, and the Peacock deal suggests that in addition to its own services, it will add offers bundles with outside providers.

Spotify says its upcoming AI tools — built with Universal, Sony, Warner, Merlin and Believe — will keep artists and songwriters at the center.


													By
												

	Kristin Robinson


Senior Writer


	Spotify is partnering with Sony Music Group, Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, Merlin and Believe on “artist-first” AI music tools, according to a blog post from Spotify. Little is known about what generative AI models will come out of this partnership but the post notes that the company has “already begun work on the first product” and that these forthcoming AI products will “empower the artists and songwriters they represent and connect them with the fans who support them.”


	As part of the announcement, Spotify is touting four principles that it will follow with its AI models to “put artists and songwriters” first.


	It reads as follows:


	To create these forthcoming models, Spotify says in its blog post that it has started building a state-of-the-art generative AI research lab and product team.


	The news comes just weeks after Spotify announced that it was strengthening its policies on negative use cases of AI-generated music. This includes updates to its spam, impersonation and content mismatch policies, among others. The streaming service also recently announced an integration with ChatGPT, allowing users to better personalize their song and podcast recommendations.


	See below for comments from top music industry executives on the new agreement: 


Alex Norström, co-president and chief business officer at Spotify: “Technology should always serve artists, not the other way around. Our focus at Spotify is making sure innovation supports artists by protecting their rights, respecting their creative choices, and creating new ways for fans to discover and enjoy the music they love.”


Gustav Söderström, co-president and chief product and technology officer at Spotify: “AI is the most consequential technology shift since the smartphone, and it's already reshaping how music is created and experienced. At Spotify, we want to build this future hand in hand with the music industry, guided by clear principles and deep respect for creators, just as we did in the days of piracy. Our company brings deep research expertise to this opportunity and we're actively growing our AI team and capabilities to drive the continued growth of the entire music ecosystem.”


Rob Stringer, chairman of Sony Music Group: “We are pleased to be collaborating with Spotify to develop responsible generative AI offerings that broaden opportunities for artists and songwriters, whilst enhancing the music experience for fans. This is an acknowledgement that direct licensing in advance of launching new products is the only appropriate way to build them and demonstrates how a properly functioning market benefits everyone in the ecosystem and fuels innovation. We appreciate and applaud Spotify's leadership at this critical period.”


Sir Lucian Grainge, chairman & CEO of Universal Music Group: “For several years we've been driving initiatives with our partners to put artists at the center of the conversation about Gen AI and have struck Artist-Centric agreements that establish innovative new vehicles to unlock the opportunities presented by this revolutionary technology.  I commend Daniel, Alex and Gustav on taking these critical steps forward to advance this approach.  It is essential that we work with strategic partners such as Spotify to enable Gen AI products within a thriving commercial landscape in which artists, songwriters, fans, music companies and technology companies can all flourish.”


Robert Kyncl, CEO of Warner Music Group: “We've been consistently focused on making sure AI works for artists and songwriters, not against them. That means collaborating with partners who understand the necessity for new AI licensing deals that protect and compensate rightsholders and the creative community. We support Spotify's thoughtful AI guardrails, and welcome the opportunity to pioneer the future together.”


Charlie Lexton, COO of Merlin: “Merlin's approach to the use of AI in music is straightforward. We actively look for partners who respect and value copyright, respect and value artists and want to enrich, not displace, the creative community. Spotify's principles on AI announced today demonstrate that same commitment. We are excited to work together to ensure these principles translate into products that genuinely enhance the creative and commercial eco-system – for the benefit of our independent members, their artists and their fans.”


Denis Ladegaillerie, founder and CEO of Believe: “At Believe, we have always seen two sides to AI and GenAI. On the one side is ‘responsible AI,' focused on artist and copyright protection, guided by our four principles of consent, control, compensation, and transparency. On the other side is ‘value-creative AI,' innovations that place artists and their careers at the center, empowering creativity, accelerating music discovery, and deepening fan engagement. After supporting Spotify's recent initiatives to strengthen AI protections, we are now thrilled to partner with Spotify to co-develop ‘value-creative AI' tools that will fuel artist development and unlock new creative and commercial opportunities.”

Nayeon, Jihyo, Tzuyu & Momo of TWICE perform ""This Is For"" and ""Strategy"" as Olympic gymnast Suni Lee hits the catwalk.

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	Four members of the K-pop girl group TWICE — Nayeon, Jihyo, Tzuyu and Momo — hit the runway for Wednesday's Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, and they were joined by another superstar on the catwalk.


	The quartet kicked things off with “This Is For,” the title track from their fourth full-length album that came out in July. The lyrics were a perfect fit for the fashion show that celebrates women, with lines like “This is for all my ladies who don't get hyped enough” and “I wanna go where the baddest girls are from” (we think they found them on Wednesday night). Next up was their December single “Strategy,” from their EP of the same name.

	











	For both songs, the TWICE women wore their Victoria's Secret PINK best, including fuzzy knee-high boots and the PINK brand emblazoned in silver rhinestones. The group was also flanked by backup dancers as well as models dressed in a full range of looks from the more youthful and casual PINK brand, including hoodies and sweatpants, striped gym socks, cotton bras and undies, beanies and furry cardigans.




	One of those PINK models: Olympic gold medal-winning gymnast Sunisa “Suni” Lee, making her Victoria's Secret Fashion Show debut.

A post shared by Victoria's Secret PINK (@vspink)


	TWICE stopped by to chat during the pink-carpet pre-show, with Tzuyu telling the interviewer, “We love the fun and free feeling of the PINK.” Via a translator, Jihyo added: “We are used to doing the performances with nine members, but this time we are able to do only four of us, so I hope you guys enjoy this new performance of us.”


	Also performing on Wednesday's Victoria's Secret Fashion Show: KAROL G, Madison Beer and Missy Elliott.


	Next up for TWICE: The nonet announced dates for their This Is For 2026 world tour, with plans to hit North America, Europe and the U.K.

The Colombian American's singular fusion of Latin music and R&B have made her a star — and proved that uncompromising artistry can be good business, too.


													By
												

	Isabela Raygoza


Associate Editor, Billboard Español


It's a few hours before Kali Uchis is set to take the stage for the second of two sold-out nights at New York's Madison Square Garden in September, and the venue is buzzing. Fans, many dressed in the artist's merchandise or girly pink outfits, hum with anticipation. For the Colombian American powerhouse, this moment represents the culmination of a decadelong rise — from an indie darling crafting mixtapes in her Virginia bedroom to a superstar reshaping the boundaries of motherhood, biculturalism and fame.

	











	Today, she's moving audiences of thousands — all while raising her 1-year-old son and balancing life on the road with her partner, rapper Don Toliver. And backstage, the artist born Karly Marina Loaiza exudes the kind of tranquility of someone who's exactly where she belongs.


	Dressed in a plain baby blue spaghetti-strap top, the 31-year-old is having her glam squad ready her, meticulously curling her waist-length extensions and sharpening her cat-eye eyeliner. As they apply last-­minute touch-ups, Uchis emphasizes the importance of grounding themselves prior to the concert. “We all do a prayer together before the show to uplift everyone and remind us that we're all on the same team,” she says. “That we're here to make something beautiful, inspire people and have a good time.”

	











	Uchis has built a reputation as a bilingual and genre-fluid artist who bends musical boundaries with ease. Her voice, languid and honeyed, can glide over sensual R&B, bouncing reggaetón, shimmering pop or nostalgic jazz. While bilingual peers like Cuco, Helado Negro or Omar Apollo remain at theaters and amphitheaters, Uchis is dominating arenas with songs that ignite feelings of intimacy and escapism, where love, resilience and self-discovery often collide. She's a storyteller who bears her heart with a blend of vulnerability, empowerment and poetic introspection, whether asserting her independence (“Loner”), exuding self-love (“All I Can Say”) or tapping into supernatural longing (2021's “Telepatía,” her first Hot Latin Songs No. 1 and her first Billboard Hot 100 entry).


	“Kali has incredible artistic sensitivity. I was really impressed by how she pays attention to every detail of her voice, her melodies and the way she conveys sensuality and emotion in every word,” Karol G tells Billboard. “Her style is very authentic, and that makes her shine, giving each song a very special touch.”


	Uchis' ambitious and largely sold-out 29-date North American arena run — her first time headlining such venues — elevated her artistry to a new level. According to Billboard Boxscore, she grossed $31.2 million from 322,000 tickets sold during the tour, which included two-night runs at arenas in New York and Chicago and a three-night stint at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, Calif.

	











	“Kali's vision has always led the way — we built a team to amplify it, leaning into her bilingual and genre-defying identity as her greatest strength and shaping a tour that feels both world-class and authentically hers,” says Jon Lieberberg, who manages Uchis alongside Shakira Kalité.


	Under the glow of swirling pink lights, theatrical fog and chiffon drapery, Uchis transformed Madison Square Garden into an otherworldly haven for her fans. The crowd — a mix of young people, couples, LGBTQ+ followers and fans from diverse ethnicities — seemingly knew every lyric as Uchis' velvety voice floated effortlessly through her bilingual anthems. “Even though it's called the Sincerely, tour, it's really a huge celebration of my entire discography,” Uchis says.


	Her elaborate show bore that out. After making her grand entrance, Uchis — by turns perched on a swing, wearing a hand-crystallized French Polynesian lilac silk gown and nestled in a larger-than-life teacup, spinning like a doll in a music box — first spotlit tracks from her latest album, 2025's soulful Sincerely,. Then she pivoted and the energy shifted dramatically: Clad in commanding SEKS black leather with playfully naughty schoolgirl-inspired attire, Uchis confidently delivered material from her 2024 Spanish-language album, Orquídeas, bringing out JT of City Girls to join her on the Dominican dembow-leaning banger “Muñekuita.” Later, Rauw Alejandro made an appearance to give their collaboration “No Hay Ley Parte 2” its live debut.


	“Both Kali and I have different musical universes, but at the same time we share a very Latin and feminine essence,” says Karol G, whose Orquídeas collaboration, “Labios Mordidos,” hit No. 10 on Hot Latin Songs and No. 97 on the Hot 100. “When we got together, there was a mixture of sweetness, sensuality and strength … the fact that we are both Colombian and the special connection between us is also reflected in the music.”

	











	“I think that's what people love about Kali, that she represents so many different people and communities. She is a testament that a person can be many different things and be themselves,” says Wasserman senior vp Cristina Baxter, who has worked with Uchis since 2015. “Whether you connect with her because of shared heritage or not, the ultimate connection is with the idea that she's a multifaceted person and artist. She's not going to be told who she is, and she's going to live authentically herself.”


	The yearlong hiatus Uchis took after Orquídeas — declining to tour behind it so she could focus on raising her and Toliver's son after he was born — informed how she approached this tour. “The reasoning behind doing so much of my discography on this tour is I feel like this is the tour to do it,” she says. “I took my little break to have my baby and be with him every day, all year. But now, let me just go ahead and do as much as I can and give justice to these songs that so many people didn't get to see.”


About halfway through our interview, Uchis' phone buzzes. She FaceTimes her son, who's on his way to the LEGO Store with a family member. “¡Hola, mi amor! ¿Qué quieres comprar?” she coos, then chuckles when a family member chooses a toy recommended for older children, ages 3 and up. “Está bien, está bien,” she assures in Spanish. I ask if her child speaks both languages, and she replies with pride, “He does! He understands and speaks both fully.”


	English and Spanish define Uchis' world — and her career, where she has carved out a space as the rare Latin artist who thrives across linguistic boundaries, reflects this. A strong performer on the Latin and all-genre charts, her most recent albums Orquídeas and Sincerely, both hit No. 2 on the Billboard 200; the former's debut was the highest for a Spanish-language set by a woman last year, and it ruled the Top Latin Albums and Latin Pop Albums charts. It even became the first Spanish-language set by a woman to debut atop the Vinyl Albums chart. Uchis has also scored nine entries on the Hot 100, including her viral 2021 hit “Telepatía” (No. 25) and her Peso Pluma-­assisted smash, “Igual Que un Ángel” (No. 22). Her 18 career entries on Hot Latin Songs include “Telepatía,” an eight-week No. 1.


	For Uchis, though, this tour's importance transcended such numbers. “We haven't done a tour since the Red Moon in Venus tour [in 2023],” she says. “I had a tough experience in part two [of the tour] because I was pregnant and I was not ready to announce it. It was complicated trying to perform, trying to hide my pregnancy and not being ready to talk about it.” This tour, however, has been “like a return to myself again. I have my body back and have this renewed, refreshed feeling. I have learned so much from the touring that I've done [previously]. This definitely feels still like me, but such an evolved version.”

	











	And while Uchis was making up for lost time on this tour — performing both Orquídeas and Sincerely, material for audiences for the first time — the run was also an opportunity for her to treat fans to live renditions of her earliest repertoire, alongside the bilingual hits that have made her a global sensation. She reached back as far as her 2015 EP, Por Vida, and gave several songs from across her catalog their live debuts. “This is my first real [solo] arena tour,” says Uchis, who opened arenas for Tyler, The Creator in 2022. “It felt like the right thing to do was to honor this full-circle moment of, ‘Let me put myself on. Let me show you a little bit of something about me from back when I started and bring it all the way to here.' ”


	Amid it all, Uchis had another challenge: traveling on a demanding national tour with a toddler. “Luckily, my man is really supportive,” she says of Toliver. The couple, who traveled together alongside their child on a tour bus, approached the outing not just as a professional endeavor but as a family adventure. “I have a good support system right now,” Uchis explains. “Everyone knows that I have to be focused on the show, but I'm also looking at it as a family road trip.” But, she notes, “My son wants to play with me all day” — and those days often started early and ended as late as 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. after shows. “Getting rest has been hard,” she admits, but with help from her partner and loved ones who traveled with her on the tour bus, she could sneak in a nap before sound check — an hour or two if she's lucky.


	“Until my son is 3 years old, for me, it's a big priority being in his everyday life, even when I'm working,” she says. “On a normal, everyday basis, I'm with him constantly. But obviously, this is a seven-week tour, so it's the first time where he has to know, ‘OK, Mommy actually has to go to work.' ”

	











	Uchis' management went to great lengths to tailor the logistics of the tour to her circumstances. “We intentionally shaped the pace, routing, travel and daily workflow of the tour,” Lieberberg says, explaining that the structure was designed to make it “possible for Kali to show up fully for her audience and fully for her family.” For example, one key part of the plan was routing that allowed for travel by bus instead of constant flights.


	The structure has at least one major fan: “[My son] loves traveling,” Uchis says with a huge smile. “He loves seeing new things. He loves being on the tour bus.”


Even as she builds a new chapter with her family, Uchis remains tethered to the artist she used to be. “I really built my way here through all these years,” she says.


	Uchis was born in Alexandria, Va., and raised between the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area and Pereira, Colombia. That bicultural upbringing heavily shaped her artistry. She learned to read and write in Spanish before English, a foundation that later allowed her to record in both languages seamlessly. Growing up, music was a constant presence in her “chaotic, full house,” where cousins, uncles and aunts filled the space with life — and noise.


	“Music was always there. It was just part of my life from the beginning,” she recalls. “Even when there was silence, I would hear music in my head. I think that's why I started writing songs when I was really little. I was always inspired to try things, whether it was learning instruments, making clothes or performing for the kids in the neighborhood. I was just a very creative little girl.”


	That same self-sufficiency emerged when she started making music in high school. Uchis taught herself the basics of video directing and album cover photography, experimenting with visual and sonic identities long before she had formal industry backing. She caught the attention of major players like Snoop Dogg, Diplo and Tyler, The Creator after the release of her 2012 debut mixtape, Drunken Babble, on social media — and prompted her move to Los Angeles, where she began preparing for a career that would let her stay true to herself while reaching bigger audiences.


	“I had an instant reaction to her music the first time I heard it over 10 years ago,” Wasserman's Baxter recalls. “When I heard snippets of Drunken Babble several years before we started working together, I felt immediately like I wanted to work with her. There was no one like her. I still say there's no one like her. She has such a singular, authentic voice.”

	











	Uchis' ascension to arenas, Baxter says, “is really a testament to all of the work that she's put into her career and the relationship that she's developed with her fans.”


	Lieberberg adds, “Over the past decade, she's built a global audience that deeply identifies with her unique voice and perspective. The success of her recent releases proved she was ready for that next stage.”


	And her status today as one of America's most bankable female Latin headliners is a remarkable turn for someone who admits how little she understood commercial expectations less than a decade ago. “When someone said to me something about my first-week sales of [my 2018 debut] Isolation, I was like, ‘What? I didn't know that was a thing,' ” she recalls. “I was just so naive about the music industry. I didn't try to do anything to support the sales.” For her, Isolation's power had nothing to do with metrics: “I traveled the world making this album and collaborating with all these amazing people like Gorillaz, Tame Impala, Bootsy Collins. I put together so many legends for my debut album. That was all that I cared about.”


	“She's a very unique and well-rounded artist with the ability to create music that connects on a global level without losing her roots,” Karol G says. “I admire her greatly because she stays true to herself, and to me, she is a figure who inspires you to believe in yourself and your own art without fear.”


	This, combined with Uchis' refusal to compromise her bilingual identity — exemplified by 2020's Sin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios), her first album entirely in Spanish, and her decision to alternate between languages on subsequent albums — has propelled her journey. The industry may have been hesitant about a rising star who operated in two languages, but her fans weren't.

	











	“People kept telling me to stick to English, that it was easier to sell music that way,” Uchis recalls. “I'm not going to just keep making music in one language because it's easier to sell. I'm going to do both because I can do both. I always felt that [not] utilizing everything that God gave me into my art is the same as spitting in God's face. Why would God have made me bilingual? Why would God have made me with this duality if I wasn't meant to project it into my art and use it to inspire other people and to create with all of this that I have?”


	But Uchis never expected to crack the bilingual code this effectively. “I had a lot of doors closed in my face, and I had a lot of opportunities missed because I feel like nobody ever thought that this would get to this point,” she says. “A word that people used a lot was ‘unique.' At the time, those aesthetics weren't really popular. I want to say that the things that I did were always very much ahead of their time. I don't think that people were ready for what I was doing.”


	Now Uchis has arenas of fans around the world proving just how wrong those ­detractors were.

	Following a competitive situation, Amazon MGM Studios' United Artists and Scott Stuber have landed Lizard Music, a package with Dwayne Johnson attached to star and Benny Safdie attached to direct. Safdie also will write the script, based on the Daniel Pinkwater novel. 


Deadline first reported the news that the package was hitting the market after Safdie and Johnson's A24 pic The Smashing Machine bowed at the Venice Film Festival. That pic won Safdie best director at Venice and earned Johnson the best reviews of his career portraying UFC fighter Mark Kerr.

	The film will follow a boy left to his own devices who stumbles upon a secret late-night broadcast of lizards playing otherworldly music, and a hidden door to the extraordinary swings open. His search for answers leads him to the eccentric and whimsical septuagenarian Chicken Man and his beloved companion, a 111-year-old chicken named Claudia – two kindred spirits who found each other at just the right time. United by this shared vision, they set off on an adventure that begins as a hunt for a hidden society but blossoms into something far greater: a voyage through invisible worlds, unexpected harmonies and the unbreakable bond between lost souls who discover magic not only in what they find but in each other. 


	“We are so thrilled to partner once again with extraordinarily talented Dwayne Johnson, as well as work for the first time with the amazing creator, writer and director Benny Safdie, on Lizard Music,” said Courtenay Valenti, Head of Film, Streaming and Theatrical at Amazon MGM Studios. “Everyone at Amazon MGM and UA is deeply inspired by their previous collaboration on the critically acclaimed The Smashing Machine. We are so excited to now collaborate with them on this imaginative, entertaining and cinematic story; Lizard Music is a tale that feels both timeless and unique. We are very fortunate that they have trusted us to be their studio partners.”

	Producers for Lizard Music include UA's Stuber and Nick Nesbitt, Out for the Count Productions' Safdie, Seven Bucks Productions' Dwayne Johnson, and Magnetic Fields Entertainment's David Koplan. 


	“I've been lucky enough to work with Dwayne and Benny on multiple projects and have seen firsthand their incredible talents and connection as artists,” said Stuber. “The world they've created together for Lizard Music is unlike anything either has done before, and we couldn't be more excited to bring this wonderfully imaginative story to life.”


	Said Safdie: “I couldn't be more excited to go on this journey with Amazon MGM studios and United Artists. Lizard Music is a book I read to my two sons, and we were riveted by its imagination and wonder. I love Daniel Pinkwater as a person and an author; the idea of making a movie where everyone can join the conversation is both thrilling and beautiful. To go on this adventure with Dwayne and to be able to watch him transform and become the Chicken Man is just beyond. I can't wait!”


	Safdie and Johnson are repped by WME. Johnson also is repped by the Garcia Companies.

Chu On How The Breathtaking ‘Wicked: For Good' Took Flight With New Songs For Cynthia Erivo & Ariana Grande, Plus A Secret Guest Star As Cowardly Lion","https://deadline.com/2025/10/jon-m-chu-wicked-for-good-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-1236587870/","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Columnist/International Editor At Large


EXCLUSIVE:  Jon M. Chu says he “tweaked and tweaked” Wicked: For Good, the second part of his breathtaking movie musical about Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West who fled Oz, and Glinda the Good who remained. Getting the film to gleam involved bringing back stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande to film new lines for the title song and persuading a major actor to voice the Cowardly Lion.


	But something unexpected floored him.


	“The colors were holding us back,” he reveals, laughing loudly when we met in London following a special in-conversation session during the BFI London Film Festival.

	The yellow brick road wasn't, well, yellow enough. “No joke,” he insists. The tweaking continued until two weeks ago, the acclaimed filmmaker discloses.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“We were doing, sound of the mix, the final mix. But really at the end it was color that was holding us back, because we were getting new visual effects. And then green is so sensitive. You can have so many ranges. And every time you switch… to the HDR version, to the IMAX version, to the Dolby version, those greens go everywhere…It's her skin,” he says, referring to Elphaba's hue.


	“And then the yellows in the yellow brick road. It can't be the honey brick road; it has to be the yellow brick road,” Chu declares.


	“And those colors, when they expand in the color space, they just start to veer. And we had to really be careful. So we spent a lot of time, way more time, not to repaint them, but just tweak to make sure it was in the range that we expected on the film version, on the Dolby version, because you just get more colors in HDR or stuff like that.”

	











	Whatever spell Chu used, it worked because Wicked: For Good works for good on so many levels. It's gloriously, deliciously good. Universal releases the film into theaters on November 21.


	Some might even argue that it's a tighter, more thrilling, more exciting film than Wicked. 


	Yes, it's romantic, yes, it's a musical and yes it's a thriller. Boy, does it thrill.


Wicked 2 is certainly far superior to the second act of the stage show that's still running on Broadway and in London's West End. 


	And, Cynthia Erivo is, in Chu's words, “a badass,” and both she and Grande are class acts. The audience at the private screening I attended in London applauded as the final credits rolled. It's truly one of the year's outstanding movies. It's a marvellous piece of cinematic art. And, by George, it's just what we need. The joys are, to steal a line from a song, unlimited. 


	Chu had choices to make when he was in pre-production and rehearsals for both Wicked and Wicked: For Good.


	He remains silent when I say that nothing in the second part of the stage version eclipses Elphaba performing Defying Gravity, the hit song that closes act one before the interval. 


	When Erivo's Elphaba soars towards the western skies performing Defying Gravity in the closing moments of Wicked, I wondered how on earth Chu would top that in Wicked: For Good?


	Chu had some ideas. The director says that he knew where it did work and that he knew how to enhance it to make Wicked: For Good excel.


	The reveals in the existing songs For Good and No Good Deed worked, he says. “I felt like I wanted it to work even more. And I knew we had the opportunity. Also, I knew the girls better. Once I understood how we were going to feel about these characters, then I knew what was missing emotionally for me. I want to see what Elphaba, now that she's made her choice to leave the wizard and Oz, how is her life when she's made this choice? How lonely can that be? What are the questions she asked herself when she thinks maybe she made a mistake, what would drive her back to the wizard? That's never made sense to me, actually. Try to make sense of that. Oh, it would be Glinda. We should add Glinda into that scene because Glinda would be the only one who can speak to her, convince her,” he explains without pause.


	“And then what's Glinda's journey through this? At the end of act one, Glinda doesn't make the choice. She actually hasn't changed that much. She maybe has opened her brain, she's starting to wake up, but she goes right back. So this movie had to be about the courage of someone popping their own bubble, a bubble of privilege or their bubble of safety. ..So those things we really focus on. How do we, even when the girls aren't together, how are the decisions each of them made affecting the other in their journey?” Chu wondered.


	Chu describes parts of Wicked: For Good as “part monster movie,” like the Universal monster movies about the creation of a Beast That comes from Within. It's Elphaba swooping through the sky on her broomstick, and Glinda in a bubble.


	“Elphaba's a superhero in this one. I mean that opening, cold open, she comes down,” Chu says, as he describes Erivo's dramatic entrance. 

	











	“We wanted to show how powerful she really was. I think this is how you show a superhero, especially these women as superheroes, and not have to fit into what a guy's superhero is, the stereotype of it all. Elphaba's her own person and Glinda could be too. It's also the origin story of Glinda the Good,“ he says.


	And Glinda's so conflicted, and it's fascinating to watch how she navigates those emotions of feeling. 


	“Totally, I think that's us,” is Chu's immediate response. “I think we wish we could be Elphaba and have that kind of moment of clarity, but I think most of the time we're not that clear. And we go back and forth and we hide in our bubble. More times than not, no matter how much we say we're an ally of this or that, or how much we're against this or that, most of the time we just stay in our own world. And I think to watch someone, and especially Ariana, navigate this character and break her for us, maybe gives us a little bit of a guideline that we can do it at any time.”


	Elphaba has the courage of a lion, in abundance, I say. 


	“Well, she has to muster more courage at a certain point because when you question your home, the place that you are fighting for, that you believe in, and you realize that it doesn't even want you. I mean, I think that we ask, we all ask ourselves that question at some point in our lives. And so her courage to surrender to that too and go off into an unknown path that has nothing to do with this place,” Chu says.


	The heart of the film is about Elphaba and Glinda.


	But there's heat between Elphaba and Jonathan Bailey's Fiyero — a splendid performance, by the way.


	Their relationship seems to develop in a deeper, perhaps more intimate, way than it does in the stage show. Seeing their courtship pan out on stage is one thing, but it's a gobsmacking, beautifully unexpected moment on screen.


	Chu says he structured it in such a way because “what I didn't want this to do, was just make it about love. This is not about them getting together,” he says emphatically. 


	“This was about her figuring out who she is and declaring what she wants in her life. And each of the breaks in their brain are not about each other. They're actually about looking at the world in a different way. And they're finding each other in the truth. And so for me, it actually goes deeper. The song As Long As You're Mine, I think it feels sensual. Not because they're like, physical, because actually in the [stage] show, they're much more physical. They're together already. From the very beginning. She goes, ‘kiss me fiercely.' In this movie they're actually apart. There's hesitation. They don't even know what the other's going to say. So we really wanted that to have, instead of just a song about them together, it's a song about will they, won't they, how are they going to find each other?”


	And then, through the course of the song,  Fiyero looks at the propaganda proclaiming Elphaba as an evil person, who wants to destroy all of Oz's citizens. “He looks at her and it's like, ‘Wow, you survived all of this and you're still kind and you are beautiful.' And he says, ‘You're beautiful'…And I think that intimacy, getting them closer in the song actually makes it feel more sensual. Even though they're not actually physically doing anything.”

	











	Decisions about new songs were made very early on. Chu says that he had several discussions with about new numbers with composer and lyricist Steven Schwartz.


	“Well, we knew the pick points of where we needed something, whether it was a scene or a song. And Steven was like, ‘I know what that song can be.' And it was No Place Like Home.”


	 And then Schwartz would text Chu voice messages featuring music played on the piano. 


	“I'm like, ‘Oh, that's interesting. Where are you going with that? Okay, what about this? And what about that?' But I mean, that's Steven's genius of knowing what was needed. But we had always identified through the script the areas that I think we needed help on,” Chu shares.


	And creating Girl in the Bubble, a new number for Grande's Glinda was a similar process. 


	“I want to see her make this decision. I don't just want to jump to it. I want to see her struggle. I want to be there with her when she wrestles with it. And so he came up with this song Girl in the Bubble, and then when he came up with the song, it was like, ‘How do we visualize this?' If every word is so important, I'm not going to want to look here. And then we were thinking about, okay, well this movie has a lot of reflections and distortions. We have a lot of that kind of symbolism and oh, what if she's trapped in the image of herself? We never know what's the reality, what's not. It was very highly technical and we're removing walls and putting walls back in real time of going into all these reflections. But it all sort of connected for us there.”


	The song For Good, written for the second act of the stage show, was enhanced for the movie, Chu confirms. 


	“We added a couple of pieces of dialogue at it's beginning. So she says, ‘Look at me, not through your eyes, through theirs.' That's new. She used to say, ‘Look at me. I'm limited,'” he tells us, his voice delivering the song's lilting harmony.


	“Now she says, ‘Look at me,' and she pauses. We really wanted to refine the song. 


	“That was written 20 years ago. Now you have Cynthia Erivo playing this part, and we really have to understand why she's leaving and what would compel her to leave for this sacrifice. And I think them connecting on this, ‘Hey, it's not that you, it's not your fault. It's this system that's in place …' And Cynthia as Elphaba saying, ‘Good, can't just be a word, it has to mean something.'”


	And that last line is one of the most powerful in the movie, when I heard it, it struck me as something right out of a classic like Casablanca. It goes without saying that these Wicked pictures will stand the test of time and, well, they're classics almost from the moment they're released.


	Chu repeats the phrase for me. “‘Good can't just be a word. It has to mean something. It has to change things.' And I think that Elphaba needed to give Glinda a gift of something that when Glinda makes her final speech, that we hear the echo of Elphaba coming through there. And that phrase helped us connect that.”


	Chu and his collaborators couldn't know what state the world would be in when they embarked on these movies five and a half years ago because the film does, quite uncannily, reflect a sense of what's going on in the world around us. People, in this case animals, being ill-treated, having their voices taken away, shunned and driven out of Oz.

	











	“I know it's crazy,” says Chu, shaking his head. “When we were making it, there was a vibe in the air. We were coming out of COVID lockdown, and there's a lot of questions about what we've been living in,” he reasons. 


	“And the movie was always about our adult selves looking at our children's stories and wondering, do we still believe in those things, happily ever after or any of that. And so that's the power of a timeless story. That's why The Wizard of Oz has lasted for so long. That's why Wicked has lasted for so long. They tap into something that can feel timely at any time. And hopefully, it's about humanity, the cycles of humanity. And unfortunately, we are in a cycle that mirrors this. And so it's more important than ever in a weird way, that that's the power of movies that we can see ourselves…who are we going to be? Who are we going to choose to be and what do we stand for?”


	Watching Wicked: For Good with an audience, I could feel the movie binding us, as all great films can- and should.


	“I don't know how the audience feels yet, but I know for us, who made it, it bound us together. Not because of the characters or the songs, but because of what it stood for. Because of the moment that we were in, we needed this movie. We needed to make this movie. We needed each other to make this movie and to process it together. It changed all of our lives even before anyone saw one frame of it. So the fact that then the audience did bring it into their lives, it did affect people. It only feels closer to us and now they are a part of our lives. So yeah, I think there's something about movies and stories that are really important to how we see our own world, and we are inundated with news and bad news and good news, and sometimes a story can take us away and relieve us of this. And the only time we can get clarity of the world is when we tell a fictional story. But it always brings us back home and allows us to process the information more deeply. Come back home and maybe be changed …”


	I'm fascinated by how Chu and his team were able to shoot both at the same time. “One day we'd be shooting in their dorm room at Shiz and the next day we'd be shooting in the Kiamo Ko [castle], which is set years later.


	“One day we'd be shooting, What Is This Feeling? And then the next day we'd be shooting, As Long as You're Mine. It was weird. We were jumping. It was all about, what set was built first and what schedule? It was all about the logistics. It was just a huge long shoot and we had to have everything prepped before we even went in. 


	“We rehearsed everything. So we kind of knew the feeling. We had our giant board where I mapped out emotionally where we were. So we all sort of knew. And every day before I'd have to check my map where, and I think it shows the technique of these women. These are not just two women who just did a fun musical. They had to be so precise and technical at the highest levels. It's not just acting, it is singing, it's moving. And it had to all tie together. So people think they know what these girls are they're capable of.But in movie two, you really see it.”


	But, I ask, how were Erivo and Grande able to switch and go so much deeper, as they do in Wicked: For Good, how did they manage to give such deeply moving performances ?

	











	“Because that's the arc of the characters. And so they were already in the arc. They were living these characters. So I don't know if there was an intentional like, ‘Hey, this is movie one. So remember movie one…' We didn't think of it as two movies. We thought of it as, ‘Where are we in the story? Has her brain broke yet? Has she made her first? We always looked at when did they ask their first question of this world? When does it go unanswered? When do they break and when do they make their decision to enter this new phase or whatever? So we knew when her bubble popped, when she thought it popped, she pretended it popped and when it would be there. So we would just track that. And then they did a lot of the in-between work to get there. And then every day when we're shooting it, we would just nudge at it, nudge it, nudge at it.”


	Chu shakes his head when I ask where their reserves of energy came from. 


	“That I don't know,” he exclaims. “We didn't know if they could do it, they didn't know if I could do it. I think we all didn't know. There was no choice. That's why I think when people see these girls, it is masterful.”


	They are great performances. “They will forever be Elphaba and Glinda for many, many people,” Chu declares.


	Was there more time to craft and finesse Wicked: For Good, I ask?


	“Yes and no. I mean, yes, we did have more time because we cut both together at the same time. My first 12 weeks after shooting, instead of just showing the studio one movie, I showed both,” he says, startling me.


	“It was really rough. But we got our whole team to just go really hard because I needed to know the bigger arc. I needed to know where we were headed. And then once we showed the studio, which is very scary, I didn't have to, but I was like, ‘I'm just going to force myself to do it.'”


	Ahead of the special double screening, he warned studio executives: “You guys can't give any notes. I don't want to hear any notes.”


	They saw both versions three months after Chu and his collaborators returned to Los Angeles. ”Then we were confident enough because it was still on its legs enough. Then I put movie two away and we didn't look at it for a year,” he reveals.


	That allowed Chu and the team at Universal to focus on the first part of Wicked so it could be released through the late fall and winter of 2024. 


	“And then,” the filmmaker tells us, “I didn't look back at it until January of this year. We did not open it up. And so having that room to focus on movie one and then open it up in January was very revealing because some choices stuck. And some choices we just had changed. The movie had changed or I had changed.”


	“Also, with Wicked out in the world, there was a sense that audiences understood the characters and the narrative better than anticipated, so we could not maybe do so much setup. And so then we re-edited, and then in March we were like, ‘I need some lines put in.' Some of those lines in [the song] For Good. I really wanted to nail it.”


	Chu gathered up his crew and returned to the UK last March and “we went back and shot with the girls…Just to shoot some of those new lines For Good.”

	











	They also filmed some more of a speech that Glinda delivers at the end of the film “because I just needed to refine it,” Chu explains.


	Also, they filmed scenes involving the young Glinda. “We had that scene in the script and I knew we should have kept it, but we didn't shoot it at the time because we had a lot of other pressures.”


	Chu notes that he and producer Marc Platt “always said' if we need it, we'll go get it.'”


	Around that time, Chu approached a celebrated actor to voice the Cowardly Lion's lines. He sent the star in question a direct message on Instagram. “I was like, ‘It's not a ton of lines, but maybe you have a little time. I know you're busy. I'll come to you.' He was like, ‘Why the fuck not, let's go!' And then we went ahead and recorded the lines.”


	Laughing, Chu says, “Man, wait until the red carpet when the actor who gave us the Cowardly Lion's voice steps foot on it. It'll be wild.”


Wicked collected ten Oscar nominations and won two – Best Costume for Paul Tazewell and Best Production Design for Nathan Crowley and Lee Sandales.


	It's no secret that I loved Wicked the movie, unexpectedly so because I was never the world's greatest fan of the stage show. But Erivo and Grande opened it up for me and allowed me to hear it for the first time. I reckon that the work by sound wizard Simon Hayes, and his colleagues, Andy Nelson, Jack Dolman, John Marquis and Nancy Nugent Title, helped enormously.


	Chu and his artists have breathed life into it. Even more so for Wicked: For Good. It's how I felt when I saw The Godfather: Part Two. That was a masterpiece too.

Great article, more of this on Deadline please!
Straight up behind the scenes movies news and your take on it, which was wonderful!

I loved this interview Baz. Thank you for giving so much insight and profoundness without spoiling anything. I loved Wicked (saw it in theaters 5 times). I knew the play existed but I didn't know anything about it. So excited to watch part 2! I just really hope they land the conclusion.

					By Denise Petski 

Senior Managing Editor


EXCLUSIVE: It's a busy time for Patrick Fischler. The actor known for his work on Mad Men, Lost and most recently in Oscar-winning American Fiction, has been tapped for a key recurring role in the upcoming second season of Hulu‘s Paradise, Dan Fogelman's drama series from 20th Television. He also is set for a recurring role in Apple TV‘s upcoming Cape Fear, opposite Javier Bardem, Amy Adams and Patrick Wilson.


	Fischler's role in Paradise is being kept under wraps, but we hear he's playing a brilliant professor trying to balance his work with a quietly challenging personal life.

	Starring Sterling K. Brown, Julianne Nicholson and James Marsden, Paradise is set in a “serene community inhabited by some of the world's most prominent individuals. But this tranquility explodes when a shocking murder occurs, and a high-stakes investigation unfolds.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The series is executive produced by Fogelman, Brown, John Requa, Glenn Ficarra, John Hoberg, Jess Rosenthal, and Steve Beers.


	In Cape Fear, Fischler will play an undisclosed role opposite Bardem and Adams. 


Cape Fear is created, written and showrun by Nick Antosca, based on the novel The Executioners, which inspired Gregory Peck's 1962 film, and the 1991 remake directed by Martin Scorsese and produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment. The series is billed as a tense, Hitchcockian thriller and an examination of America's obsession with true crime in the 21st century. In it, a storm is coming for happily married attorneys Anna (Adams) and Tom Bowden (Wilson) when Max Cady (Bardem), a notorious killer from their past, gets out of prison.

	











Cape Fear comes from UCP, a division of Universal Studio Group, and Amblin Television. EPs include Scorsese, Antosca and Alex Hedlund for Eat The Cat; Spielberg, Darryl Frank and Justin Falvey for Amblin Television, Bardem, Adams, and Morten Tyldum, who directs the pilot. 


	Fischler will next be seen alongside Hannah Einbinder and Gillian Anderson in Mubi's horror film Teenage Sex and Death at Camp Misama. He was most recently seen opposite Jeffrey Wright in the Oscar-winning American Fiction and continues to recur on NCIS: Origins. Fischler is repped by Paradigm and Main Title Entertainment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Kate McKinnon to play love goddess Aphrodite in Percy Jackson season 3","https://www.avclub.com/kate-mckinnon-aphrodite-percy-jackson-disney","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 02:28:00 GMT","

Disney+'s Percy Jackson And The Olympians show has not been shy about plucking actors from the “comedy gods” pantheon to fill out its own celestial order, and the show has just revealed a big one: Per reporting from Variety, the streaming series has just tapped former Saturday Night Live star Kate McKinnon to play its version of Greek love goddess Aphrodite.

As the deity (whose previous credits include turning statues into women, turning women she was mad at into much stinkier women so that their husbands would cheat on them, and the whole Trojan War thing), McKinnon will subject Walker Scobell's Percy to tests related to love before offering him her aid. (Presumably by making some of his own enemies extra-stinky, so that their significant others will cheat on them.) (Don't blame us, Apollonius of Rhodes wrote it.)

McKinnon has had a relatively quite time of it of late, at least compared to the “mass Kate McKinnon saturation” it felt like we were in danger of hitting a few years back. She had a small but notable role in Barbie in 2023, a supporting role in this year's The Roses, and an uncredited appearance in A Minecraft Movie a few months back. She joins a cast that includes, amongst its adult gods, Jason Mantzoukas, Timothy Omundsun, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Jay Duplass, Toby Stephens, and Courtney B. Vance, the latter taking over the role of Zeus from the late Lance Reddick. The Percy Jackson series is currently gearing up for the release of its second season, which is scheduled to debut on Disney+ on December 10, 2025. The show was granted a season 3 renewal, set to adapt Rick Riordan's book The Titan's Curse, back in May.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Skibidi Toilet has now signed with a major Hollywood agency","https://www.avclub.com/skibidi-toilet-studio-signs-with-caa-hollywood-agency","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 05:24:00 GMT","

Today, in “Sentences we dare you to say without sighing wistfully at the end” news: The studio responsible for the mass proliferation of Skibidi Toilet videos on the internet has just signed with major Hollywood representation. That's just how it goes, sometimes: They distract you for weeks with “We're going to get our fake AI actress signed!” headlines, and then, boom, Skibidi Toilet in the halls of Hollywood power.

Specifically, the signing entity in this case was Invisible Narratives, a studio that exists as a sort of protective shell around actual Skibidi Toilet creator Alexey Gerasimov, the person who makes the insanely popular YouTube videos about the toilets with the Half-Life 2 heads growing out of them. (You can overdose on this shit very quickly, but we will, for the sake of context, include exactly one sentence of Skibidi Toilet lore from the show's Wikipedia page here: “Concurrently, relations sour between the Skibidi Toilets and the Astro Toilets, a race of powerful extraterrestrial toilets that formerly counted G-Toilet among their ranks, and the Astro Toilets invade Earth.” Y'all good? We have orange juice and cookies for anybody feeling faint.)

Invisible Narratives, in turn, is the company that exists to turn the above sentences—which elementary school-age children and also apparently Michael Bay have been consuming obsessively for a few years now—into money, mostly in the form of huge amounts of merchandising. It's run by a former Paramount executive named Adam Goodman, and has now signed with vaunted Hollywood agency CAA, because what aspiring agent has not dreamed, with stars in their eyes, of breaking into this brutal business, taking a risk on a relative unknown, and ultimately signing such entertainment luminaries as Titan Speakerman and Chief Scientist Skibidi Toilet? The upshot of this is that a lot of people have smelled money coming off of the massive amounts of kid attention the web series has generated since it debuted in early 2023, and it's now escalated to the “needing an agent to handle it all” level of cultural ubiquity. We hope some of that cash is getting back to Gerasimov, because, say what you like about his art, he's the guy who realized that children really do want to watch Garry's Mod heads come out of toilets while singing a dumb little song. But the point is that the machine is now mobilizing in full.

Anyway, in case this didn't feel bleak enough yet, here's the partnership rendered into Hollywood trades speak (per THR): “Now Invisible Narratives is turning to CAA to represent its flagship Skibidi Toilet franchise and other digital IP across TV, syndication, video games, endorsements, food and beverage partnerships, electronics, and live events.” We, personally, cannot wait for those beverage partnerships; who doesn't want to sip a freshly decanted 2025 Skibidignon Blanc over dinner while contemplating how every generation, inevitably, finds itself alienated from the ones that come after it—while also looking at a wine bottle with a guy's head coming out of a toilet on it?

Losing a loved one is never easy. Diane Keaton's loved ones are opening up after her heartbreaking passing at the age of 79. In a statement shared with People, the Oscar-winning actress's family confirmed she passed away from pneumonia on October 11 in California. 

They also expressed their deep gratitude for the outpouring of love and support that has poured in from fans, friends, and colleagues around the world. “The Keaton family are very grateful for the extraordinary messages of love and support they have received these past few days on behalf of their beloved Diane, who passed away from pneumonia on October 11,” the family said in their statement.

Keaton's family encouraged fans to honor her memory in ways that reflect her lifelong passions.“She loved her animals and she was steadfast in her support of the unhoused community,” the family shared. 

“Any donations in her memory to a local food bank or an animal shelter would be a wonderful and much appreciated tribute to her.”

A post shared by Hudson Grace (@hudsongracesf)

A source close to the actress told People that her health had “declined very suddenly,” calling her passing “heartbreaking for everyone who loved her.” The source added, “Her death was so unexpected, especially for someone with such strength and spirit.”

Keaton rose to fame in the 1970s with her breakout role as Kay Adams in The Godfather films and her collaborations with Woody Allen. She won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in Annie Hall in 1977.

Throughout her career, she starred in beloved classics such as “The First Wives Club”, “The Family Stone”, “Because I Said So”, “Book Club”, and “Finding Dory”. She also appeared in the HBO series The Young Pope and directed projects including “Heaven” (1987), “Hanging Up” (2000), and an episode of “Twin Peaks”.

Her career was marked by authenticity, humor, and a distinctive style that made her one of Hollywood's most enduring and admired figures.

Born in Los Angeles in 1946 as Diane Hall, Keaton built a life defined by creativity, independence, and love for her family. She adopted her two children, Dexter and Duke, in 1996 and 2001.

Keaton never married, and she often reflected on her choice to live life on her own terms. “Today I was thinking, I'm the only one in my generation of actresses who has been a single woman all her life,” she told People in 2019. “I'm really glad I didn't get married. I'm an oddball.”

Known for her wit, grace, and trailblazing spirit, Keaton's influence will continue to inspire generations of artists and fans.

There's obviously more to it than pneumonia. That took her because she was already compromised by something else. We're not dummies.

Country music legend and former “American Idol” judge Keith Urban has canceled his scheduled concert in Greenville, South Carolina, due to laryngitis. The show was set to take place on Thursday night at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena. 

According to event organizers, the Grammy-winning country singer has been placed on complete vocal rest following his diagnosis earlier in the week. Urban's longtime laryngologist, Dr. Gaelyn Garrett from the Vanderbilt Voice Center, advised the 57-year-old artist to cancel the show to avoid further strain on his voice, as reported by Fox Carolina.

Urban's medical team remains optimistic about his recovery. Dr. Garrett said the singer is expected to return to the stage for his Nashville concert on Friday, October 17, at the Bridgestone Arena.

“Keith Urban has been advised by his longtime laryngologist, Dr. Gaelyn Garrett, to cancel his performance in Greenville due to laryngitis, which began earlier this week,” the statement read. “He has been placed on complete vocal rest, and Dr. Garrett is optimistic that he will be back onstage for his Nashville show.”

The canceled Greenville performance was part of Urban's High & Alive World Tour, which began in May and was set to conclude in Nashville.

Urban expressed regret over the cancellation and took a moment to thank fans for their support.

“Hey Greenville, I'm so SO sorry to have to cancel the show,” Urban shared in a statement. “I know all the logistics it takes to get to a concert these days, and I've never taken any of that, or any of YOU, for granted. I'm looking forward to getting back there when we can!”

Although he hasn't posted about the cancellation on his social media pages, his heartfelt note quickly circulated among fans who wished him a speedy recovery.

A post shared by Keith Urban (@keithurban)

The Bon Secours Wellness Arena confirmed that refunds will be issued automatically to anyone who purchased tickets through Ticketmaster. Fans who bought tickets through third-party resellers are advised to contact their original vendor for assistance.

Urban's High & Alive World Tour featured supporting acts Chase Matthew, Alana Springsteen, and Karley Scott Collins on select dates. Despite the temporary setback, Urban's team reassured fans that he is expected to make a full recovery and continue performing.

As Urban rests his voice, many fans are sending well wishes to both the artist and his estranged wife, Nicole Kidman, following their recent separation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2025 Performers Lineup: Performances List","https://entertainmentnow.com/fashion-famous-celebrity-designers/victorias-secret-fashion-show-2025-performers-performances/","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 15:06:20 GMT","

The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show is known for its fun and energetic performances. Rather than walk down the runway with a serious expression, like many other fashion shows, models are often playful, smiling, and even dancing while they show off their lingerie. The inclusion of live performers usually helps the fun aspect of the show, and this year, there are performances from four different acts. 

A post shared by Victoria's Secret (@victoriassecret)

The musicians set to perform at the 2025 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show on Wednesday, October 15, are K-pop group TWICE, Missy Elliott, Karol G, and Madison Beer. The announcement was shared on the official Victoria's Secret website. 

Fans had the opportunity to react to the news when the official Victoria's Secret Instagram account posted photos. Alongside a picture of TWICE, the caption reads, “TWICE performing on the runway? We've never been more ready. Livestream the show on October 15 at 7PM ET on Prime Video and Amazon Live or our YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram.”

Fans have shared their excitement, writing, “Twice will show them how REAL performance is done with LIVE VOCALS,” and “SLAYYY QUEENSSS.” 

A photo of Karol G posted on Instagram was also shared to generate excitement about her inclusion in the show. “We said go big this year—and we meant it. KAROL G, welcome to the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show stage,” the caption reads. 

A post shared by Victoria's Secret (@victoriassecret)

Fans are thrilled. “First Bad Bunny at the superbowl n now Karol g in VS,” a fan wrote. “Here we are proud of KAROL G,” another comment reads. 

“Excellent decision is a great working entrepreneurial woman, disciplined, and above all, what she does she does with love and passion,” a third person shared.

A post shared by Victoria's Secret (@victoriassecret)

Madison Beer's inclusion in the event has also been met with great excitement. “Madison Beer is taking the stage—and trust us, you're going to want to turn it up,” the caption of her announcement on Instagram reads. 

“So proud of her i'm crying,” a fan wrote. “This is the greatest choice you could have picked for this,” another person wrote. 

And last, but certainly not least, we have the music legend Missy Elliott!

Bring on the mistletoe! Hallmark Channel's 16th annual Countdown to Christmas kicks off on October 17, 2025, and we're feeling extra jolly about this year's onscreen pairings.

With two jam-packed months of movies and series ahead, it was no picnic picking just a few couples we can't wait to see, given all the magical match-ups. But in the end, these Top 8 duos have our hearts thumping with the most anticipation, and we're happy to tell you why. So — in no particular order, cue the holiday meet-cutes and bring on those snow-capped romances!

A post shared by Tyler Hynes (@tyler_hynes)

Let's start with the most obvious gift under the tree! Fans have been wanting a reunion between Hallmark Channel heartthrob Tyler Hynes and “When Calls the Heart” queen Erin Krakow since the final moment of their first movie together — 2021's “It Was Always You.”

In July, they announced their reunion with a hilarious teaser set to Peaches & Herb's “Reunited” and, understandably, fans went wild. Although “Christmas Above the Clouds” isn't a sequel, everyone's eager to see this dynamic duo's chemistry fly off the screen again. 

In the movie, promoted as a modern take on “A Christmas Carol,” Krakow plays a workaholic CEO who tries to skip Christmas (gasp!) by flying to Australia. But on the loooong flight, she finds herself haunted by her past, present, and future, AND unexpectedly reunited with her ex, played by Hynes. Will she rediscover Christmas magic and true love all in one flight? We are so ready for take-off! “Christmas Above the Clouds” premieres on November 8 at 8 p.m. Eastern time. 

We have been pumped for this pairing since Hallmark announced “Merry Christmas, Ted Cooper!” We hope Kimberley Sustad's brilliant brand of dry, offbeat humor gets to shine alongside the adorably quirky and smirky Robert Buckley. Preview pics from the set, including Buckley in a hilarious snowman costume, tell us we're in for a wild ride!

According to the logline, Buckley plays Ted Cooper, a TV weatherman who loves Christmas but has experienced three really bad Christmases in a row. Positively determined to make this Christmas very merry, he faces a bunch of injuries and obstacles on his way home for the holidays — including landing in Urgent Care with a doctor who was his former crush, played by Sustad.

These two are not only funny but have huge hearts, so they know how to make a rom-com seriously sparkle. Keep in mind: Sustad is one of three screenwriters behind the “Three Wise Men” franchise, tasked with crafting all the touching moments that occur as hilarity ensues. Add in prolific Hallmark director Jason Borque and the fact that Buckley's one of the executive producers? We're expecting rom-com gold. “Merry Christmas, Ted Cooper!” premieres on October 25 at 8 p.m. Eastern time. 

Bravo to the Hallmark casting wizards who thought to pair up longtime star Tamera Mowry-Housley and B.J. Britt, who's quickly become a fan favorite as part of “The Groomsmen” trilogy with Tyler Hynes and Jonathan Bennett. 

We expect great chemistry between Mowry-Housley, a consummate professional and sitcom alum who's been acting practically her whole life, and Britt, a giant goofball who's also got a huge emotional wingspan when a script or topic touches him.

Their unique combo of talents will certainly come in handy for “Tidings For the Season,” in which Britt plays Adam Kade, a serious local news anchor whose life “takes an unexpected turn in early December” when he meets 10-year-old Robbie, his biggest fan, and Robbie's single mom, Lucy, played by Mowry-Housley. Robbie's one request of his favorite newscaster? To balance out the bad news by reporting good, uplifting stories, too. Can he do it without compromising his career? We have a feeling Mowry-Housley and Britt will be tugging at our heartstrings and we are here for it! “Tidings of the Season” premieres on November 16 at 8 p.m. Eastern time. 

Ben Rosenbaum is on fire! 2025 has been a big year for the longtime “When Calls The Heart” star, who not only married his real-life leading lady, co-star Erin Krakow (who made our Top 8, too), but he also landed his first leading role in a Hallmark movie with “The Christmas Cup.” 

Hearties can't wait to see another side of Rosenbaum as a rom-com leading man and we think he's been perfectly paired up with Rhiannon Fish, who seems to spark genuine, sizzling onscreen chemistry with every actor she works with. 

In “The Christmas Cup,” Fish plays Staff Sergeant Kelly Brandt, who returns home for the holidays in low spirits due to a potentially career-ending knee injury. Her family tries to boost her spirits by convincing her to lead a hometown team in the local Christmas Cup competition, and sparks fly when she receives help from Fire Captain Quinn Stokley, played by Rosenbaum. We're hoping for a four-alarm fire with these two! “The Christmas Cup” premieres on November 30 at 6 p.m. Eastern time. 

Hear ye, hear ye! “She's Making a List” delivers an onscreen reunion of rom-com royalty — Hallmark Channel's queen of Christmas Lacey Chabert is paired up with one of Hallmark's meet-cute kings, Andrew Walker, for the first time since their 2018 flick, “My Secret Valentine.”

The duo had been hoping to reunite onscreen, even suggesting movie ideas to Hallmark executives, Walker told EntertainmentNow. It turned out that Hallmark was one step ahead, already working on finding the right script and timing for the two to come back together. Walker described the movie as “Hallmark Christmas meets ‘Men in Black,'” which has us all the more excited. 

According to the synopsis, Chabert plays Naughty or Nice inspector Isabel Haynes, who is “assigned to evaluate mischievous 11-year-old Charlie.” But things get complicated when she unexpectedly falls for Charlie's widowed father, Jason Duncan, played by Walker. As her heart softens, she starts to question the rigid rules of her job and entertain the true magic of Christmas. “She's Making a List” premieres on December 6 at 8 p.m. Eastern time. 

This darling duo has us walking on air! In “A Christmas Angel Match,” longtime Hallmark stars Meghan Ory and Benjamin Ayres play two “rival” angels who have to work together on Earth to match up human couples during the holiday season. 

As they're butting heads, we get to see Ayres put his comedic chops to good use as the “fun and spontaneous” angel, which is how Ory's older, wiser angel describes him in one preview — and she does not see it as a compliment. Though they may ruffle each other's feathers, there's also a spark between these two that they can't deny. 

Ayres and Ory are old pros at making onscreen magic, but he told EntertainmentNow that portraying angels was an intriguing and super sweet challenge, unlike anything they've done before. We have a feeling it'll be a match made in Heaven. “A Christmas Angel Match” premieres on October 17 at 8 p.m. Eastern time. 

A post shared by kristoffer polaha (@polahaha)

We really can't think of a better duo than Nikki DeLoach and Kristoffer Polaha to headline Hallmark's first-ever partnership with Nashville's iconic Grand Ole Opry to tell a gritty-but-charming story layered with grief, healing, time-travel, and the rich history of an iconic landmark. Both actors excel at stories like these, from DeLoach's deeply emotional “The Gift of Peace” to Polaha's time-travel hit “A Biltmore Christmas.”

Oh, and did we mention they've been friends for more than two decades? “A Grand Ole Opry Christmas” will be an onscreen reunion for DeLoach and Polaha, who co-starred in the TV series “North Shore” in 2004 and 2005. 

The movie was a major undertaking, filmed in Nashville and Kansas City with a star-studded cast that includes Hallmark favorites Sharon Lawrence, James Denton, and Eliza Hayes Maher, as well as country superstar Brad Paisley and a dozen cameos from fellow country artists. DeLoach and Polaha will be the glue that holds it all together, which sounds like a grand plan to us. “A Grand Ole Opry Christmas” premieres on November 29 at 8 p.m. Eastern time. 

A post shared by Kat Barrell (@katbarrell)

It's not lost on us that the final movie of Hallmark Channel's Countdown to Christmas extravaganza, premiering days before Christmas, is a celebration of mother(s) and child. Nicely played, Hallmark.

“The Christmas Baby” brings together longtime Hallmark stars Ali Liebert and Kat Barrell as a busy couple who live and work together. But they're thrown for a loop “when a baby boy shows up on their doorstep days before Christmas with a note written specially for them,” per the synopsis. As they find themselves temporarily fostering the infant, they fall head over heels for the little guy — and decide to navigate the complicated process of trying to adopt him together.

Liebert and Barrell's excitement about the movie is absolutely contagious. They've both already shared heartwarming posts about working together and how proud they are of the movie, including Barrell writing on October 10, “If this doesn't make your heart sing with joy then I've got nothing left to help you.” Sounds like the perfect way to wrap up Countdown to Christmas! “The Christmas Baby” premieres on December 21 at 8 p.m. Eastern time.

May we all be as blessed as beloved genderqueer poet laureate Andrea Gibson who, in the last year of their storied life, got to see it committed to the big screen by way of a loving and intimate documentary. Gibson passed away in July, after they were able to not only participate in the making of Ryan White's documentary “Come See Me in the Good Light,” but to attend and celebrate its premiere at this year's Sundance Film Festival.

And while the last thing we would do is put words in Gibson's mouth — poet laureate! they did the whole word thing just fine on their own! — we suspect that Gibson would want viewers to enjoy White's documentary, not cry over it. Consider it a celebration, not a wake, and what a beautiful one at that. The film's first trailer make that very clear.

While White and nearly everyone else who worked on the film (including Gibson) expected that it would end with Gibson's death from aggressive ovarian cancer, it didn't. Gibson was even able to attend the film's premiere in Park City, Utah, a wonderful, tear-stained celebration of their remarkable life and their seemingly indomitable spirit.

 










“We entered it thinking, at least I did, that it was going to be a film about Andrea's death,” White told IndieWire at Sundance. “And while we were shooting it, we started to understand, this is not a film about dying. It is a film about mortality, but it is all about living and the time that we have on this Earth. So why does the hero have to die in the end?”Since it premiered at Sundance in January, the film has merited a ton of festival accolades, including wins for Sundance Film Festival Festival Favorite, San Francisco International Film Festival Audience Award, Seattle International Film Festival Best Documentary, Hot Docs Audience Award, Cleveland International Film Festival Audience Award, Provincetown International Film Festival Audience Award, Boulder International Film Festival Audience and Best Feature Doc, Full Frame Documentary Film Festival Audience Award, Calgary International Film Festival International Documentary Audience Choice Award, and Port Townsend Film Festival Best Documentary Feature.

The documentary is directed by White, who also produces alongside Jessica Hargrave, Tig Notaro, and Stef Willen. “Come See Me in the Good Light” will be releases in select theaters and stream globally on Apple TV on November 14, 2025. Check out the film's latest trailer below.

British filmmaker, artist, and critic Charlie Shackleton gets the chance to work out feelings about the Zodiac killer documentary he never got to make — as well as his own about the genre itself — with “Zodiac Killer Project.” The never-found serial murderer who stalked the Bay Area in the 1970s remains the subject of endless cultural fascination, including as part of David Fincher's own beloved 2007 film.

Sundance NEXT Innovator Award winner “Zodiac Killer Project,” which has played festivals globally since Park City, finally opens in theaters this November. In it, the director gives us an assemblage of missing pieces from a Zodiac documentary he was commissioned to make, but which ultimately fell through. Here, he is able to show us what that documentary would have looked like, down to even a close-call encounter with a potential suspect.

In the process, Shackleton delivers an often hilarious, satirical deep dive into how true crime documentaries, ever so the fashion these days, operate and work their way upon audiences. Along the way, Shackleton's own droll voiceover guides us through his would-have-been production, here realized in meta form by Loop and Field of Vision. Ahead of the film‘s release, IndieWire shares the exclusive trailer for “Zodiac Killer Project” below.

Here's the official synopsis:

Filmmaker Charlie Shackleton was hot on the trail of the next great American true crime documentary — a riveting account of a highway patrolman's quixotic effort to identify and capture the infamous Zodiac Killer. Shackleton devised a plan, began collecting interviews, and shot “evocative B-roll” footage of ghostly California freeways and parking lots where the killer may have once lurked. And then the project fell apart, leaving Shackleton with fragments of the unfinished film and time to ruminate on shortcuts and signifiers of the ubiquitous genre. 

A witty and beautifully assembled deep dive into our obsession with serial killers and the stories we tell about them, Shackleton's “Zodiac Killer Project” emerges from the ash heap to probe and deconstruct the form with the incisive eye of a true crime connoisseur.

As IndieWire's David Ehrlich wrote in his Sundance review, the film “sees its director leveraging their misfortune into an impish and hyper-resourceful attack on the oppressive strictures of modern storytelling (in this case the rigid conventions of the true-crime genre rather than the mandates of a censorious regime), one that allows Shackleton to achieve a measure of freedom through the act of detailing his own cage. And, as was the case with its most obvious point of reference, the non-film that Shackleton has rescued from the jaws of erasure is almost certainly more rewarding than the one he was originally hoping to make.”

 










Music Box Films releases “Zodiac Killer Project” on Friday, November 21 in New York with an expansion to follow. Here's the trailer, an IndieWire exclusive.

More pastel shenanigans are on the way. 

One of TV's most immaculately art-directed series, “Palm Royale,” is back for more catty fun in Palm Beach, courtesy of Kristen Wiig, Allison Janney, and Carol Burnett. That troika alone lets you know that arch times are ahead, and so does the official trailer for Season 2, dropping on Apple TV (don't call it Apple TV+), November 12.

“Palm Beach is no longer safe,” Wiig's Maxine Dellacorte-Simmons says to kick things off in the glimpse of the new episodes of creator Abe Sylvia's show. One reading recent headlines would likely assume that statement is a given. But never fear! This is the 1960s, and Mar-a-Lago is still owned by Marjorie Merriweather Post. Something clearly has Maxine in a state, though. She spent most of Season 1 as a kind of Southern belle poseur, a barbarian at the gates of Palm Beach high society who's actually already snuck in by marrying the disowned airline-pilot son (Josh Lucas) of society maven Norma Dellacorte (Burnett). Disowning your sons with airline pilot aspirations is something Palm Beach-adjacent families do.

It's a series that positively cackles. And all of us in the room were cackling in June 2024 at IndieWire Honors when Burnett herself, winner of our Vanguard Award, took time to recall her own start as a journalist and a job interview she had at the very venue of our event: Hollywood's Citizen News. John Mulaney then later called Burnett “a fucking commie.” A good time was had by all.

And so will it be for those who watch “Palm Royale.” The first season was nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards in 2024 (for Outstanding Comedy Series, Best Actress in a Comedy Wiig, and Best Supporting Actress Burnett), and an additional eight Creative Arts Emmys. It won for Best Title Theme Music, courtesy of Jeff Toyne.

Ricky Martin, Leslie Bibb, and Laura Dern round out the main cast, while Bruce Dern joins his daughter in the series' supporting ranks along with Kaia Gerber and James Urbaniak. Revel in every perfectly articulated beat of Wiig's “Well, I do know that you know that I know what you know. Ya know?” in the trailer below.

“Palm Royale” Season 2 premieres Wednesday, November 12 on Apple TV.

Whether you're a total believer in aliens or roll your eyes at conspiracy theorists, there's something to be appreciated in Dan Farah's “The Age of Disclosure.” The documentary attempts to apply some journalistic legitimacy to ideas that, until recently, were confined to obscure forums and podcasts, featuring 34 government officials from both political parties making the case that our government knows a lot more about extraterrestrial life than it's telling us. 

If you're open to the idea (and at peace with the fact that you can't see any visual evidence yet), the documentary plays like a sci-fi thrill ride underscored by the optimistic notion that we might have a very exciting century ahead of us if this information begins to be disclosed. And if you're not convinced by any of the testimony, you might be morbidly fascinated by the performance art of watching so many allegedly serious people would go on the record about such things.

The film, which premiered at the 2025 SXSW Film and TV Festival before distribution rights were acquired by Prime Video, follows alleged government whistleblower Luis Elizondo. Elizondo has become a dashboard saint for alien research enthusiasts after claiming to have resigned as the director of the Pentagon's classified Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program over what he saw as bureaucratic opposition to telling people the truth. 

 










He outlines a series of unexplainable phenomena that military and intelligence officials have witnessed over the past century, including flying objects that defy all laws of physics and travel exponentially faster than anything mankind has ever produced, which the military has categorized as Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (or UAPs, for short). 

He's joined by a series of government officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, all of whom offer their reasons for believing that a massive reveal of information about alien research could be on the horizon.  

The film's findings could signal the beginning of a real-life “X-Files” episode or merely be speculation that never goes anywhere, but it feels safe to say that “The Age of Disclosure” will be one of the most talked-about documentaries of the fall. 

The film opens in select theaters and streams worldwide on Prime Video on Friday, November 21. Watch the trailer below.

Brazilian auteur Kleber Mendonça Filho dazzled cinephiles with 2016's “Aquarius” and 2019's “Bacurau,” but he may have achieved new heights with his latest, “The Secret Agent,” which now has an official trailer that you can watch below.

“The Secret Agent” won the most awards of any film at Cannes 2025: Best Actor for lead Wagner Moura, Best Director for Mendonça Filho, and the FIPRESCI Critics Prize for Best Film. Moura has been on the cusp of becoming a huge star for years with his work in “Narcos” (where he played Pablo Escobar), the gentle Sundance drama “Sergio,” and last year's Alex Garland nightmare-epic “Civil War.” The Brazilian actor has received the highest acclaim of his career to date, though, for his work in “The Secret Agent.”

The film is set in the last days of Brazil's military dictatorship, which lasted until the early 1980s. As David Ehrlich put it in his review of “The Secret Agent” from Cannes, “The film's story begins in media res, and while the plot couldn't be easier to follow, it fittingly requires the audience to earn every morsel of the context they'll need to appreciate its power. A middle-aged man who marries the quiet confidence of a cowboy with the “I don't want any trouble, here” demeanor of an extra who just wants to survive the trigger-happy Western around him, Marcelo [Moura] could be an anti-military Communist, but he could just as easily be a tech researcher who has personal business in Recife.” 

 










“That duality is at the heart of Wagner Moura's deceptively recessive lead performance — a performance that Mendonça mines for its errant sense of mystery from the movie's opening scene, in which Marcelo smooth talks a dirty cop at a highway gas station where a corpse has been rotting in the sun for several days. ‘I'm almost getting used to this shit,' the station owner spits, alarmed at how fast he's adjusted to the reality of doing whatever business he can with a dog-eaten body lying next to the pump. Change comes fast in Mendonça's Brazil, and it's hard to blame people for doing their best to roll with the punches.”

Twists and turns happen from there, and the soundtrack is laced with Tropicália gems from the 1970s. So much so, it inspired Ehrlich to murder (and perhaps the first-ever confession to a murder in a movie review): “[There are] so many great Tropicália-accented songs that the critic sitting next to me spent the entire movie Shazam-ing every scene. I obviously stabbed him to death with my pen at a certain point, but I made sure to steal his phone for reference when the screening was over.”  

NEON will release “The Secret Agent” in theaters on Friday, November 26. Watch the trailer for “The Secret Agent” below.

Even on her debut EP, at just 22 years old, feeo sounded like the weariest of old souls. She sang of a choking fear, of bombs falling like tears, of staying up to hear her lover leave because she couldn't bear the thought of waking up to “haunted sheets.” Over toe-scuffing downtempo beats and wistfully unfurled synths, she asked questions—“Are we in love or is it just the drugs, babe?”; “Being lost is a bit like being free, isn't it?”—in a tone that suggested she harbored few illusions about the answers.

It wasn't just the wise-beyond-her-years lyrics that were so striking. It was feeo's effortless balance of plaintiveness and composure, vulnerability and control. Her guarded, whisper-soft musings had a way of unexpectedly blossoming into R&B-schooled runs that proved that, for all her seeming reticence, this woman could really sing. Her tempos may have followed the halting pulse of a doubtful heart, but her voice telegraphed a quiet, determined confidence.

In the four years since, the artist born Theodora Laird has released a handful of EPs and singles, as well as collaborations with Caius Williams and Loraine James, fleshing out the bruised contours of her emotional world while burrowing deeper into the strangeness of her production. Composed of muted synths, thin tendrils of guitar, and atmospheric electronic processing, her sound atomized, turning granular and shimmery. A thin layer of dust seemed to cover everything, like a house that's been locked up for years. Sometimes, her backing tracks were made of little more than tiny samples of her wordless voice, like a chorus of forlorn bumblebees.

On her debut album, Goodness, feeo returns with an even more experimental approach, befitting her new home on London's adventurous AD 93 label. Her songs have gotten still quieter and more minimalist, even as her lyrical and conceptual horizons have ballooned outward. And while her voice remains as stunning as ever, some of the surface-level prettiness of her previous work has burned off, leaving a whiff of charred metal and plastic.

From the opening “Days pt. 1,” it sounds like feeo has has only grown more world-weary in recent years. “Awful things happen every day to people who don't deserve it,” intones an ominous voice (veteran British actor Trevor Laird, feeo's father), spinning a surrealistic tale of pianos falling onto the heads “of infinite strangers, in infinite cities, in infinite parallel universes,” photos of the dead “lost in house fires and floods, or auctioned off in plastic boxes salvaged from bailiff removals and abandoned storage units.” This grimly cartoonish, weirdly quotidian scene of existential annihilation is made all the more menacing by its backdrop of blackened feedback, like Pan Sonic in an industrial furnace; the absence of feeo's singing voice only drives home the sense that we are entering some kind of cosmic void.

“Days pt. 1” is a head fake of sorts, because Goodness is not exactly a noise record; like feeo's previous work, it foregrounds the emotive power of her voice and her understated melodic instincts—often, by stripping everything around her down to the bare minimum, as though she were hunched over a desk dusted with pencil shavings and eraser crumbs. Despite—or, more likely, because of—their fragility and aching sense of lack, these are the most breathtakingly beautiful songs she's recorded yet. In “Requiem,” her multi-tracked voice rolls like luminous mist over softly tumbling synths and horns, the mood filled with nameless yearning; in “Win!,” electrical crackle snags in haphazard loops beneath singing caught on the edge between words and sighs.

While feeo still sings about love, she has broadened her scope. “The Mountain,” a brooding tone poem suffused in billowing wind, or perhaps the sound of a rushing train, seems to be about a whale of Biblical proportions, “Her slate tailbone/Jagged and slick/Her ribcage curved and giant… She could tear me to pieces,” she marvels. “Give life/Give life/Then take it away/I'm only a witness.” In “Requiem,” she paints a similarly mythic scene of death and rebirth, black roses growing from her supine body, before a coda that feels like a benediction: “Night forgives those/Black as her.”

“Here” is the album's centerpiece, a miniature epic of desperate hope. The seven-minute song faintly recalls Grouper in its dalliance between harmonium drone and tentative electric guitar, but the artfulness with which feeo inscribes her sadness on the surface of the air has more in common with Beth Orton and Beth Gibbons. The here of each stanza is London, a wasteland of crushing jobs and crushed hopes, dead time and dead eyes, where the minutes are counted “like lost loose change.” feeo has a gift for focusing on the tiniest details and also for zooming out and connecting everything in one graceful sweep. Begging her lover to leave the city with her (“I say it all the time,” she repeats, ruefully), she allows herself a glimpse of an idyllic future, “Laid to rest in tall grass/When we are withered and old,” before returning to reality: “But now we stay/Striking the pavement for gold.”

Toward the end of the record, Trevor Laird's gravelly voice reappears on “Days pt. 2,” which flips the fatalistic scenario of “Days pt. 1” on its head. This time, it's good things that happen to bad people: A villainous abuser of animals finds a pound coin on the sidewalk; “infinite landlords receive infinite loving kisses from infinite wives in infinite parallel universes.” Static swirls and rumbles, and hammering kickdrums evoke paranoia and panic attacks. Both interstitials are so unlike the rest of the album that I've wondered just what purpose they are meant to serve. Whatever feeo may mean by them, they're a reminder that while her music can be bleak and it can be beautiful, it is also shot through with an acerbic sense of humor. Drawing lines between coins on the pavement and cosmic injustice, feeo's songs can be dizzying in their shifts in perspective, like looking through the wrong end of a telescope.

They can also be dizzying in their pure, unalloyed beauty, like the closing “There Is No I,” a love song pairing feeo's highest, breathiest singing with keening slide guitar. “When we're together/We're better together,” she repeats reverently, in a love song that illuminates the record's overwhelming darkness like a simple beam of light. After an album of convoluted electronic experiments and sleight-of-hand production tricks, this practically unplugged recording—unvarnished, unguarded—reveals new depth to her boundless vision. It's the sound of an old soul renewing herself every time she presses the record button.

Thirteendegrees attempts an important course correction for any buzzing artist in 2025: He no longer wants to be seen by detractors as a “gimmick,” saying as much on the second track “ROOFTOPZ.” He's at the center of a pervasive wave of nostalgia wherein rappers mostly born after the Bush administration are co-opting the swag of the late 2000s and early 2010s. Just watch the music video for “Da Problem Solva,” which replicates those black-and-white rap videos like Kanye's “Good Life” with such alarming accuracy that I'm convinced the director has a flux capacitor.

Anyway, the gimmick stuff is all noise. “Da Problem Solva” was an internet hit this year, a refreshing retooling of 2015 Young Thug flows and The-Dream's detailed production palette. And all throughout BLACK FRIDAYZ, his first project released on Island, Thirteen continues to recontextualize the stylistic language of Thug, as well as Chicago touchpoints that seep into his DNA, to articulate a catchy, melodic sound that has actual room for substance.

In interviews, he frames his music as an alternative to Chicago's drill scene, but it can also be read as a much-needed reprieve from the chaos machine of Playboi Carti and his kin. Harvesting a bygone era for not just the low-hanging fruit of nostalgia, but to develop entirely new styles, seems to be a path that others in his class are also taking: Rising London rappers fakemink and feng build off the slower, moodier production templates of early Drake and 40 to pack more storytelling and feeling into their songs. In an underground landscape where Carti's shadow looms large, this immediately sets their music apart from the endless assembly line of rage rap variants.

And so we get songs like the last two on BLACK FRIDAYZ, “Ghetto Hipster” and “Drive Save,” which paint in amber hues, skewing closer to the warm hum of Acid Rap than anything from the underbelly of SoundCloud. These more “mature” beats gesture at potential collaboration down the road with Chicago's alternative scene, the Sabas and Nonames of the world, even if Thirteen doesn't offer as much lyrical content, instead orbiting bland details about label offers and being “the hood Tumblr.”

But maybe he doesn't have to. After all, Thirteendegrees also owes part of his swag to Sicko Mobb, the storied Chicago duo who once told this very site that they would categorize themselves as “party music.” BLACK FRIDAYZ thrives where Thirteen leans into what he described as the record's “luxurious, above and beyond” sound, on soaring, world-beating songs like “Fake Killa,” “Champain,” and “Chiraq Child” with the young firebrand lil2posh. The synth portamentos and victory lap chords will immediately transport some millennial listeners to scrolling Datpiff for Roscoe Dash and Rich Kidz tapes, but the pastiche isn't as overt as it was on previous projects. Like Carti's retro-Futuristic turns all over MUSIC, Thirteen's homage is generative, not conservative.

Another point of reference might've been last year's Saaheem, where Sahbabii, fellow Young Thug acolyte, sharpened his rough mixes and refined his eccentricities into a glossy, airtight package ripe for Solange and Tyler, the Creator cosigns. BLACK FRIDAYZ similarly functions as a smooth, easy on the ears and richly produced sampler. BNYX, the star producer with an ear to the pavement, meets Thirteen where he's at on “Palace,” melding Tron-esque synth constellations with a vintage Lex Luger riser and chintzy drum fill. I kinda miss his grainy vocal takes on Clique City, Vol. 2, which fleshed out his PhD-level study of the mixtape era, but this record's studio-quality polish pushes him in interesting directions. On “Blacc Friday,” the most moshpit-ready song here, Thirteen flips between smooth, Travis Scott-type Auto-crooning and blistering chants. It's not as convincing as Yeat's best work in the same mode, but it's a fun song for the Rolling Loud set and a necessary detour from the record's cruising altitude.

Instead of the thrilling shopping spree of styles that its title suggests, BLACK FRIDAYZ settles into a groove and grooves hard, aiming for wide appeal but threatening to drift out of attention. It's refreshing that Thirteen's approach does not hinge on the contemporary playbook of sticky snippets and viral moments. He's much more holistic and album-oriented—and definitely not a gimmick—which may prove to benefit his longevity. If he comes with some stronger writing and bigger swings on the follow-up, BLACK FRIDAYZ will be remembered as a solid transition record that pushed him out of his comfort zone.

There's a look on Sissy Spacek's face near the end of the haunting prom scene in 1976's Carrie that's burned in my mind, where the protagonist calmly steps down from the stage covered in pig's blood. Carrie's eyes are a thousand miles wide and unflinching, slowly surveying the gymnasium she's telepathically set ablaze and her fleeing tormentors, scattering to no avail. Princess Nokia evokes this image on the first full track of her latest album, Girls, as she launches into a deadpan diatribe against her abusers and the crushing effects of the patriarchy on women, all while draping herself in the imagery of Greek mythical macabre and Santeria. One can almost picture her mirroring Spacek's startling expression as she drills into her targets from the booth. It kicks off a whiplash assembly of songs that touch on the titular topic with varying degrees of focus and success, seemingly asking: Who's got time for subtlety these days?

In the interim between Nokia's 2023 release i love you but this is goodbye and Girls, the New York native became enamored of the work of David Lynch, especially the cult phenomenon Twin Peaks and the spirit of its protagonist, Laura Palmer. In homage, she's named the opener “Blue Velvet.” Overt lyrical allusions aside (“I've been through too much, babe, I feel like Laura Palmer/I've been a statistic, and every one ignored me,” she spits with calm fury), the inspiration she gleaned from Lynch's thematic obessions is potent in Girls' conceptual throughline. Written over the span of a year, it's an album that admonishes the cruelty shown towards women before turning right around to tout belief in the power of love and the beauty of femininity (in any form), using any heavy-handed signifier that it can to drive the point home. Take the genre juxtaposition crafted by Nokia and production duo Joey Wunsch and Al von Staats: blaring '80s synths on the anthemic, tonally brutal “Medusa” rub up against the soothing ocean waves swirling in the background of “Period Blood,” to the point that it almost feels like a natural come down.

The constant oscillation between tenors over the album's 12 tracks creates a battle to maintain lyrical focus and intensity, which Nokia handles to mixed success. She's at her best when she locks into the understated flow rooted in the tradition of her city's boom-bap rap that barely rises above the whisper: “I'm drinking blood in the mountain, I got the fountain of youth/I'm scaring men off with rumors, can't tell the lies from the truth,” she raps along ghostly shrieks and pounding drums on “Blue Velvet.” But production avenues that sound like demos jacked from other artists' hard drives diminishes some tracks' impact, especially when paired with writing that doesn't reach past the surface. “Drop Dead Gorgeous” lands like a Charli XCX bootleg where the BPM doesn't reach the threshold to become the banger that it wants to be, and her musings feel like they should be backing a TikTok edit of a Bodies Bodies Bodies fan-cam. If you close your eyes, you could trick yourself into thinking the Lindsey Stirling-assisted “Pink Bronco” is a Lana Del Rey cut, where Nokia contorts her voice to match Lana's ethereal register while attempting to subvert the Americana aesthetic with yearning for solitude and self-love. She conjures images of packing a suitcase and never looking back, dropping references to green juice and white picket fences, almost making you wonder if she's just saying things because they sound idyllic.

But there are enough moments where the enthralling production overpowers the more cliché leanings. “Matcha Cherry” is quite lush, with layered strings swirling underneath as her voice crescendos to the refrain, “I'm in love with her, see myself in her, I think I know that, girl.” The switch between the murkiness and blown-out bassline helps “Gossip Girl” leap into “club hit” territory, giving the satirical lyrical tone a bit more oomph on the back of Tenebrae-like synths. But Nokia's most incisive writing occurs when she takes aim at a particular target—perceived contradictions be damned. She has zero qualms about wielding equal vitriol for all her enemies, regardless of gender: “You're male-centered and you make bad decisions/Bird bitches all bread, no chicken,” she spits on “Phoebe Philo,” cutting through the fat to get to the crux of the problem with a particular type of woman. She's called Girls as a wake-up call to other women to center their comfort and care; everything else comes second. She makes that clear from “Blue Velvet”'s first lines: “Girlhood is a spectrum, pretty is destruction/I just fell from grace, and I made it into something.” That grave urgency isn't always maintained throughout Girls' runtime, but Nokia never lets you doubt her intention for a second.

Avant Gardner LLC, the bankrupt owner of the Brooklyn club complex of the same name, has applied for a permit to demolish the Mirage venue, Brooklyn Paper reports. Having failed to secure reopening permits due to safety and technical issues, Avant Gardner filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in August and handed its assets to a lender. The demolition permit filing does not name the Mirage but seeks to demolish 32,000 square feet of a three-story temporary structure, which describes the Mirage build within Avant Gardner, Brooklyn Paper reports. The complex's other venues, Great Hall and Kings Hall, remain operational for now. Pitchfork has emailed Avant Gardner for comment.

The Mirage opened as a pop-up venue in 2015 and quickly became an East Williamsburgh  nightlife destination. A much-touted renovation led to a scramble to quickly reopen the venue, but New York's Department of Buildings deemed the venue structurally unsound and a fire hazard.

The Black Crowes celebrate their 1994 album Amorica in a new live concert special. The followup to the band's two commercial juggernaut albums Shake Your Money Maker and The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, Amorica — styled as amorica. — was polarizing to casual fans upon release. But to hardcore followers of the group's founding Robinson siblings, it was a rock & roll revelation.


	Onstage at the Analog venue inside Nashville's Hutton Hotel, singer Chris Robinson and guitarist Rich Robinson re-create some of the album's most eclectic songs. “Wiser Time,” “P. 25 London,” and the LP's lead single, “A Conspiracy,” are all brought to life by the full band. For good measure, they close the concert with “Remedy,” off The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion.


	The Robinsons also sit for an interview about Amorica, and share their take on the songs and what inspired them.


	“Some of the imagery and the emotion in it is bleak and lonely. How can you be 28 years old and already be that dusted? That's just growing up as well,” Chris says in this clip. “If one thing we were in tune with the artists of our generation in that era, is we were all in touch with our blue. It was a blue period for everyone. There's a melancholy that drifts through the whole thing.”

Jeffrey Epstein needs no introduction. After years of media coverage and wild conspiracy theories, the late financier is practically synonymous with human trafficking and sexual abuse. He was a real-life boogeyman who spent years preying on underage girls while being shielded from prosecution by his immense wealth and powerful connections. This made him into an enduring symbol of moral rot among American elites, not to mention a lack of justice for victims of sexual violence.


	Still, the Epstein saga might have gradually faded from the national consciousness, even in spite of the widespread, unfounded belief that his 2019 suicide in a jail cell while awaiting trial was in fact a murder carried out to prevent him from implicating associates in his crimes. But, because one of his longtime friends was Donald Trump — the two were close until a falling out sometime around the mid-2000s — Epstein's ghost has continued to haunt the political landscape. It's not just that things like a creepy birthday letter the president allegedly wrote to him have become a matter of public record (though Trump denies authoring the document); there's also the administration's embarrassing, ongoing failure to disclose more material related to federal investigations of Epstein after many assurances to the MAGA base that they would release these supposed bombshell files.

	











	And so “Jeffrey Epstein” is a name that still commands headlines. It also happens to be a fairly common name, in use among a great many men who have done no wrong. One database search returned information on nearly 300 Jeffrey Epsteins around the U.S. Rolling Stone reached out to dozens of them in hopes of learning how the Epstein story has affected their day-to-day lives over the past few years. Perhaps understandably, only three replied to share their experiences.

	











	Jeff L. Epstein, 53, resides in an area of New Jersey outside Philadelphia and works full-time as a singer covering Frank Sinatra, the Beatles, Elvis Presley, and many others, in senior living centers, where he says residents are thankfully not too plugged into news developments involving the other Jeffrey Epstein. (He also says that only his older relatives call him Jeffrey.) When the topic does come up, he's taken to feigning confusion, acting as if he doesn't follow the news himself.

	“Every now and then some resident, like 80 years old, might say, ‘Will you ever release the tapes?'” Epstein says. “And I'm like, ‘Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about — what are you referring to?” This strategy, he says, tends to shut down the conversation quickly and effectively. It irks him that the case seems to be a joke to people who make these comments. “If you treat the subject seriously, there is never a reason to say that to me, ever,” he says.


	This Epstein first learned of the infamous Epstein in the mid-2010s. With the latter's arrest and suicide in 2019, he recalls, things turned “nightmarish,” particularly online. He shares a screenshot of a Facebook post he made that year in a local community group where he asked for recommendations of a cleaning service, only to be met by hostile and mocking comments addressing him as Epstein the criminal, as well as a photo of that Epstein. Elsewhere on social media, people have demanded to know why his username is “Jeff Epstein,” assuming it's an intentional provocation. In some instances, he has tried to roll with the unfortunate coincidence, like when he occasionally made appearances on the YouTube show of comedian Graham Elwood, who would introduce him by saying, “No, not that one!” Epstein acknowledges that the bit “was pretty funny.”


	More recently, though, Epstein says, he is trying to reclaim his name. At a weekly open mic with musician friends where he's been a regular for two years, he says, he used to call himself “Jeff L.” to avoid any unwanted association with a notorious sex offender. Then he had a change of heart. “It just doesn't feel right,” he says. “It's just awkward. So maybe six months ago, I'm like, ‘I'm done. My name is Jeff Epstein.'” He told the open mic host to introduce him by his full name going forward. Initially, the host started telling audiences that he was “the good one, not the bad one,” Epstein says, but he soon put a stop to that, telling him that “the only reason” he still deals with a certain stigma is because “people keep saying that.”

	“It'll never go away,” he reflects, in part because of the other Epstein's many links to rich and powerful people, but also since “we'll never know the total truth” of what went on in his social circles. “So people are going to make up whatever, and just keep it going,” Epstein says.


	Asked whether the name has caused him much grief, another Jeff Epstein, a 45-year-old warehouse manager in New Jersey, says, “You have no idea!” His friends, at least, appear take a certain pleasure in the unfortunate coincidence. Epstein shares an email thread between him and a few pals about being approached for this interview — one person advises that he tell Rolling Stone “that you haven't been laid in six years because of this, and make sure they put your picture and address in the article.”


	“I went to my primary care doctor, whom I haven't seen in years,” Epstein says. “He walks in and says, ‘Back in the news!' I can't make this shit up.” He admits that the remarks are pretty much inescapable. “I get comments all the time, especially when I need to show ID,” he says. Epstein knows how to take these interactions in stride, however. “I usually tell them they are uninvited to my yacht party if they tell me to change my name.”


	Then there's Jeff Epstein, 57, who runs a flooring company in Tuscon, Arizona — and says that his name has thankfully never put a dent in his business. “My customers get a kick out of it,” he says. “When they don't know my full name, and I call them, because of my iPhone, it says Jeffrey Epstein is calling. And so I've had customers block my phone immediately, then I have my office call and tell them, ‘No, no, that's Jeff.'”


	“It comes in waves,” Epstein says of conversations about being a Jeffrey Epstein. “Sometimes I don't get anything for months at a time, and then some weeks, I'll have three or four people mention it,” with some asking if it's his real name. He adds, “It can be annoying, but it has never been negative, other than the inconvenience. It's just never-ending. It's funny, if the news is on when I walk in, I'll hear my name three or four times in two minutes. There's always something that reminds me every day that I share a name with this guy.”


	Epstein says the unusual situation has affected the rest of his family, too. While his company doesn't make use of his surname, his brother has a business that does, which has led customers to make jokes. His brother tells them that he has a sibling named Jeffrey who has to put up with much more of this commentary.

	“I'm non-political, so that also helps,” Epstein says of his random connection to reviled criminal frequently invoked in partisan attacks. Even so, he has a clear personal interest in seeing the Epstein case come to some kind of resolution. “I did post ‘release the Epstein files,' but that's basically because I want my name back,” he says. “Yeah, let's get it over with. Why are we not doing this?” He's referring to the current administration's attempts to move on from the matter, with Trump and the White House taking the bizarre, nonsensical line that lingering questions about the late Epstein's activities constitute some kind of “hoax” from Democrats. “You mean my name was ruined because of… nothing?”


	“Would definitely love to have no one talking about my name anymore,” he continues. Although they've each found ways to deal with the headache, these Jeffrey Epsteins agree that it's a tired subject. At this point, they've all heard the same lines thousands of times. “It's run its course, but just won't go away,” Epstein says. If you ever meet a Jeffrey Epstein, then, do him a solid: pretend you've never heard the name in your life.

I
n January 2020, just weeks before the NBA shut down and Costco shelves emptied and Tom Hanks got sick, Joy Corbitt's only brother died in his mid-forties with symptoms of Covid. Which meant, from the pandemic's earliest days, Joy was taking no chances. 


	She'd heard that Black and brown people like her seemed to be getting sick and dying at higher rates than other Americans. And that kids were either not getting sick, or getting less sick, or getting sick in ways we didn't really understand. So, when it came to protecting her then-14-year-old daughter, Lia, the North Carolina mother was vigilant.


	“I was consumed with the news — consumed with the numbers,” Joy says.


	As one week of lockdown slogged into the next, Lia, a straight-A student, struggled through that chaotic, ever-unmuted, camera-off Zoom version of school. Which is to say, she didn't learn much. 


	With Joy's husband James, a long-haul trucker, frequently on the road, the mother and daughter did their best to fill the time. They got a crazy Shih Tzu puppy named Zane. They spent long hours playing foosball and air hockey. They watched Netflix and cooking shows and Bridgerton together (yes, even the sex scenes).

	By the time fall 2020 poked its head onto the horizon, Lia's high school was set to resume in-person classes. Joy kept her daughter home. She was anxious; it was too soon for students to return. But Lia, a budding theater kid, was eager to get back to her friends, to her life, to try her luck onstage. 

	











	A couple of months into the school year, after Lia scored a role in a production of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, Joy relented. Lia “just lit up” about theater, her mom recalls. Joy figured, we had to let kids be kids. She took some consolation in the rules mandating universal masking.


	The masking, of course, didn't last long. Kids.


	On an otherwise unremarkable day in January 2021, Lia came home with what she described as a “very minor sore throat.” She isolated, per school policy, counting down the 10 days until she could return. On Lia's first day back, though, her throat was sore all morning. She threw up at lunch. Joy took her home early.

	“I was very confused,” Lia says. “I thought, ‘Am I still sick?'”


	“I thought it would go away,” she adds, “quickly.”


	It didn't. 


	Over the next three years, Lia would develop a perplexing, debilitating, and persistent set of symptoms. Extreme fatigue that turned mornings into catatonic nightmares. Brain fog that made memories slippery. Incessant vomiting. It all kept her out of class, stuck in the nurse's office — or out of school entirely. The straight-A's evaporated. 


	Lia's story is one I've heard from dozens of families over two years investigating the impact of long Covid on kids. It's a slow-moving spiral: first their health, then their grades, then their future. And as the country throttles past the pandemic's fifth anniversary, those for whom Covid looms very present are feeling increasingly forgotten, subject to pervasive skepticism and a kind of cultural fatigue when it comes to their illness.


	The Make America Healthy Again movement has recently gestured at embracing the long Covid community. In September, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) convened two roundtables with the stated purpose of bringing long Covid “out of the shadows,” including by launching a “public awareness and education campaign.” Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall — a physician with a loved one suffering from long Covid and who co-led the convenings — says those conversations were the first step to “take this invisible illness seriously.”

	But since the earliest days of the second Trump administration, the dollars that could help those suffering from the illness have quietly faded away. In March, cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) disappeared the nearly $2 billion invested in the RECOVER (Researching Covid to Enhance Recovery) initiative, hamstringing research that might have yielded diagnostic tests or better treatments. The same week, the administration shuttered the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Long Covid Research and Practice. 

	











	In April, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gutted the NIH's Vaccine Research Center — the entity whose work laid the foundation for the Moderna Covid shot. In May, health officials installed by Trump overrode career scientists at the Food and Drug Administration to limit approvals of new Covid vaccines. Around the same time, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. disavowed the vaccine for healthy kids and pregnant women. (“We're now one step closer to realizing President Trump's promise to make America healthy again,” Kennedy said in a video announcing the policy.) 


	In the weeks that followed, the secretary also removed every member of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with a merry band of loyalists and skeptics. That committee has since walked back recommendations for the Covid shot. And since the committee's suggestions only move forward with the approval of the CDC director, RFK Jr. fired Susan Monarez, whom he'd appointed to that role 29 days earlier, for her refusal to “commit in advance to approving every [committee] recommendation regardless of the scientific evidence,” as Monarez later testified at a Senate hearing.


	Then there was Trump's so-called Big Beautiful Bill, expected to boot tens of millions of Americans, including potentially one in five kids, off Medicaid. Where health insurance goes, vaccine access follows: Uninsured or partially insured children are less likely to get the shot, studies show. And unvaccinated children are up to 20 times more likely to develop long Covid.


	The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to requests for comment on how the measures taken since March could affect young people with long Covid. But in the lead-up to this school year, these developments led experts to warn that Covid cases may start ramping up again. That could have devastating effects in an education system beset by plummeting achievement levels and an epidemic of absenteeism (more than 10 million kids, or nearly one-third of all school-age children, regularly missed school last year). And for families already affected by long Covid, absence after absence is prompting threats of investigations for truancy that have led to children being removed from school altogether, either by choice or upon the advice of the district. 


	“Millions of Americans are impacted by long Covid, and they deserve a federal government that will have their back,” Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said in response to inquiries from Rolling Stone. “The Trump administration is not only failing to achieve those goals, but actively taking us in the wrong direction.” 

	











	It all suggests a brewing public health crisis for a generation of Americans — including people like Lia Corbitt, who, since 2022, has been largely in virtual education. That's left doting parents like Joy disheartened. 


	“When you have a disability people can't see, you don't get the same level of empathy,” Joy says. “It feels like the world has moved on.”


	THE CDC DEFINES LONG COVID as a wide array of chronic symptoms — including fatigue, difficulty concentrating, memory changes, and sleep disturbances — that began after an infection with the virus and last more than three months. The most recent data from HHS estimated that, as of December 2024, around 22 million American adults had the illness at some point. More than nine million were still sick with it by the end of 2023. 


	Data is harder to come by for children, who since the earliest days of the pandemic were noted to experience a wider-ranging and less predictable set of symptoms than adults. In February 2024, a paper published in the Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) estimated that up to 6 million children in the United States had suffered from long Covid at some point. A year later, CDC researchers put the figure at closer to one million, with 300,000 actively suffering from the disease; it also noted the numbers, based on national survey data, may significantly undercount the illness' true toll.


	Whichever figure you use, the numbers are enormous, rivaling conditions like ADHD and autism as one of the most common chronic diseases in American youth today. And for the children and teens I've spoken with, long Covid has done serious physical and emotional damage. It's also hindered their ability to participate in school — something that becomes an all-encompassing source of frustration for children and parents alike. 


	All of the students interviewed for this story were diagnosed with long Covid. And they all met the Department of Education's (DOE) eligibility criteria for specialized school accommodations because of their illness. It's a group that's ballooned in size: The number of children receiving specialized accommodations increased by 500,000 after the pandemic relative to before. 


	There's Alexander, in eighth grade when the pandemic hit, the adventurer extraordinaire from Massachusetts whose Covid-related exhaustion meant tardy after tardy — but who was denied accommodations because his grades were too good. 

	











	There's Eliza, a kindergartner in Washington state whose severe stomach pain constantly kept her out of school, but who was denied accommodations because the principal said that “we have great teachers here.” 


	There's ninth-grader William, a Mets fanatic from suburban New York, who was denied accommodations because school officials told him that “Covid is over.”


	Those struggles are despite a July 2021 joint statement from HHS and the Department of Justice clarifying that long Covid is a protected condition under the Americans with Disabilities Act. But early actions under the second Trump administration stand to further jeopardize their ability to access special education. An Inauguration Day executive order targeting DEI withdrew federal support through the DOE for learning loss caused by the pandemic, including from long Covid. (The rollbacks specifically targeted special education for Hispanic, Black, and tribal communities, whose children who faced higher rates of severe illness due to Covid, and who use special education at higher rates.) The Big Beautiful Bill's Medicaid cuts likewise stand to dry up billions more in special education dollars. 


	And should the Trump White House fulfill its campaign promises to axe the DOE entirely, billions of federal dollars upon which schools rely to support millions of children who need special education may vanish overnight. 


	WITHIN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, the legitimacy of long Covid has been a wellspring of controversy. 


	What the wide-ranging long Covid symptoms have in common is that they're a challenging combination of persistent yet intermittent, incapacitating yet invisible. Too often, especially for young people, that means adults — even doctors — “don't believe there's anything wrong with the child,” says Alexandra Yonts, a pediatric infectious disease specialist who is also the director of the post-Covid program at Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C. “They think they're being a teenager.” 

“I'm battling with the school because they don't believe anything is wrong with Dakota. They don't believe he has long Covid. They don't believe long Covid exists.”


	At various points, skeptical doctors have attributed the symptoms to a kind of neurosis: patient as hypochondriac, equipped with a fancy new diagnosis. “It is hard to know if this kind of long-tail phenomenon is more pronounced or more common [with Covid],” Adam Lauring, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Michigan, told The Washington Post in June of 2020, “or we are just seeing things that come to our attention because there is a heightened awareness.”


	Other doctors have chalked up the symptoms to a kind of societal malaise: patient as emotional sponge in a chaotic world, sickness quite literally all in their heads. “Whether long Covid can be considered just a consequence of a viral infection or should be attributed to the implications of ‘the pandemic era' we are now living in is still a matter of debate,” Achille Marino and Rolando Cimaz, pediatric rheumatologists at the University of Milan, wrote in 2022 in the journal of the European Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases.


	Some in the medical community have even called for dumping the diagnosis altogether. “It is time to stop using terms like ‘Long Covid,'” John Gerrard, former chief health officer of Queensland, Australia, wrote in a press release for a March 2024 study comparing symptoms of Covid patients to those with the flu. “This terminology can cause unnecessary fear, and in some cases, hypervigilance to longer symptoms that can impede recovery.”

	











	Another piece of the long Covid puzzle is a practical issue: getting diagnosed. 


	According to Elizabeth Pray, former president of Washington state's chapter of the National Association of School Nurses, who herself has cared for numerous kids with symptoms of long Covid, there are two major steps in the diagnostic odyssey. First, the child needs a documented Covid infection. Second, they need to find a doctor able — and willing — to make the diagnosis.


	But many kids may not have tested at the time of their infection, Pray says. Months into the pandemic, the U.S. faced severe shortages in Covid tests for everyone. Well into the winter of 2022, major retailers like CVS and Walgreens were still rationing tests to favor adults, who were at greater risk of severe illness and death. At various points, tests were restricted for kids under 16 years of age, and then under 12. 


	Even in kids who did test, studies show that up to 90 percent of cases can go missed due to differences in how kids' immune systems handle the virus. “If you have families that didn't test,” Pray says, “how would you tie it back to know how big the problem is?” 


	In the situation where a child does have a confirmed case, finding a doctor to ink the long Covid diagnosis can still be a challenge. According to the patient advocacy group Long Covid Alliance, there are fewer than a dozen long-Covid pediatric clinics across the country, compared with 400 adult clinics. That means many kids who live far from major medical centers — like Pray's students in Moses Lake, a town of 25,000 that's 200 miles from Seattle — won't ever be seen at such a clinic. 


	Dakota Presnell was one of those kids. 


	Before the blackouts, the vertigo, the sniffle, and the cough, Dakota's childhood in the seaside North Carolina vacation town of Manteo was idyllic. 

	











	He'd spend summers leaping off story-high footbridges and docks and jetties, and slipping down slides into the rollicking Atlantic surrounding Roanoke Island. In the off-season, he'd roller skate down deserted streets and frequent the laser tag arena or the bowling alley, playing one or the other until they closed up shop.


	Dakota was “a happy-go-lucky kid,” his mother, Michelle Hooker, says. “It was hard to keep him home … He was always on the go, always doing something.”


	Then, sixth grade. Winter 2021. Omicron.


	Dakota had gone back to school in-person and — like many who contracted Covid's most infectious variant — he was quickly bedridden, Michelle says. Of all his symptoms, the dizziness and fatigue were the worst. At one point, a friend told Michelle that she should “look into” long Covid; she'd bring it up time and time again with Dakota's pediatrician, to little avail.


	In the summer of 2022, the blackouts started. Out of nowhere, like a limp marionette, Dakota would drop to the ground. Michelle “became his legs,” she says, as she'd carry her son from room to room. By the fall his fatigue and fainting spells were a “complete and utter nightmare.” By January 2024, Dakota's symptoms also included memory loss and severe pain in his arms and legs that he couldn't shake. 


	Michelle says that, during this time, they went to loads of doctors — pediatricians, neurologists, the works — and racked up several hospitalizations where they were seen by still more clinical teams. They accrued loads of diagnoses: non-epileptic seizures, amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome, functional neurologic disorder.


	That last diagnosis, in particular, irked Michelle. “That's a fancy way of saying it's all in your head,” she says.


	Long Covid, she adds, never made the list.


	To Yonts, at Children's National, experiences like Dakota's are no longer surprising. She's heard story after story of undiagnosed patients who, by the time they make it to her clinic, have been seen by doctors who “think there's something else going on, [something] not physical.”


	At the same time, Yonts knows specialized long Covid clinics, including hers, can't see the vast majority of patients who request a visit: Their capacity is “woefully inadequate,” she says. “We've had really lengthy waitlists for most of our existence.”


	FOR KIDS LIKE DAKOTA suffering from long Covid, navigating school is a mess, too. 

	











	Under federal law, any student with a “physical or mental impairment” impacting their ability to participate in school is entitled to accommodations under a so-called 504 or an Individualized Education (IEP) plan. The DOE's language is deliberately inclusive: Such entitlements stand whether students are diagnosed with — or are “regarded to have” — any such impairment, William Koski, director of the Youth and Education Law Project at Stanford University, says.


	The accommodations provided under the plans can run a broad spectrum. They include everything from rest breaks to extra time to provision of quiet spaces for testing. They can also be more tailored: For example, for children with conditions that put them at risk of passing out — in which staying hydrated is critical — accommodations can include things like keeping pretzels or a water bottle at their desk. More intensive plans can include tutors or “changes to the curricular expectations” altogether.


	Since the onset of the pandemic, the number of school-aged students with IEPs has jumped. In the 2018-19 school year, 6.3 million children received special education services. In 2022-23, 6.8 million did. Still, some long-Covid families say they've been in the dark when it comes to accommodations. In some cases, they've faced pushback for seeking special education.


	That's true for people like Lia, who had a preexisting special education plan for ADHD, and who had, by then, a long Covid diagnosis. But Lia struggled to convince her school to provide additional accommodations for her fatigue, nausea, and frequent absences. After much back and forth, the school offered a compromise: She could have two extra days to hand in her homework. Oh, and she could go to the bathroom when she needed to. 


	“That was really the only change that they gave us,” Lia says.


	“If there had been other options,” Joy adds, “they weren't discussed or offered.”


	The obstacles to accommodations have been especially stark for people like Michelle and Dakota, who hadn't previously navigated special education, and who lacked a formal diagnosis of long Covid. It took more than three years before Michelle realized they could even seek help. “[The school] didn't give us any information,” Dakota says. 


	When they finally did hear through Facebook about the possibility of a 504 — and started pinging the school to advocate — things quickly became contentious.

	











	“I'm battling the school,” Michelle says, “[because] they don't believe anything is wrong with Dakota.” 


	(Dare County Schools, Dakota's district, did not respond to requests for comment.)


	To Laura Malone, pediatrician and director of the Post-Covid-19 Rehabilitation Clinic at Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, part of the trouble around accommodations traces back to lack of knowledge around the illness. “Long Covid is a newer diagnosis … [that] schools, education systems aren't as aware of,” Malone says.


	Michelle puts it more bluntly. “They don't believe he has long Covid,” she says of the school. “They don't believe long Covid exists.”


	AFTER MONTHS OF BATTLING, by the beginning of eighth grade in fall 2023, Dakota successfully got a 504 plan. Theoretically, that entitled him to extra time on tests and deadlines, as well as breaks throughout the school day. On paper, it was a version of school that retained a sense of normalcy while being feasible given his fatigue and brain fog. 


	Unfortunately, the text on paper didn't translate to real life, Michelle says. The plan “didn't do much — he was still expected to [take] all these classes, carry all of this homework, do the daily assignments,” she says. “It was kind of a B.S., fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants type answer.”


	In this way, Dakota and Michelle's experience reflects a different issue with learning accommodations: the difficulty implementing and enforcing them.


	One of the biggest pieces of the implementation issue is that of dogma, Kathy Riley, nurse at the Plymouth school district in Massachusetts and co-lead for the National Association of School Nurses' long Covid efforts, says. There are cases where teachers, much like some school officials, simply disagree with the notion that long Covid is real, or that kids with it need help. “The teachers have to buy into the accommodations … or it's not going to work,” Riley says. “If a teacher doesn't really agree with it, then the kid doesn't get it.”


	That gets into the problem of enforcement, which typically falls upon the districts themselves. The DOE's Office of Civil Rights “generally will not evaluate the content” of 504s or IEPs, the agency states on its website. Nor does it “review the result of individual placement or other educational decisions.” Instead, “any disagreement can be resolved through a due process hearing.” 


	But a 2019 report from the Government Accountability Office found that the ability and willingness of families to pursue such hearings varies widely due to language barriers, ability to find an attorney, legal costs, and fears of retaliation, among other factors. Such barriers were particularly marked in low-income school districts, which on average have more children of color, and which tend to have higher numbers of children with disabilities. 

	










At various points, skeptical doctors have attributed the symptoms to a kind of neurosis: patient as hypochondriac, equipped with a fancy new diagnosis.


	“Many parents feel they are at a disadvantage in a conflict with the school district due to an imbalance of power and so may be reluctant to engage in dispute resolution,” the report concluded. (The DOE did not comment on inquiries from Rolling Stone about the inability of students with long Covid to receive 504s or IEPs, or lack of enforcement of 504s or IEPs in cases where they are granted. )


	Recent reporting suggests that kids' access to special education may worsen further following widespread cuts to the DOE. In March, the administration hollowed out the department's Office of Civil Rights — including entire investigative teams in the majority of regions — leaving thousands of pending cases in limbo, according to the New York Times. And in May, ProPublica found that, in the period following the cuts, hundreds fewer ongoing cases were investigated, and new cases were dismissed outright at rates 30 percent higher than previously. 


	In late September, Maryland Sen. Angela Alsobrooks introduced a bill to exempt funding for special education from any future DOE cuts. “Any attempt to slash programs and protections for our students with disabilities is beyond callous,” Alsobrooks said in a press release. Still, by October — amid the government shutdown — mass layoffs were imperiling the DOE's ability to administer special education, department sources told ABC News. 


	To Dakota, politics shouldn't play a role in whether kids with long Covid get the support they need. That's true for teachers not following certain special education plans rather than others. It's also true for government-wide initiatives that pull out the rug from under children like him.


	“People are inclined to their opinion,” Dakota says, “but at the same time, in some situations, like [with] long Covid … opinions get in the way.”


	THE TUG-OF-WAR AROUND accommodations comes at a time when fewer American students are attending school than ever before.


	In January 2024, a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that chronic absenteeism — defined as the number of students missing at least one out of every 10 school days — nearly doubled following the Covid pandemic. Every state saw increases in chronic absenteeism, the study found: In total, nearly 30 percent — some 13 million children — regularly missed school.

	











	The alarm bells around the absenteeism crisis partly relate to learning loss. In January 2025, an annual Congressional analysis known as the “nation's report card” found that American students' achievement levels were declining to some of the worst in recent history.


	The alarm is also related to money. Attendance is one of the key factors that determines school funding in most states. That incentivizes schools to do what they can to make sure students show up, since absences can only hurt their bottom line. As a result, some districts are taking a punitive approach to chronic absenteeism. On one extreme is Missouri, where, following an August 2023 decision from the state's Supreme Court, parents of children with poor attendance records are now liable for jail time.


	A more common mechanism involves truancy. 


	States like Indiana are already moving to toughen truancy laws by introducing bills to tighten attendance requirements and immediately refer families for investigation in ways that can lead to prosecution of children, parents, or both. 


	Truancy hinges on defining an absence as unexcused. But that's a definition “really dependent on the school itself,” Christy McGill, deputy superintendent for educator effectiveness and family engagement for the Nevada Department of Education, says. 


	For example, some schools may require doctors' notes for every missed day, McGill says, while others do not. Studies have found that children of color were up to four times more likely to have their absences marked unexcused than those who were white.


Rolling Stone contacted every state's education department for this article, the majority of which did not respond to requests for comment. Most of those that did — Colorado, Kentucky, Oregon, and Utah among them — lack visibility into the reasons for excused versus unexcused absences. 


	Such variability worries Hedy Chang, executive director of Attendance Works, a national nonprofit organization focused on chronic absenteeism. “Unfortunately, across the United States, absences are too often deemed ‘unexcused' for arbitrary reasons,” she says.


	The lack of clarity around excused versus unexcused absences includes those potentially related to medical conditions such as long Covid. Even as large-scale reviews of children with long Covid find absenteeism to be a consistent issue, schools have little insight into whether poor attendance in their district may derive, in part, from kids struggling with the condition. “There's no question there could be long Covid symptoms out there we don't know about,” Eric Mackey, Alabama's state superintendent of education, says, “[but] I don't have any information on that.”


	(The DOE did not respond to inquiries from Rolling Stone about policies for determining unexcused absences or the initiation of truancy investigations. The agency also did not respond to inquiries about how schools should incorporate protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act into their policies around absences or truancy.)

	










“We've been beat up and chewed up, and it's not fair, because Dakota's falling through the cracks. His light is getting dimmer and dimmer — because he's losing hope.”


	Many of the families I spoke to, at one point or another, found themselves staring down threats of truancy. For some, those threats came via robocall after robocall. For Dakota and Michelle, they came in meetings with school officials. And for Lia and Joy, they came more insidiously. 


	“I always wondered what my teachers thought,” Lia says. “They knew I was sick — but did they believe me, [or] did they think I was making it up?”


	So, when Lia's medical waiver fell off seemingly overnight in the fall of 2022, Joy was concerned. If Lia missed 10 days of a given course, she'd automatically fail — if not worse, when it came to the specter of truancy.


	(Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, Lia's district, did not respond to requests for comment.)


	“I tried to communicate from the beginning that … there is no way, at this point, she is not going to miss more,” Joy says. “[But] it didn't matter. It felt like she was being punished for being ill.”


	AFTER MONTHS OF FRUITLESS morning wake-ups and early afternoon pickups, tardies and absences and missed assignments, months of blackouts and vomiting and forgetfulness and dozing off, Dakota and Lia were left with only one option: hybrid education. 


	Education outside the schoolyard has long been considered the option of last resort, Koski, at Stanford, says: Keeping kids with their peers “is one of the bedrock principles of … the disability rights movement.”


	Based on how their accommodations were implemented, though, the families I interviewed say they felt trapped. 


	In Lia's case, even as her 504 entitled her to two extra days to submit homework, she kept racking up absences for not bringing it to class on the original due date. And even as she and Joy heard through the grapevine that other students across the country struggling with long Covid were offered additional services, such IEPs that included hybrid school with teachers coming to their homes for in-person tutoring, she was never offered such a plan.


	“Given how the school was handling [accommodations], and their procedures, and their rules, I really had no choice but to switch to virtual school,” Lia says.


	That switch came with its own costs. She was always missing out: parties, prom, homecomings. She kept finding herself on the outside of inside jokes. She lost close friends, who accused her of being flaky, or avoiding them entirely. “It's still affecting me to this day,” Lia says.

	











	Dakota found himself in a similar spot when, this past summer — after Michelle finally had an opportunity to advocate for his special education plan — officials rendered a decision: Dakota would be enrolled at Dare Learning Academy, the district's “alternative” educational option. It was the worst of both worlds: simultaneously denying Dakota additional accommodations and punting him further to the margins. It also felt like confirmation of what his family had dreaded: that school officials saw him as undisciplined or unmotivated rather than sick. 


	To Michelle and Dakota, the decision felt premeditated: People “sometimes have their minds made up before we even see them,” Dakota says. 


	It's hard to know whether the experiences of kids like Lia and Dakota are becoming more common. The most recent data available from the DOE shows that the number of students in homebound or hospital-bound, residential facility, or separate school-based programs has stayed roughly stable since the pandemic. But that data doesn't account for the kind of hybrid education that became mainstream during the pandemic. (The DOE did not comment on inquiries from Rolling Stone about how students in hybrid school settings are counted.)  


	The longer-term consequences on a generation of struggling children taught without adequate support — or via hybrid education — are also not yet clear, says Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. But, based on what she's seen, she's afraid that “every community is going to pay the price in the long run.” 


	“We absolutely know the best place for a kid is in school,” Kressly says. In virtual education, she adds, “are we just putting them out of sight?” 


	Some parents — like Michelle — are already observing changes in their children.


	“We've been beat up and chewed up, no one's taken account for what they've done, and it's not fair, because he's falling through the cracks,” she says of Dakota. “As long as this goes on,” she adds, “his light is getting dimmer and dimmer — because he's losing hope.”


	Dakota, for his part, still has big dreams. He wants to live in a big city (Norfolk, Virginia), and work a demanding job (general surgeon). Dakota thinks he'll be good, too: “I know how to listen and take other people's opinions and worries into account,” he says.

	











	But Dakota also knows he faces long odds. And he knows how much his illness plays a role in that. “Long Covid has taken my life and turned it around,” Dakota says.


	Lia is also trying to concentrate on the future. 


	After she got into a pediatric long Covid clinic and began implementing a variety of different treatments — salt tabs day and night, electrolyte powder infused in every drink, this and that medication prescribed off-label — slowly but surely, she has been feeling better. So, she's got her eyes on the prize. A high school diploma. A college welcome weekend. Most recently, a beauty pageant title. 


	Even still, life looks different now. In particular, there's a void where her friends and classmates used to be. “I'm back,” Lia says, “and at the same time, so much has changed, because I've missed out on so much.”


	This fall, she was excited to make a fresh start at college. New place, new people, new her. A her that feels like the real her. Not the long Covid version. 


	College “is a place where no one really knows me,” Lia says. “I can start over — and kind of, maybe, separate myself from the illness a little bit.”

	Following the news of Diane Keaton‘s death, her family has confirmed that the beloved Oscar winner died of pneumonia on Saturday at the age of 79.


	“The Keaton family are very grateful for the extraordinary messages of love and support they have received these past few days on behalf of their beloved Diane, who passed away from pneumonia on Oct. 11,” read their statement to People.


	The Oscar winner's family also shared a passion that was close to her heart, writing, “She loved her animals and she was steadfast in her support of the unhoused community, so any donations in her memory to a local food bank or an animal shelter would be a wonderful and much appreciated tribute to her.”


	From her breakthrough role in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather to her lovable performance as a divorced playwright in Nancy Meyers‘ Something's Gotta Give, Keaton mastered everything from rom-coms to drama throughout her prolific career. 


	Hollywood has mourned her passing, with stars and co-stars alike sharing tributes on social media in remembrance of her. Jane Fonda, who co-starred alongside Keaton in Book Club and its sequel, Book Club: The Next Chapter, posted a photo of a smiling Keaton on Instagram. “She was always a spark of life and light, constantly giggling at her own foibles, being limitlessly creative … in her acting, her wardrobe, her books, her friends, her homes, her library, her world view,” Fonda wrote in the caption. “Unique is what she was. And, though she didn't know it or wouldn't admit it, man she was a fine actress!”

	











Coppola also honored Keaton's memory, writing in a statement, “Words can't express the wonder and talent of Diane Keaton. Endlessly intelligent, so beautiful. Everything about Diane was creativity personified.”

	One of the first things you'll see upon entering the ornate terminal at Washington, D.C.'s Union Station are gaggles of National Guard troops loitering about, clad in full tactical camo. Most look bored, a hand slung casually over the rifle they're now authorized to carry, a suspicious eye on the teenagers milling about the food court in the after-school rush. Wander around the city and you'll encounter similar gaggles posted up at almost every major point of interest, as well other federal forces whose agents have for months now been brutalizing anti-ICE protesters around the nation.


	They're there because Donald Trump has prioritized a physical and legal crackdown against his political opposition, one that has primarily targeted Democratic cities and lawmakers. The administration has recently directed its attention toward protesters, free speech, and liberal nonprofit groups, in particular, with the president signing an order labeling anti-fascists a domestic terror group, and a memo targeting “anti-Christianity,” “anti-capitalism,” and “anti-Americanism,” as the administration sees them. The goal appears to be to make existence miserable for activist groups and organizations that support resistance to Trump's authoritarian power grab.

	











	It may all come to a head this weekend as millions across the country prepare to march in the second iteration of the “No Kings” protest. Over 2,500 events have been planned across the United States and abroad, with some of the largest expected to take place in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and, of course, Washington, D.C.

	The Republican ecosystem has been working hard to demonize the protest movement ahead of this weekend's demonstrations, adopting Trump's framing of his opposition as anti-American terrorism. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy appeared on Fox Business and described the more than 2,500 protests that are expected to take place across the country and in cities abroad as “part of antifa” and  “paid protesters.” House Speaker Mike Johnson called the planned events a “a hate America rally,” adding that “the pro-Hamas wing and the, you know, the antifa people, they are all coming out.”

	House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) also referred to the event as a “hate America rally,” Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) called potential participants part of the “terrorist wing” of the Democratic Party, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claimed the protests would be stocked with the “hardest core” members of the left. Rep. Pat Harrigan (R-N.C.) even called it a “blue hair, anthropomorphic experiment,” during a Wednesday appearance on Fox Business. 


	No Kings is a coalition of grassroots demonstrations bolstered by liberal and left-leaning advocacy groups. The first No Kings event in June drew as many as six million participants nationwide, according to estimates. The protests took place the same day Trump hosted an awkward attempt at a military cortèges, in the style of the autocratic leaders he admires, on the National Mall. At the time, organizers told Rolling Stone that in order to defeat a tyrant “you need to have a visible demonstration that Americans are against authoritarian overreach.”


	In the intervening months, the organizations involved in the No Kings have been building up their coalition, and training activists and partner organizations on how to weaponize principles of “strategic non-cooperation” against the administration. 


	June's protests were almost universally peaceful across the country, and organizers tell Rolling Stone that they expect the second iteration of the event to go off in much the same way. But they are not blind to the reality that the events will be taking place amid Trump's sweeping crackdown against anti-ICE protesters in major Democratic cities, and that Republicans are openly attempting to brand opposition to the president as terrorism.

	“This is about one thing and one thing only: to score political points with the terrorist wing of their party, which is set to hold […] a hate America rally in D.C. next week,” Emmer said Friday of the upcoming protests. 

	











	“[We] want to be out there carefully, peacefully speaking our minds,” Lisa Gilbert, co-president of Public Citizen — one of the organizations participating in the No Kings coalition — tells Rolling Stone. “The one thing we cannot be in this moment is cowed by what [Trump] is threatening, and we won't be bullied into fear and silence in this moment.” 


	The Trump administration's escalation of its campaign against Democratic and progressive nonprofits followed the assassination of right-wing activist and organizer Charlie Kirk — even though senior law enforcement officials don't believe Kirk's killer was working with any organization on the left, with one senior administration official recently telling Rolling Stone the prospect was “never on anyone's radar.”   


	“I think it's very clear that they're lashing out because they fear this kind of peaceful, organized people power, and that's true of authoritarian regimes all over the world,” says Ezra Levin, co-founder of Indivisible — a progressive activist group focused on peaceful resistance to the Trump regime.


	Administration officials have told Rolling Stone that they intend to make Trump's enemies, including progressive groups, “suffer,” while another source said that White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller declared the administration to be “at war” with left-leaning groups. Some in the administration have compared the strategies they want to use to go after these groups to those used in the “war on terror,” as they put it.


	Levin dismissed Republican attempts to rebrand Saturday's events as “hate America” rallies. 


	“They understand that the phrase ‘No Kings' is so damn popular that they should avoid mentioning it, so they're trying to come up with other ways to refer to it,” he says. “[It's] encouraging that they're taking note and worried about what a peaceful display of the people's power is going to do to their own image […] and then part of it is serious. They are coming after our First Amendment rights, and that's the whole point of doing this protest.”   


	Trump has recently made a public spectacle of openly targeting some of his most prominent critics in recent weeks, and even escalated his rhetoric toward suggestions of the necessary annihilation of his political opposition. Jimmy Kimmel was briefly pulled off the air after direct threats from the FCC against the ABC News, with Trump threatening to sue when Kimmel was reinstated, and openly suggesting that his other critics in the entertainment world should watch their backs. The president has also filed a series of frivolous — but financially punitive — lawsuits against major networks and media outlets, including the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, for reporting he believes makes him look bad. Trump even flat-out bragged that “we took the free speech away” earlier this month while signing an executive order aimed at punishing anyone who burns the American flag. 

	











	“If the first No Kings was about pushing back on Trump's image as a strong man on [the day of] the ridiculous military birthday parade he threw for himself,” Levin adds. “This one is a reaction to the invasion and occupation of American cities, the crackdown on comedians and other peaceful protests, and the bullying of media institutions and political opposition.”


	The GOP's alarming rhetoric about the protest movement is coming straight from Trump, who has characterized anything and everything that opposes him — from comedians to the news organizations — as a threat to America, and something to be discarded. Earlier this month, he complained that Republicans had “to take care of this little gnat that's on our shoulder called the Democrats” during a speech at the Norfolk Naval base. Days before, he told senior military leaders gathered at Quantico that “America is under invasion from within. We're under invasion from within. No different than a foreign enemy, but more difficult in any ways because they don't wear uniforms. At least when they're wearing a uniform you can take them out.”


	Gilbert notes that the entity putting Americans at risk is not the protest movement, but the administration itself: “The authoritarian intensity that we've seen from this administration has just doubled our desire to be out there and to do everything we can do. Which is to litigate, organize, fight back, and mobilize people to do more in this moment.”  


	On the insinuation that the protests are being stocked with paid attendees or receiving funding from extremist boogeymen, something Trump and Republicans in Congress like Ted Cruz says needs to be investigated, Gilbert laughs. “These are locally supported events by community members and leaders. It is not funded centrally in any way,” she says. “We are not funding 2500 events around the nation.”

	“Nonprofits are another forum where they are attempting to silence dissent, and it's un-American, and it's appalling, and that's a big part of why we're actually out there right now,” she adds. 


	No Kings cannot predict exactly how many people will turn out at home and abroad on Saturday, but with over 2,500 planned events, the turnout is expected to exceed their first day of protest in June. “There is no other way to protect your constitutional rights other than exercising them,” Levin says. On Saturday — in communities big and small — millions of Americans will do exactly that.

O
ne day in 2013, Jack Antonoff was sitting in a car in Los Angeles with his friend Hayley Williams when he decided to play her a new song. Back then, Antonoff was best known as a member of the band Fun., and he hoped to release the track, “I Wanna Get Better,” as the first single for a new solo project, Bleachers. The song — a “fucking life story in three minutes,” as Antonoff has called it — defiantly addressed a series of personal traumas that shaped his identity. Getting Williams' seal of approval was a big deal.


	“It was one of the first songs that I really loved that spoke to mental health in the way that it did,” Williams recalls. “I needed to say [what the song said], but someone else had to say it for me, in a way.” As she relates the memory, she and Antonoff are sitting across from each other in a studio in Queens one July afternoon, just days after she joined Bleachers onstage at the Newport Folk Festival.

	











	The pair have been in each other's lives for two decades. Antonoff saw Williams' band, Paramore, play its first festival show, at New Jersey's Bamboozle (formerly Skate and Surf) in 2005. Williams was a fan of Antonoff's band Steel Train; she even wore one of their buttons in a photo shoot back in the day (“My biggest button,” she notes). After the first Fun. album came out indepen­dently in 2009, she sent it to Fueled by Ramen co-founder John Janick (now running the powerhouse label Interscope Records), who later signed the band. “I didn't know that,” Antonoff says when she mentions this. “I don't get to be anywhere without that move.”

	











	Fun. opened for Paramore in 2010, just as the headliner's latest album, Brand New Eyes, created a massive pop-crossover moment. During that tour, Williams would spend time with Antonoff at the catering table, avoiding the drama brewing behind the scenes within her own group. “Our band was super fun to hang out with then,” she says sarcastically.

	“You were fun to hang out with,” he says. “We just thought you were super friendly.”


	In each other they saw an immediate kinship: Both had cut their teeth in DIY rock scenes, learning how to play, write, and build community in Franklin, Tennessee (for Williams), and New Jersey's Bergen County (Antonoff). Both have come a long way since: Paramore became one of this century's biggest bands, and Williams' powerhouse stage presence and voice have inspired everyone from Billie Eilish to Lil Uzi Vert. With Paramore on a break, Williams, 36, self-released an excellent raw solo album this summer, Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party, which arrives as a physical release on Nov. 7 with two additional songs, for a 20-track album.


	Antonoff, 41, has become one of the most prominent hitmakers on the charts, working on everything from Taylor Swift smashes to Kendrick Lamar's GNX; this year alone, he was instrumental in Sabrina Carpenter's Man's Best Friend and Doja Cat's Vie. With Bleachers, he's collaborated with heroes like Bruce Springsteen while turning his band into a live juggernaut. Coming off the success of last year's fantastic self-titled Bleachers LP, Antonoff has never felt more sure about who he is. (In addition to this story, you can also catch Antonoff and Williams at Rolling Stone‘s Musicians on Musicians: Live event at the Beacon Theater on Oct. 23.)


Williams: When you were playing “I Wanna Get Better” at Newport, I felt so emotional about it. It's such an introspective song, but it's so triumphant-sounding. I got really emotional thinking about where you were at in your life and your career when you [first] showed me that, versus what I've watched you do [since].

	We've been able to grow through so many seasons of our careers. I feel like I've gotten to watch and have you support me in these ways. Even though “I Wanna Get Better” wasn't the first Jack song I ever heard, it's the one [where], to me, you really put a stake in the ground.


Antonoff: It's the first song I wrote where I was like, “Man, you can all fuck off.” What's the first song you wrote where you were like, “This is it”? Like, “If you crack me open, this is the music that would shoot out”?


Williams: I had a lot of those moments when I was writing [Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party]. And some of that is because I would write the lyrics and feel really uncomfortable about it, but then the processing all happened a lot quicker for me this time around. I would look back at three weeks ago and be like, “Oh, my God, that's what that meant.” … I had that with “Whim.” That song explains so much about how I view relation­ships, and I think my downfall in them and the tendency to sabotage. I saw the lyrics printed on something recently, and I was like, “Those could go on my epitaph, and I'd be OK with it.”


Antonoff:This whole new album feels like being in a room with you more than anything else you've ever made.

	











Williams: That's the coolest compliment.


Antonoff: It feels very conversational. That's the hardest thing to do. I think it's very easy to be unclear. There's so much armor in being unclear.


Williams: I think that's why, in my mind, I wish I was more poetic in this or that way. Because the thought is I will feel like I'm cloaked in something but maybe still get to be cool-artist vibe. But I think it's just not natural.


Antonoff: The whole album, there's so many moments where I'm like, “Whoa, she said that.” It's what it's like to actually talk to someone, which, I think, is something we're all reclaiming.


Williams: We're saying nothing if we're not cringing a little bit, saying the uncomfortable thing.…


Antonoff: The album gave me this feeling which I've been having about music. In this hellscape of only marketing, marketing, marketing, it's become very clear what matters and what doesn't. [The album] made me feel happy.


Williams: That's so sick. Thank you. We got to experience this coming from the scenes that we came from, and the kind of music that really kick-started us. It's so communal, and you're always being fed by and feeding back into the community. When the world feels the way it does, I find myself wanting to plug back into what's local. I'm wanting to go to smaller shows. I'm wanting to feel like I can see the blood and the bone.


Antonoff: Yeah, this is our version of every motherfucker on Earth making sourdough and trying to find a yard to plant stuff in.


Williams: The modern world drives you back underground in a weird way.


Antonoff: When I was younger, we were like, “TV rots your fucking brain.” Now it's quaint. If someone was like, “You wanna watch a movie together?” I'd cry. Watching a movie with someone at their house would be equivalent to the Sixties version of lying in a field …


Williams: … like, line dancing. Especially sans any other screens.


Antonoff: Dude, I'm only happy if I have something on TV, something on my laptop, [and] I have my phone. My partner [Margaret Qualley] meditates and stuff. She's not sick that way.

	











Williams: I hate to say I'm with you. I really romanticize the version of myself that is not like that.


Antonoff: When you're [onstage], you're fulfilled.


Williams: I am fulfilled. But I think that my extracurricular activities … I'm starting to see the rotting effects. This is where I have to decide that if I want to be a musician for the rest of my life, I have to be like I was at 16 and just practice more and hang out in my room with my instruments more and not rot away.


Antonoff: It's really fun to rot.


Williams: But I'm tired of the news. There's days you're just like, “I have to get away.”


Antonoff: That's why I go to the studio so much, because it really — I'm not thinking about anything else.


Williams: You're locked in.


Antonoff: Where do you lock in?


Williams: I lock in when I'm writing. It's nice because we'll start a lot of times by digging through my notes and seeing what unhinged shit I wrote down when I wasn't thinking about it. I really enjoy it as a writing prompt, almost.… When there's a thread that you start to pull and there's something there, there's a purity that I'm always chasing. I haven't really found it in any other hobby or passion. Do you ever feel ashamed of that?

“Good things are made by a tiny group of people seeing the same thing together.”


Antonoff: I used to feel more. But it's been my whole life.… It's just what I do, it's what I think about doing, what I look forward to doing, and it's what I spend my time trying to preserve [so] that I can keep doing it. Which, on one hand, it's the most glorious thing. It's also kind of pathetic to not have a well-rounded life.


Williams: I feel that way too. Zac [Farro, Paramore's drummer] is so good at tennis. It's a secondary passion he thrives in the way he thrives in music. I admire it so much. There's nothing [else] that gives me that feeling.


Antonoff: I think it's OK. Sometimes it's about breaking it down in the simplest sense, which is: That's just what you do. And if you spend your life doing that, that would be a life worth having been lived. It gets bad if you start to distort. If you're spending a certain amount of time in the studio or on the road and that causes you to take too many drugs or isolate or hurt your brain or body … But you're one of the more functional people I know.


Williams: Huge compliment. I don't feel that, but …


Antonoff: I think feeling it is the first step to being an actual fucking insane person. “I am functioning” is, like, one minute before you walk into the water [laughs]. Also, I think this comes from the scenes we were raised in, but not everyone plays like it's their last fucking night on Earth. But I see that [in you], and it reminds me of being a kid at the Wayne Firehouse [a DIY venue in New Jersey]. And it's like, “This is the last show on Earth.”


Williams: Every show really does feel like [it could be] the last one.


Antonoff: Me too, which is really hard on my body.… I've talked to Springsteen about this because he plays it like fucking last night on Earth every night. And he can still do it.

	











Williams: He's ripped.


Antonoff: I'm not gonna age like that. You will.


Williams: No, no, no. I'm a twig. I'm gonna just disintegrate into thin air.


Antonoff: Not how I see it. But we were talking about deep jealousy of people whose job it is to hunch over the piano and make everyone weep. It was interesting to hear [Springsteen] say, “Yeah, it's not fucking easy,” because I look at him like a brick wall. But it's so painful to play like that. It always has been! It's not an age thing.


Williams: It's traumatizing, unless you're used to it. The biggest and hardest lesson has been when I have to recover my voice. The body stuff is one thing, but as long as I'm moving and sleeping, I'll be OK. My voice though, oh, my God.


	This just sends me into an entirely different direction, and I want to know: Do you feel disconnected from your body a lot as an artist?


Antonoff: I have no connection with my body, besides a really strange relationship to food, which I also think is birthed from touring. Zero connection to my body. And I get hurt a lot when I play.

“I want to be in 100 bands before I die. I like that feeling of being in a room with people.”


Williams: You live up here [points to her head]. Everything's kind of going on up here, whether it's creativity, worry, all of it?


Antonoff: A lot of gut. I live heavily here [points to his stomach]. I feel kind of like a question mark in my gut.… Do you have that?


Williams: I do think that I have a neurotic connection to my body where I will start to stress about something and it will instantly show up in my throat or in my stomach. It's like when good things are happening—


Antonoff: Other shoe dropping.


Williams: The piano falling from the sky.


Antonoff: And not a Jew, which is interesting because that's a big thing in my culture.


Williams: For me, my connection to it is sort of skewed. I have food stuff too. I'm always interested in this with artists because we actually have access to such a great release for our energy. That could be through writing lyrics. It could be through moving the way we move onstage.… I think that's energy moving through us.


Antonoff: That's a way bigger [release] than I've ever gotten from trying yoga or things like that. But then I get in trouble, because after I play, I feel like I've conquered the world, and I eat everything, and then I get really sick.


Williams: I want artists to talk about that stuff more. My mom teaches about this kind of stuff at Belmont [University] in Nashville, and it's a lot about emotional intelligence and awareness in other ways. I'm always really interested when she talks about the body. Anything in my life that happens, it'll show up as acne, as nausea, it'll show up as [pain in] my shoulder. I think those are just messages, right?

	











Antonoff: We grew up in a very similar way. Do you ever feel like your origin story gets rewritten [by others]?


Williams: Yeah … I don't think anyone has ever gotten the storyof our band right. At this point, it's just fun.


Antonoff: Same with me. I feel like we can relate to this because you make a few pop records and all of a sudden it's like, “No, you didn't grow up in that place. You didn't grow up playing [American] Legion halls.” I just did! I've been honestly writing about it for the first time.


Williams: It's far more interesting than being in the pop world.


Antonoff: It was the most interesting thing in the world.


Williams: I still die on the sword of the way we grew up, the scenes we grew up in. Even if I kind of hate so much about it.


Antonoff: There's so much I hated about it. I was talking with someone in their early twenties and I was like, “There was so much messed-up stuff when I grew up, but I also had so much to push against.” You didn't go to a show without a can of food. Everything was Food Not Bombs. It was so early [to be introduced] to the concept of activism and music and all this stuff.


	I love the idea that we listen to young people more, but it also must be so hard to be an angry 15-year-old and an adult's like, “What do we do with the Indigenous?” You're like, “I don't know what to do!” A lot of people I know have kids that are teenagers, and they're demanded to have answers on things that robbed them of the opportunity of being kind of a little bitch.

“I felt like I always got blamed for the shit that would go on in our band.”


Williams: What an important time of life, just to get to be a little bitch. I saw the Linda Lindas [L.A. punk band that ranges in age from 15 to 21] play in Nashville … and I was like, holy shit. What would it have been like to be that age and have my parents understand everything that I'm talking about?


Antonoff: I was so angry.


Williams: Yeah, me too.


Antonoff: But also, not to knock anything they got going on, but having that subculture was my whole feeling.


Williams: It's the whole foundation to …


Antonoff: … push against.

	











Williams: I watch what you do and you're involved in so many different things. I always can feel the same heartbeat in it. I stay so proud watching you because I know a lot about where you came from and what that feels like, and I can still see it in every move that you make. I think that's what I'm looking for all over the place in our industry. Right now, we're in such an interesting time to me, that there are so many artists that are having a moment that have been around for so long. Charli [XCX], Turnstile. I feel like I'm getting to watch my favorite movie.


Antonoff: The stuff we always thought would live under the surface has totally broken through.


Williams: It's influenced pop culture in such a way. When I was at the Turnstile show at Under the K Bridge [in New York], I had this moment like, “Hardcore kids are running the music industry, and I'm in love with it.”


Antonoff: The last time I saw them I was like, “This looks like a Kid Dynamite show.” The way everyone's moving is really remarkable. The aesthetic of real artists or a real band is so back, which is sort of a funny concept, but it leaves a lot of space for people who can actually do it. I meet so many people [where] the aesthetic of a band is interesting to them, but a band is a very long thing.


Williams: We could talk about that forever. I'm on the opposite end, feeling out what it means to be someone that only ever wanted to be part of that, not for the aesthetic, but because of the safety of it.


Antonoff: The safety is the best. You move as a unit. You're like a gang.


Williams: I don't know how to live any other way.


Antonoff: But you kind of are a band even when you're solo. The feeling is very communal.


Williams: There's no point to me otherwise. I made this record, and it kind of feels like it just exploded out. It does feel right to put it out under my name. But I think I have to exercise saying that I feel like it's the last record I'll do under my name, and I feel proud of that. I want to be in 100 bands before I die. I like that feeling of being in a room with people and something that didn't exist becomes a thing that you're all holding.


Antonoff: Yeah, the one plus one equals a million [thing]. Why I like producing records is the idea that two things come together and then something new happens. I don't understand why anyone argues in the studio. Just leave. I think of it like flying a plane. We can't be arguing.


Williams: I agree. You know our band [Paramore], and you grew up around us. We've had more than our fair share of drama. Our manager would always be like, “Communication is the most important stuff in any rela­tionship.” He's been saying that to us since we were 16. When you think you've figured that out, a few years go by and you have to refigure that out.…


	This is insane to bring up in an interview of this magnitude. But I genuinely felt like I always got blamed for all the shit that would go on in our band, and I never knew if it was [because] I'm the singer. But also at the time, I'm a young girl, and people don't understand young girls.

“Live music is bigger than ever. People are fucking going to shows.”


Antonoff: And the only girl the whole time, right? You never had another woman in the band, right?


Williams: Maybe randomly for live stuff, but no, never in the band. At times, I wore that like a badge of honor. “I can handle this, and I want to protect the whole.” But my attitude, whether it's in the studio [or] the live setting, is I know what I like, and I want to contribute that to it. But I also just love when the vibe is good and everyone's happy.


Antonoff: It makes so much better work.…


Williams: I do have a question about working alone, or how you know when something is for you versus how you delegate it to a collab­orative setting. I'm still kind of figuring that out because, like I said, I would much rather be with other people.


Antonoff: Most of the time [when] I'm working with other people, I'm just coming in and working on their stuff. I'm always working on my own stuff. Once in a while, I'll be working on an album, and have an immediate gut reaction, which is: Would I be sad to lose it? And if the answer is yes, then it's mine. And if the answer is no, then it's a cool thing I made that's not attached to anything.

	











Williams: You ever give something to someone and then take it back?


Antonoff: No … Oh, yes! Too salacious to get into.


Williams: OK, wow …


Antonoff: But I also don't really do that. When I say “give something to someone,” I'm talking about a chord or production idea. I've never written a song and been like, “Here.” Because I wouldn't be able to really finish the song if I wasn't gonna sing it myself. And also, I don't work with anyone who isn't a songwriter.


	One of the funniest things about my job is this total distortion of how it works. People have this idea of how records are made. I think it's at once hilarious, but probably mostly rooted in misogyny, because I notice the differences of who I'm working with and how people interact with me about it.


Williams: Oh, yeah.


Antonoff: It's insane, because I've never seen so much passion about something. I know firsthand — you weren't there. There were three people there. I'm doing a thing with me, Laura [Sisk, his engineer], and then usually one person or two. It's the most tiny space.… It's so odd to me how everyone has such a clear assumption on how it happened, and [they] weren't there. No one was there. When I eat something amazing, I'm not like, “Here's what they did.”


	It's been the weirdest experience of my life to go to a place every day and to do a thing almost like a meditation and to have the story of that thing be completely untold, which is how I like it. I don't want it told. The truth is incredibly uninteresting because the magic is kind of within.


Williams: I feel that way too. I try to film as much as I can. I like to open my computer and have Photo Booth running when I'm writing something, especially if I'm making something with a friend. But I'm still really new to it. You just launched yourself into collab­orations with a lot of different people, and it always felt really true to you. Whereas I would say no to every opportunity to co-write for the longest time. I just didn't want to leave the bubble that we had created with Paramore.


	At the same time, now I'm 36 — 20 years or so into my career — and I'm realizing I don't actually have much experience collaborating outside of this world. There's a hungry part of me that I'm definitely willing to feed and try, but it comes with so much self-doubt. Do you still get terrified?


Antonoff: If it's my music, it's terrifying. But then when you find those people that see the thing you see, it's like this magic connection. When I work with other people, it's so obvious if it works or not. The work is incredibly intense.


Williams: Every relationship in my life is a slow burn. I made this album with [producer] Daniel [James].… When I finally decided to try this, it was such an instant [feeling of] “This is safe.” And also, “We're the same. We're the same kind.”


Antonoff: The only way good things are made is by a tiny group of people seeing the same thing together.


Williams: I'm feeling that so much around working on this project because it came from me not really being in a great place.… A few friends became a better label experience than I've ever had. And this is the first time I'm not on a label.

	











Antonoff: I let almost no one in, because it's such a vulnerable state. Doesn't matter who or what you've done in the past. All irrelevant. Every songwriter thinks they've written their last song. You never think you can do it again.


Williams: I wish it would change.


Antonoff: The room is so vulnerable, I feel like you can't let anyone in, because if someone comes in and is like, “Ooh, those drums,” you just, like, die.


Williams: I've loved tapping into the creativity of friends that I trust. If they said, “I don't know, have you thought about it this way?” it wouldn't suck the oxygen out. It would just refine something. That's also the importance of community. It's like the vulnerability part we talked about. The trust … Another thing that's really fun about being a part of a subculture is it kind of does narrow down — depending on the show I'm at, I'm like, “OK, we have similar values.” I feel so, like, held in, you know, tight by that.

“There's a lot of dudes that are gonna say weird shit to me. But I get to be here.”


Antonoff: Same.


Williams: I kind of just don't want anything else.


Antonoff: I don't want anything else. I just want to make sure everyone gets in [to the show] safely and doesn't get, like, completely destroyed by how much it costs.


Williams: Yeah, yeah, yeah. How are you gonna talk about that? How are you gonna tour?


Antonoff: The biggest thing I'm gonna keep doing is shouting about it, because live music is literally bigger than ever. That's a beautiful thing. People are fucking going to shows in a big way now.

	











Williams: I don't know if I just tuned back in or if it really is happening in a way again that feels more akin to what we grew up with.


Antonoff: For better or worse, I'm kind of always watching that part of it. I love touring and live music so much. If people aren't coming to your show, you ain't worth shit.… My Chem[ical Romance] are having the biggest tour ever right now.


Williams: It's really cool. They're really good guys.


Antonoff: I grew up with them. The best guys. So this thing is flour­ishing. Everyone wants to go see music, and there's so much for everyone to go around. Then there's a couple fucking people at top [who] just have to be like, “Nope.” And you fucking are left with what you're left with, which is people like us talking to the audience being like, “Hey, we're so sorry about the fake VIP line. Thanks for letting us know. Gonna shut it down.”


Williams: I lost a large chunk of my innocence the first time I realized that we had made enough money to get gas to go to the next show, but we had to give half of it to the venue. My dad was like, “This is America.”


Antonoff: I remember it too. I've seen it from every level. I know how hard it is to be someone who plays for no one. That's character building. What fucks me off is, why is drawing a few hundred people not an honest living? You and your band can't turn a profit, and then we have to watch the companies that own all these rooms and monopolize the whole fucking thing and post billions of earnings. Chill the fuck out, it's working. Everyone wants to come. It's not total anarchy.


Williams: The indie venues [struggling] thing is killing me. My favorite street in Nashville has been just obliterated.


Antonoff: It's so simple to me, and there's one answer that's never going to happen, which is [the corporations] have to make a little less money. I want everyone in that room [at a show] to feel like a fucking human being from beginning to end. I want it to be the best night ever. The last thing I want people to think about is how they're treated. I remember growing up — a bad security guard? They'd be gone. It would never happen. There was such protection over the literal vibe.


Williams: I remember getting heckled quite a bit. There was this one show at the North Star Bar [in Philadelphia]. I had a great show, but there was this guy that just kept saying really foul shit to me. I'm 16 … Someone heard this guy and just immediately took him outside. I heckled him back and shit, but I can only do so much. I'm trying to play a show.


	That night really impacted me, because [it showed] we take care of each other. There's a lot of bad apples. There's a lot of dudes that are going to say weird shit to me. That sucks. But I get to be here. I'm going to keep claiming the space, and the right people are going to make the space.


Antonoff: The culture of the audience is fucking everything.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q='unidentified+flying+objects'","Portraits of Alien Encounters Revisited","https://vocal.media/futurism/portraits-of-alien-encounters-revisited-cq9790zn9","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 15:03:05 GMT","

Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) and aliens are usually regarded as visitors from outer space who have travelled countless light years to reach our planet and plague people in the middle of the night, or frighten us on lonely highways.

 

In more recent years UFOs have been designated as Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon (UAPs) and those who control or operate them have been designated as non-terrestrial intelligences.

 

Instead of wrestling with theories and speculation, Nigel Watson has spoken directly with ‘ordinary' people in the United Kingdom who have reported seeing or communicating with UFOs and alien entities and a wide range of other startling associated phenomena, all of which is usually considered to be too far-fetched or ‘crazy' to be investigated.

 

Nigel's decades-long research shows how a simple sighting of a light in the sky can escalate to sightings of alien entities, robots, men in black and angelic beings. 

 

UFO witnesses and experiencers can also be plagued by a life-changing poltergeist or other ghostly experiences, telepathic messages, alien communications, strange coincidences, visions of the future, and abductions.

 

One such case involved schoolboy Paul Bennett and his friends who in the 1970s, near their homes in Wrose, Bradford, West Yorkshire, often saw UFOs and had other ghostly experiences. In October 1975 they had a few UFO-related encounters at the nearby Idle Hill reservoir. The first time they saw a glowing red, cigar-shaped object directly over the reservoir and a few days later a glowing green object was seen hovering over the same location. More dramatically, sandwiched between these incidents Paul and friend saw a large green robot scooping up soil samples with its clawed arms. 

 

The remarkable thing about what he called the “Wrose Monster” was that it hovered above the ground and had two very thin stilt-like legs and two small plate-like feet. The head had no eyes, nose, mouth, ears or hair, but looked just like a thick, solid ball of green metal. Paul threw some stones at the thing and only one of them hit. It made a “ping” sound, as if it had hit metal. There was no retaliation from the robot and after a few minutes it disappeared from view.

Like Paul, Stefan Lobuczek has had a lifetime of strange experiences and alien encounters, which seem to run in his family. Unlike many abductees who are spiritually uplifted by their alien contacts, Stefan's experiences are deeply troubling to him.

 

In 1970, when he was 11-years-old, he felt a strange presence in his bedroom.

As an adult, he recalls that he felt a strange presence. Then, a beam of intense light lifted him through his bedroom window and deposited him inside a nearby UFO. Here Stefan found himself naked on a metal examination table. Looking down on him were several aliens. 

 

Stefan said, “There were the tall thin ones, which I always think of as the Pink Panthers, but without the tail, they had big black eyes and they floated about a lot. The other being's [sic] of which there seemed to be more were short grey and wrinkly and had a pungent odour I can't begin to describe.”

 

A silver object was put in his arm and he felt a terrible pressure inside his head. And an alien, who looked like a Pink Panther cartoon character, reassured him via telepathy that he would be returned home soon.

 

Paula Green also talks about her experiences that began when she was 6-years-old in 1977. Her first UFO encounter occurred in October 1983, when she was 12-years-old, as she was walking through Judy Woods, Bradford, with a friend. The object was a strange 30 feet (9m) high structure with a boomerang-like arm that slowly rotated in a clockwise direction.

 

She said that when the object bathed them in a pale blue light; “Everything went in slow motion; it was like a horror movie. I remember turning to my friend and saying ‘F****** run!' I had to drag her as she was so terrified and awed.” On getting home she was shocked he was very late and she had “lost” four hours of time. 

 

Over ten years ago Paula had an abduction experience where she found herself in a moulded, round room. She said: “I was sat in a chair, eyes focussed on a screen. People were sitting near me. The totally glass screen was a bit bigger than an iPad. It showed scenery with a 3-D effect. It showed landscapes with rivers, birds and flowers in glowing vivid colours. It was a flow of pictures but no people were in them. They made me feel very happy and elated. Then there was devastation.”

 

 

 

On a wider scale Nigel looks at the Liverpool Leprechaun scare that erupted in July 1964, which mainly involved gangs of children. These “leprechauns” were described as “little green men in white hats throwing stones and tiny clods of earth at one another.” Similar child-orientated scares of this type are included in the book along with close encounters reported by children.

 

Other cases deal with adults who have had telepathic messages and communications with aliens. Norman Harrison, who lived in Sheffield in the late 1970s, claimed the stars of Betelgeuse IV, V and VI in Orion are the location of the fifth race of aliens, and a sixth populates the constellations of Ursa Major and Cassiopeia. This race occupies the solar systems of Merak, Alcor, and Dubhe in the Ursa Major constellation. The whole race is linked in a confederation and their colonies are densely populated. Other than being humanoid, Norman does not describe the appearance of these two races.

 

He went on to say: “All these aliens have spacecraft capable of exceeding light velocity several times over and have the facility to set up impenetrable force fields as well as invisibility shields. They make use of unimaginably advanced energy propulsion technology and have extremely powerful electromagnetic – gravitic (sic) devices at their disposal, all capable of effecting vital changes in this world. Force fields and rays are extensively utilised at enormous distances: in spite of the long distance these are resolved to fine focus and can be intensified as required to influence the course of events on Earth.

 

“Many of their Earth contingents are military task-force or scientific field operatives. The remainder engaged in collating or compiling vital information, making regular operational shuttle trips and submitting data reports to their base planets.”

 

These stories might seem like science fiction or the very stuff of nightmares, yet they are sincerely told by people of different age groups, social backgrounds, and locations.

 

The cases examined in this book do not supply any objective proof for the existence of any kind of physical extra-mundane vehicles darting about in our skies, but they do prove the fundamental influence and impact this phenomenon has on us. Rather than manipulate the evidence to support any hypothesis, Nigel illustrates the many hidden facets of the UFO experience.

 

Whatever the answer, if there is any one answer, Portraits of Alien Encounters Revisited is a fascinating look at how UFO experiences have evolved in the UK and reflect similar worldwide changes in our relationship with the unknown.

Three sharp pings alerted Emily that the oven had completed its preheating cycle. Donning two protective potholders, she inserted a large tray of muenster cheese-topped chicken breasts and an equally large tray of thoroughly seasoned Brussels sprouts. Two blood orange Le Creuset pots began to bubble on the stovetop, prompting the sous chef to slightly turn down the heat.

A senior US Government official has confirmed ‘the existence of UFOs' in a new trailer, with a former official confirming the existence.

The revelation came from a teaser for an upcoming Prime Video documentary, The Age of Disclosure, which will focus on the belief that the existence of alien life has been covered up by the government for decades.

Presented by TV and Film producer Dan Farah, the doc suggests that the United States have been subject to an 80 year cover-up, and includes interviews with multiple senior government officials.

Advert

Amongst those shown to be interviewed in the trailer is Marco Rubio, the United States Secretary of State, and one of the highest-ranking members of the current US government.

Rubio, a major Donald Trump ally, appears in the documentary and states that UFOs have been spotted flying over restricted nuclear facilities.

The Secretary of State does not exactly suggest that these flying objects are silver saucers with green aliens hanging out the top, but in the trailer doesn't specify his stance on the investigations.

He says in the trailer: “We've had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities — and it's not ours.""

Advert

Rubio goes on to say that ‘even Presidents have been operating on a need-to-know basis'.

The most shocking revelation from the trailer however comes from Jay Stratton, a retired Defense Intelligence Agency official.

Stratton was the former director of the government's UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) Task Force and confirms that he has seen both alien craft and alien beings.

He says: “I have seen, with my own eyes, non-human craft and non-human beings.”

Advert

Farah previously spoke to Entertainment Weekly about the documentary, calling it the ‘biggest disinformation campaign in the history of the U.S. government.”

He went on to add: “Clearly, the facts around this topic have been covered up for 80 years and kept from the public, and every single high-level, credible person I interviewed did not think that was right.

“They knew that was the case, and they did not think it was acceptable.""

The film has been highly touted, but some who have seen it so far are skeptical about the claims.

Advert

Whilst Variety's Owen Gleiberman acknowledged that they ‘want to believe', they were not convinced by the arguments outlined in the doc.

The Hollywood Reporter's Daniel Fienberg points to the legitimacy of those interviewed, particularly Marco Rubio, before saying: “My problem with The Age of Disclosure isn't the lack of opposing voices.

“It's that there couldn't be experts debunking anything here. Nothing is proven, and thus nothing can be refuted.

“If somebody insists, without evidence, that there's an underground bunker somewhere with a thousand alien bodies and 50 alien spacecraft, it's impossible for anybody to refute.”

For those X-Files fans who want to believe and thus want to judge for themselves however, the documentary will release on Prime Video November 21.

The film will also get awards-qualifying theatrical screenings in Los Angeles, New York and Washington, D.C.

	A buzzy UFO documentary has landed distribution. 


The Age of Disclosure has earned a limited theatrical run in New York, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. to quality for Oscar season and an exclusive VOD streaming release on Prime Video. The theatrical and VOD date is Nov. 21, and the film is now available for pre-order.




	The documentary caused a stir and plenty of debate when it premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival in March. Its trailer received more than 22 million cross-platform views, which is said to be a record for a documentary. A new trailer for the project (below) was released Thursday.

The Age of Disclosure, by filmmaker Dan Farah, features on-record interviews with 34 current and former senior members of the U.S. government, military and intelligence community with direct knowledge of unidentified aerial phenomena. The film contends there has been an 80-year cover-up of the existence of non-human intelligent life and a secret war among major nations to reverse engineer UFO technology. The film comes amid a series of headline-making bipartisan Congressional hearings on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) calling for transparency about what the government might know about non-human intelligent life.

	Ever since SXSW, Joe Rogan has been a vocal supporter of the project gaining distribution, repeatedly urging streamers to pick up the film. “Amazing documentary, I really hope that gets released somewhere big,” Rogan has said. “Very well done. They think this documentary is going to break the dam. It's pretty intense.” The Hollywood Reporter‘s review was more skeptical. (“The Age of Disclosure tackles its topic with utmost certainty and sincerity, its interview subjects treating everything they say like it's established fact, not requiring corroboration or confirmation,” critic Daniel Fienberg wrote.)

	











	Some of the officials interviewed include Secretary of State Marco Rubio (who says in the trailer that, when it comes to UFOs, “even presidents are operating on a need-to-know basis”), New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds and General Jim Clapper (who was a U.S. Director of National Intelligence under President Barack Obama).


	Back in March, Farah discussed making the film in detail with THR, noting, “My goal was to only interview people who had direct knowledge of the UAP topic as a result of their work for the U.S. government, and who would share what they can legally disclose … There are people who want the topic to continue to be kept from the public entirely. So I went to great lengths to make this documentary in secret over the last two-and-a-half years … there are these fundamental facts — like that we're not alone in the universe — that everyone feels like the public has the right to know, and it's also in our best interest to make known so that there's no longer this antiquated, unjust stigma that is making our country fall behind in how seriously this topic is taken.”


	From the official description: “The film was granted unprecedented access and support from senior members of the U.S. government, military and intelligence community. Everyone interviewed in the film has direct knowledge of UAP as a result of their work for the U.S. government. The film exposes the profound impact the situation has on the future of humanity, while providing a look behind the scenes with those at the forefront of the bipartisan disclosure effort.”

	











	Farah's producing credits include Ready Player One, which likewise scored a SXSW Film Festival premiere at the Paramount in 2018. The Age of Disclosure is a Farah Films production, in association with Born Ready Films. Produced and directed by Farah, executive producers are Colin Frederick, Andrew Farah and Shara Senderoff.

""We interviewed dozens of very high-level, credible officials who said these unknown threats could basically destroy our way of life forever,"" the ""Age of Disclosure"" director says

Johnny Dodd is a senior writer at PEOPLE, who focuses on human interest, crime and sports stories.

 After months of speculation — and even frustration — from fans over why their much-anticipated UFO documentary The Age Of Disclosure hadn't yet been released, producers have announced a date for its commercial launch.


 The documentary features dozens of prominent voices from the U.S. government, military and intelligence communities as it sets out to corroborate a purported 80-year global coverup of non-human intelligent life.


 Disclosure drew huge audiences at the SXSW Film Festival, which helped push its trailer to more than 20 million views. Now it will be released on Nov. 21 for a theatrical run in New York City, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.


 On that same date, Disclosure will also be available for streaming worldwide on Prime Video, where it's currently ready for pre-order.


 The film, which marks the directorial debut of Dan Farah, was a nearly three-year secret undertaking that eventually allowed him access — and bipartisan support — to the highest-levels of the federal government.


 “Like countless people around the world, I've always been fascinated by the question of whether or not humanity is the only intelligent life in the universe and if the government knows the answer to that question but has kept it from the public,” first-time director Farah tells PEOPLE in an exclusive statement.


 “I had to make this film in secrecy and faced numerous hurdles because there are people who would prefer that this film not exist,"" he says. ""I could not be prouder for the world to see it.”


 Those interviewed in the film include retired Air Force Lt. Gen. James Clapper, former director of national intelligence; Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Adm. Tim Gallaudet, a former Navy chief oceanographer; and Lue Elizondo, a former Department of Defense official and one-time member of the Government's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.

 Their first-hand accounts — such as those from Jay Stratton, former director of the government's unidentified aerial phenomena task force — are both intriguing and disturbing.


 “I have seen with my own eyes non-human craft and non-human beings,” Stratton says in the film.


 Rubio confesses in the doc that the issue of UFOs (also known as UAPs) “keeps me up at night.” He has a number of memorable scenes in the film where he discusses just how gravely important he feels this topic is and the risks involved by our leaders' continued reluctance to take it seriously.


 “I ask people to think about why would any of these extremely high-level people like our Secretary of State [Marco Rubio] have to gain by participating in this film and shedding light on this?” Farrah told PEOPLE earlier this year. “They're doing it because they feel an obligation to bring out the truth as much as they legally can.”


Farah Films

 The documentary comes at a time when UAPs have been the focus of historic bipartisan congressional hearings — and the proposed UAP Disclosure Act — aimed at forcing the government to publicly release everything it knows about the topic.


 “The U.S. government has gathered a great deal of information about UAPs over many decades but has refused to share it with the American people,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer — who has worked with Sens. Mike Rounds and Kirsten Gillibrand on the issue — recently said.


 “The American public has a right to learn about technologies of unknown origins, non-human intelligence and unexplainable phenomena,” Schumer said.


Farah Films/YouTube

 Disclosure, according to Farah (who produced Spielberg's 2018 sci-fi action feature Ready Player One), comes on the heels of a paradigm shift in the way Americans think about UAPs, once seen as a fringe issue.


 “We interviewed dozens of very high-level, credible officials who said these unknown threats [posed by UAPs] could basically destroy our way of life forever,” Farah previously told PEOPLE. “Things could get really bad, really fast. Learning that left me rattled.”

The Age of Disclosure, an explosive documentary that makes a strong case for the existence of non-human intelligent life – Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) visiting our planet – will get a robust Oscar-qualifying run and worldwide release on Prime Video.


	The film directed and produced by Dan Farah will be released theatrically on November 21 in York City, Los Angeles, and Washington DC and stream the same day on the Prime Video platform, which has secured an exclusive VOD window for the documentary.


	Watch the new trailer for The Age of Disclosure above. It features Secretary of State and former U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) among other highly placed people in government who speak to their knowledge of UAP.

	The documentary “shockingly reveals an 80-year global cover-up of non-human intelligent life and a secret war among major nations to reverse-engineer advanced technology of non-human origin,” states a release. “Featuring testimony from 34 members of the U.S. Government, military, and intelligence communities, the film exposes the profound stakes for the future of humanity.

	“The timely documentary arrives amid historic bipartisan Congressional hearings on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) and the proposed UAP Disclosure Act, led by Senators Schumer, Rounds, and Gillibrand, calling for transparency about what the government knows about UAP and non-human intelligent life.”

	











The Age of Disclosure, which has earned praise from Oscar-winning filmmakers Oliver Stone and Bryan Fogel, premiered at SXSW in March. Farah notes he spent three years making the film in secrecy. “Everyone interviewed in the film has direct knowledge of the UAP issue as a result of their work for the U.S. Government, and is breaking their silence in the film with what they can lawfully disclose,” the release says. “The Age of Disclosure is unprecedented in terms of its access, credibility, and the information it reveals.”


	“The film represents a paradigm shift,” the release continues, “reframing the UAP issue from fringe speculation to a credible issue globally with consequences that can no longer be ignored.”


	Ryan Pirozzi, head of Prime Video Marketplace, commented, “We are thrilled to broaden our selection of premium entertainment by offering The Age of Disclosure to our global Prime Video customers.”


	Distributed by Relentless Releasing, The Age of Disclosure is a Farah Films Production.

If this is actually true, then hey, great job endangering our country's work to win a secret war just so you can make a doc and a little money! Very big of you!

This information is widely available already. Many of the main players testimony is public. But great cynical response to quality journalism in the service of an informed electorate. Glad you trust your government so much you'll let them wage secret wars in your name.

The film will also get awards-qualifying theatrical screenings in Los Angeles, New York and Washington, D.C.

Writer-at-Large


	A buzzy UFO documentary has landed distribution. 


The Age of Disclosure has earned a limited theatrical run in New York, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. to quality for Oscar season and an exclusive VOD streaming release on Prime Video. The theatrical and VOD date is Nov. 21, and the film is now available for pre-order.




	The documentary caused a stir and plenty of debate when it premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival in March. Its trailer received more than 22 million cross-platform views, which is said to be a record for a documentary. A new trailer for the project (below) was released Thursday.

The Age of Disclosure, by filmmaker Dan Farah, features on-record interviews with 34 current and former senior members of the U.S. government, military and intelligence community with direct knowledge of unidentified aerial phenomena. The film contends there has been an 80-year cover-up of the existence of non-human intelligent life and a secret war among major nations to reverse engineer UFO technology. The film comes amid a series of headline-making bipartisan Congressional hearings on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) calling for transparency about what the government might know about non-human intelligent life.

	Ever since SXSW, Joe Rogan has been a vocal supporter of the project gaining distribution, repeatedly urging streamers to pick up the film. “Amazing documentary, I really hope that gets released somewhere big,” Rogan has said. “Very well done. They think this documentary is going to break the dam. It's pretty intense.” The Hollywood Reporter‘s review was more skeptical. (“The Age of Disclosure tackles its topic with utmost certainty and sincerity, its interview subjects treating everything they say like it's established fact, not requiring corroboration or confirmation,” critic Daniel Fienberg wrote.)

	











	Some of the officials interviewed include Secretary of State Marco Rubio (who says in the trailer that, when it comes to UFOs, “even presidents are operating on a need-to-know basis”), New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds and General Jim Clapper (who was a U.S. Director of National Intelligence under President Barack Obama).


	Back in March, Farah discussed making the film in detail with THR, noting, “My goal was to only interview people who had direct knowledge of the UAP topic as a result of their work for the U.S. government, and who would share what they can legally disclose … There are people who want the topic to continue to be kept from the public entirely. So I went to great lengths to make this documentary in secret over the last two-and-a-half years … there are these fundamental facts — like that we're not alone in the universe — that everyone feels like the public has the right to know, and it's also in our best interest to make known so that there's no longer this antiquated, unjust stigma that is making our country fall behind in how seriously this topic is taken.”


	From the official description: “The film was granted unprecedented access and support from senior members of the U.S. government, military and intelligence community. Everyone interviewed in the film has direct knowledge of UAP as a result of their work for the U.S. government. The film exposes the profound impact the situation has on the future of humanity, while providing a look behind the scenes with those at the forefront of the bipartisan disclosure effort.”

	











	Farah's producing credits include Ready Player One, which likewise scored a SXSW Film Festival premiere at the Paramount in 2018. The Age of Disclosure is a Farah Films production, in association with Born Ready Films. Produced and directed by Farah, executive producers are Colin Frederick, Andrew Farah and Shara Senderoff.

It's photography. It is sculpture. It is textile art. It's an unidentified flying object straight out of the imagination of Stanley Kubrick or Ridley Scott, spaceships beyond Orion, C-rays glowing in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. Miriam Bäckström (Stockholm, 1967) is all this and nothing at the same time. A object that becomes an image that finally becomes an object.

Let's try to make sense of all this. His post-photographic work goes beyond a camera shot. It all starts by photographing a tiny fragment of fabric with a macro lens. The resulting image is converted into a weave and this is woven in silk, lurex and jacquard.

Then this fabric becomes skin in new ways, 3D modeled geometries whose skeleton is made of wood. Technology and craftsmanshiptradition and contemporaneity working together. The result is not a photograph glued to a volume, but an image that becomes matter.



Bäckström declines photography as open source. Hence, his works blur the borders between techniques: when the textile becomes an image and the image becomes a volume, the taxonomies dissolve. Elba Benítez hosts few but emphatic pieces, only four. one of them Advanced Cone (2019) looks like a ten-meter alien object.

Pieces that are at the same time raster, pixel and skin: They are reminiscent of heat shields or armor plates seen by the camera of a space probe. It is not illustrative science fiction, but poetic engineering.






                                                            Miriam Bäckstörm: ‘Advance cone', 2019. Photo: Elba Beníez


His trajectory is coherent. Born in Stockholm in 1967, she began to stand out in the nineties through conceptual photography. His work consisted of photographing interior spaces such as apartments, restaurants and galleries, with great technical precision and without explicit human presence, but evoking their imprint as if they were settings in search of characters.

Over time, these sets took her towards the theatre, cinema, performance and, more recently, textile art. He does not abandon the photographic, he stretches it – extends it – until it acts as sculpture and architecture.

Bäckström represented Sweden at the 2005 Venice Biennale (along with Carsten Höller) and has made tapestries for the Swedish royal house (Palace of Frederick VIII, official residence of the Danish royal family), public spaces and museums, and his work appears in collections such as Tate, Guggenheim, MoMA, or Moderna Museet.

That, and nothing else, is the postphotographygo beyond the shot, be able to transform language. Bäckström's “extensions,” as the title of the exhibition says, – the artist's fourth in the gallery – are optical and haptic, tactile and visual, spatial and mental.

His works envelop the viewer in a hypnotic plot like the moiré of a fabric or the snow on an untuned television screen. When we move, our brain reads the plot as if it were in motion; when surrounding the pieces, the shine It turns on and off as if the fabric were breathing.

Without grandiloquence, but from monumentality, Bäckström works different stories about our way of looking at the world, from the micro to the macro, from the insignificant to the infinity in a extraordinary translation exercise.

      JONATHAN CHADWICK, ASSISTANT SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY EDITOR




It's one of the biggest unanswered questions in science: if there's life beyond Earth, why hasn't it contacted us yet?

Now, a scientist claims to have the answer – and it suggests aliens are more similar to us than we thought.  

Dr Robin Corbet, an astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland, thinks aliens got bored of trying to find us and simply stopped looking.

In a new paper, he suggests extraterrestrial civilizations are only a little bit more technologically advanced than us.

As a result, they reached the upper limit of what their technology is capable of, gave up and lost interest.

'In the mundane perspective, where other civilizations are not that much more advanced, a limit to exploration would arise,' said Dr Corbet. 

The expert says Proxima Centauri b – a planet in another solar system 4 light years away – could be a 'promising' location for life to exist. 

However, with humanity's present spacecraft speeds, it would take around 100,000  years to reach it. 

For decades, sci-fi films and comics have depicted aliens as sophisticated civilizations using technology beyond our comprehension.

This may have fueled the assumption that they are capable of successfully beaming messages to other planets, including our own. 

For example, they could send out 'swarms of interstellar robotic probes' or powerful beacons in the form of light or sound that could be detected across the galaxy. 

Films like 'ET' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' even suggest they're able to visit other worlds in their high-powered spaceships.  

But according to Dr Corbet, extraterrestrials might not be able to do this because their technology level is only a bit ahead of us – akin to 'an iPhone 42 rather than an iPhone 17'. 

In fact, their technology may not include 'significant leaps equivalent to harnessing electricity or rely on as yet unknown laws of physics', he says in his paper. 

Even if aliens do have a capable beacon transmitter, it is not clear that there would be 'much motivation' to operate it for millions or billions of years until their signal is noticed.

What's more, significant colonization or exploration of the galaxy would 'have to have benefits that outweigh the costs', he adds. If life on Earth is any indicator, costly projects would get ditched if they soon prove too difficult.

If you ask an astronomer if aliens exist, the high likelihood is they'll say yes.

The universe is mind-bogglingly vast and we have only explored a very tiny fragment of it, so there's bound to be some other form of life out there. 

According to Erik Zackrisson, an astrophysicist at Uppsala University in Sweden, there are 70 quintillion planets in the universe - that's 7 followed by 20 zeroes. 

So the very fact we exist here on Earth would make it incredibly unlikely that nowhere else in the universe has some kind of conscious life too. 

However, some detractors cite the Fermi paradox - the fact there's a lack of evidence for extraterrestrials despite various high estimates for their probability. In other words, if there is alien life, why have we not found any evidence for it?

Dr Corbet's theory, known as the 'radically mundane' theory, offers an answer to the 'Fermi paradox' – the apparent contradiction between the lack of evidence for alien civilizations and high estimates for their probability.

In effect, the paradox asks, if there is so much extraterrestrial life, why have we not found any evidence for it? 

Simply, it could be that lifeforms in the universe are stuck in the same boat, in the sense that no one quite has the capacity to do so. 

Alternatively, some aliens do have the technology but are so far away from us to make it impossible.  

'The Fermi paradox may be explained if the galaxy contains a modest number of technological civilizations, with technology levels that, while more advanced than contemporary Earth, are nowhere near the 'super-science' levels that could result in readily detectable astro-engineering,' Dr Corbet concludes in his paper, yet to be peer-reviewed.

While it might sound compelling, Professor Michael Garrett, director of the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics in Manchester, voiced reservations regarding the radically mundane theory. 

'It projects a very human-like apathy on to the rest of the cosmos,' he told the Guardian. 

'I find it hard to believe that all intelligent life would be so uniformly dull.' 

There are already several possible answers to the Fermi paradox, including extraterrestrial life being too scared of 'dangerous' and 'violent' humans to want to come here. 

Dr Gordon Gallup, a biopsychologist at the University of Albany, said in a 2022 paper: 'If there is intelligent life elsewhere, they may view humans as extremely dangerous.

'Maybe this is why there is no proof or compelling evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence – we pose too great a risk, and they do not want to be discovered.' 

Alternatively, aliens are unrecognizable because they are so far advanced and have transcended to a different realm, another theory alleges. 

Regardless of the answer to the paradox, successfully sending and receiving messages between aliens could one day happen. 

On Earth, scientists have already tried to beam messages towards other solar systems in radio or light signals, akin to sending information in an email via the internet.

According to Mark Buchanan, a physicist and writer in the UK, the best way to make contact with alien life would be to send light signals because they travel so fast.

'And there are many ways to send signals of a kind that do not get changed by any natural process, so another civilization would see them as coming from an intelligence,' he told the Daily Mail.

The Fermi Paradox questions why, given the estimated 200-400 billion stars and at least 100 billion planets in our galaxy, there have been no signs of alien life. 

The contradiction is named after its creator, Italian physicist Enrico Fermi.

He first posed the question back in 1950.

Fermi believed it was too extraordinary that a single extra-terrestrial signal or engineering project has yet to be detected in the universe — despite its immense vastness. 

Fermi concluded there must a barrier that limits the rise of intelligent, self-aware, technologically advanced space-colonising civilisations.

This barrier is sometimes referred to as the 'Great Filter'.

If the main obstacle preventing the colonisation of other planets is not in our past, then the barrier that will stop humanity's prospects of reaching other worlds must lie in our future, scientists have theorised.  

Professor Brian Cox believes the advances in science and engineering required by a civilisation to start conquering the stars will ultimately lead to its destruction.

He said: 'One solution to the Fermi Paradox is that it is not possible to run a world that has the power to destroy itself.

‘It may be that the growth of science and engineering inevitably outstrips the development of political expertise, leading to disaster.'

Other possible explanations for the Fermi Paradox include that intelligent alien species are out there, but lack the necessary technology to communicate with Earth.

Some believe that the distances between intelligent civilisations are too great to allow any kind of two-way communication.

If two worlds are separated by several thousand light years, it's possible that one or both civilisations would become extinct before a dialogue can be established. 

The so-called Zoo hypothesis claims intelligent alien life is out there, but deliberately avoids any contact with life on Earth to allow its natural evolution. ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

As Halloween nears, the spirits are stirring in the Levittown area and local historical groups and paranormal investigators offering a tours that delve into the area's lore.

Dating back to the 1600s, the area is steeped in history that organizers hope will bring out the public to explore the tales of the supernatural that linger in historic buildings and along darkened streets.

The Historic Langhorne Association is hosting walking ghost tours every weekend through the end of the month. The tours last just under two hours and explore the borough's storied past.

In the event of poor weather, the walking tour will be moved inside the association's library on Maple Avenue. 

A special non-walking tour will be held in the library at 1 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 26.

Tickets are required and cost $15 for adults and $10 for ages 8 to 17.Tickets can be purchased online. 

According to the association, all tickets are non-refundable, non-transferable and cannot be exchanged for a new date or time.

A few miles away in Bristol Borough, Valerius Productions and the Lower Bucks Paranormal Society have partnered for the “Spirits on Mill Ghost Walk.”

The tour promises to share “haunting tales and unique history that linger in the shadows of Mill Street's historic buildings and beloved small businesses through the lens and personal experiences of the local staff and their very own paranormal investigation team.”

The family-friendly tour is approximately two hours long and covers a half-mile stretch of the central business district.

Tour dates run through early November and the outings are rain or shine. 

Tickets are $35 and can be purchased online.

Some local establishments are offering drink specials and discounts for the Halloween season.

The Grundy Library and Grundy Museum in Bristol Borough is hosting a number of Halloween-related events and activities this month, including a spiritualism exhibit movie night, and book events. For more information, click here. 

For those seeking a closer look at a centuries-old manor, the Historic Bolton Mansion in Bristol Township is teaming up with the Fairless Hills Paranormal Group for tours on the evening of Friday, Oct. 17.

Fairless Hills Paranormal Group team members will conduct guided tours with paranormal equipment set up on all three floors of the house. 

Tickets are $25 per person and are non-refundable.Tickets can be purchased online. 

Ticket purchases support the Historic Bolton Mansion group. 

Bucks County has a long history and ghost legends run throughout. Many of the tales can be found in Charles J. Adams III's book “Bucks County Ghost Stories,” which can be purchased online or found at local libraries.

Chris Carter's paranormal mystery series ""The X-Files"" wasn't just one of the best TV shows of the 1990s, but it came to define the era. ""The X-Files"" was produced after the end of the Cold War, and while the United States was enjoying a new period of seeming economic prosperity and eerie international peace. This period, however, made many of us suspicious. Rather than focus our enmity on mysterious foes overseas, we turned inward, looking at our own institutions with suspicion. The FBI's malfeasance became a point of interest, and ""The X-Files"" posited that the world was rife with aliens, cryptids, and vampires ... and that the FBI spends considerable resources hiding them from the public. 

Agent Mulder (David Duchovny) was the open-minded explorer, wanting to find the truth about the world, wounded from when his sister was abducted by aliens. Agent Scully (Gillian Anderson) was the skeptic, always insisting that there is a logical, scientific reason that something may look supernatural. Scully retained her skepticism, even after seeing weird creatures with Mulder every week. The series was funereal in tone and intellectual in presentation. It was sensational and smart at the same time. 

But just as the 1990s eventually came to an end, ""The X-Files"" lost its relevance. It was a reflection of the time. After the beginning of the George W. Bush administration, its wee alien conspiracies suddenly seemed naïve. ""The X-Files"" had no place in the world anymore. It's no wonder that the world's many X-Philes dislike all the show's seasons that aired after 2000. I say declaratively that seasons 7 through 11 are not essential. Well, with one exception, as we'll see below. H

ere are the five most essential episodes of ""The X-Files."" Note: this will not merely be a list of the ""funny"" episodes. Fans like those best, of course, but the below selections are more generally emblematic of what the series is capable of.

The bulk of ""The X-Files"" consisted of monster-of-the-week episodes, wherein Mulder and Scully would investigate a creature, supernatural killer, or some other fantastical beast. This stood in contrast to the ""arc"" episodes, wherein the stalwart FBI agents would further look into an ever-widening conspiracy within the government to hide aliens, technology, and evidence of mass abductions. Different X-Philes prefer different types of episodes.

As for monster-of-the-week episodes, though, ""The X-Files"" came out swinging with ""Squeeze"" (September 24, 1993), the third episode of the series. The story followed a mysterious man named Eugene Victor Tooms (Doug Hutchison), a Baltimoran with the mysterious ability to stretch and squeeze his body through tiny openings. He used this ability to slide through air vents and attack people, killing them and removing their livers. Mulder and Scully manage to apprehend Tooms and give him a polygraph test, linking him to murders from nearly a century before. 

It's eventually revealed that Tooms is not a human, but some other kind of humanoid creature that hibernates in a subterranean nest for 30-year periods. It only awakens to rebuild its next, eat a few human livers, and go back to sleep. Tooms is a scary monster with a unique ability, and showed that ""The X-Files"" wasn't going to rely on traditional cryptids like Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster. It was fully willing to be scary and gross on its own terms. If the first two episodes didn't grab you, then ""Squeeze"" assured you would become an ""X-Files"" addict for years to come. 

On the conspiracy side of the coin, we have ""Paper Clip"" (September 29, 1995), which is also one of the best episodes of the series. ""Paper Clip"" was the third part of a three-episode arc that also included ""Anasazi"" and ""The Blessing Way,"" and it opened up the show's third season with a bang. This three-episode arc was also a sequel story of sorts to a two-parter from the show's second season that included ""Duane Barry"" and ""Ascension"" (October 14 and 21, 1994). Really, this spot is a five-way tie between those episodes. 

In 1994, Gillian Anderson became pregnant and needed to step away from the series for a spell. Show creator Chris Carter came up with an arc wherein Scully was kidnapped, leaving Mulder on his own. That last-minute cover ended up inspiring a larger story arc about a deep conspiracy in the FBI, which may have proven the existence of alien greys, and how the U.S. government was secretly using alien technology. Several new players were introduced along the way, including the Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis), the Lone Gunmen (Bruce Harwood, Tom Braidwood, Dean Haglund), and a cadre of shadowy conspirators called the Syndicate. Oh yes, and there was the weaselly Agent Krycek (Nicholas Lea), whom some X-Philes referred to as Ratboy. The title of ""Paper Clip"" refers to the real-life Project Paperclip, wherein multiple Nazi scientists were hired by the U.S. government after World War II. 

Getting into the details of the story would take too long, as the conspiracies on ""The X-Files"" were massively complex and always changing. But at this point in the series, the conspiracies were still comprehensible and seemed large and important. ""Paper Clip"" was proof that ""The X-Files"" could work with larger, outsize stories that felt incredibly important and salient. Until the 1998 movie, the conspiracy episodes wouldn't get much better than this.

""Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space'"" (April 12, 1996) might have been the first proper ""comedy"" episode of ""The X-Files."" In it, the immortal Charles Nelson Reilly played the titular Jose Chung, an author who is writing a book about alien abductions. He interviews Scully about a recent case of hers, and finds that her job can be a little kooky from time to time. Jose also interviews a few other assorted kooks and diner owners, and finds that Mulder and Scully appear, from the outside, to be part of the shadowy conspiracies they fight against. This is the episode wherein Scully performs an alien autopsy only to find that she's dissecting an alien suit being worn by a very human military pilot. 

This is also the episode wherein Alex Trebek and Jesse Ventura appear as mysterious Men in Black, and Mulder is said to screech like an alien when he sees a crashed UFO. It's the episode where an alien abductee, while being held in a cage on an alien spacecraft, looks over into the cell next to them and sees another alien, locked up, smoking a cigarette and repeating, ""This is not happening."" The gag is that Jose Chung wished to publish his book about alien abduction, aiming to blow the lid off all the conspiracies. But, it seems, the business of alien abduction is so whimsical and absurd that its publication would discredit the actual investigators of UFOlogy. 

""Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space'"" cleverly makes light of ""The X-Files,"" openly acknowledging that the complex conspiracies on the show will sound oblique and ridiculous to any outsiders. Mulder may have been trying to uncover the truth, but the truth is ""out there"" in both senses of the phrase. 

""Home"" (October 11, 1996) is another monster-of-the-week episode, but it may be the show's creepiest and most effective. Mulder and Scully travel to Home, Pennsylvania, to investigate the exhumed corpse of a severely mutated infant found buried in a baseball park. Mulder suspects that the infant's death might have something to do with the mutated Peacock brothers who live nearby. The Peacocks have been living in the same house since the Civil War, and it's implied that the family has stuck to a strict regimen of inbreeding that entire time. Mulder and Scully investigate whether the Peacock brothers may have kidnapped and impregnated a victim. If they did, they need to find her. The episode would climax inside the Peacock household, and the identity of the baby's mother revealed to be a member of the Peacock family. Eesh. 

""Home"" has the same sort of villains as Tobe Hooper's ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" from over 20 years earlier, but told in an ""X-Files"" way, with a deep conspiracy and a need to find the truth. When Mulder and Scully find what they find underneath the Peacock Bros. bed, it's shocking and horrifying. It's not supernatural, but it certainly is unusual, and plays into decades of lurid urban legends about the backwater areas of the United States. ""Home"" doesn't uncover anything about the mythos of ""The X-Files,"" but it proves that monsters of the week will always be the show's strongest suit. Have something lighthearted and fun to watch after ""Home,"" because it may leave you a little shaken.

This may be a controversial choice, as ""Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster"" (February 1, 2016) aired during the poorly received two-season revival of ""The X-Files"" that aired in 2016 and in 2018. Time, as mentioned, was not kind to ""The X-Files,"" and it was dated as soon as Bill Clinton left office. This didn't stop occasional re-visitations in the form of the feature film ""The X-Files: I Want to Believe"" in 2008, and the two revival season in the 2010s. 

By then, Mulder and Scully had aged out, and audiences wondered what we were doing here. Real-world government conspiracies about torture, faked weapons reports, and ill-advised wars were more important than the fantasy aliens seen in the 1990s, so ""The X-Files"" was instantly behind-the-times. Only ""Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster"" managed to address the nature of the FBI agents' work, and what function they still played decades after their glory days. 

Rhys Darby plays an ordinary guy named Guy Mann who seems uncomfortable around other people. He is the suspect in a bloody murder, one that seems to have been perpetrated by a betoothed monster, or at least a human with a gore fetish. It's eventually revealed that Guy Mann is innocent ... and that he's not a human. It seems that Guy Mann is a bipedal lizard being who lived happily in the woods with vague animal intelligence. When he was bitten by a human, be became a were-human, now able to turn into a man for brief periods. Guy hates being human. He hates being self-aware. He hates that he has to concern himself with petty human concerns. 

Mulder witnesses Guy transforming, giving him proof that the supernatural is out there. But, Mulder learns — as does the audience — that the monsters don't care about ""the truth."" They just want to live their lives. Maybe, Mulder didn't need to expose the truth. Maybe he can just let the monsters be.","{'href': 'https://www.slashfilm.com', 'title': 'SlashFilm'}","other"

While plowing a wheat field in rural Washington state in the 1990s, William Wallace spotted a gray plane overhead that he believed was releasing chemicals to make him sick. The rancher began to suspect that all white vapor trails from aircraft might be dangerous.


		This story also ran on CNN. It can be republished for free.	

He shared his concern with reporters, acknowledging it sounded a little like “The X Files,” a science fiction television show.

Academics cite Wallace's story as one of the catalysts behind a fringe concept that has spread among adherents to the Make America Healthy Again, or MAHA, movement and is gaining traction at the highest levels of the federal government. Its treatment as a serious issue underscores that under President Donald Trump, unscientific ideas have unusual power to take hold and shape public health policy.

The concept posits that airplane vapor trails, or contrails, are really “chemtrails” containing toxic substances that poison people and the terrain. Another version alleges planes or devices are being deployed by the federal government, private companies, or researchers to trigger big weather changes, such as hurricanes, or to alter the Earth's climate, emitting hazardous chemicals in the process.

Several GOP lawmakers and leaders in the Trump administration remain convinced the concepts are legitimate, though scientists have sought to discredit such claims.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is planning to investigate climate and weather control, and is expected to create a task force that will recommend possible federal action, according to a former agency official, an internal agency memo obtained by KFF Health News, and a consultant who helped with the memo.

The plans, along with comments by top GOP lawmakers, show how rumors and conspiracy theories can gain an air of legitimacy due to social media and a political climate infused with falsehoods, some political scientists and researchers say.

“When we have low access to information or low trust in our sources of information, a lot of times we turn to our peer groups, the groups we are members of and we define ourselves by,” said Timothy Tangherlini, a folklorist and professor of information at the University of California-Berkeley. He added that the government's investigation of conspiracy theories “gives the impression of having some authoritative element.”

HHS is expected to appoint a special government employee to investigate climate and weather control, according to Gray Delany, former head of the agency's MAHA agenda, who said he drafted the memo. The agency has interviewed applicants to lead a “chemtrails” task force, said Jim Lee, a blogger focused on weather and climate who Delany said helped edit the memo, which Lee confirmed.

“HHS does not comment on future or potential policy decisions and task forces,” agency spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in an email.

The memo alleges that “aerosolized heavy metals such as Aluminum, Barium, and Strontium, as well as other materials such as sulfuric acid precursors, are sprayed into the atmosphere under the auspices of combatting global warming,” through a process of stratospheric aerosol injection, or SAI.

“There are serious concerns SAI spraying is leading to increased heavy metal content in the atmosphere,” the memo states.

The memo claims, without providing evidence, that the substances cause elevated heavy-metal content in the atmosphere, soil, and waterways, and that aluminum is a toxic product used in SAI linked to dementia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, asthma-like illnesses, and other chronic illnesses. The July 14 memo was addressed to White House health adviser Calley Means, who didn't respond to a voicemail left by a reporter seeking comment.

High-level federal government officials are presenting false claims as facts without evidence and referring to events that not only haven't occurred but, in many cases, are physically impossible, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California.

“That is a pretty shocking memo,” he said. “It doesn't get more tinfoil hat. They really believe toxins are being sprayed.”

Kennedy has previously promoted debunked chemtrail theories. In May, he was asked on “Dr. Phil Primetime” about chemicals being sprayed into the stratosphere to change the Earth's climate.

“It's done, we think, by DARPA,” Kennedy said, referring to a Department of Defense agency that develops emerging technology for the military's use. “And a lot of it now is coming out of the jet fuel. Those materials are put in jet fuel. I'm going to do everything in my power to stop it. We're bringing on somebody who's going to think only about that.”

DARPA officials didn't return a message seeking comment.

Federal Messaging

Deploying chemtrails to poison people is just one of many baseless conspiracy theories that have found traction among Trump administration health policy officials led by Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist before entering politics. He continues to promote a supposed link between vaccines and autism, as well as make statements connecting fluoride in drinking water to arthritis, bone fractures, thyroid disease, and cancer. The World Health Organization says fluoride is safe when used as recommended.

Delany, who was ousted in August from HHS, said Kennedy has expressed strong interest in chemtrails.

“This is an issue that really matters to MAHA,” said Delany, referring to the informal movement associated with Kennedy that is composed of people who are skeptical of evidence-based medicine.

The memo also alleges that “suspicious weather events have been occurring and have increased awareness of the issue to the public, some of which have been acknowledged to have been caused by geoengineering activities, such as the flooding in Dubai in 2024.” Geoengineering refers to intentional large-scale efforts to change the climate to counteract global warming.

“It is unconscionable that anyone should be allowed to spray known neurotoxins and environmental toxins over our nation's citizens, their land, food and water supplies,” Delany's memo states.

Scientists, meteorologists, and other branches of the federal government say these assertions are largely incorrect. Some points in the memo are accurate, including concerns that commercial aircraft contribute to acid rain.

But critics say the memo builds on kernels of truth before veering into unscientific fringe theories. Efforts to control the weather are being made, largely by states and local governments seeking to combat droughts, but the results are modest and highly localized. It isn't possible to manipulate large-scale weather events, scientists say.

Severe flooding in the United Arab Emirates in 2024 couldn't have been caused by weather manipulation because no technology could create that kind of rainfall event, Maarten Ambaum, a meteorologist at the University of Reading who studies Gulf region rainfall patterns, said in a statement on the floods. Similar debunked claims emerged this year after central Texas experienced devastating floods.

The Government Accountability Office concluded in a 2024 report that questions remain as to the effectiveness of weather modification.

Research into changing the climate has been conducted, including work by one private company that engaged in field tests. Still, federal agencies say no ongoing or large-scale projects are underway. Study of the concept remains in the research phase. The Environmental Protection Agency says there are no large-scale or government efforts to affect the Earth's climate.

“Solar geoengineering is not occurring via direct delivery by commercial aircraft and is not associated with aviation contrails,” the agency says on its website.

Widespread Misinformation

Misperceptions about weather, climate control, and airplane contrails extend beyond the Trump administration, scientists said.

In September, a congressional House committee hearing titled “Playing God With the Weather — A Disastrous Forecast” involved two hours of debate on the once-fringe idea. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who chaired the hearing, has introduced legislation to ban weather and climate control, with a fine of up to $100,000 and up to five years in prison.

Some Democrats objected to the nature of the discussion. Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) accused Greene of using “the platform of Congress to proffer anti-science theories, to platform climate denialism.”

Frequently citing chemtrails, GOP lawmakers have introduced legislation in about two dozen states to ban weather modification or geoengineering. Florida passed a bill to establish an online portal so residents can report alleged violations.

“The Free State of Florida means freedom from governments or private actors unilaterally applying chemicals or geoengineering to people or public spaces,” GOP Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a press statement this spring.

Meanwhile, the chemtrail conspiracy has permeated popular culture. The title track on singer Lana Del Ray's seventh studio album is entitled “Chemtrails Over the Country Club.” Bill Maher dove into the chemtrail myth on his podcast “Club Random,” saying, “This is nuts. It's just nuts.” And “Chemtrails,” a psychological thriller, wrapped filming in July.

Social media has given wing to the chemtrails concept and other fringe ideas involving public health. They include an outlandish belief that Anthony Fauci, who advised both Trump and President Joe Biden on the government response to the covid-19 pandemic, created the AIDS epidemic. There is no evidence of such a link, public health leaders say.

Researchers say another false belief by those on the far right holds that people who received covid vaccines could shed the virus, causing infertility in the unvaccinated. There is no evidence of such a connection, scientists and researchers say.

More severe weather events due to global warming may be driving some of the baseless theories, scientists say. And risks occur when such ideas take hold among the general population or policymakers, some public health leaders say. Climate researchers, including Swain, say they've received death threats.

Lee, the blogger, said he disagrees with some of the more far-fetched beliefs and is aware of the harm they can cause.

“There are people wanting to shoot down planes because they think they are chemtrails,” said Lee, adding that some believers are afraid to venture outside when plane vapor trails are visible overhead.

There is also no evidence that plane contrails cause health problems or are related to intentional efforts to control the climate, according to the EPA and other scientists.

The memo and focus at HHS on climate and weather control are alarming because they perpetuate conspiracies, said David Keith, a professor of geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago.

“It's unmoored to reality,” he said. “I expected there were documents like this, but seeing it in print is nevertheless shocking. Our government is being driven by nonsensical dreck from dark corners of social media.”

The facts had changed so MPs simply amended their conspiracy theories to fit the new evidence

It's all as clear as mud. If Keir Starmer thought that releasing the three witness statements of the deputy national security adviser (DNSA) Matthew Collins late on Wednesday night was going to make the China spy case row go away, then he was in for a big disappointment.

There was no way MPs were going to let a story like this out of their clutches. This was their moment to take centre stage. When they could bathe in their own importance. When they could believe that they and national security were one and the same thing.

There again, whatever Starmer had put into the public domain would never have been enough. Even a letter from the director of public prosecutions (DPP), Stephen Parkinson, falling on his sword and admitting he had taken his eye off the ball, would have been dismissed as irrelevant.

When it comes to a choice between cock-up and conspiracy, most MPs naturally gravitate to conspiracy. So much more exciting. Life's too dull when it's just some unelected apparatchik doing a job badly.

As the facts change, MPs merely change their conspiracy theories to fit the new evidence. In her embarrassing tirades at Wednesday's prime minister's questions, Kemi Badenoch had insisted that Starmer was at the centre of a major cover-up. That he had personally leant on Collins to get him to change his evidence. That he was basically a Chinese spy himself, doing the bidding of his masters in Beijing. Punching the air in triumph as the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) collapsed the trial.

Come Thursday morning, that particular narrative appeared dead in the water. There was just no evidence to support it. But not to worry. Because another conspiracy theory was at hand. One that was the polar opposite of the previous one. In this exciting new version, it was Starmer's lack of involvement, his failure to nobble Collins that was compelling proof the prime minister was a Chinese stooge.

A true red, white and blue patriot would have done whatever it took to secure a conviction. Stopped at nothing. Putting a gun to Collins's and Parkinson's heads. Doing nothing was simply unforgivable. As one door closed for opposition MPs, another one opened. Not that there was any recognition that the terms of reference for the conspiracy theory had just done a U-turn. On days like these politicians imagine themselves to be a tabula rasa. Yesterday doesn't matter. It never happened. All that matters is what happens today.

So it was almost inevitable there would be an urgent question in the Commons to give MPs a platform to air their new theories that had been developed overnight. You can generally gauge how much trouble the government reckons it is in by the minister it sends out to answer a UQ. Get a cabinet minister and the government is supremely confident of its position. So the appearance of Chris Ward, the most junior of ministers in the Cabinet Office making his first ever outing at the dispatch box, on the government frontbench, told you all you needed to know.

And, to be fair, Ward did about as well as could be expected under the circumstances. He didn't die on his arse and only had to endure a modicum of faux pity from opposition MPs. It's just that he would much rather have been anywhere than in the Commons at 10.30 on a Thursday morning.

It wasn't so much that he had nothing much to say – which he didn't really – it was more that he knew nothing he did have to say was going to make much difference. Try telling a UFO convention that UFOs don't exist will only make the audience even more convinced they do. Because the establishment would say that, wouldn't they?

Poor Chris. All he could do was stand up and read the words in front of him. The DNSA had made the witness statements without any interference from government. He wasn't entirely sure why Collins had added a line from the Labour manifesto about China being an economic opportunity. Presumably to give context that Labour's line on China was not that much different to the Tories. And you'd have to ask the DPP why the CPS had dropped the case.

Then the onslaught, First from shadow minister for policy renewal, Neil O'Brien. The CPS had said they were just 5% short on the evidence they needed to get take the case to trial. Why hadn't the government done whatever it took to get the case over the line? To a layperson, this sounded very much like expecting the government to fabricate new evidence if the existing material was insufficient. But maybe spy trials don't count. There again, surely the Met could have knocked something up. They are old hands at that sort of thing.

Labour MPs were equally bewildered. Emily Thornberry couldn't work out why the CPS had not just backed off and let a jury decide on the guilt. Matt Western, chair of joint committee of national security strategies, announced he would be starting an inquiry of his own. Barry Gardiner raised doubts about the quality of information the spies had provided. Careful Bazza. Careless talk cost lives. Just because the spies passed on information freely available elsewhere and gossip picked up in the coffee queue in Portcullis House, this didn't mean it was any less serious. This was MPs we were talking about. Nothing is more important than that.

Tory Tom Tugendhat, one of the two MPs targeted, begged the prime minister to come to his rescue. How could he have abandoned Tom by not leaning more heavily on Collins? This wasn't party politics, it was a matter of life and death. Just provide the evidence, damn it! If you haven't got it, then invent it. It wasn't hard. What was the point of being prime minister if you didn't bang up spies?

The Tories kept on coming. Bernard Jenkin refused to believe Collins wasn't nobbled in some way. Bernie couldn't explain whether he had been nobbled to keep quiet or write rubbish witness statements. Jeremy Wright and Nick Timothy wanted the spies banged up regardless of whether they were guilty or not. Miraculously, none of the Conservatives engaged with the fact that it had been their own government's stance on China that had collapsed the case. Or that the case would have still collapsed if they had been in power.

Ward just stood there and took it all. It was all a big cock-up. Look to the CPS for answers. The government was equally gutted the case had not gone ahead. Come the end, there were points of order from Alicia Kearns, another spyee, Tugendhat and Graham Stuart. Stuart asked for an expression of sympathy to be shown towards Ward. Chris looked crushed. Ridicule he could take. Pity was too much.

A year ago today, the world was left reeling by the shocking news of former One Direction member Liam Payne's tragic fall from a hotel balcony.

Yet, even after a year, investigators are still trying to unravel the mystery surrounding Payne's last hours in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He was alone at the time, as his girlfriend Kate Cassidy, 26, had already flown back home.

Charges have been levelled against a hotel employee and a waiter, but many questions remain unanswered, leaving the star's family in a painful limbo as they await full details about the events leading up to his untimely demise.

Payne, aged 31, met his tragic end after falling from the third floor of the Casa Sur Palmero Hotel around 5pm local time on 16 October 2024. His funeral took place the following month in Amersham, Bucks, reports the Mirror.

The UK inquest determined the singer's medical cause of death to be polytrauma - a condition where multiple injuries occur to the body. However, a toxicology report also revealed traces of cocaine, alcohol, and prescription antidepressants in his system.

In the aftermath of his death, Payne's friend Rogelio 'Roger"" Nores, hotel operator Gilda Martin, and receptionist Esteban Grassi were initially charged with manslaughter, but these charges were later dropped.

However, charges against hotel employee Ezequiel Pereyra and waiter Braian Paiz, who stand accused of supplying cocaine to Payne, still stand.

Both men deny the charges but have been held in police custody since January. Case's ongoing mysteries A trial date has yet to be established for Pereyra and Paiz, as Argentine authorities continue sifting through 800 hours of CCTV material, mobile phone data and laptop content, meaning neither defendant has been able to present their version of events regarding their encounters with Liam in court.

The duo were officially charged in June, with prosecutors claiming they provided Payne with narcotics on at least two occasions during the two weeks preceding his death. Security camera footage allegedly captures Payne requesting ""seven grams more"" from Pereyra during a brief lift encounter at the hotel on the day he died.

Under Argentine law, the prosecution must present evidence to a judge, who determines whether proceedings advance to trial or if charges are dismissed.

A source revealed to The Sun: ""Police are still looking through Liam's laptop and the mobile phones of people connected to the inquiry. ""It's very frustrating as the likelihood of a trial still seems a long way off, and there is a sense that the police investigation is too slow.""

The publication reports that one suspect's mobile was used to contact Payne in the days before his death, yet wasn't examined until May, despite being seized as evidence in November.

Should they be convicted, Pereyra and Paiz face up to 15 years behind bars. Paiz has acknowledged supplying Payne with cocaine, but refutes accepting payment, which forms the basis of his charges.

Leading up to the anniversary, Payne's loved ones managed to raise £250,000 in his memory to help youngsters fighting cancer at Great Ormond Street Hospital.

The fundraising efforts began shortly after his passing, with the family urging grieving supporters to make donations to the hospital rather than sending floral tributes.

The funeral service programme disclosed that the funds would contribute towards establishing a new centre as part of Payne's enduring impact.

The order of service stated: ""Your donation today will continue Liam's legacy by helping to build a brand new Children's Cancer Centre at Great Ormond Street Hospital. This incredible new building will help give seriously ill children childhoods that are fuller, funner and longer.""

A representative from the children's hospital expressed how moved they were by the overwhelming support: ""We're so touched by the generosity shown towards GOSH in Liam's memory. Every donation is helping us take another step towards a world-leading children's cancer centre.

""It's a place of hope which will help build the future of children's cancer care and save more lives. It's a lasting legacy that will make a difference for generations.""

At the South Louisiana Ice Processing Center in Basile, detainees say they were forced into hard labor – and sexually assaulted and stalked by an assistant warden

Queer and trans immigrants at a detention facility in south Louisiana have alleged that they faced sexual harassment and abuse, medical neglect and coerced labor by staff at the facility, and that they were repeatedly ignored or faced retaliation for speaking out.

In multiple legal complaints, immigrants detained at the South Louisiana Ice Processing Center (SLIPC) in Basile, Louisiana, said they were recruited into an unsanctioned work program that forced them to perform hard manual labor for as little as $1 per day. Detainees also alleged that queer people were targeted by an assistant warden who stalked, harassed and sexually assaulted them.

Three current and former detainees who spoke to the Guardian said that, between 2023 and 2025, they endured months of abuse from an assistant warden named Manuel Reyes and his associates. In their complaints to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the detainees also said that they faced retaliation for reporting the abuse to authorities, alleging that Reyes and other staff beat them and denied them medical treatment.

“I was treated worse than an animal,” said Mario Garcia-Valenzuela, one of the detainees. “We don't deserve to be treated like this.”

Garcia-Valenzuela, a trans man detained at SLIPC, has alleged that, as part of the unsanctioned work program, Reyes forced him to move heavy cabinets and cinder blocks, and to clean using industrial-strength chemicals without gloves or protective gear. When Garcia-Valenzuela complained of injuries from the work program, he said, Reyes and his associates forcefully stripped him naked and mocked him.

Kenia Campos-Flores, who is trans and non-binary, told the Guardian that they suffered from persistent migraines and chest pain after exposure to cleaning chemicals they were made to use during unofficial, overnight work shifts. Campos-Flores also alleged in a complaint they were persistently sexually harassed by Reyes, who entered their dorm and stole possessions including their boxers.

Another trans detainee, Monica Renteria-Gonzalez, complained that a stripper chemical he was told to use to clean the facility floors seeped through his fabric shoes and burned the skin of his feet. On more than one occasion, while Renteria-Gonzalez was bent over cleaning, he said, Reyes came up from behind and inappropriately touched him. The assistant warden also told Renteria-Gonzalez he was watching the detainee through security cameras, including while he was showering.

A fourth detainee, identified by the pseudonym Jane Doe, is a cisgender, queer woman who said that Reyes forced her to perform oral sex on him on a “near daily basis” between February and May 2024, threatening to kill her if she refused, according to her complaint.

Doe, who was deported to the Dominican Republic in January this year, has chosen not to share her name or speak publicly because she fears that Reyes will make good on his threat to find and harm her, her lawyer said.

Taken together, the detainees' stories present a troubling pattern of mistreatment and abuse inside SLIPC, their attorneys said. Though the alleged abuse took place across two presidential administrations, advocates worry that conditions inside detention facilities could further deteriorate amid the Trump administration's present push to arrest and detain a record number of immigrants. Trans and queer immigrants in detention are especially vulnerable, advocates said, given that the administration is also moving to roll back key civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ people in federal custody.

The detainees' allegations are detailed in four separate administrative complaints filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act, which allows individuals to sue the government for injuries caused by federal employees. The government has six months to adjudicate the complaints, or the claimants could move forward with a federal lawsuit. They were submitted in September by Robert F Kennedy Human Rights, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Louisiana and the National Immigration Project. Those groups have also submitted a civil rights complaint to the DHS oversight bodies, including the office for civil rights and civil liberties (CRCL), on behalf of the detainees.

“This was a sadistic late-night work program,” said Sarah Decker, a senior staff attorney with RFK Human Rights. “It was designed to target vulnerable trans men or masculine-presenting LGBTQ people, who [Reyes] coerced into participating.”

When detainees tried to report their abuse, Decker said, Ice officials repeatedly disregarded them. Officials dismissed multiple reports of abuse in accordance with the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act (Prea), Decker said, as well as complaints to the Ice office of inspector general (OIG), the department charged with oversight of Ice.

“These people screamed for help. They filed grievances. They filed complaints under the Prison Rape Elimination Act, they filed verbal complaints through the office of the inspector general. They did everything to get help,” Decker said. “And they were systematically ignored, and complaints were buried.”

The Guardian attempted to locate Reyes though multiple means, including public records and social media searches and were unable to contact him. Reyes is not facing criminal charges for the alleged sexual abuse at the facility.

He is no longer employed at SLIPC, Decker said – he left the facility in July 2024. But, Renteria-Gonzalez and Garcia-Valenzuela, who remain detained at SLIPC, told the Guardian other staff at the facility have continued to retaliate against them, placing them in solitary confinement and denying them full access to medical care.

The DHS and Ice did not respond to the Guardian's queries about the detainees' allegations, nor did the agencies address whether any of the detainees' Prea complaints were investigated.

Located about 90 miles (145km) from the Gulf coast in the rural town of Basile, Louisiana, SLIPC was once a correctional facility. But in 2019, it opened as an Ice detention facility, operated by Geo Group, one of the largest private prison and surveillance firms in the US.

Over the past several years, the detention center, which houses mostly women as well as a few trans people, has attracted a string of allegations of civil and human rights violations, medical neglect and poor hygiene. In 2022, an internal inspection by the office of the immigration detention ombudsman – an independent office within the Department of Homeland Security – found that the facility had insufficient medical staffing, and had been inconsistent in addressing the medical and mental health needs of detainees. A 2025 report by the Yale Law School also found that detainees were “left hungry, cold, and in an atmosphere detainees describe as abusive”.

“It's devastating and heartbreaking, everything that they do to us in here,” said Renteria-Gonzalez, who first arrived at the facility in May 2023. “We struggle on a daily basis.”

He said his decision to remain in detention while his immigration case is under review – rather than accept deportation – has been painful.

Renteria-Gonzalez came to the US when he was 12 and has been in the country for 31 years. His eight-year-old daughter is a US citizen. “It is for my daughter and my family that I have endured everything that I have in this detention facility for the past 28 months,” he said. “It's so that I can make it back home to her.”

Renteria-Gonzalez said Reyes first recruited him to participate in the late-night work program in September 2023, according to his complaint. Reyes would often come into his dorm late at night – at around 2 or 3am – to wake him up for his night shift.

“It's like he lived [at the detention center] 24/7,” Renteria-Gonzalez told the Guardian.

Each recruit worked alone, during different times or in different parts of the detention facility – meaning they were often alone with Reyes, the detainees allege. During these times, Renteria-Gonzalez said, he would watch them work and probe them with invasive and inappropriate questions. “It made me feel uncomfortable,” he said. “He used to sit on his phone and asked us for personal information to look us up on Facebook and stuff.”

Sometimes, he said, Reyes entered detainees' dorms late at night for no particular reason, and would take their used underwear and personal hygiene products. On other occasions, Renteria-Gonzalez alleged in the complaint, Reyes would stalk him as he went to and from the showers and ask invasive questions: “And after, he would say: ‘Tell me what were you doing in the shower?'”

Twice, Renteria-Gonzalez said, Reyes came up behind him and touched him inappropriately. Another SLIPC officer, according to Renteria-Gonzalez, began to sexually harass him as well, sending him explicit notes and showing him pornographic images of herself.

“I just felt overwhelmed,” he said. “I thought enough was enough.”

Eventually, he realized he wasn't alone.

After being detained at SLIPC in February 2024, Garcia-Valenzuela said he also found himself trapped in Reyes's unofficial work program.

Garcia-Valenzuela had fled to the US in 2014 from Mexico, where he was tortured by members of a drug cartel. “I have no choice, that's why I'm fighting,” he said. “Because I know that as soon as they deport me, I'm going to be handed over to the cartels and I'm going to be tortured and killed – ripped into pieces.”

But in SLIPC he faced a new kind of horror. He alleged that on more than one occasion he was told to move heavy metal filing cabinets back and forth across a room. When he struggled to lift the furniture, Reyes would taunt him, he said, saying: “If you think you are a man, I'm going to treat you like a man.”

In the spring of 2024, Garcia-Valenzuela reported sexual harassment on the basis of his gender, in accordance with Prea. He said he felt targeted due to his gender identity and wanted the fact he is transgender removed from his file, as a measure of protection. But an Ice officer responded that “even if we take off your transgender marker, there is no hiding that you are transgender”, noting Garcia-Valenzuela's physical appearance, he said. To Garcia-Valenzuela's knowledge, no follow-up investigation into Reyes was conducted.

Renteria-Gonzalez's complaints were dismissed as well, Renteria-Gonzalez said.

A spokesperson for Geo categorically denied the allegations detailed in the complaints.

“GEO strongly disagrees with these baseless allegations, which are part of a long-standing, politically motivated, and radical campaign to abolish ICE and end federal immigration detention by attacking the federal government's immigration facility contractors,” said Christopher V Ferreira, a Geo group spokesperson.

Ferreira added that “GEO has comprehensive policies in place for the reporting and investigation of all incidents that occur at the Center, including instances of assault and/or sexual assault. These policies are governed by standards and requirements established by the US Department of Homeland Security.”

Geo did not respond to questions about Reyes's employment status at SLIPC.

The detainees who filed complaints against Reyes and other SLIPC staff said that they faced harsh retaliation for doing so.

When Jane Doe filed a Prea complaint with Ice using a paper form and through the phone hotline, detailing that Reyes had sexually assaulted her, she received no response, according to her legal complaint.

But afterwards, Reyes redoubled his efforts to stalk her, the complaint alleges – and forced her to perform oral sex on him, saying he had her cornered in the facility's “camera blind spots” where no one would see them.

When she attempted to resist, Reyes told her he had found her mother's home address in the Dominican Republic, Doe alleges in the complaint, and told her that if she were deported, he would follow her to her family's residence where “you won't have any protection”.

Jane Doe said Reyes and other staff also blocked her from accessing medical treatment for her epilepsy, even as her seizures became more severe and frequent during her time in detention, the complaint states. He repeatedly cornered Doe as she was en route to the medical center to receive treatment, and told her he would watch her on cameras while she was receiving medical evaluation. On one occasion, he told Doe he was “masturbating to her because he saw her body in medical condition when she was in an observation cell”, the complaint alleges.

“We feel so vulnerable, impotent,” Renteria-Gonzalez said.

After he reported that Reyes had sexually assaulted him, Renteria-Gonzalez said, Reyes burst into his housing unit and yelled, “You should have never put my name on it!”, in reference to the complaint to Ice. Renteria-Gonzalez said he was then placed in solitary confinement for two weeks.

After Renteria-Gonzalez reported harassment from another officer, his complaint was dismissed as “unsubstantiated” and the officer came back and told him: “They can't do nothing to me,” according to the complaint.

Meanwhile, Garcia-Valenzuela said he was repeatedly sent to solitary confinement, he believes in retaliation for speaking out. He said staff at the detention center falsely reported that he had attempted self-harm, and needed to be placed under suicide watch, even though he had not in fact tried to hurt himself.

At one point, while Garcia-Valenzuela was in the medical isolation unit, officers delivered him a meal that consisted of a few potatoes and a few grains of cereal. There was no spoon provided, he said, and there was a note that instructed him to eat it “like a dog”.

Shortly after that incident, he said, a doctor at the facility suddenly – without explanation – stopped providing him access to medication for hand pain that had been exacerbated by his working in Reyes's night-shift program.

He has avoided making further complaints. He tries not to speak to or make eye contact with staff, and avoids leaving his dorm. He limits trips to the restroom, he said. And rather than go to the cafeteria to warm up his food and eat, he takes his meals cold, and dines in bed. “I have to stay in the back-most corner of my bed, and eat there,” he said.

“I don't ever feel at ease.”

The allegations of abuse at SLIPC come at a time when the health and safety of trans people in federal custody is especially under threat, advocates say.

On the first day of his presidency, Donald Trump unveiled a flurry of executive actions targeting trans rights, rolling back anti-discrimination protections and mandating that people in immigration detention be placed in facilities based on their sex assigned at birth.

On 16 January – the last day of Joe Biden's administration – Ice reported that 47 trans people were in Ice detention facilities around the country and that 69 had been arrested since the start of the fiscal year. As soon as Trump took office, the agency began omitting data on the number of transgender people in immigration detention from its reports.

“The government is essentially refusing to acknowledge the existence of trans people, let alone their humanity,” Decker of RFK Human Rights said.

Although a federal judge has blocked enforcement of Trump's ban on transgender healthcare in federal prisons, Decker told the Guardian that inside detention centers, guards and staff have been emboldened to deny healthcare to trans clients, or retaliate against them for requesting care.

“I worry that the situation will only get worse from here for trans people,” she added.

The administration also closed the civil rights division of the DHS, as well as the ombudsman office overseeing immigration detention, arguing that the staff in these congressionally mandated divisions were “internal adversaries that slow down operations”.

The divisions included employees tasked with regularly visiting detention centers, investigating complaints and preparing reports for Congress. Detainees facing discrimination, neglect and abuse now have even fewer options for recourse, Decker said.

It's a scary, difficult moment to speak out, said Campos-Flores, a 37-year-old single parent of two children who came to the US from El Salvador when they were 11 years old.

During the seven months that Campos-Flores was detained at SLIPC, they would call their parents every day, just to reassure them that they were still alive. Periodically, they would beg their family and their lawyer to find ways to get them out. “I asked them to try to book me into another facility,” they said. “It was too much – just too much.”

In November 2024, they were deported – and immediately they felt a sense of relief to be freed from Reyes, they said. But they couldn't stay away from their children, who are US citizens – so they crossed back into the US and were again apprehended.

They are currently detained at a different correctional facility in Louisiana, serving a criminal sentence for illegal re-entry. But after finishing their sentence, it is likely they will be transferred back to SLIPC before deportation – and face the same officers who harassed them, or ignored their complaints.

“But I have my 12-year-old son. He is also gay, he likes boys, and I don't want him to experience anything like what I have experienced,” they said. They want to fight for his rights, too, they said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

                                                                                Rehearsal time is over. The world's best and most ambitious young pianists have descended on Warsaw for the Frederic Chopin International Piano Competition — for some, a gateway to classical music glory. 
Fans from around the globe snapped up tickets as much as a year ago. The lucky ones attended the opening night concert on Oct. 3 and will follow along as the contest builds to a thrilling climax on Oct. 20.
Winning the Chopin International — held every five years in the 19th-century composer's homeland — can raise the curtain to playing at venues across the globe and signing contracts                                    



                                                                                In his famous tragic play Romeo and Juliet, the English playwright William Shakespeare wrote, “What's in a name?” As it turns out, there is quite a lot in a name, particularly a surname, which is commonly known as a person's last name in Western societies. A surname is written after the first name, which is also referred to as a given name or, traditionally, a Christian name. A closer look at the history of surnames reveals some fascinating insights into their origins.
  It may come as a surprise to some that up until about 1,000 years ago, surnames were                                    



                                                                                Continued from yesterday（延續自昨日）

While many early surnames in England were strongly influenced by the work people did, like Carpenter or Plumber, jobs were not the only factor. Physical characteristics, personal nicknames, geographical locations and even parents' first names also played a role.
  It's not hard to imagine how the color of a person's hair could have led to a surname like “Redhead” or “White,” while a darker complexion might have resulted in the last name “Black.” Meanwhile, someone known as a quick runner might have earned the surname “Swift,” while a clever or cunning individual could have been called “Fox”                                    



                                                                                Many popular English expressions originate from the world of sports. While their roots lie in athletics, their meanings extend far beyond the playing field. Here are three examples.
Hat Trick

This expression comes from cricket. When a bowler dismisses a batter, it's called “taking a wicket.” Taking three wickets in a row is a great achievement, so in the past, a bowler who achieved this was rewarded with a hat. Later, sports like hockey and soccer adopted it to mean scoring three goals in a game. Nowadays, this phrase means to achieve any three successes consecutively, not just in sports. For example,                                    ","{'href': 'https://www.taipeitimes.com', 'title': 'Taipei Times'}","world"

            Her arm was the first thing Shyam Babu saw, tiny and frail, poking through the mud like a discarded doll. But this was no doll. Covered with ants and bleeding from what doctors would later suspect were animal bites, the pig farmer had just made a terrifying discovery near a river in this north Indian village.
    


            Wrapped in a towel, barely stirring, but slightly breathing, was a newborn baby girl buried beneath a foot of earth.
    


            “I went closer and saw that the child's fingers were moving. I went even closer and could sense a heartbeat,” Babu recalled as he retraced his steps leading to the horrific discovery last month in the sugarcane and paddy fields of rural Shahjahanpur district in Uttar Pradesh state.
    


            “I realized the child was alive…. Someone had buried a baby alive.”
    


            Terrified, he ran to raise the alarm. Soon a crowd was at the scene.
    


            In a frantic but delicate rescue, captured on images and video reviewed by CNN, a policeman dug away the packed earth. The girl, later estimated to be about 15 days old, was completely smeared in mud. Gasping for air, her mouth and nostrils clogged with dirt. As she was lifted from the ground, she let out a weak, painful cry.
    


            Rushed to the Shahjahanpur Medical College, she was found to have a severe infection, respiratory distress, injuries, and sepsis. The local police started searching for the girl's parents – and a motive.
    


            Gourav Tyagi, a local officer investigating the case, told CNN they had three theories. Her parents could have believed their sickly child had died and buried her according to local customs. The newborn had syndactyly, a condition where two or more fingers or toes are joined together and could have been abandoned owing to the stigma around disabilities in parts of India.
    


            And there was another angle: that she was discarded because of her gender, another victim of female infanticide in the world's most populous nation, where a deep-seated preference for sons can lead to girls being abandoned or killed.
    


            Dr. Rajesh Kumar, a pediatrician in Shahjahanpur for two decades, told CNN he has seen four or five such cases before.
    


            But he noted: “I have never seen a boy in such a situation… left alone and abandoned.”
    


                    “There is pressure to birth a boy. A woman faces a lot of difficulty. They do not want girls so the woman goes to temples and does rituals to have a boy.”
                


                    Nanhe Singh, 60, villager
                


            In the quiet hush of the neonatal intensive care unit at Shahjahanpur Medical College, the only constant sound was the monotone of the heart monitor, its low hum keeping watch over the baby sleeping inside the sterile incubator.
    


            When she first arrived there, she was clinging to life. Her face was blue from a lack of oxygen, her body temperature dangerously low, and her blood pressure was so faint it was unrecordable. Against all odds, doctors initially saw a flicker of hope.
    


            “Miracles do happen,” Dr Kumar told CNN at the time, as the medical equipment worked to keep the tiny girl alive.
    


            “Our hospital staff is taking care of her like family. Our nursing staff, ward nannies, and doctors are all taking care of her like she is our child.”
    


            Soon they had given her a name – Pari, the Hindi word for “angel.”
    


            Shahjahanpur district, where Pari was found, lies in the fertile, populous plains of north India. It is overwhelmingly rural, with most of its three million people working in agriculture. Paddies and wheat fields line the meandering roads between villages. The holy river Ganges skirts the district's southern border.
    


            Beneath the surface of this agrarian life, traditional gender roles exert a powerful force. And it is this culture that paralyzed Babu, 25, with fear after he found Pari.
    


            “I did not have the courage to take the child out myself. I feared that people would see me, think the wrong things, and blame me instead,” Babu said, before he ran to find his mother.
    


                    “If they find out it is a boy then it is okay. If it is a girl, then they get her aborted.”
                


                    Sapna Singh, 28, villager
                


            According to the last national census in India, carried out in 2011, Shahjahanpur had about 872 females for every 1000 males, a wider gap than a national average already imbalanced.
    


            That imbalance, activists and locals say, is partly due to a deeply entrenched system of cultural, economic, and social biases that systemically devalues girls – and the desirability of raising them.
    


            “There is pressure to birth a boy,” said 60-year-old Nanhe Singh, from Shahjahanpur's Paina Bujurg village close to where Pari was found.
    


            “A woman faces a lot of difficulty. They do not want girls so the woman goes to temples and does rituals to have a boy.”
    


            The preference for sons is rooted in a patriarchal structure where boys are expected to carry on the family lineage, inherit property, and perform essential last rites for their parents.
    


            Daughters, on the other hand, are often perceived as a significant financial liability.
    


            “One of the biggest issues with having a girl is the tradition of dowry” – the money or property that is often demanded by a groom's family at a wedding, vegetable seller Achal Kumar Gautam, 32 told CNN.
    


            Despite being outlawed, this is a “tradition going on for generations and has to be followed,” he said. “This becomes a burden over time for us. We have to pay the dowry, there is no other way around it. This is more expenditure which we would not have to do for a boy.”
    


            With such pressure to give birth to a son, some women turn to medical procedures to find out if they are carrying a boy or a girl, said another villager from Paina Bujurg, Sapna Singh.
    


            “If they find out it is a boy then it is okay. If it is a girl, then they get her aborted. This happens here,” the 28-year-old said. “People do this inside their homes, and no one gets to know outside.”
    


            To combat female feticide India enacted a law in 1994 prohibiting the use of medical technologies to determine the sex of a fetus. Yet, in these labyrinthine lanes of rural India, a dangerous and illegal abortion trade thrives.
    


            Shahjahanpur's superintendent of police Rajesh Dwivedi told CNN sex determination tests “have severely reduced over time,” while acknowledging that it continues to happen “on the sly.”
    


            “We cannot change everything, but immense change has happened,” he said.
    


            According to activist Sunita Aralikar, illegal sex determination “is something that goes on in households of all classes.”
    


            Aralikar, who herself survived being buried alive as a baby 70 years ago, has dedicated her career to empowering women and fighting the deep-seated cultural biases that devalue girls.
    


            She sees this latest tragedy as proof of how little has changed.
    


            “This association of glory and success with a boy child, and failure and burden with a girl child is something that cuts across the country,” she said.
    


            A United Nations State of World Population report estimated India had 45.8 million “missing females” as of 2020 – a staggering figure driven by a combination of sex-selective abortions before birth and higher death rates for girls due to infanticide after birth.
    


            According to Sapna Singh, families in her village often “scare and threaten” women who become pregnant. “They tell her they only want a son,” she said, adding that the pressure can escalate dramatically. “They beat her up. Many people kill women if they are not birthing boys. It is not the woman's fault. They beat her, threaten her, and abuse her.”
    


            Kamaljeet Kaur, who has spent 18 years as a health volunteer in the villages of Shahjahanpur, described gender discrimination and female infanticide as a “systemic issue.”
    


            “It happens rampantly here,” she told CNN.
    


            The consequences for women who bear multiple daughters can be devastating, Kaur said. “If a woman has daughters, especially a second or a third, her life turns into hell,” she said. “Men are continuing to follow old traditions and customs. She is abused, told she has no brains… her position in the family is based on whether she has a son or daughter.”
    


            This relentless abuse, Kaur noted, strips women of their voice, turning them into “a mute spectator to everything happening to her.” And the silence is brutally enforced by the community itself.
    


            “People do not raise their voice against this as they do not want to make enemies,” Kaur said. “If you raise your voice, the local shop owner won't give you milk, neighbors won't help… you're basically isolated.”
    


            Local media reports from across Uttar Pradesh paint a similarly bleak picture.
    


            In November of last year, a baby discovered by a roadside in Gorakhpur was treated by doctors and survived. That same month, residents in Bareilly discovered a 20-day-old girl abandoned in a field. In December, a 10-day-old baby girl was found dead in a garbage dump in the city of Baghpat.
    


            This grim reality evokes a sense of sorrow and powerlessness among women in Paina Bujurg. Nanhe Singh said she was aware of Pari's case.
    


            “I feel very bad, but what can we do?”
    


            In the Shahjahanpur hospital, the first 24-hours after Pari was found gave the medical staff cause for hope. But then her condition deteriorated fast.
    


            Necrosis – the death of body tissue – progressed to her face and scalp. Her breathing grew increasingly labored, and doctors had to place her on oxygen support. She required a blood transfusion to keep her alive.
    


            At two weeks old, Pari was severely malnourished and weighed less than 1.7 kilograms (3.7 pounds), making it difficult for her body to ward off any infection.
    


            After a CNN team had left the area last month, police officer Gourav Tyagi confirmed that Pari had died. The police had still not managed to track down her parents and were widening their search, he told CNN.
    


            “I did not have words when she passed away. It was hard to unplug all the monitors and let the baby go,” said Sarita Singh, the nurse in charge of the newborn unit at the hospital. “We were her family.”
    


            Staff did not want her life to be defined by tragedy.
    


            “When she came here, she looked beautiful,” Singh said. “Which is why we named her Pari.”
    


            In 2015 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government launched its “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao” or “Save the Girl Child, Educate the Girl Child” campaign to address India's skewed ratio of children and to promote women's empowerment.
    


            The government says the program has brought wider attention to gender discrimination and seen some success. The country's national sex ratio at birth rose from 918 girls per 1,000 boys in 2014-15 to 934 in 2019-20, according to data published by the government.
    


            The gross enrollment ratio for girls in secondary education has increased from 77% to 81% in the same period, the same data showed.
    


            However, the program has also faced some criticism. A parliamentary committee in 2021 noted that a disproportionately large percentage of the scheme's funds – nearly 79% between 2016 and 2019 – was spent on media advocacy rather than on concrete health and education initiatives for girls.
    


                    “Some people drown the child… some bury her under the ground. Many people just give the child away in hospitals. They don't even take the girl child home.”
                


                    Sarita Singh, nurse, Shahjahanpur Medical College
                


            Billboards and broadcasts promoting the campaign to protect and educate India's girls are now ubiquitous in cities, towns and on the airwaves.
    


            But the silence following Pari's death was deafening. Her story was largely overlooked by the national news channels and failed to spark sustained outrage.
    


            For some, the campaign's impact also feels superficial. “People say the slogan… but in reality, no one is following it,” Singh, the hospital nurse said. “It has only become a saying.”
    


            CNN has contacted the Uttar Pradesh government for a response.
    


            The activist Aralikar believes that creating opportunities for female success is the key to shifting perceptions. “I'm not saying education and opportunities will erase the problem overnight, but it will at least level the playing field… Only when you start to see girls thrive do you believe they're worth investing in.”
    


            Meanwhile the police investigation and the search for Pari's parents continues.
    


            “There is a deeply regressive thought about girl children that continues to this day,” the nurse Singh said. “Some people drown the child… some bury her under the ground. Many people just give the child away in hospitals. They don't even take the girl child home.”
    


            For Babu, the man who found Pari, the encounter with her felt like an act of fate. He usually walks his pigs down a different path, closer to the river, he told CNN.
    


            “But because destiny had it that I'd have to save her life, I ended up here,” he said, pointing to the area near the road.
    


            “My wife was very worried. She kept saying I should bring the baby home so we can look after her… I would work harder as a laborer and raise her. We would never cause any harm to our children.”
    


            The father of two girls clung to that sense of purpose all week, watching the news and waiting for updates on the child he believed he had saved. He had already begun to imagine a future for her, hoping she would live a “long life and be brilliant.”
    


            The news of her death shattered that hope. “I have goosebumps,” he said upon learning of her death. “This is wrong.”
    


            “I wanted to meet her in the future. Strong, growing, healthy,” he said, his voice heavy with emotion. “I took her out of the soil but she has returned to it.”

Prominent progressives dismiss GOP's proposition to discuss healthcare subsidies only after government reopens

US politics live – latest updates

The US Senate vote to re-open the government failed for a tenth time on Thursday after prominent progressives in Congress rejected Republican promises to discuss healthcare subsidies once the government is funded.

The Senate vote on a short-term Republican funding bill failed with just 51 votes. A second vote on Pentagon funding on Thursday could begin the process of fully funding military operations and ending the lapse in military pay if it passes. After the votes, senators are expected to leave Washington for the weekend, almost guaranteeing the shutdown lasts until at least Monday.

The Senate majority leader, John Thune, made his clearest offer yet to Democrats on Thursday morning, telling MSNBC he would guarantee them a vote on extending Affordable Care Act subsidies – the most crucial ask from the Democratic side – by a fixed date if they agree to reopen the government. “At some point, Democrats have to take yes for an answer,” Thune said.

On Wednesday evening, the progressive senator Bernie Sanders and representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pre-emptively rejected that kind of promise during a 90-minute CNN town hall, insisting they need actual legislation signed into law before they will budge.

“I don't accept IOUs. I don't accept pinky promises. That's not the business that I'm in,” Ocasio-Cortez told the audience. When asked if a Trump pledge would be enough, Sanders replied mockingly: “Oh yeah, no doubt, because the president is a very honest man.”

The New York congresswoman and Vermont senator rejected any short-term fix, calling it an attempt to delay political pain until after next year's midterm elections. “What we will not accept is for the ACA premiums to skyrocket on the American people,” Ocasio-Cortez said.

Meanwhile, the House speaker, Mike Johnson, has kept the chamber out of session for four weeks after Republicans passed their funding bill, with GOP leaders arguing that returning to Washington would only reduce pressure on Senate Democrats. Johnson and the Democratic minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, have traded barbs over the month, and have now agreed to debate on C-Span, though no date has been set.

Thune said he would support extending the healthcare subsidies if they included reforms such as income caps, but he would not commit to a one-year extension estimated to cost $35bn annually, and acknowledged he could not guarantee an outcome. He did not rule out the potential for the shutdown to run until Thanksgiving, over a month away: “I hope it doesn't last through Thanksgiving,” he said.

The standoff has left federal workers without paychecks for weeks, with no end in sight. At the CNN town hall, one worker with four children asked how he was supposed to feed his family. Another woman said her housing was at risk because the shutdown had blocked her government-backed loan.

Ocasio-Cortez tried to reassure them while holding firm: “My hope is that we're ready to resolve this as quickly as possible.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

U.S. President Donald Trump will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest as part of renewed efforts to end Russia's war against Ukraine, Trump announced on Oct. 16.

The announcement followed a phone call between the two leaders earlier the same day, during which they also agreed to hold a high-level U.S.-Russia meeting next week.

""The United States' initial meetings will be led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, together with various other people, to be designated,"" Trump wrote on TruthSocial. 

It remains unclear who will represent Russia at the meeting.

""President Putin and I will then meet in an agreed-upon location, Budapest, Hungary, to see if we can bring this 'inglorious' war between Russia and Ukraine to an end,"" the U.S. president added.

The conversation comes a day before President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to Washington, where he is expected to press for the transfer of Tomahawk long-range missiles to Ukraine.

The call marks the first direct contact between the two leaders in nearly two months and comes amid heightened tensions over the stalled peace talks after Putin's effective dismissal of direct negotiations with Zelensky — an initiative that Trump personally backed.

Trump and Putin last spoke on Aug. 18, after Trump's meetings in Washington with Zelensky and European leaders. Following that call, the U.S. president said he had begun arranging a direct meeting between the Ukrainian and Russian presidents.

Zelensky rejected Putin's invitation to meet in Moscow, calling it impossible while Russia bombs Ukraine, but repeatedly said he is ready to meet the Russian leader on neutral ground.

Trump and Putin also met in Alaska on Aug. 15 to discuss prospects for a peace settlement in Russia's war and broader bilateral cooperation — their first meeting since Trump's return to office.

Since the Alaska summit, no tangible progress has been made toward peace.

Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported that the meeting convinced Putin he could intensify air strikes on Ukraine without facing serious pushback from Washington.

Since then, Russia has escalated attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure while diplomatic engagement between Washington and Moscow has faltered.

In April, Hungary's parliament voted to approve the country's withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC), potentially allowing Putin to visit the country despite his arrest warrant issued in 2023 over the abduction of Ukrainian children.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose government is widely seen as illiberal, has blocked or delayed military aid to Ukraine, maintained ties with Putin, and echoed Kremlin narratives.

After Trump's announcement, Orban posted on X that the planned meeting is ""great news for the peace-loving people of the world,"" adding that Hungary is ""ready"" to host the presidents.

The U.S. president has recently intensified his criticism of Russia, saying in September that Ukraine could win the war and regain all Russian-occupied territories lost since the invasion. 

The U.S. is also weighing whether to supply Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles, which have a range of up to 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles), allowing Kyiv to strike targets deep inside Russian territory.

The call came as both sides signal entrenched positions: Moscow warned of escalation, while Washington weighed new measures that could reshape Ukraine's battlefield capabilities.

Trump said on Oct. 15 that Ukraine wants to ""go offensive"" in the war against Russia and that he will decide whether to approve such a strategy after meeting with Zelensky in Washington on Oct. 17.

Putin warned on Oct. 5 that arming Ukraine with long-range missiles capable of reaching Siberia would mark ""a new stage of escalation"" and could derail any progress in U.S.-Russia relations.

Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor.



The announcement followed a phone call between the two leaders, during which they also agreed to hold a high-level U.S.-Russia meeting next week.



The move follows President Volodymyr Zelensky's Oct. 14 decree to strip Odesa Mayor Hennadiy Trukhanov of his Ukrainian citizenship. 

Explosions have been reported in Kharkiv, Izium, Kropyvnytskyi, and Poltava. Earlier, the Air Force issued a nationwide missile warning after Russia launched MiG-31 bombers. 

""There will be no oil, (Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is) not buying his oil from Russia, it started — you know, you can't do it immediately, it's a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon,"" U.S. President Donald Trump said.



Another Ukrainian military training ground was hit by a Russian missile strike on Oct. 16, wounding troops. 

The decision to rename Fairy Tale Square was made “in order to honor prominent political leaders of modern times, as well as to draw international attention to the reconstruction of the hero city of Chernihiv,"" according to the explanatory note.



Ukraine's General Staff has released a recording of what it says are North Korean soldiers guiding strikes into Ukraine's Sumy Oblast.

""Our military knows what to do; they have the military potential and all the necessary capabilities,"" Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.





""President (Donald) Trump has instructed the ambassador and myself to tell our European allies that we would be in favor of whether you would call it a 'Russian oil tariff' on China or a 'Ukrainian victory tariff' on China,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Virginia Roberts Giuffre seeks to explain how she was able to rationalize staying for nearly two years in what she called 'Epstein's sickening world.'Bebeto Matthews/The Associated Press

A posthumous memoir by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre offers an expanded account but few new revelations about her longstanding claims to have been sexually trafficked by the late financier to billionaires, politicians and Britain's Prince Andrew.

Titled Nobody's Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice, the book is set for release Tuesday. It was co-written by author-journalist Amy Wallace, and was completed before Giuffre died by suicide in April.

Giuffre told her story in interviews and lawsuits for 16 years. The book, which she said enabled her to tell her whole story and “provide context where it has been sorely lacking,” revisits her allegations involving the men who socialized with Epstein, but carefully so. In many instances, she has left their names out, writing that she either didn't know them or feared retaliation.

But she has added details and description of how her alleged experiences with Epstein – after what she said was a traumatic childhood and other instances of sexual abuse – affected her psychologically and left her struggling to cope. Giuffre also seeks to explain how she was able to rationalize staying for nearly two years in what she called “Epstein's sickening world.”

Giuffre's memoir was completed before she died by suicide in April.The Associated Press

“I needed him not to be a selfish, cruel pedophile. So I told myself he wasn't one,” she wrote about her mindset at the time.

Giuffre first met Epstein in the summer of 2000, weeks before she turned 17, while working at the spa at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida. In the book, she retells the story of being hired by Epstein's longtime companion, Ghislaine Maxwell, to work as a “masseuse” for Epstein.

She said Epstein and Maxwell coaxed her into performing sex acts during massages, then began taking her to his luxurious homes in New York, the U.S. Virgin Islands and New Mexico, where she says she met – and sometimes was directed to have sex with – numerous famous friends and acquaintances of Epstein.

Maxwell has denied participating in any sexual abuse and called Giuffre's account of being trafficked a lie, as have all of the men she has publicly accused.

In the book, Giuffre details alleged encounters with Prince Andrew, who she sued in 2021, claiming that they had sex when she was 17. Andrew denied her claims and the two settled the lawsuit in 2022.

Speculation that Epstein was involved in a global sex trafficking ring continues to cause headaches for the Trump administration, which has been under pressure to publicly release more records related to the FBI's investigations of Epstein and Maxwell.

Family of Virginia Giuffre says they are shocked that Trump said Epstein ‘stole' her

Even Giuffre, in the concluding pages of the book, asks: “Where are those videotapes the FBI confiscated from Epstein's houses? And why haven't they led to the prosecution of any more abusers?”

In the book, she describes meeting Trump once at Mar-a-Lago, where her father worked, but doesn't accuse Trump of wrongdoing.

Trump “couldn't have been friendlier,” Giuffre said, adding that he offered to help her find babysitting work.

Giuffre also mentions that she was once present for dinners Epstein had with former President Bill Clinton and former Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, but she also didn't accuse them of any wrongdoing.

Giuffre broke off contact with Epstein in 2002. Three years later, Palm Beach police began investigating Epstein after the parents of another teenage girl reported that their daughter had also been paid for a sex act. Police identified multiple underage girls with similar stories about being hired to give sexualized massages, but the investigation ended in 2008 when Epstein pleaded guilty to procuring a person under 18 for prostitution. He served 13 months of an 18-month jail sentence.

Analysis: The Epstein affair has turned the MAGA narrative on its head

In the book, Giuffre wrote that Epstein and Maxwell persuaded her to become a recruiter who found other girls who would perform sexualized massages on Epstein – something she called “the worst thing I've ever done in my life.”

“The faces of the girls I recruited will always haunt me,” she wrote.

Federal prosecutors in New York brought new charges against Epstein in 2019 but he killed himself in jail as he awaited trial. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 of charges including sex trafficking and is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Giuffre wasn't part of either case.

Many Epstein victims have told their stories publicly over the years, but Giuffre always stood apart with her claim to have been “loaned” to Epstein's rich and powerful friends and acquaintances.

The Associated Press typically does not name people who say they are the victims of sexual abuse unless they have come forward publicly with their stories, as Giuffre has.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Can Hamas be disarmed in Gaza?","https://www.dw.com/en/can-hamas-be-disarmed-in-gaza/a-74375825","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 10:25:42 GMT","

Hamas is still present in Gaza, engaging in bloody power struggles with rival clans and groups. Many states want to see Hamas disarmed, but how realistic is that? 

Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist group based in Gaza, has executed what it says are criminals and traitors from rival clans and groups inside the territory.

Some of these brutal executions were carried out in public, with Hamas sharing footage of the killings on social media. It says some of the individuals committed murder and claims others spied for Israel. 

Hamas — which is classified as a terrorist organization by Germany, the US and several other countries — has been keen to reassert control over Gaza mere days after its war with Israel ended.

It still commands some 40,000 fighters, according to Israeli daily Haaretz, who can now be seen reappearing on the streets and squares of Gaza.

Hamas operatives are taking action against Palestinians in Gaza it accuses of capital crimes and political offenses. Dozens of people have also been arrested, according to Khaled Abu Toameh, a journalist working in the Palestinian territories, who spoke with the Israeli daily The Jerusalem Post. ""It is assumed that many of them will be executed,"" he said.

The Doghmush clan, which has clashed with Hamas for many years, is a well-known group in Gaza. Originally from Turkey, the clan settled in the Gaza Strip over the course of the 20th century, gradually taking control of two districts in the territory.

It is said to be affiliated with the Fatah party and the Palestinian Authority (PA), both of which are led by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Doghmush clan members were involved in the kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2006, according to a report by Arabic news broadcaster Al Jazeera.

The Abu Shabab clan, a Bedouin group based in the south of Gaza, is also involved in a power struggle with Hamas. The Palestinian Islamist group has accused Abu Shabab of collaborating with Israel, a claim the clan has denied. A Times of Israel newspaper report said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has supported Abu Shabab with weapons, and said Netanyahu had confirmed the move.

What does the future hold for Hamas in light of these power struggles? The group should be completely disarmed, according to US President Donald Trump's peace plan; however, this does not look likely for now.

Trump has made contradictory statements about the group's disarmament. Addressing the Israeli parliament on Monday, Trump proclaimed that ""virtually the entire region has endorsed the plan that Gaza will be immediately demilitarized, that Hamas will be disarmed and Israel's security will no longer be threatened in any way, shape or form.""

Yet before his speech, on the flight to Israel, Trump told reporters his government had allowed Hamas to temporarily rearm itself as it tries to restore order after months of war.

Most recently, however, Trump appeared to double down on the group's disarmament, saying if Hamas did not lay down its weapons, the US would disarm it by force.

Hamas sent a clear message when its armed operatives showed up in Gaza City shortly after the Israeli withdrawal, said Simon Wolfgang Fuchs, a professor of Islam at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. ""Hamas is making a point that it has by no means disappeared from the Gaza Strip; on the contrary, it continues to claim a role there,"" he said.

It could be a long road before Hamas is disarmed, according to an analysis by the US Atlantic Council think tank. Its study said that as long as Hamas continues to exist — whether as an armed group, political movement or even just as an idea — there is considerable risk that it will regain influence in the Gaza Strip to assert its own interests.

Hamas sees its weapons as a means to guarantee its existence — militarily, politically and symbolically, said Simon Engelkes, who heads Ramallah's branch of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation.

""Without a concrete political quid pro quo, Hamas will probably not agree to disarmament,"" Engelkes told DW. ""US President Trump's 'security guarantees' that the war in the Gaza Strip will not be continued due to the ceasefire agreement will not be enough at this stage.""

Even though Hamas' military structures were severely weakened in the war, its networks and presence in Gaza have remained intact, said Engelkes. ""This ensures their political viability in the short to medium term.""

After taking power in Gaza in 2007, Hamas was responsible for the police and internal security as well as the judiciary. It maintained Gaza security until October 7, 2023, the day it attacked Israel, so completely disarming Hamas will likely be difficult.

It remains to be seen who will assume responsibility for Gaza's internal security in the future. Egypt and Jordan have announced they are training some 5,000 security officers for future deployment in Gaza. Police authorities from the PA may also be involved, according to Trump's Arab partners.

""It is entirely possible that Israel will veto these local forces,"" said Fuchs. This is because the Israeli government does not want the PA to play any role in Gaza at all, he explained. Israel does not want any of these forces to have any connection to the PA government in Ramallah, according to Fuchs. ""As such, it is completely unclear how an agreement will be reached on this issue and who should control the security services should be.""

The US, its regional partners and many other states agree Hamas should no longer be in charge in Gaza. French President Emmanuel Macron has warned that Hamas still poses a threat.

""You don't smash a terrorist group with thousands of fighters, tunnels and this kind of weaponry overnight,"" Macron said after the Hamas-Israel ceasefire was agreed in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt earlier this week.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, meanwhile, declared that his country is willing and ready to help disarm Hamas. The German government, too, is against Hamas continuing to play a political role in Gaza.

The real conflict still lies ahead, said Engelkes. He added that it will center not only on weapons, but also on political control and legitimacy. ""Who will speak for Gaza in the future and with what authority?"" he asked.

Ignoring the interests of Hamas entirely will also be risky, said German foreign intelligence service head Martin Jäger during a recent parliamentary hearing.

There is a ""very real risk"" Hamas could become active outside of Gaza if it is not involved in the transitional administration of the Palestinian enclave, but pushed out of the territory or underground, Jäger told lawmakers. ""This would, of course, affect the entire Arab region, but also Europe.""

All observers agree that the main aim must be to allow Palestinians to live in dignity. If this is not ensured, violence could flare up once again.

US President Donald Trump has confirmed reports that the CIA is now able to carry out operations in Venezuela. But he ruled out that the agency would ""take out"" President Nicolas Maduro.

US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he had authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela.

The remarks represented a new escalation in the political conflict between the US and Venezuela, as the US has continued to strike boats on international waters, which have originated from the South American nation.

Trump accused the government of Venezuela of trafficking drugs to the US by sea.

""We are looking at land now, because we've got the sea very well under control,"" Trump said, in reference to the strikes on vessels in Caribbean waters. ""I think Venezuela is feeling heat.""

Trump was asked by reporters if he had given the CIA authority to ""take out"" Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, but he rejected the notion.

""That's a ridiculous question for me to be given. Not really a ridiculous question, but wouldn't it be a ridiculous question for me to answer?"" the US president replied.

The Trump administration has already set $50 million (€43 million) for information leading to Maduro's arrest and conviction on drug trafficking charges.

President Maduro was quick to hit back, denouncing Trump in an address.

""No to war in the Caribbean...No to regime change...No to coups d'etat orchestrated by the CIA,"" the leftist leader said.

The Venezuelan government accused the US of attempting regime change with the ultimate goal of stealing Venezuela's vast oil reserves.

It said it would raise a complaint before the UN Security Council on Thursday.

Donald Trump has announced he will meet Vladimir Putin in Hungary, after holding a two-hour phone conversation with the Russian leader.

The call came with Mr Trump due to meet Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House on Friday.

“I have just concluded my telephone conversation with President Vladimir Putin, of Russia, and it was a very productive one,” Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social.

“At the conclusion of the call, we agreed that there will be a meeting of our High Level Advisors, next week. The United States' initial meetings will be led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, together with various other people, to be designated. A meeting location is to be determined.

“President Putin and I will then meet in an agreed upon location, Budapest, Hungary, to see if we can bring this ‘inglorious' war, between Russia and Ukraine, to an end.”

Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, has positioned himself as something of a broker between Russia and the West, maintaining warm ties with both Mr Trump and Putin.

The meeting will mark the most significant talk held between the two leaders since their summit in Alaska in the summer.

Although the meeting on US soil was warm, relations between the two leaders plummeted when the talks did not ultimately result in progress.

Mr Trump has frequently expressed frustration over the Russia-Ukraine conflict in recent months, saying that it has been harder to solve than he initially thought.

Hungary and Slovakia, its pro-Putin ally, are Moscow's biggest EU customers of Russian oil, making Mr Orban one of Putin's few allies in Europe.

When the Russian leader invaded Ukraine, most Nato and EU members backed sanctions on Moscow, stopped buying Russian gas and made its president a pariah.

But Mr Orban signed new energy contracts with the Kremlin, decried EU sanctions, clashed with Mr Zelensky and continued to hold talks with Putin.

Buoyed by his success in the Middle East, the US president is now turning his attention to the European conflict.

“I actually believe that the success in the Middle East will help in our negotiation in attaining an end to the war with Russia/Ukraine,” he wrote in his Truth Social post announcing the meeting.

Mr Zelensky is travelling to Washington to press Mr Trump to sell him Tomahawk missiles that would allow Ukrainian forces to strike deeper into Russian territory.

The Ukrainian leader has argued such strikes would help to compel Putin to return to the negotiating table and end the war.

Speaking before his call earlier in the day, Mr Trump said: “I am speaking to President Putin now. The conversation is ongoing, a lengthy one, and I will report the contents, as will President Putin, at its conclusion. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”

Mr Trump told reporters travelling with him to Israel on Sunday that he planned to discuss the Tomahawks with Putin as a way to pressure him to end Russia's war in Ukraine.

“Do they want to have Tomahawks going in that direction? I don't think so,” Mr Trump said on Sunday. “I think I might speak to Russia about that.”

For many college basketball experts, selecting the greatest players of the women's poll era sounds easy — until they try it.

Of course, USC's Cheryl Miller and Diana Taurasi of UConn are relatively easy choices. But narrowing the list from there gets tricky, inevitably leaving out talented players, including those who sharpened their skills during later professional careers. 

In honor of the 50th anniversary of the women's basketball poll, The Associated Press assembled a list of the greatest players since the first poll in 1976. And in the spirit of the Top 25 rankings, the choices are certain to spark a debate and prompt plenty of handwringing among those who were in a position to vote.




“Nearly impossible,” Rebecca Lobo, a former UConn standout and NCAA champion, said of the assignment. “As I'm looking down the list, I'm like no-brainer, no-brainer, no-brainer. But then I'm like wait, there's too many no-brainers and not enough slots.”

Lobo was one of 13 members of a panel of former players and AP sportswriters who voted on the greatest players. They were instructed to consider only the athletes' college careers. Other factors, however, were up to their discretion, including championship pedigree, record-breaking statistics or simply their ability to will their teams to victory. 

“It was extraordinarily difficult especially to try to hone in on a players' college career and eliminate their pro career from your brain,” Lobo added. “There are going to be players who are Hall of Fame caliber players who aren't on the list.”




Joining Miller in the frontcourt on the first team are Breanna Stewart and Candace Parker. Caitlin Clark joins Taurasi as the guards.

Taurasi helped UConn win three national championships, including carrying the Huskies to the last two basically on her own during her junior and senior season.




“What an accomplishment and what an honor,” Taurasi said. “To think about the history of the game and where it's gone. You always have to look at the past to go into the future. There's so many great women who paved the way.”

Clark led Iowa to back-to-back NCAA championship game appearances while setting the career scoring record for any Division I women's or men's basketball player.

Her play on the court, including her logo 3-point shots, helped lift women's basketball to unprecedented levels of attention and energy during her last two seasons.

“Being named an AP All-American is one of the most storied honors in college sports,” Clark said. “It means a lot to be named to this all-time list alongside players I looked up to. It's fun to think about what it would have been like if we all played together.”

The frontcourt of Miller, Stewart and Parker dominated the game during their eras.

Stewart won four NCAA championships at UConn and earned Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four all four years. Parker led Tennessee to back-to-back titles in 2007-08. Miller, one of the original NCAA greats, starred for USC and led the Trojans to consecutive championships in 1983-84.

“I grew up watching Cheryl Miller play,” Parker said. “She'd be No. 1. My dad was like ‘This is who we wanted you to be.' I'm honored to be on this list with her.”

The second team's backcourt is UConn's Sue Bird and Virginia's Dawn Staley. The former Cavaliers guard and current South Carolina coach is the only women's player to win the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four on a losing team when her Cavaliers fell to Tennessee. Bird helped UConn win championships in 2000 and 2002. 

The Lady Vols' Chamique Holdsclaw, UConn's Maya Moore and Lusia Harris of Delta State are on the second team frontcourt. Holdsclaw was a three-time NCAA champion and twice earned the tournament's MOP honor. Moore was part of the Huskies' dynasty that won a then-record 89 consecutive games. She helped the Huskies to consecutive titles in 2009-10. 

Harris led Delta State to three AIAW titles in the mid-1970s and was the tournament's MVP each year.

“I'd watch these two teams play and I'm not sure who would win,” UConn coach Geno Auriemma said of the first and second teams selected by the panel.

Auriemma has four former players on the first two teams, but would enjoy looking to the bench at a group of reserves that includes: 

UCLA's Ann Meyers Drysdale, Kansas' Lynette Woodard and Texas Tech's Sheryl Swoopes in the backcourt. For the frontcourt, there is USC's Lisa Leslie, Baylor's Brittney Griner and South Carolina's A'ja Wilson.

“I am always asked if players today could play back in the ‘70s or '80s or vice versa. When you're great in one generation, you're going to be great in any generation,” said Meyers Drysdale, who also was a member of the voting panel. “I don't think there's any name that is wrong or there's any name that is right. There's so many great players that are going to be left off.”

‘Fox News @ Night' panelists applaud President Donald Trump for his Chicago crime intervention, and agree that local leaders are failing to meet the moment.

FIRST ON FOX: A federal grand jury indicted two alleged Antifa members with terrorism-related charges for a July 4 attack on an ICE facility in Texas.

The indictment, issued Wednesday and unsealed Thursday, charges Cameron Arnold and Zachary Evetts with providing material support for terrorism, attempting to murder federal and assisting officers and discharging firearms during attempted murders.

""For the first time ever, the FBI has arrested anarchist violent extremists and charged these Antifa-aligned individuals with material support to terrorism,"" FBI Director Kash Patel said in a statement.

""This was a planned and coordinated terrorist attack on the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas, where armed extremists tried to murder U.S. officers on July 4th,"" he continued.

""We are executing under President Trump's new authorities at record speed. To date, the FBI has made over 20 arrests tied to this case and related Antifa networks. No one gets to harm law enforcement. Not on our watch,"" Patel added.

Attorney General Pam Bondi also hailed the charges, vowing further prosecutions against Antifa members.

Arnold and Evetts are alleged to have participated in the ambush of federal agents at the ICE detention facility along with nine others. Authorities say the suspects used fireworks as a distraction while vandalizing vehicles outside the facility.

""Seconds later, coconspirator-1 [Arnold] opened fire on the officers, striking the Alvarado officer in the neck area as the unarmed correctional officers ducked and ran for cover. The wounded officer fell to the ground but was able to return a few shots. Coconspirator-1 continued to fire additional rounds until his rifle jammed. The attackers then left the scene,"" the indictment reads.

Ten individuals have been charged for their roles in the shooting of an Alvarado police officer at the Prairieland Detention Center.   (U.S, Separtment of Justice.)

Justice Jackson compares racial vote barriers to disability access in Louisiana v. Callais, during oral arguments on the legality of certain Voting Rights Act provisions. (Credit: United States Supreme Court)

Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson sparked debate Wednesday after she invoked the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) during oral arguments to illustrate how the government can remedy discrimination — an exchange that quickly took off on social media, where some critics accused her of comparing Black voters to disabled persons. 

The back-and-forth took place during nearly three hours of oral arguments in Louisiana v. Callais, which centers on states' obligation to consider race when drawing congressional maps under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

Jackson's remarks were a follow-up to questions posed by Justice Elena Kagan, who had also pressed counsel for Louisiana on what remedies the government must provide in cases of discrimination under the 14th and 15th Amendments, and if they must take into account issues of intent.

""Going back to this discriminatory intent point — and the fact that remedial action, absent discriminatory intent, is really not a new idea in civil rights laws. And my paradigmatic example of this is something like the ADA,"" Jackson said.

SUPREME COURT SIGNALS IT MAY LIMIT KEY VOTING RIGHTS ACT RULE

""Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act against the backdrop of a world that was generally not accessible to people with disabilities. And so it was discriminatory, in effect, because these folks were not able to access these buildings — and [it] didn't matter whether the person who built the building, or the person who owned the building, intended for them to be exclusionary. That's irrelevant,"" she continued.

""Congress said the facilities have to be made equally open to people with disabilities, if readily possible. I guess I don't understand why that's not what's happening here.""

Jackson went on to note that the idea of Section 2 is that the government ""is responding to current-day manifestations of past and present decisions that disadvantaged minorities,"" and to ""make it so they now have equal access to the voting system, right? They're disabled,"" she said, drilling down on the hypothetical. 

FORMER SUPREME COURT JUSTICE WARNS PARTISANSHIP PLAYS ‘TOO MUCH OF A ROLE' IN JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS

The lawyer arguing for Louisiana interjected to note, ""The difference is that the remedy under the ADA and other anti-discrimination laws are not stereotyping.""

""It's not race-based,"" Jackson quickly agreed of the ADA and other discrimination laws. ""I take your point.""

""But what you're saying, then, that if the problem of no access is about race, 'it's just too bad,' because you can't have a remedy that relates to race?""

""Absolutely not, Your Honor,"" counsel responded.

Despite the heavy backlash that erupted on social media and suggestions that she was describing Black people or other minorities as ""disabled,"" Jackson's remarks were not unique — nor were they unique in the eyes of the Supreme Court.

As she noted during the same exchange, the ""disabled"" terminology was used by the Supreme Court in a 2021 case, Allen v. Milligan, which also dealt with race-based redistricting issues in the state of Alabama and issues of discriminatory intent. 

In Milligan, Jackson said, the Supreme Court ""used the word disabled — we said, that's a way in which you see that these processes are not equally open.""

""So I don't understand why it matters whether the state intended to do that. What Congress is saying is, if it is happening, which Section 2 gives us the tools to determine, you've got to fix it.""

The court's conservative majority seemed poised to significantly weaken Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, though to what extent it will do so remains to be seen.

California gubernatorial candidate Steve Hilton shares concerns about the state's leadership on 'Hannity.'

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law on Monday that approved a study on potential inequities in youth sports, including ""race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, income, or geographic location.""

The Youth Sports for All Act, AB749, calls for a commission to be formed to carry out ""an assessment of the need and potential for a centralized entity to improve access to and involvement in sports for all youth, regardless of race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, income, or geographic location, that addresses issues in youth sports.""

The listed issues include ""How to foster a safe, supportive, and inclusive environment for youth sports.""

The law also establishes a fund in the state treasury for the commission to expend to pay for its research. 

The California Assembly's vote to pass AB749 comes months after it, and its Democrat majority, voted to block two bills that would have banned biological males from girls' sports on April 1. Every Democrat member voted against it then.

Now, the new law comes while the state is embroiled in a divisive culture war over trans athletes in girls' sports. The U.S. Department of Justice has sued the state's educational agencies for policies that enable biological males to compete in girls' sports, while 17 school districts have now passed a resolution to oppose those policies. 

California has been the largest state to defy President Donald Trump's ""Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"" executive order, joining Democrat strongholds like Minnesota, Maine and Illinois in upholding state laws to protect trans inclusion. The California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) has allowed trans athletes to compete in girls' high school sports since 2014, when state law AB 1266 was enacted. 

As a result, the 17 school boards have made it a point to speak out against the state's Democratic leaders, and express their support for protecting girls' sports. 

Oakdale Joint Unified School District became the latest district in California to adopt that type of Title IX resolution on Monday, when it passed unanimously among the district's trustees. Oakdale Joint Unified School District Board of Trustees President Clayton Schemper led the initiative. 

""As the Board President, I brought forth this resolution because to me, it's just common sense. There is clearly a biological difference between boys and girls and that is no more obvious than on the playing field,"" Schemper told Fox News Digital.  ""All we ask is that CIF stand for what is right and uphold its protections by ensuring fairness in girls' sports. Tonight, I encourage all school boards in California to do the same and to fight not only for, but alongside, our girls.""

Earlier in October, the biggest high school district by enrollment and land area in the state passed a similar resolution. Kern High School District regularly enrolls more than 40,000 students and employs more than 1,700 staff per year across its 31 schools, became the 16th district to do so on Oct. 6. Kern High School District (KHSD) trustee Derek Tisinger told Fox News Digital that he and his colleagues had to witness a Christian school forfeit to one of the schools in its district over a trans athlete last month. 

INSIDE GAVIN NEWSOM'S TRANSGENDER VOLLEYBALL CRISIS

Bakersfield Christian forfeited its freshman/sophomore game to Ridgeview High School in the final week of September, with the explanation that ""As a school grounded in the authority of Scripture, we affirm the biblical view that sex is determined by God at conception.""

""People try to say, ‘hey, it only affects a small amount of people,' but there were probably 30 girls that practiced and dreamed their whole life about playing volleyball, and they didn't get to play,"" Tisinger said. 

Resistance to trans athlete participation is believed to have prompted other volleyball forfeits at the varsity level across the state dating back to last year. 

This season, Jurupa Valley High School's girls' volleyball team has seen 10 regular-season games forfeited from its schedule, Fox News Digital previously reported. The team is currently embroiled in a national controversy after two of its senior players filed a lawsuit against the Jurupa Unified School District (JUSD), citing their experience with a trans athlete. 

Last season, a Christian high school girls' volleyball team in northern California, Stone Ridge Christian, forfeited a playoff game to San Francisco Waldorf, which had a trans athlete on its team. 

Newsom's office previously provided a statement to Fox News Digital, deferring responsibility for the situation to the CIF, CDE and state legislature. 

""CIF is an independent nonprofit that governs high school sports. The California Department of Education is a separate constitutional office. Neither is under the Governor's authority. CIF and the CDE have stated they follow existing state law — a law that was passed in 2013 and signed by Governor Jerry Brown (not Newsom) and in line with 21 other states. For the law to change, the legislature would need to send the Governor a bill. They have not,"" the statement read.

A bipartisan survey by the Public Policy Institute of California found the majority of California residents oppose biological male trans athletes competing in women's sports. 

That figure included more than 70% of the state's school parents.

""Most Californians support requiring transgender athletes to compete on teams matching the sex they were assigned at birth,"" the poll stated. 

""Solid majorities of adults (65%) and likely voters (64%) support requiring that transgender athletes compete on teams that match the sex they were assigned at birth, not the gender they identify with. An overwhelming majority of public school parents (71%) support such a requirement.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) reacted with hostility when asked about the New York Democrat running against Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) in 2028.

During a joint town hall with Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez with CNN, host Kaitlan Collins asked about a hot topic for the past several months — whether the New York congresswoman would mount a primary challenge to the aging Schumer. The question was met with outright hostility by Ocasio-Cortez and Schumer, who accused the host of distracting from other issues.

“I mean, no!” Ocasio-Cortez said, exasperated and waving her hands.

“I don't think this is about…” she added, trailing off, and joined by Sanders.

“This is what we're talking about!” Ocasio-Cortez yelled with a nervous laugh. “This is what we're talking about!”

Sanders echoed the remark, then launched into a tirade about CNN and the media's coverage.

“You have a country that is falling apart!” he yelled. “We have a housing crisis, a healthcare crisis, an education crisis, massive income and wealth inequality, a corrupt campaign finance system, and the media says, ‘Are you gonna run? What're you gonna run for?' Nobody cares!”

“Nobody cares!” Ocasio-Cortez echoed, continuing her nervous laughter.

Collins countered that there was obviously interest if it was something discussed by the president, vice president, and speaker of the House. Sanders said the trio was only talking about it to distract from “the real issues.”

“And let me tell you what the real issue is, let's see if CNN talks about it,” the Vermont senator began, going on to outline his problems with the United States, including a lack of guaranteed healthcare, paid family leave, medical leave, the minimum wage, homelessness, Trump's treatment of climate change, and the presence of “oligarchs on top who have more and more power every day.”

“Let's talk about that issue, not her own political future. She'll decide that,” he concluded.

Ocasio-Cortez has remained a favorite of the progressive Democratic cause, with her perceived stock rising as Democratic leaders struggle to counter the rising prominence of partisans to their left. Rumors have grown increasingly prominent in Democratic and Republican circles that the representative could mount a primary challenge to Schumer in 2028.

AOC STAYED AT SWANKY HOTELS AMID CROSS-COUNTRY ‘FIGHTING OLIGARCHY' CAMPAIGN

Elsewhere in the town hall, Ocasio-Cortez continued positioning herself as a progressive Democratic leader in future elections by using inflammatory rhetoric against Republicans, claiming Republicans believe women are “inferior” and “don't deserve equal rights,” that LGBT people are “subhuman,” and uses “white supremacist” messaging to “radicalize a generation of young boys in particular, away from healthy masculinity and into an insecure masculinity that requires the domination of others who are poorer, browner, darker, or a different gender than them.”

Despite this, she said that she will not “question your motive” or “allegiance to this country” if you disagree with her as a Republican, and that Republicans are stoking division.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Can a deep-blue city fend off Trump's ICE crackdown?

Updated at 2:10 p.m. ET on October 16, 2025

When National Guard troops from Texas started to arrive in Illinois last week, I drove out to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center on the outskirts of Chicago to get a better look at what the soldiers were sent to protect. The ICE building is just off the interstate, next to a pest-control company and several union halls. Protesters have been gathering here for weeks, so ICE covered the windows with plywood and closed off the street with jersey barriers and steel fencing. The facility looks not much bigger than a neighborhood hardware store, a vestige of a different era of immigration enforcement, when ICE wasn't working for a president who wanted a million deportations a year.

Television crews were set up outside, but I found only two protesters. One was Nick Sednew, a 40-year-old musician and father of a preschooler who told me he has been coming here every few days to try to overcome a feeling of dread and hopelessness. He stayed in the designated protest area about two blocks from where officers were coming and going, and it seemed unlikely they would notice him or the sign he held above his head, which said: ICE Out!

Sednew said he lives in a mostly Latino neighborhood in northwest Chicago that has been hit hard in recent weeks by raids. “This is not really abstract or political for me. I've witnessed them kidnapping my neighbors,” he told me. It was as if he were describing a foreign occupation, but from the beginning, President Donald Trump has framed his Chicago operation as a military conquest.

In early August, Trump announced his plans on Truth Social with cartoonish imagery from Apocalypse Now, with the president appearing as Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore, the film's fictional U.S. commander who massacred Vietnamese villagers with napalm. Chicago's skyline is behind him, shown as a flaming hellscape, with “Chipocalypse Now” scrawled across the bottom. “‘I love the smell of deportations in the morning' … Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR,” Trump wrote, adding emoji of helicopters.

Life seems to imitate social media in the current Trump era, and sure enough, Border Patrol agents in commando gear rappelled from a Black Hawk helicopter this month to raid an apartment building on the city's South Side. They kicked down doors and forced residents from their beds at gunpoint, using plastic zip ties to subdue U.S. citizens and noncitizens alike. A few days later, agents shot and wounded a woman who works as a teacher's aide at a Montessori school, whom they accused of ramming them with her vehicle. As the federal government's crackdown intensifies, I've spoken with activists and ICE officials who are all worried about where this is headed.

Sednew, bearded and wearing a hiking cap, told me he wanted to choose his words carefully because he fears the government will target resisters like him. “They are like a bully who has someone in a headlock and saying ‘Stop making me hit you.' They control every lever of power, and they're using the power of the state to punch down, with vengeance and ill will, on innocent people.”

Department of Homeland Security officials say they've deployed to Chicago to save the city from immigrants who commit crimes. Chicago has long had a reputation for shootings and gang violence, but there is no evidence that the recent influx of immigrants has made the city more dangerous. If anything, it's been the opposite: Chicago's murder rate is down by more than half since a spike during the pandemic, and this summer the city recorded the fewest number of killings in 60 years.

Read: The deeper crime problem that the National Guard can't solve

As a stage for Trump's top domestic-policy issue—mass deportations—Chicago is perhaps the biggest blue trophy among the American cities the president has threatened or already targeted. The city was among the first to adopt “sanctuary” policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, back in 1985. It remains a Democratic Party stronghold, and the home of the Obamas, whose vision of multiracial liberalism remains the country's main ideological antithesis to MAGA.

Trump seemed to hesitate after his Chipocalypse post, announcing he would order soldiers to Memphis and New Orleans instead of Chicago. But he pivoted back with no explanation a few weeks later, calling Chicago “the worst and most dangerous city in the World, by far.” He has assigned Texas National Guard units—who have earned a reputation for treating migrants harshly along the Mexico border—to deploy along with federalized Illinois troops. A district court has blocked the moves, for now, leaving Trump's mobilization in limbo. At the heart of the legal dispute are the administration's claims that it is facing a dangerous rebellion, enabled by Democratic leaders, that puts federal officers at risk and undermines the rule of law.

From where I stood with Sednew and the other protester, the threat to ICE seemed well under control. The village of Broadview, where the ICE building is located, has banned protests before 9 a.m. or after 6 p.m. The facility is barricaded and guarded by town police officers, alongside Cook County Sheriff deputies and Illinois State Police officers. Chicago police have played a similar role in the city, at times standing as a buffer between protesters and federal forces, but not assisting ICE.

Trump officials say they will not be deterred, and when DHS Secretary Kristi Noem visited the city earlier this month, she toured properties the administration is looking to acquire. “We're not going to back off,” Noem told reporters. “We're doubling down, and we're going to be in more parts of Chicago.”

Every city targeted by Trump so far seems to resist in its own way. Protesters in proudly weird Portland, Oregon, have been mocking Trump's “war zone” claims by dancing in animal costumes and riding bikes buck naked. In Los Angeles, where I went to cover protests in June, the crowds were large, angry, and more confrontational. Demonstrators stormed the freeway to block traffic, and some torched Waymo cars and hurled objects at police. California Governor Gavin Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass shared the crowd's disapproval of Trump, but they deployed hundreds of California Highway Patrol and LAPD officers to keep a lid on looting and stave off wider unrest that might vindicate the president's troop deployment.

In Chicago, city officials and neighborhood activist groups have been more disciplined, coordinating closely on efforts to slow ICE's “Operation Midway Blitz.” Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson are fighting the National Guard deployment in court, and Johnson has declared city property off-limits to ICE, though it's unclear how he'll be able to enforce the ban. When Noem tried to use the bathroom inside the Broadview municipal building earlier this month, staffers wouldn't even open the door.

Abigail Jackson, a spokesperson for the White House, told me in a statement that Pritzker and Johnson were “failed leaders” and “Trump-Deranged buffoons” who “would rather allow the violence to continue and attack the President for wanting to help make their city safe again.”

Many of the street-level activists I spoke with are working under the leadership of a decades-old group, the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, or ICIRR, which everyone pronounces as “ICER.” It sounds like a brand of antifreeze. ICIRR and other groups have tried to pressure businesses to block ICE from their property and have organized “Rapid Response” volunteer brigades that quickly deploy to locations where ICE officers attempt to make arrests. They document the encounters and hand out legal-aid information.

The activists have a tip line to report sightings and share vehicle descriptions and license-plate numbers. Once ICIRR activists verify the information, they post it to social media. The warning system identifies when a neighborhood is hot, so worried residents can stay indoors or away. When ICE is on the move, some volunteers will follow in cars, honking their horns and blowing whistles to create a rolling alarm system.

As ICE rushed into the city's Avondale neighborhood in northwest Chicago last week, volunteers gathered on a busy corner with signs telling motorists Cuidado! La Migra Está Cerca (“Watch out! ICE is nearby”). I spoke with Emmeline Prokash, who had propped up a warning sign on her stroller after dropping off her son at preschool. “What they're doing is disgusting,” said Prokash, a gardener and stay-at-home mom wearing a whistle around her neck. “It's not right. They're just abducting people. They're separating families. Kids are afraid to go to school. These are my neighbors.”

A helicopter circled overhead, and an activist with a telescope said he spotted the U.S. Customs and Border Protection seal on the fuselage. He had two whistles dangling from his neck and a small rearview mirror—typically used by cyclists—mounted on his sunglasses.

Another neighbor, Damien Madden, said he'd seen officers in plainclothes that morning chase down a man in a red T-shirt, stuffing him into a white minivan. They were gone in less than a minute. “I grew up in the city, and I'm used to cops doing what cops do,” Madden, 52, told me. “But at least they come up and identify themselves. There's due process. But to see someone just get chased and snatched, it's crazy.”

Read: ‘It's never been this bad.'

Passing motorists honked in support, and others pulled up to trade info. Watch out for a silver Jeep Wagoneer, one driver said. DHS and ICE officials say that activists like these are illegally obstructing them from doing their jobs and that this type of tracking has led to death threats and doxxing attempts. ICE officers typically work in plainclothes, but the agency has allowed them to wear masks as a form of identity protection.

Officers cannot force their way inside a private residence without a judicial warrant, and the technique known as “knock and talk,” in which officers try to persuade suspects to open the door, has been neutralized by activists' know-your-rights pamphlets. That has left officers relying more and more on street arrests. An opinion by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh last month gave ICE officers a green light to continue relying on factors that include ethnicity and physical appearance when determining who they question.

Brian Rodarte, the manager of a medical-supply company in the neighborhood, told me officers stopped one of his drivers that morning and let the man go after seeing his driver's license. Then the officers followed him to the company's employee lot and tried to drive in. Rodarte quickly shut the gate. “All of our employees are American citizens, but we don't need guys being racially profiled and detained,” Rodarte told me.

Rodarte, who is half Mexican and half Irish, told me he sees both sides of the immigration debate. He has no problem with ICE arresting violent criminals, he told me, but they should handle it the right way. “What they're doing is against our rights and totally unconstitutional,” Rodarte told me. “They're just racially profiling anyone who looks Hispanic.”

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin denied that federal forces are racially profiling suspects, and said that the claims were “disgusting” and “reckless.”

“Protesters and illegal aliens violently resist arrest, hit and kick agents, throw rocks and other projectiles at them, block and ram government vehicles, and form human barricades—causing serious injury to our brave law enforcement,” McLaughlin wrote in an email. “When confronted with imminent threats of severe or fatal harm, CBP Officers and Agents are authorized to defend themselves and others.”

In Chicago, as in L.A. before it, the federal mobilization is led not by career ICE officials but by Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol chief of the agency's El Centro Sector, more than 2,000 miles away in California. Bovino, who is now also the “at-large commander” for Trump's crackdown, has become a star of MAGA social media, and in Chicago he travels with a film crew, making DHS propaganda videos. In one, he patrols the city waterfront on a boat, in footage that builds to a glittering shot of Trump Tower. Another shows Bovino buying energy drinks at local markets and high-fiving Black residents, set to the Bee Gees' “Stayin' Alive.” Its apparent aim is to exploit the Black-brown tensions in Chicago that worsened during the Biden administration, as record numbers of migrants—especially Venezuelans—poured into the city, some on buses sent by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican. Some Black residents grumbled that the new arrivals received benefits that should go to needy American citizens, and Trump advisers, including Stephen Miller, have tried to fan those resentments to woo Black support. Asked about the message of Bovino's video, McLaughlin wrote, “Your obsession with race and weaponizing it is gross and unhealthy,” and told me, “Chicagoans, regardless of skin color, are happy to see law and order restored in their city.”

At Teques Bites, a small Venezuelan cafe in Avondale, I met owner Andry Garcia, who arrived in Chicago five years ago. He told me the ICE raids were sweeping up some of the “bad” Venezuelans—criminals—but also many others who were law-abiding and had pending asylum cases, or whose temporary legal residency had been taken away by the Trump administration.

Garcia said his sales have been cut by more than half since ICE arrived, and he's struggled to find delivery drivers brave enough to be out on the street, where they'd be easy ICE targets. Last year Garcia acquired a second, larger location with dreams of expansion, but his plan is now frozen. “We were just about to open when the whole ICE thing started,” he told me.

Trump officials claim they are hunting members of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang, which the president has designated as a foreign terrorist organization. The administration has used that label to conduct lethal attacks in the Caribbean on boats allegedly linked to the gang. The gang's presence in Chicago was used to justify the commando raid that Bovino's teams carried out on the apartment building in Chicago's South Shore neighborhood. DHS officials said they made 37 arrests, including of two Tren de Aragua members and a U.S. citizen wanted on a narcotics charge. Others arrested had criminal records that included battery, theft, and drug possession, officials told me. DHS has not released their names or provided evidence of some of the suspects' gang ties.

The apartment building was mostly deserted when I visited it last week, though a few residents remained. Shards of broken windows littered the exterior, and the entranceway reeked of cat urine and rotting trash. Prior to the raid, the building's residents were a mix of Black tenants, many of them destitute, and newly arrived Venezuelan families. In recent years, as code violations accrued and some occupants stopped paying rent, the building spiraled deeper into squalor and ruin, residents told me.

The lock on the front door was broken, and inside, the hallways, stairwells, and abandoned units had become dumping grounds for trash. I held my breath and stepped over rat carcasses through dark corridors swarming with flies. Fresh plywood covered some of the units hit by the raid, but others remained open, lacking doors. I could see rotting food, feces, and bloodstains along the floors amid broken furniture and diapers. An abandoned bicycle in one hall had training wheels, and a child's stuffed animal, a pink pig, had been left behind in the stairwell. The building had clearly been in a bad state even before Bovino's forces smashed their way through.

“You see this shit? This is how we live here,” one of the residents I met, Archie Collins, told me.

Collins, 59, said he'd moved into the building with his older brother five years ago, after losing his job as an inspector at a factory making parts for Ford. His brother received federal housing vouchers, but he died six months ago. Collins has lived alone since then. His electricity came through an extension cord plugged to another unit. His pants were torn. He'd been asleep when Bovino's forces stormed the building, pulling residents out of their apartments at gunpoint. Collins, who is Black, tried to show them his Illinois ID card. “They didn't give a shit,” he said.

Collins told me he felt terrorized and humiliated. “They didn't come here for me. I don't talk like a fuckin' Venezuelan,” he said, fuming. His front door had been smashed in.

When we finished talking, Collins asked for money, and told me he hadn't eaten all day. I said that, as a journalist, I could not pay for interviews, but I would be happy to buy him some food. We drove to a nearby supermarket, and Collins went up and down the aisles, filling his cart with bread, ramen noodles, milk, hot dogs, and pastries. I realized that no one from the federal government had gone to the building after the raid to check on the elderly Americans who lived there, to see if any of them needed help, or to apologize for handcuffing them in the middle of the night.

As we passed the freezer case, Collins asked me if he could get ice cream. He picked out a pint of fudge swirl and tore into it as soon as we got back in the car, using the lid as a spoon. Back outside the apartment building, he bundled the grocery bags in his hands and raced inside as if someone might try to rob him.

Images from Chicago this week show federal forces behaving aggressively: pointing weapons at unarmed protesters, lobbing tear gas in residential neighborhoods, arresting a 15-year-old. Border Patrol agents tackled and handcuffed a veteran producer for the Chicago television network WGN, who said she was merely walking to the bus stop. Agents claimed she threw an object at their vehicle, but she was released without charges. The ledger of violence has been mostly one-sided.

One afternoon last week, I went to another Chicago neighborhood that had been in the news, Humboldt Park, to speak with Jessie Fuentes, the local alderperson. Fuentes, 34, appeared in a video that went viral, showing her asking an ICE officer in a hospital emergency room if he had a judicial warrant. The officer violently yanked her arms behind her back and cuffed her.

As we walked along West Division Street in Humboldt Park—the “Puerto Rican mecca of the Midwest,” Fuentes joked—passing drivers honked in support, and residents who'd seen the video came up to hug her. At least once a week, Fuentes said, she walks through the neighborhood, passing out know-your-rights pamphlets. She helps coordinate Rapid Response brigades, and she told me she's helped arrange care for children whose parents have been taken by ICE, and helped recover vehicles that were left idling in the street after owners were seized so fast they didn't have time to park.

Graciela Guzmán, a 35-year-old Illinois state senator who represents the district, joined Fuentes, and told me one of the most frustrating things she hears from the administration is that the city is a war zone. “They're the ones using tear gas and rubber bullets, and breaking windows,” she said. “They're the ones bringing a war zone to Chicago.”

On the day Fuentes was handcuffed, she told me, she'd received a call from the hospital administrator. ICE officers were inside the emergency room, they told her, and patients were scared. The officers had arrived with a Venezuelan man who fell and broke his leg after federal agents raided the parking lot of a nearby Walmart, Fuentes said.

In the video, she firmly insists to the ICE officer that the man “has constitutional rights.”

“No, no,” the officer says. “You need to leave.”

The clip ends with Fuentes being led out of the building in handcuffs. Fuentes said a Border Patrol agent arrived in a white truck to pick her up, but told the officers to remove the handcuffs when he found out she was an elected official.

DHS identified the patient as Ronal Jose Orozco-Meza, who officials said had Temporary Protected Status, a form of provisional legal status, that he had tried to renew in April. That claim is now pending. The Trump administration has revoked those legal protections, leaving an estimated 600,000 Venezuelans eligible for arrest and deportation. Orozco-Meza's attorney Enrique Espinosa told me his client had been placed under 24-hour watch by ICE—and that officers had confiscated his cellphone and refused to let him speak with a lawyer for seven days, claiming they had not finished processing him. Orozco-Meza remains hospitalized with an ICE monitoring device, Espinosa said.

The legal fight over the deployment of the National Guard troops hinges largely on the credibility of the government's claims about the threats to federal forces in Chicago. At least two videos have circulated showing officers failing to make an arrest as protesters gather and try to free suspects from custody. The incidents do not show protesters attacking officers, but DHS officials say assaults are soaring and gangs in Chicago have bounties on federal officials. Federal prosecutors charged an alleged Latin Kings member last week who had supposedly put out a hit on Bovino, offering $10,000.

The federal agents have been quick to draw their guns, and they have shot two people in Chicago already. Silverio Villegas Gonzalez was shot and killed on September 12 as he attempted to drive away while an ICE officer was reaching into his vehicle. DHS initially claimed officers were severely injured in the incident, but body-camera footage released later showed that was not true. Villegas Gonzalez, 38, a father of two U.S.-born sons who arrived from Mexico in 2007, worked as a cook and had no criminal record other than years-old traffic violations, according to Reuters. DHS said it is investigating the incident, and that the officers had feared for their safety.

Three weeks later, border agents shot Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old day-care worker who had been driving behind them, honking her horn, and yelling “la migra!” out her windows. DHS said that the agents had defended themselves after Martinez rammed them and that they were trapped “by 10 cars.” On Friday, federal prosecutors charged Martinez and another defendant with impeding a federal officer while in possession of a deadly weapon.

Christopher Parente, Martinez's attorney, told me DHS's version of the incident is contradicted by body-camera footage captured by one of the three agents in the vehicle. (The two others had their cameras turned off, he told me.) The agents were not, in fact, boxed in, he said, and there appear to have been only two vehicles following the officers, not 10. The agent in the back seat, who Parente said had his finger on the trigger of the rifle, can be heard saying “Do something, bitch” just before the collision. The footage shows the driver yanking the steering wheel to the side as the crash occurs, and the agents jump out and start firing. Martinez was stuck five times but managed to drive away and call an ambulance, Parente said. Martinez told him she was still making car payments on the Nissan Rogue she was driving, and wouldn't have used it as a battering ram.

Martinez had a handgun in her purse, which she carries for self-defense, and for which she has a valid concealed-carry license, Parente said. The federal indictment does not claim Martinez brandished the weapon at any point. When federal agents arrested Martinez and tried to take her to a detention facility, the staff refused to admit her because her bandages were soaked through with blood, her lawyer said. She had to be taken back to the hospital, and a judge ordered her release from custody a day later.

As U.S. District Judge April Perry granted Illinois leaders a temporary restraining order to block the National Guard deployment on Friday, she wrote that DHS officials' perceptions of events in Chicago “are not reliable.” (Trump officials have appealed, and the next hearing is scheduled for October 22.) Protests outside of the ICE building in Broadview have never drawn more than 200 people, she noted, and did not meet the threshold of a “rebellion” that would necessitate federal troops. The deployment of the National Guard to the facility “or anywhere else in Illinois,” Perry wrote, “will only add fuel to the fire that Defendants themselves started.”

Free speech is endangered; unbiased and trustworthy news is elusive. In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard.

What TV can teach us about Instagram.

Instagram is starting to look more like TV, a move that might make some parents happy but ultimately proves that tech companies are getting closer to total victory in their campaign to capture as much of our attention as possible.

The company just announced a new default content setting for Teen Accounts that promises to show teen users only content that's “similar to what they'd see in a PG-13 movie.” (There are also new settings that serve rough equivalents of PG- and R-rated content to teens, although parents have to approve the change.) On top of that, Instagram is exploring the idea of launching a TV app so you can watch Reels on the big screen in your living room.

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

These developments dovetail nicely with the argument that Derek Thompson made a few days before Instagram's announcement: “Everything is television.” Citing a Federal Trade Commission filing, he points out that only 7 percent of users' time on Instagram involves consuming content from people you know. Meanwhile, podcasts are on Netflix, and AI can create an infinite circuit of slop to tap your consciousness into. “Digital media, empowered by the serum of algorithmic feeds, has become super-television: more images, more videos, more isolation,” writes Thompson.

Old-fashioned television used to be extremely tame, thanks to a combination of technological constraints, federal regulations, and societal norms. There used to be a limited number of channels, because there was a limited amount of spectrum to broadcast on. And because there was a limited amount of spectrum, nearly a century ago, the federal government created an agency to control the airwaves: the Federal Communications Commission.

In the medium's early days, there was still plenty of fear that TV was ruining American minds, especially young ones. Broadcaster Edward R. Murrow condemned the rise in entertainment television as “the real opiate of the people” in a 1957 interview with Time. A few years later, in 1961, Newton Minnow delivered his first address as FCC chair by describing TV as a “vast wasteland… a procession of game shows, formula comedies about totally unbelievable families, blood and thunder, mayhem, violence, sadism, murder, Western bad men, Western good men, private eyes, gangsters, more violence, and cartoons.” This guy would have hated TikTok.

The bad things that Minnow pointed out were especially bad, because children could tune in and see them whenever they found themselves staring at a screen. The FCC would eventually police the kinds of content that could be broadcast during certain hours. Obscene content was illegal on TV, but starting in 1978, some profane or indecent material was allowed between 10 pm and 6 am, when kids were presumably asleep. (You can thank George Carlin for that.) That amounted to an early form of age verification, which, as the Instagram announcement makes clear, continues to be a problem on the internet. It also seems unsolvable.

Protecting kids nevertheless seems to be the only bipartisan motivation to regulate today's super TV. Whether it's social media's controversial contribution to the youth mental health crisis, or the “unacceptable risks” AI chatbots pose to children and teenagers, lawmakers have plenty of reasons to impose new regulations on the platforms that have become the 21st century equivalents of broadcasters. Senatos Richard Blumenthal and Marsha Blackburn, co-sponsors of the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), recently started campaigning to push the bill through the Senate (again) before the end of the year.

Things are changing fast, though. When you factor in new AI-powered feeds, like OpenAI's Sora and Meta's Vibes, it's clear that digital media — or super TV, if you prefer — has its own vast wasteland problem.

Prohibiting certain kinds of content is hard when there's not a single government agency policing the airwaves, or these days, the tubes that keep us online. So the preferred path to regulation seems to be to create three internets: one for kids under 13, one for teens, and one for adults. A PG, PG-13, and R internet, if you will.

Doing this successfully requires checking IDs, and the current state of age verification is a mess. In the past three years, 25 states have passed laws requiring websites with adult content, namely porn, to verify a user's age. This is the R-rated internet. Several of these states also require age verification for social media platforms. Because the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA) places limitations on websites allowing users younger than 13, this is the PG-13 internet. Presumably, the PG versions of websites would include some of these protections, including the ability to turn off addictive algorithms, as New York recently proposed.

Age verification online is really hard, by the way. For the most part, to confirm someone's age, you need to confirm their identity. Free speech advocates warn that strict age requirements will prevent anonymous adults from accessing content that's protected by the First Amendment. Civil liberties groups say that age verification presents a huge security risk, which seems like a reasonable worry after the recent hack of an age verification company exposed the data of 70,000 Discord users. High-tech age verification methods, like using AI to estimate a user's age based on their activity or facial recognition to guess age based on how old they look, aren't yet proven. And more than anything, kids can figure out how to get around age verification systems, whether by lying about their birthday or using virtual private networks (VPNs).

Looking back to television's golden era, when game shows and bad words were the big dangers, you can see how much the stakes have changed. Digital media is powered by math so sophisticated, even the people who wrote the code don't know how it works. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok are interactive and deliberately addictive. Use of these products has been linked to depression, anxiety, and self-harm.

If the three-internets strategy works, it would represent an improvement for parents who want their kids to have an age-appropriate experience online. There would probably even be positive knock-on effects, like better privacy protections, which are a hallmark of existing laws that protect kids online. Heck, it could even be handy for those of us who would simply like to avoid accidentally seeing a murder on their phone.

Creating feeds that are safer for kids, movie rating style or otherwise, is a step towards making feeds safer for everyone. Or, at least, it's evidence that Instagram and its competitors are capable of doing so.

Even a veteran Silicon Valley investor can't make the numbers behind venture capital add up.

Sequoia Capital partner and former PayPal exec, Roelof Botha, appeared on two podcasts over the past week to share a contrarian take on the VC industry — one shaped by more than two decades of investing.

""I think there's a huge problem with the venture industry. There's too much money,"" Botha said on a recent episode of the ""All-In"" podcast. ""In my opinion, investing in venture is a return-free risk.""

Botha said that venture capital firms invest over $150 billion in companies each year. Yet, even under what he called ""reasonable assumptions for return,"" the math still doesn't seem right to him.

He pointed to Figma, which had one of the hottest IPOs of the year, debuting at a near $20 billion valuation. ""You'd need 40 Figmas a year for the industry to make the returns work,"" he said.

He reiterated his point this week on the ""Uncapped with Jack Altman"" podcast. ""I don't think venture is an asset class,"" he said. ""It doesn't support the numbers.""

He said that, over the last 20 to 30 years, there have only been an average of 20 companies a year that have ended up making exits of $1 billion or more.

Investors — and startup founders — may be too often pursuing quantity over quality, he said.

""There's a lot more talent than really interesting ideas, or interesting companies to build,"" he said. ""I think we're spreading a lot of that talent thin right now.""

Venture capital has had a mostly rough year so far, driven by uncertainty in the economy and markets. Exciting IPOs are few and far between compared to the salad days of 2021.

Figma was one bright spot, as was a handful of major deals, mostly related to AI, that gave some investors a shot at beating the odds. 

In March, Google announced that it was buying security startup Wiz for $32 billion in cash, for instance. OpenAI raised another $40 billion round. Anthropic had two funding rounds for a total of $4.5 billion.

Sequoia Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

In this article

A woman who says she was abused by the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein sued Bank of America and the Bank of New York Mellon Wednesday, alleging the banks knowingly provided financial services that enabled his sex trafficking operation for years.

""We don't think the suit has any merit, and we're going to contest it vigorously,"" BNY CEO Robin Vince said Thursday, in a CNBC interview on ""Squawk on the Street.""

Bank of America declined to comment.

The woman, referred to in court papers as Jane Doe, is seeking an unspecified amount of damages from both banks.

She is represented by law firms Boies Schiller and Edwards Henderson, who previously secured settlements of $75 million and $290 million with Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan, respectively, over their alleged financial ties to Epstein.

Neither Deutsche nor JPMorgan admitted wrongdoing in agreeing to settle.

Epstein died by suicide in 2019 in jail while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The circumstances of his death, as well as his social relationships with wealthy and powerful individuals, fueled theories that others were involved in his crimes.

His case has become a political headache for President Donald Trump's administration. After pledging during the 2024 campaign to release files from the Justice Department's investigation into Epstein, the administration reversed course this year, prompting an outcry from Trump's conservative base and members of Congress.

The House Oversight Committee is now investigating the Epstein case.

In both lawsuits, Jane Doe said she met Epstein in 2011 while she was living in Russia. She said she became financially dependent on Epstein, who raped her, forcibly touched her, and forced her to engage in sex acts with other women at least 100 times between 2011 and 2019.

""As Congress works toward unraveling how Jeffrey Epstein was able to orchestrate his criminal sex trafficking enterprise for decades without detection, we are taking another important step forward toward justice for survivors,"" Sigrid McCawley, a lawyer for Jane Doe, said in a statement.

Jane Doe said she opened a Bank of America account in 2013 at the direction of Richard Kahn, Epstein's former accountant, and that Kahn regularly sent her money for rent through the account.

Lawyers for Kahn did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Doe said in 2015, Kahn's assistant told her that Epstein was adding her to the payroll for a ""sham company"" and that she would receive funds through her Bank of America account. She said she did not know the purpose of those payments.

Her lawyers wrote that those transactions should have raised red flags for Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank. Epstein had pleaded guilty to state-level prostitution charges in Florida in 2008 as part of an arrangement that allowed him to avoid federal prosecution.

The lawsuit against BNY said the bank gave a line of credit to MC2, a modeling agency that the lawsuit said Epstein and French model scout Jean-Luc Brunel used to traffic victims. In total, BNY processed $378 million in payments to women trafficked by Epstein, the lawsuit said.

Brunel was arrested in December 2020 and was found dead in jail in 2022, according to Parisian prosecutors.

Both lawsuits said the banks should have filed Suspicious Activity Reports with the U.S. Treasury Department. The lawsuits said such reports could have helped law enforcement stop Epstein sooner.

SHANGHAI — Chinese tech giant Alibaba is already recouping its investment on artificial intelligence in the company's e-commerce business, vice president Kaifu Zhang told reporters on Thursday.

The Chinese tech giant has bet big that AI will generate returns despite market concerns that companies are spending too much on the technology with little to show for it. Alibaba last month announced it will increase its spending on AI and cloud infrastructure, after pledging in February it would spend 380 billion yuan ($53 billion) over the next three years on the tech.

Zhang oversees e-commerce AI applications at Alibaba. Earlier in the day, he shared how the company has rolled out a range of AI tools, from making search results more personalized to improving the accuracy of virtual clothing try-ons.

The presentation comes a day after Alibaba began presales for Singles Day, China's biggest shopping event of the year that's akin to Black Friday.

Zhang said preliminary testing has showed consistent results from AI, including a 12% increase in returns on advertising spend.

""It's very rare to see double-digit changes"" in such tests, he said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. Zhang predicted that thanks to AI integration, there would be a ""very significant"" positive impact on Alibaba's gross merchandise volume during this year's Singles Day shopping period, which centers on Nov. 11.

Alibaba's China e-commerce unit remains the tech giant's largest source of revenue, with growth of 10% year-on-year in the quarter ended June 30 to the equivalent of $19.53 billion.

Despite lackluster Chinese consumer spending in the last few years, during the Singles Day period last year, research firm Syntun estimated 20.1% year-on-year growth in sales to 1.11 trillion yuan for Alibaba's Tmall, JD.com and PDD.

The company on a late August earnings call cast AI and consumption as ""two major historic opportunities"" that require Alibaba to make investments of ""historic scale.""

""Our first priority at this point is making these investments,"" CFO Toby Xu said at the time. ""So for now, we may place relatively less emphasis on profit margins. But that does not mean that we don't care about margins.""

Gold extended its rally to a fresh record high on Thursday, as investors turned to the safe-haven asset due to U.S.-China trade tensions and the U.S. government shutdown, with prospects of interest rate cuts further boosting demand.

Spot gold was up 1.5% at $4,271.49 per ounce, climbing for a fifth consecutive session. U.S. gold futures for December delivery were up 2% at $4,288.50.

Gold, traditionally seen as a store of value during times of instability, has risen 61% year-to-date.

Investors' focus this week has been on the trade spat between the world's biggest economies, with U.S. officials on Wednesday criticising China's major expansion of rare earth export controls as a threat to global supply chains.

""Renewed trade frictions (are) adding to uncertainty across global supply chains... investors are increasingly turning to gold,"" said Nitesh Shah, commodities strategist at WisdomTree, adding that gold's breakout also reflects investor unease over U.S. policy credibility.

There is a strong likelihood the metal remains above the $4,200 level, Shah added.

Gold's rally has been driven by a cocktail of factors, including expectations of interest rate cuts, ongoing political and economic uncertainty, solid central bank buying, inflows into gold exchange-traded funds and a weak dollar.

Meanwhile, the two-week-old federal government shutdown may cost the U.S. economy as much as $15 billion a week in lost production, a Treasury official said on Wednesday.

On the monetary policy front, traders are pricing in a 25 basis-point cut in October with another in December, seen as 98% and 95% chances respectively.

Non-yielding gold typically performs well in a low-interest-rate environment.

""To get to $5,000 in 2026, the market would likely need to see physical demand hold steady but a further upswing in financial demand for gold allocations,"" said Aakash Doshi, head of gold metals strategy, State Street Investment Management.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has had a rocky first half of October so far.

The world's largest cryptocurrency surged to start the month as investors sought a hedge against US government shutdown uncertainty. Last Friday, it plunged from $121,000 as low as $104,000 following President Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese goods.

Bitcoin's descent was particularly notable against the backdrop of gold (GC=F), which has climbed to new all-time highs past $4,200 and is up 16% in the past month. Bitcoin, by comparison, has yet to recover from Friday's losses and is down 8% in that period.

""Right now, capital is clearly favoring gold due to its momentum and reduced volatility profile,"" Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, told Yahoo Finance. ""There are also structural buyers in central banks, which provides a quasi-backstop to the trade.""

He noted that investors are likely to eventually rotate into bitcoin from gold since the precious metal tends to front-run crypto.

On Thursday, bitcoin was trading around $108,000 per token. Wall Street veteran strategist Ed Yardeni explained its precipitous drop last week in a note on Wednesday.

""The crypto derivatives ecosystem exacerbated bitcoin's recent fall,"" Yardeni wrote. ""During the abrupt drop, liquidity dried up, with over $19 billion in liquidations across crypto futures and leveraged positions.""

When prices dropped rapidly, platforms automatically closed risky trades to prevent bigger losses, he said.

Traders also noticed a ""whale"" who pocketed $192 million shorting bitcoin ahead of the sudden crash, a move that could have exacerbated the selling. That same wallet placed another bearish bet late Sunday. 

Crypto bulls entered October with expectations of a strong month, as the token has risen in 10 of the past 12 years, according to Compass Point Research.

The cryptocurrency hit all-time highs north of $126,000 per token last week, along with precious metals that also hit records, in what Wall Street has dubbed the ""debasement trade,"" or a hedge against weakening fiat currencies.

Crypto analysts predict bitcoin will close out the year higher, with JPMorgan forecasting a price target of $165,000. Meanwhile, Citi sees the token reaching $133,000 during the same time period and $181,000 by the end of 2026.

The biggest crypto liquidation of all time wiped out $19 billion worth of positions last week, sending BTC tumbling below $106,000 for a time before it rebounded back above $110,000. Now changing hands at $1o8,673, predictors on Myriad are asked where it's headed next—$120,000 or $100,000. 

Inspired by a bet between crypto personalities Mando and KeyboardMonkey, the market has see-sawed back and forth in the last 24 hours, briefly flipping in each direction as predictors are largely split and uncertain about Bitcoin's immediate future. 

In Thursday trading, predictors have flipped from bullish to bearish, at one point giving $120,000 around a 55% chance of hitting. But as Bitcoin dropped further, odds flipped to favor the $100K side which now is favored at 54%. 

A recent Glassnode report indicates that a deeper contraction is at risk if BTC stays on the lower end of the $108,000-$117,000 range. The top crypto asset is hanging there for now as trade war uncertainty lingers.

Bitcoin's Dip Below $110,000 Sparks $524M in Crypto Liquidations

Bitcoin will need to rise around 10.5% higher to hit $120,000—a move that would pay bullish predictors on Myriad closer to 53% for their positions. On the other hand, a further correction of around 8% will pay out about 46% based on current probabilities. 

What's Next? President Trump is scheduled to speak at 3:00pm ET today, potentially impacting crypto and broader markets.

Solana has been underperforming its major crypto peers, dropping more than 13% in the last week and changing hands at $190.50 on Thursday afternoon. 

Despite some calls for an “epic end of year,” SOL is dipping further away from a new all-time high—and Myriad predictors are feeling less confident as well. 

Odds of a new SOL all-time high before the end of the year have dropped more than 16% in the last week, as it now stands 35% off its January top of $293. 

That represents a significant detraction from this time last month, when odds in favor climbed as high as 68%. 

The sixth-largest crypto asset has been unable to escape the pulldown of the broader crypto market, but has also had its nearest term catalyst—approval of Solana ETFs—frozen as a result of the government shutdown. 

Options on Solana and XRP Futures Begin Trading on CME

With DAT accumulations slowing and no ETF inflows in sight (just yet), predictors put the odds of a new all-time high at just 34% at the time of writing. 

What's Next? The government shutdown is likely playing a role in delaying expected Solana ETF approvals.

Gold bugs are rejoicing as the asset continues to move higher, pushing north of $4,300 as it charges towards the $5,000 mark. That move has provided Myriad predictors with a new market which sets gold alongside ETH in the race to $5,000, asking which asset will hit the milestone first.

Trading around $4,307, gold has a significant headstart on ETH, but predictors on Myriad actually prefer ETH's chances at reaching $5,000 first—placing odds around 53% in favor of ETH as of Thursday morning.

As it stands now, ETH will need around a 25.5% move higher to hit $5,000. Meanwhile, gold only needs around a 16% boost to resolve the market.

But market participants are not dismayed, even as individuals are lining up around the block to buy gold while net ETH ETF flows are negative on the week.

Gold Futures Break $4,200 as Crypto Outflows Hit Record Levels

In the early morning hours Thursday, gold was a slight favorite on Myriad, but only reached as high as 52%. Since that time, odds have swung back around 8.5% to favor ETH.

Analysts told Decrypt this week that the “debasement trade,” or the move to hard assets to hedge against fiat currency inflations, may have another decade ahead of it.

As it gains speed, will gold be able to maintain its edge against Ethereum?

What's Next? ETH has fallen further from $5,000 while gold moves up another 2% in early Thursday trading.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Bitmine chair Tom Lee says the ‘bubble has burst' in digital asset treasury companies","https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/10/16/bitmine-chair-tom-lee-digital-asset-treasuries/","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

Leo Schwartz is a senior writer at Fortune covering fintech, crypto, venture capital, and financial regulation.

Digital asset treasuries have become one of the most prominent features of the current crypto bull market. So-called DATs are businesses that acquire a hoard of a given cryptocurrency, from Bitcoin to Dogecoin, and seek to operate a publicly-traded vehicle that provides sell exposure to those assets in the form of shares. But with the number of projects ballooning, critics have warned that digital asset treasuries, or DATs, could be the latest crash in the rollercoaster sector. In the latest episode of Fortune's Crypto Playbook (which you can find on Spotify, Apple, and YouTube), Tom Lee, the longtime analyst and chairman of the leading DAT BitMine, said that the bubble might already have burst. 

Lee first learned about Bitcoin while serving as the chief strategist at JPMorgan in 2012, starting his own research company Fundstrat a few years later and building a reputation as an outspoken Bitcoin bull when much of Wall Street was still skeptical. In June, he became a crypto executive himself, joining a little-known publicly traded Bitcoin mining company called BitMine as it sought to rebrand itself into the largest institutional holder of Ethereum. 





The software CEO Michael Saylor pioneered the approach with his company MicroStrategy, which began accumulating large stockpiles of Bitcoin in 2020, quickly becoming a way for investors to get access to the volatile cryptocurrency through a publicly traded vehicle, long before the approval of exchange-traded funds. The idea for BitMine was to do the same but for Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency. 





Though Ethereum has at times struggled in recent years amid the proliferation of other blockchains and its own technical challenges, Lee argued that it is still the “blockchain of Wall Street,” especially as financial firms explore the implementation of stablecoins and different tokenized assets, many of them native to Ethereum. 





BitMine, whose market capitalization sits above $15 billion, holds over three million Ethereum tokens, or around 2.5% of the total supply, though Lee's goal is to acquire 5%. While investors have more options to buy top cryptocurrencies than when Saylor began accumulating Bitcoin for MicroStrategy, Lee argues that BitMine still offers advantages, from reaping staking rewards to being included on major stock indexes. “We're essentially a liaison between how Wall Street views future upgrades to Ethereum,” Lee said. 




That doesn't mean that digital asset treasury companies as a broader asset class will prove successful, especially as more launch to hold different types of cryptocurrencies, including so-called “alt” coins such as Sam Altman's Worldcoin. Lee pointed out that many DATs are trading below their net asset value, or the worth of their underlying crypto holdings, as an increasing number launch into the public market. “If that's not already a bubble burst,” Lee asked, “How would that bubble burst?”

In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, the stability of Bitcoin is the linchpin for investor sentiment. Miraculously, Bitcoin has clung to a pivotal support threshold around $110,000, bravely weathering turbulent trading conditions. This crucial level serves not only as a defensive bulwark for Bitcoin itself but also as a psychological benchmark that reverberates throughout the entire crypto ecosystem. With a palpable sense of optimism blossoming, traders are now placing their bets on a variety of altcoins—Solana, Ethereum, and promising newcomers like MAGACOIN FINANCE. As institutional interest intensifies, an array of tantalizing investment opportunities is poised to emerge for those who dare to venture into this volatile yet alluring landscape.

Bitcoin's steadfastness above $110,000 has ignited a renewed sense of confidence among market players. The recent upheaval—spurred by macroeconomic pressures—has been accompanied by a notable surge in institutional interest, largely fueled by ETF-linked inflows. Striking data illustrates a remarkable inflow of $340 million into Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, a drastic reversal from earlier outflow patterns. This resurgence not only highlights escalating investor trust but also signals a potential consolidation phase that could usher in substantial growth. Analysts are projecting a bullish outlook, with expectations that Bitcoin might soon flirt with the exciting territory of $120,000, assuming the current momentum persists.

Ethereum is stepping boldly into the limelight, bolstered by noteworthy institutional backing. The latest reports of ETF inflows reaching an impressive $1.3 billion weekly underscore its formidable position in the market. After dipping to $3,800, Ethereum now represents an enticing buying opportunity for long-term speculators. On-chain metrics reveal that over 40% of Ethereum is currently staked, a reflection of its scarcity that fosters price stability. Should Ethereum successfully breach the resistance mark around $4,250, analysts foresee a potential surge toward $4,700, further solidifying its status within institutional investment portfolios.

As Bitcoin maintains its resilience, Solana is basking in renewed interest, currently oscillating between $226 and $229. This upward movement is underscored by a wave of institutional investments and the anticipation surrounding possible ETF approvals. Technical analyses indicate Solana has regained its bullish trajectory, positioning it as one of the leading altcoins worth acquiring for those chasing significant future gains. With established support levels ranging from $218 to $212, market watchers are eyeing price targets that could soar to between $245 and $250, potentially establishing Solana as a formidable player in the crypto arena.

Among the emerging stars in the presale spectrum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing significant attention. With over $16 million raised and a robust community backing, this project promises investor security through thorough audits conducted by HashEx and CertiK. Its carefully structured presale model emphasizes sustainability, appealing to a wide array of investors and positioning MAGACOIN as one of the top emerging tokens for 2025. Analysts are pointing to its fixed supply and transparent developmental roadmap as key ingredients that could yield remarkable returns, with projections suggesting potential gains of up to 50x in the medium term.

Currently, the Fear and Greed Index from CoinMarketCap indicates a sentiment of fear at 35—a landscape often ripe for major recoveries. Both Bitcoin and Solana are solidifying their support zones, presenting savvy investors with excellent entry points. Historically, significant downturns can serve as launchpads for powerful upward movements, particularly during phases marked by altcoin surges. Observers are keen to discern these patterns, recognizing the potential for selected altcoins to emerge triumphant amid the chaos.

In summary, Bitcoin's firm positioning at its critical support levels paves the way for excitement among altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE. With a surge of institutional capital seeking fresh avenues for investment, the cryptocurrency terrain appears poised for exploration. Whether one aims to engage with established giants or pivot towards promising newcomers, these dynamic market conditions advocate for a strategic accumulation approach as we transition into Q4. Keeping a watchful eye on these shifting trends will be crucial for any investor committed to navigating the intricate tides of the crypto market. As the landscape continues to evolve, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a beacon of community support, grounded fundamentals, and clear utility—marking it as a serious contender among the most promising altcoins to consider for 2025.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Privacy 2.0: Encrypted Computing's Blockchain Revolution","https://cointelegraph.com/news/encrypted-computing-blockchain-revolution","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

 What's the real tension in blockchain, total transparency or total privacy, and how do we unlock both? 

One of the core tenets of blockchain protocols has been the provision of privacy for users, even if the chains are publicly verifiable and relatively transparent.

This is becoming increasingly important as personal privacy rights seem to be eroding, evidenced by the European Union's recent push for a chat control law that would allow mass scanning of private communications and encrypted messages.

The latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast delves into the importance of privacy-preserving protocols in conversation with Yannik Schrade, co-founder and CEO of Arcium.

Schrade unpacks the privacy revolution: encrypted computing, zero-knowledge proofs and multiparty magic that lets blockchains handle sensitive data like medical records and finance without leaks or trusted middlemen.

Schrade says the industry is gradually moving toward an era he calls “Privacy 2.0,” where blockchains are powered by an encrypted shared state.

“That means everybody can encrypt their data, be it transaction data, be it medical records, anything. We can compute over all of this encrypted data collectively. We can build encrypted order books for people to trade privately. We can build private lending markets to have privacy when using all of those DeFi applications,” Schrade said.

The Arcium CEO said the possibility of encrypted shared states would not be just a major unlock for the cryptocurrency ecosystem, but for society as a whole. 

Schrade added that the Web2 internet that we know and use has been held back by single trusted entities. Cryptography and multiparty computation now allow people and AI to process and gain outputs from data without compromising or accessing the data itself.

Schrade gave a working example of how encrypted computing could unlock sensitive healthcare and medical data without compromising patient privacy.

He pointed to medical records at hospitals, or data collected by a Whoop band, which tracks vital signs and other sensitive biometric information. 

“Around the world, that data currently sits in data silos. It cannot be shared and shouldn't be shared, right? That data is highly sensitive. There's highly sensitive government data. There is highly sensitive financial data,” Schrade said.

Encrypted computing can connect to this data and gain shared insights without compromising the data.

Major government supplier Capita has been hit with a £14m fine over a 2023 cyberattack in which the personal information of 6.6 million people was stolen.

The penalty was imposed by the Information Commissioner's Office despite the company's submissions arguing that it should treated in the same way as its public-sector customers – organisations which the regulator tends to avoid penalising financially. Capita also made representations for its fine to be reduced on account of its “very small margins” and claimed that it “held to an alternative standard” compared with similar cases – an assertion which the commissioner did not accept.

The incident in question was sparked by the unintentional download of a malicious file onto a Capita employee's device in March 2023. Within 10 minutes of this, a “high-priority security alert” was raised – but “Capita did not quarantine the device for 58 hours, during which the attacker was able to exploit its systems”, according to the ICO. The firm's target response time for taking this kind of mitigating action is one hour.

During the more than two-day period in which the machine remained connected to the wider network, almost one terabyte of data was stolen, including personal details contained in pension files and staff records. Some 6.6 million people across 325 organisations were impacted. Subsequently, attackers implemented ransomware and “reset all user passwords, preventing Capita staff from accessing their systems and network”, the regulator said.

About half of the outsourcer's roster of customers for which it manages pension schemes – which includes many public bodies, encompassing central government, local authorities, NHS organisations and police services – were affected by the breach.

Given the firm's role in supporting these public-services providers, its representations during the ICO's considerations suggested that the watchdog should apply its public-sector approach – a model which has been in place since 2022 and in which the regulator typically avoids finding public bodies, instead issuing more formal public reprimands urging improvements in data-protection practices.

“Although Capita states that the profit margin from Capita's public sector work is modest, Capita is nevertheless a commercial business which exists to make a profit,” the ICO said in its full penalty notice, which also noted that company is a large business “with a variety of clients including those in the private sector”.

“It is clear that the commissioner's public-sector approach is not intended to be applied to organisations such as Capita… and therefore will not be applied to the proposed penalties,” the notice added.

58 hoursLength of time it took Capita to quarantine an infected device, against a target response time of one hour

In arguing for a significant reduction in the ICO's planned penalty – which was originally slated at £45m – Capita also told the regulator that it is “a very small-margins business”, and suggested that “appears to have been held to an alternative standard to other similar businesses that have suffered comparable or serious cyber incidents”.

The watchdog's notice responded: “Each incident that is reported to the commissioner, whether cyber or otherwise, is considered on its own facts. The commissioner is entitled to exercise his discretion as to which matters to investigate and when to take enforcement action. Each case will have different circumstances, and therefore different factors to take into consideration in relation to potential infringements and, if necessary, consideration for a penalty… In respect of the investigation into Capita, the commissioner considers there to be sufficient evidence to justify the infringement findings… and that, in all the circumstances the penalties against Capita… are proportionate, effective and dissuasive.”

While the initially proposed fine has been reduced by more than two thirds, an eight-figure punishment has still been imposed on the company – including an £8m penalty levied on the parent company Capita Plc and a £6m fine for specialist subsidiary Capita Pension Solutions Limited. Despite the arguments it made during the ICO's considerations, Capita has agreed to this total penalty as a “voluntary settlement”, the watchdog indicated.

“Capita failed in its duty to protect the data entrusted to it by millions of people,” said information commissioner John Edwards. “The scale of this breach and its impact could have been prevented had sufficient security measures been in place. When a company of Capita's size falls short, the consequences can be significant. Not only for those whose data is compromised – many of whom have told us of the anxiety and stress they have suffered – but for wider trust amongst the public and for our future prosperity. As our fine shows, no organisation is too big to ignore its responsibilities.”

He added: “Maintaining good cybersecurity is fundamental to economic growth and security. With so many cyberattacks in the headlines, our message is clear: every organisation, no matter how large, must take proactive steps to keep people's data secure. Cybercriminals don't wait, so businesses can't afford to wait either – taking action today could prevent the worst from happening tomorrow.”

Testing timesThe ICO's investigation identified a number ways in which, prior to the attack, Capita had not taken sufficient steps to protect the customer data it holds and processes.

This includes a “failure to prevent privilege escalation and unauthorised lateral movement… [which] allowed the attacker to escalate privileges, move laterally across multiple domains and compromise critical systems”.

“Capita failed in its duty to protect the data entrusted to it by millions of people. The scale of this breach and its impact could have been prevented had sufficient security measures been in place.”

Information commissioner John Edwards

“These failings were flagged as a vulnerability on at least three separate occasions but were not remedied,” the ICO added.

The firm also showed “failure to respond appropriately to security alerts” and ran a security operations centre that “was understaffed, and in at least six months before the incident, fell well below the target response times for responding to security alerts”.

Another major issue was “inadequate penetration testing and risk assessment”. Even when tests have been conducted “findings… were siloed within business units [and] risks identified that affected the wider Capita network were not universally addressed”.

In an update posted on its website and issued on the London Stock Exchange, where it is listed, Capita expressed its regret over the incident and said that “following a detailed forensic investigation, all those identified as potentially impacted were contacted after the attack”.

The firm's chief executive Adolfo Hernandez added: “As an organisation delivering essential public services as well as key services for private sector clients, Capita was among the first in the recent wave of highly significant cyberattacks on large UK companies. When I joined as CEO the year after the attack I accelerated our cyber security transformation, with new digital and technology leadership and significant investment. As a result, we have hugely strengthened our cybersecurity posture, built in advanced protections and embedded a culture of continuous vigilance. Following an extended period of dialogue with the ICO over the last two years, we are pleased to have concluded this matter and reach today's settlement. The Capita team continues to focus tirelessly on our group transformation journey for the benefit of our customers, our people and wider society.”

In a significant development for the intersection of technology and finance, Erebor, the ambitious banking startup founded by Oculus VR creator Palmer Luckey, has secured preliminary regulatory approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). This milestone paves the way for Erebor to operate as a full-service national bank, focusing on serving high-growth sectors like cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence, and defense technology. Backed by prominent Silicon Valley figures including Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Joe Lonsdale, the bank aims to fill a void left by the collapse of institutions like Silicon Valley Bank, offering tailored services to startups often overlooked by traditional lenders.

The approval, announced on Wednesday, is conditional, requiring Erebor to meet additional capital, operational, and compliance benchmarks before full operations can commence. Insiders familiar with the process note that this step reflects a thawing in regulatory attitudes toward crypto-integrated banking, especially amid evolving federal policies. According to reports from Business Insider, Luckey's vision for Erebor emphasizes robust risk management and innovation, positioning it as a bridge between volatile tech ventures and stable financial infrastructure.

Navigating Regulatory Hurdles in a Post-SVB Era

Erebor's journey to this point has been marked by strategic maneuvering. Founded in the wake of the 2023 banking turmoil, the startup has assembled a team of veterans from banking, law, and tech, including executives with ties to Luckey's Anduril Industries and Palantir Technologies. Fundraising efforts highlighted Luckey's political connections, as detailed in a memo covered by Business Insider, which touted access to regulators like Jonathan Gould, a former OCC official. This network appears to have facilitated the approval process, underscoring how personal ties can influence fintech regulatory outcomes.

Critics, however, question whether such connections could lead to undue favoritism, especially given Luckey's vocal support for former President Donald Trump and his involvement in defense contracting. Proponents argue that Erebor's focus on “the most regulated entity for stablecoin transactions,” as stated in its proposals, aligns with OCC priorities for financial stability. Bloomberg reported in its coverage at Bloomberg that the bank's model targets emerging tech firms, potentially injecting fresh capital into AI and blockchain projects.

The Broader Implications for Crypto and Tech Banking

Looking ahead, Erebor's approval could signal a broader shift in Washington's stance on crypto-linked institutions. As noted in a Yahoo Finance article at Yahoo Finance, this move comes amid softening federal policies, with backers like Thiel advocating for innovation-friendly regulations. The bank plans to offer services such as stablecoin facilitation, high-yield deposits for tech startups, and specialized lending for defense and manufacturing—sectors Luckey knows well from his Anduril work.

For industry insiders, Erebor represents a test case for hybrid banking models. Cryptopolitan highlighted in its report at Cryptopolitan that the bank's backing by Palantir and Anduril adds credibility, potentially attracting depositors wary of crypto's volatility. Yet, challenges remain: meeting OCC's stringent conditions will require substantial capital raises, estimated in the hundreds of millions, and navigating ongoing scrutiny from agencies like the FDIC.

Potential Challenges and Future Outlook

One key hurdle is competition from established players like JPMorgan Chase, which have ramped up crypto services, and fintech upstarts such as Revolut. Erebor's digital-first approach, devoid of physical branches, could lower costs but heighten cybersecurity risks—a concern amplified by recent high-profile hacks in the sector. Posts on X, formerly Twitter, from users like Mario Nawfal reflect public excitement, with discussions framing Erebor as a “new era for crypto banking,” though such sentiment often overlooks regulatory pitfalls.

Ultimately, if Erebor succeeds, it could redefine banking for tech innovators, blending Silicon Valley's disruptive ethos with Washington's oversight. As Luckey himself has implied in interviews, this venture is about more than profits—it's about enabling the next wave of American technological dominance. With preliminary approval in hand, the real work begins: proving that a crypto-focused bank can thrive under intense regulatory gaze while delivering value to underserved entrepreneurs.

The OCC's approval letter makes Erebor the first new charter since Gould took over in June 2025 [21]. In announcing the decision, Gould stressed that innovative banks need not be blocked: “Permissible digital asset activities… have a place in the federal banking system if conducted in a safe and sound manner,” he said [22]. This is a notable change of tone from prior OCC leadership. As Benzinga reports, the OCC applied its usual rigorous standards but ultimately concluded Erebor's plan was sound, making it “the first de novo bank to receive preliminary approval under Gould's tenure” [23].

Despite the approval, the OCC letter makes clear the bank cannot open for business immediately. All pre-opening conditions must be met: obtaining FDIC insurance, finalizing a board with qualified executives, establishing cybersecurity and compliance systems, and maintaining high capital buffers [24] [25]. The charter mandate specifically requires a roughly 12% Tier‑1 leverage ratio in the first three years [26] [27]. Only after these steps will the OCC give final sign-off.

Erebor's origins combine tech and venture capital expertise. It was co-founded in early 2025 by Palmer Luckey (best known as Oculus VR creator and Anduril co-founder) and Joe Lonsdale (8VC founder and Palantir co-founder) [28]. Early investors include Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, Haun Ventures (crypto VC), and other tech backers [29]. The bank is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, and will be run (initially) by co-CEOs Owen Rapaport and Jacob Hirshman [30].

Erebor intends to serve what it calls the U.S. “innovation economy” [31]. Its target clients include fast-growing technology and artificial intelligence firms, defense contractors, advanced manufacturers, crypto projects, payment processors, venture funds, and trading firms [32] [33]. The aim is to replace the role once held by Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which collapsed in March 2023 and left many startups and crypto firms scrambling [34] [35]. In fact, one analysis notes Erebor was conceived to fill exactly that void [36].

Erebor's mission is to marry Silicon Valley agility with Wall Street discipline. A source close to the bank told the Financial Times that the goal is to build “a stable, low-risk, reliable bank doing normal banking things without screwing everyone over with undue risk” [37]. In practical terms, Erebor will be a full-service national bank – offering deposits, loans, payment services, etc. – but with dedicated crypto features baked in. Founders emphasize they have a conservative business plan. “Getting approval so fast is a reflection of its extremely conservative business plan,” the insider said [38]. In short, Erebor vows to be a by-the-book bank that happens to serve crypto and tech clients, rather than a high-flying crypto startup.

(As background context, this approach mirrors broader tech trends. For example, TS2.tech reports that major banks are now integrating AI at the highest levels: in June 2025 UK's NatWest named a Chief AI Officer to “build differentiating AI capabilities” across the bank [39]. In that way, Erebor is riding the wave of tech-enabled banking – it will explicitly focus on clients in AI, crypto, and defense – sectors at the cutting edge of finance and technology.)

Erebor's charter spells out special crypto provisions. Its application made clear stablecoin and crypto transactions will be central to the business. The bank told regulators that USD stablecoins (like Circle's USDC and Tether's USDT) will form “a significant portion” of its operations [40]. It even plans to hold crypto assets – but only small amounts – on its balance sheet to pay blockchain “gas” fees when customers transact. CoinCentral notes the SEC filings expect around $1 million in crypto on hand for operational use [41], not for speculation.

This fits a self-described aim to be “the most regulated entity conducting and facilitating stablecoin transactions,” bringing these modern payment tools fully under banking rules. Erebor's charter application states the bank's goal is to bring stablecoin intermediation “fully within the regulatory perimeter” [42]. In practical terms, it means offering customers things like stablecoin custody, transaction settlement, and issuance, but under federal oversight. (This comes at a time when the White House, Congress and regulators have all been wrestling with crypto laws – for example, President Trump's recent GENIUS Act set rules for stablecoins. Many crypto firms like Coinbase and Circle are now applying for federal bank or trust charters [43]. Erebor's approval is part of this larger “crypto meets banking” shift.)

Analysts say Erebor's approval reflects a clear policy shift. The OCC under Gould appears more open to digital assets than its predecessor. CoinDesk notes Gould called the move “proof that the OCC under my leadership does not impose blanket barriers to banks that want to engage in digital asset activities” [44]. Gould's statement – echoed in the Benzinga report – signals regulators are finally willing to let federally chartered banks handle crypto (albeit safely) [45] [46].

Banking experts see this as a milestone. Brian Graham of Klaros Group told Banking Dive that approving Erebor on a ~4-month timeline (roughly the OCC's standard target) sends an important message. “It suggests that this OCC under this Comptroller is serious about hitting those deadlines, even for relatively novel and complex applications like Erebor,” he said [47]. “That should be a very promising signal for the large number of other potential applicants for a bank charter,” Graham added [48]. In other words, fintech startups waiting for federal charters may feel encouraged.

Not everyone is thrilled. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) expressed worries that the Trump-appointed regulators were rushing to benefit Trump allies. In a statement, Warren warned that this “tech-focused and crypto-friendly bank will cater to the financial whims of Silicon Valley billionaires,” noting both Luckey and Thiel as Trump allies. She said “in a free market, credit flows fairly… not to the President's cronies because of their political connections,” and cautioned that approving this “risky venture” could lead to “another bailout funded by American taxpayers” [49]. Other critics (including some community banks and credit unions) have protested bank charters for crypto firms, citing regulatory and safety concerns. Even blockchain advocates like Custodia Bank's Caitlin Long say trust charters and bank charters might collide and could eventually require court review.

Nonetheless, the prevailing view in crypto circles is optimistic. Industry leaders on social media call it a “watershed moment” proving that Washington will allow “responsible crypto banking,” provided safety rules are met [50]. They note that Erebor's conservative model, and its Fed oversight, makes it a potential blueprint. If Erebor successfully opens, it could become the “US bank for digital currencies and AI startups” – a designated safe haven for the innovators left out by SVB and others.

In the short term, markets barely swung on the news. Stock and crypto prices were mixed but calm. On Oct. 15, the S&P 500 ended about 0.4% higher and the Nasdaq 100 about 0.7% higher [51], reflecting a broadly positive day for tech. The Dow Jones was flat. In crypto, Bitcoin was roughly 1% lower around $111K [52]. Ether traded near $3,900 (+1.5%) [53]. Notably, Palantir (Lonsdale's longtime startup) was about $179.56 on the Nasdaq, essentially unchanged [54]. Market commentary suggests traders saw the approval as already anticipated by the sector, rather than an immediate catalyst.

Looking ahead, analysts are eyeing how this development might change the investment landscape. Some technical analysts note that Bitcoin's price could rebound if it holds support near $68,000, while a break above $70,000 or Ether over $3,500 might trigger fresh upside – moves that easier banking for crypto could eventually justify [55]. In equity markets, the long-term hope is that banks and fintechs serving crypto will benefit. For example, Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN), Square/Block, or crypto-friendly fintech IPOs might see renewed interest as regulatory barriers fall.

Morgan Stanley analysts (for example) have in recent weeks forecasted more capital inflows to crypto and blockchain stocks on such positive regulation news (though no specific price targets were given). Meanwhile, traditional bank stocks are watching closely: few expect immediate big effects on megabanks, but regional and fintech shares could rally if Erebor's model succeeds without losses. At minimum, the approval adds credibility to crypto, which some say could underpin higher valuations for related tech firms.

In summary, experts caution that Erebor's impact will unfold slowly. It must prove it can execute its model under tight supervision. If it does, however, this charter could be the opening act in a broader trend – potentially lifting both crypto assets and tech stocks tied to the digital economy. As one analyst put it: Erebor's launch “bridges Silicon Valley with the regulated banking system,” a development whose full market implications will become clearer in 2026.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","The Statues of Easter Island ‘Walked' Into Place, Scientists Say","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a68994399/easter-island-walking-statues/","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 13:30:00 GMT","

Archaeologists who analyzed the physics of the statues and their transport found that they were sculpted and transported in a way that resembles a walking motion.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Among the palm fronds and hibiscus flowers of Rapa Nui, or Easter Island, the moai—massive statues of volcanic rock usually carved in the images of chieftains or other revered ancestral figures—watch vigilantly over the island's flora and fauna from raised stone platforms known as ahu. The mystery behind them is similar to the one that once shrouded the pyramids of Egypt: How did they get there? Well, the answer seems surprisingly simple. They walked. 

Anthropologists Carl Lipo and Terry Hunt believe that they have finally confirmed how these megaliths made it out of the Rano Raraku quarry from which they arose. Even though each statue weighed several tons, their distinctly wide, D-shaped bases and forward lean were design marvels that allowed the indigenous Rapa Nui people to ‘walk' them in a zigzagging motion, creating roads in the process. This is not the first time that this ‘walking' method of transport has been suggested—not even by Lipo and Hunt themselves—but this study attempts to push back against some critics of the idea and provide significant evidence for its validity.

Upon reaching their destination, they were further carved to stand on their platforms and given eyes of white shell or coral with obsidian pupils to awaken life from within and give them arinja ora—a living face (the word moai itself means “so that he can exist”). These were then known as ahu moai, and only one ahu moai has survived with eyes intact for the approximately one thousand years moai have existed. Many also wear what look like hats, but are actually meant to resemble topknots of hair that bestowed the mental power of mana on them. 

Some of the nearly 1,000 moai on this Oceanic island off the coast of Chile never made it to their final post of honor. They languish in the grasses, some on their sides, some appearing as if they have been forever trying to stand but could never right themselves. Like their living stone brethren, fallen “road moai” began their journey from the quarry, but suffered falls that meant they could never take their final form. Legend has it that the shapeshifter Nuahine Pīkea 'Uri toppled some of them out of anger, but it is more likely that there were irregularities in some of the stone carvings that caused breaks in transit, and most attempts to stand the heavy moai back up were unsuccessful. These road moai gave Lipo and Hunt the chance to investigate the physics behind the walk to their platforms. 

In comparison to ahu moai, road moai have much wider bases. This allowed for more steady transport by lowering the center of mass, stabilizing the moai enough that it was capable of rocking from side to side while staying upright, as two teams of people (one to the left and one to the right) pulled it back and forth with cord tied around its neck. Hunt and Lipo both modeled this digitally and built their own scaled replica that was 14 feet (4.5 meters) wide and weighed in at about 9,950 pounds (4.35 metric tons). The forward lean of the statue also contributed to the walking motion that made transporting it so efficient. With a team of 18 people, they were able to successfully walk the statue 328 feet (100 meters) in only 40 minutes.

This disproves previous theories that the moai were dragged on their backs, especially because they would be more prone to breaking at the neck (the weakest point). There was also not enough hardwood on the island to provide enough logs for rolling a statue of that size across the island. Even a traditional Rapa Nui song tells of an ancestor who could make the moai walk. Far from supernatural, the rhythm, beat and tempo of the song are thought to coordinate with the task of moving the statue from side to side and down the road it created as it walked. 

“When the evidence is systematically evaluated, the success of moai transport reveals a sophisticated understanding of physics and engineering among the ancient Rapa Nui islanders,” Lipo and Hunt said in a study recently published in the Journal of Archaeological Science. “Statue transport employed elegant mechanical principles, achieved through careful observation and innovative problem-solving—a testament to Polynesian ingenuity that ‘walked' into history.”

On July 1, astronomers detected a strange, fast-moving object racing toward the Sun. Named 3I/ATLAS, this unusual traveler immediately stood out for one remarkable reason: its orbital path revealed that it had come from beyond our Solar System.

This marked only the third time in history that scientists have identified an interstellar visitor entering our cosmic neighborhood. And this one was particularly puzzling.

3I/ATLAS sets new records

Measurements show that 3I/ATLAS is moving at an incredible 245,000 kilometers per hour, making it the fastest known object ever observed within the Solar System.

It also appears to be enormous. Early estimates indicate that the body could span up to 20 kilometers in diameter, and researchers believe it may even predate the formation of the Sun itself.

Could it be alien?

Typically, when astronomers encounter a new object in space, they assume it is composed of rock, ice, or a combination of the two. However, 3I/ATLAS exhibits such strange characteristics that some scientists have begun to wonder whether it might be something more unusual.

Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb and his team recently posted a paper titled ""Is the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Alien Technology?"" on the arXiv preprint server. (The paper has not yet been peer reviewed.)

Loeb, a well-known and sometimes divisive figure in the scientific community, previously argued that the first observed interstellar object, 1I/ʻOumuamua, discovered in 2017, could have been an extraterrestrial spacecraft.

Among several features he considers potentially artificial, Loeb points out that 3I/ATLAS follows an orbit that takes it unusually close to Venus, Mars, and Jupiter -- an alignment he finds intriguing.

We've sent out our own alien probes

The idea of alien probes wandering the cosmos may sound strange, but humans sent out a few ourselves in the 1970s. Both Voyager 1 and 2 have officially left our Solar System, and Pioneer 10 and 11 are not far behind.

So it's not a stretch to think that alien civilizations -- if they exist -- would have launched their own galactic explorers.

However, this brings us to a crucial question: short of little green men popping out to say hello, how would we actually know if 3I/ATLAS, or any other interstellar object, was an alien probe?

Detecting alien probes 101

The first step to determining whether something is a natural object or an alien probe is of course to spot it.

Most things we see in our Solar System don't emit light of their own. Instead, we only see them by the light they reflect from the Sun.

Larger objects generally reflect more sunlight, so they are easier for us to see. So what we see tends to be larger comets and asteroid, especially farther from Earth.

It can be very difficult to spot smaller objects. At present, we can track objects down to a size of ten or 20 metres out as far from the Sun as Jupiter.

Our own Voyager probes are about ten meters in size (if we include their radio antennas). If an alien probe was similar, we probably wouldn't spot it until it was somewhere in the asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars.

If we did spot something suspicious, to figure out if it really were a probe or not we would look for a few telltales.

First off, because a natural origin is most likely, we would look for evidence that no aliens were involved. One clue in this direction might be if the object were emitting a ""tail"" of gas in the way that comets do.

However, we might also want to look for hints of alien origin. One very strong piece of evidence would be any kind of radio waves coming from the probe as a form of communication. This is assuming the probe was still in working order, and not completely defunct.

We might also look for signs of electrostatic discharge caused by sunlight hitting the probe.

Another dead giveaway would be signs of maneuvering or propulsion. An active probe might try to correct its course or reposition its antennas to send and receive signals to and from its origin.

And a genuine smoking gun would be an approach to Earth in a stable orbit. Not to brag, but Earth is genuinely the most interesting place in the Solar System -- we have water, a healthy atmosphere, a strong magnetic field and life. A probe with any decision-making capacity would likely want to investigate and collect data about our interesting little planet.

We may never know

Without clear signs one way or the other, however, it may be impossible to know if some interstellar objects are natural or alien-made.

Objects like 3I/ATLAS remind us that space is vast, strange, and full of surprises. Most of them have natural explanations. But the strangest objects are worth a second look.

For now, 3I/ATLAS is likely just an unusually fast, old and icy visitor from a distant system. But it also serves as a test case: a chance to refine the way we search, observe and ask questions about the universe.

Biological aging clocks across organ systems and tissues have advanced understanding of human aging and disease. In this study, we expand this framework to develop seven magnetic resonance imaging-based multi-organ biological age gaps (MRIBAGs), including the brain, heart, liver, adipose tissue, spleen, kidney and pancreas. Using data from 313,645 individuals curated by the MULTI Consortium, we link the seven MRIBAGs to 2,923 plasma proteins, 327 metabolites and 6,477,810 common genetic variants. Genome-wide associations identify 53 MRIBAG−locus pairs (P < 5 × 10−8). Genetic correlation and Mendelian randomization analyses support organ-specific and cross-organ interconnection, including 24 non-MRI biological aging clocks and 525 disease endpoints. Through functional gene mapping and Bayesian co-localization multi-omics evidence, we prioritize nine druggable genes as targets for future anti-aging treatments. Furthermore, the seven MRIBAGs are linked to future risk of systemic disease endpoints (for example, diabetes mellitus) and all-cause mortality. Finally, participants with more youthful versus more aged brain profiles exhibited distinct cognitive decline trajectories over 240 weeks of treatment with the Alzheimer's disease drug solanezumab, although this heterogeneity cannot be fully attributed to the drug. In summary, we developed seven MRIBAGs that enhance the existing multi-organ biological aging framework, and we demonstrate their clinical potential to advance aging research.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI1) provides a non-invasive window into structural and functional changes occurring with age, enabling the development of personalized disease biomarkers. Brain MRI-based aging clocks, often referred to as ‘brain age' and derived from artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) applied to MRI data, have been widely used as clinical biomarkers of neurological aging, cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease risk2. However, although brain imaging has been extensively used for aging research, no studies have systematically extended this concept to other organ systems. With the advent of large-scale, multi-organ MRI datasets, such as those from the UK Biobank (UKBB), we now have an unprecedented opportunity to conduct a more holistic, system-wide investigation of biological aging across multiple organs.

Beyond imaging-based aging clocks, researchers have also developed various omics-based aging clocks to capture different biological dimensions of aging. For example, plasma proteomics-based aging clocks3,4 have been introduced to enhance the granularity and coverage of multi-organ aging clocks. Plasma proteomics-based aging clocks capture the biological aging process by analyzing the abundance of proteins in circulation. Because proteins are the functional units of the cell, these clocks provide insights into the downstream effects of genetic regulation and environmental influences on aging. Metabolomics-based aging clocks5,6 capture biological aging by profiling small-molecule metabolites that represent the biochemical activity of cellular and systemic metabolism. Metabolomics examines the end products of metabolic pathways, making it highly dynamic and sensitive to external factors such as diet, microbiome composition, lifestyle and environmental exposures. Finally, epigenetics-based aging clocks7 focus on the analysis of DNA methylation patterns, particularly at specific CpG sites across the genome, to estimate biological age. Integrating these aging clocks into the multi-organ and multi-omics concept8,9,10 is essential for gaining a comprehensive understanding of aging biology, age-related diseases and longevity.

In our previous efforts, we developed nine phenome-based biological age gaps (BAGs)11,12 (PhenoBAGs), 11 proteome-based BAGs (ProtBAGs13) and five metabolome-based BAGs (MetBAGs5). In the present study, we derived six additional MRIBAGs, on top of the brain MRIBAG14, for the heart, liver, spleen, adipose, kidney and pancreas using data consolidated from the MULTI Consortium (Method 1). We first benchmarked the age prediction performance of the six additional MRIBAGs (Method 2). Next, we associated the seven MRIBAGs with 2,923 plasma proteins for proteome-wide associations (ProWASs) and 327 metabolites for metabolome-wide associations (MetWASs) (Method 3). Through genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and post-GWAS analyses, we depicted their genetic architecture and identified potential druggable genes (Method 4). Finally, we assessed the clinical applicability and predictability of the MRIBAGs and their polygenic risk scores (PRSs) (Method 5). All results and pre-trained AI/ML models are publicly available at the MEDICINE portal: https://labs-laboratory.com/medicine/.

The brain MRIBAG was initially developed in our previous study14 using 119 gray matter volumes, and we re-trained the brain MRIBAG here using a consistent nested cross-validation procedure along with a within-distribution, holdout test dataset (Extended Data Fig. 1). Specifically, to rigorously evaluate the performance (that is, overfitting and generalizability) of biological age prediction models, we partitioned the healthy control (CN, without any pathologies) participants into the CN training/validation/test (3,573 < N < 6,327 as the sample sizes vary across organs) and the within-distribution, holdout test (N = 500) datasets (Method 2 and Supplementary Table 1).

When fitting the organ-specific MRI features (Fig. 1a, Method 2 and Supplementary File 1), the two AI/ML models (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and support vector regressor) exhibited slight variability in performance, with no single model consistently outperforming the others (Fig. 1b). The selected optimal models for the seven MRIBAGs demonstrated moderate Pearson's r coefficients (ranging from 0.23 to 0.77) and the mean absolute errors (MAEs) of approximately 5 years in the within-distribution, holdout test dataset (Fig. 1c) before applying the age bias correction15,16. Supplementary Table 2 presents detailed statistics for the age prediction tasks before the age bias correction (Supplementary Fig. 1). Supplementary Fig. 2 presents the incremental statistical power, beyond age and sex, of the seven MRIBAGs in predicting mortality and disease categories. Model improvements may be possible for abdominal features by employing more advanced modeling approaches, such as deep neural networks that directly process voxel-wise MRI data17. Additionally, we found that high collinearity among imaging features from abdominal MRI led to poor generalizability in within-distribution, holdout test datasets (Supplementary Fig. 3). Supplementary Fig. 4 shows potential domain shift while applying the pre-trained model of the brain MRIBAGs to external datasets, exemplified by the A4 study18,19. Supplementary Fig. 5 presents a sensitivity analysis for the Alzheimerʼs disease drug differential responses. Supplementary Fig. 6 discusses sex differences in the seven MRIBAGs. Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8 discuss the feature importance of deriving these MRIBAGs and their biological interpretation. For all subsequent analyses, we used the age bias-corrected16 MRIBAGs.

a, The seven MRIBAGs are derived from various imaging modalities available in the UKBB. The number (N) of IDPs used to derive the seven MRIBAGs is displayed. b, For the seven MRIBAGs, the MAE of age prediction models using LASSO regression and linear support vector regressor (SVR) is shown for both the training dataset (cross-validated training/validation/test; 3,582 < N < 6,325) and the within-distribution, holdout test dataset (N = 500). Cohen's d quantifies the effect size of the difference between these datasets, reflecting potential model generalizability, assuming similar age and sex distributions. The optimal model (#) for each organ and tissue was selected based on the lower Cohen's d value, and these models were used for all subsequent analyses. All MAEs are reported without age bias correction. c, Scatter plots display the optimal model for each organ/tissue in the within-distribution, holdout test dataset, with Pearson's r and two-sided P values indicating the association between chronological age and predicted age. All results are shown before the correction for age bias was applied16. To evaluate the generalizability of the brain MRIBAG model, we validated it using two independent studies. In b, individual data points are overlaid on box plots summarizing the distribution. The center line indicates the median; the box bounds represent the first and third quartiles; and the whiskers extend to the most extreme values within 1.5 times the interquartile range. Ind., independent.

In our ProWAS analyses (Method 3), we identified 603 protein−MRIBAG significant associations (P < 0.05/2,923/7). Among these, the kidney MRIBAG exhibited the highest number of significant protein associations (N = 301; for example, NPDC1, IGFBP6 and TAFA5), followed by the spleen MRIBAG for 136 associations (for example, VCAM1, PTPRH and C1QA), the liver MRIBAG for 62 associations (for example, NCAN, SEZ6L and LEP), the adipose MRIBAG for 57 signals (for example, GDF15, CHI3L1 and CA14), the pancreas MRIBAG for 21 associations (for example, PLA2G1B, CTRC and CELA2A), the brain MRIBAG for 16 associations (for example, BCAN, NCAN and GDF15) and the heart MRIBAG for only REN (Fig. 2a).

The two proteins are organ enriched in respective organ and tissue, as identified by the Human Protein Atlas (HPA; https://www.proteinatlas.org/), emphasizing their relevance to organ-specific aging processes, which has been widely used to define organ-enriched proteins in previous proteome-based aging clock papers4,13. Supplementary File 2a presents detailed statistics. Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary File 2b explore the potential replication of UKBB Olink ProWAS signals in Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) SomaScan data. Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3 present individual volcano plots and protein set enrichment results via the STRING platform (version 12.0 (ref. 20)) for each MRIBAG (Supplementary Figs. 10−14). Supplementary Fig. 15 presents the sex-specific ProWAS results.

In our MetWAS (Method 3), we identified 758 metabolite−MRIBAG significant associations (P < 0.05/327/7) between the seven MRIBAGs and metabolites, showing relatively weak associations (Pearson's r < 0.3). The spleen MRIBAG showed the highest number of significant metabolite associations (N = 199; for example, acetate, acetoacetate and albumin), followed by the adipose MRIBAG (N = 196; for example, L_HDL_PL_pct, L_HDL_C_pct and PUFA_pct), the heart MRIBAG (N = 139; for example, PUFA_pct, M_HDL_TG and HDL_TG), the brain MRIBAG (N = 97; for example, LA_pct, Omega_6_pct and ApoA1), the pancreas MRIBAG (N = 57; for example, GlycA, Glucose_Lactate and HDL_PL_pct), the liver MRIBAG (N = 51; for example, Gly, Tyr and L_LDL_PL_pct) and the kidney MRIBAG (N = 19; for example, creatinine, citrate and DHA) (Fig. 2b). Descriptions of these metabolites are provided in Supplementary Table 3.

Creatinine was linked to the kidney (β = 21.77 ± 0.65; P = 1.58 × 10−258; r = 0.28) and adipose (β = −4.37 ± 0.83; P = 1.48×10 −7; r = −0.18) MRIBAGs, which may suggest distinct roles of the kidney and adipose tissue in creatinine regulation. In addition to these small-molecule metabolites, other lipid complexes and subclasses also showed significant associations. Total concentration of phospholipids (Total_P) was negatively associated with liver (β = 51.57 ± 3.59; P= 2.52 × 10−46; r = 0.18). Phospholipids in small HDL (S_HDL_PL) were linked to the brain, heart, spleen and adipose MRIBAGs. Similarly, cholesteryl esters in very large HDL (XL_HDL_CE) associated with the adipose and heart MRIBAGs. Supplementary File 3 presents detailed statistics. Extended Data Fig. 4 presents individual volcano plots for each MRIBAG. Metabolite set enrichment analysis is presented in Extended Data Fig. 5. Supplementary Fig. 16 shows the genetic correlations among the seven MRIBAGs, 2,923 proteins and 327 metabolites. Extended Data Fig. 6 presents example associations for the ProWAS and MetWAS. Supplementary Fig. 17 presents the sex-specific MetWAS results.

We conducted GWAS (Method 4) for the seven MRIBAGs (19,686 < N < 31,557 participants with European ancestries) and identified 53 (P < 5 × 10−8) genomic locus−BAG pairs. We denoted the genomic loci using their top lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) defined by FUMA, considering linkage disequilibrium; the genomic loci are presented in Supplementary Table 4. We visually present the shared genomic loci annotated by cytogenetic regions based on the GRCh37 cytoband (Fig. 3a). Supplementary Fig. 18 and Extended Data Fig. 7 detail the robustness of our GWASs and sex-specific GWAS analyses.

a, Cytogenetic regions associated with the seven MRIBAGs, with significant genomic loci identified using the genome-wide significance threshold (two-sided P < 5 × 10−8). b, SNP-based heritability estimates of the seven MRIBAGs (sample size: 18,778 < N < 31,557). c, Partitioned heritability enrichment analysis using chromatin-specific multi-tissue chromatin data, multi-tissue gene expression profiles and cell-type-specific datasets. Only significant results (two-sided P < 0.05/697) are displayed (sample size: 18,778 < N < 31,557). d, Genetic correlation estimates via LDSC between the seven MRIBAGs and eight PhenoBAGs (excluding the multimodal brain PhenoBAG11), 11 ProtBAGs13 and five MetBAGs5 (two-sided P < 0.05/11) as well as 525 disease endpoints from FinnGen and PGC (P < 0.05/525). e, Potential causal relationships between the seven MRIBAGs (that is, number of instrumental variables > 7) and 525 disease endpoints were examined through two networks: BAG2DE, where the seven MRIBAGs serve as exposure variables and the 525 DEs as outcome variables, with two-sided P < 0.05/525, and DE2BAG, where the 214 disease endpoints serve as effective exposure variables (that is, number of instrumental variables > 7), with two-sided P < 0.05/214. Although multiple sensitivity checks were performed to evaluate potential violations of underlying assumptions, these findings should be interpreted with caution. The direction array represents the causal relationship from the exposure to the outcome variables, where ‘+' denotes an odds ratio > 1 and ‘–' indicates an odds ratio < 1. f, The bar plot shows the incremental R2 (that is, the R2 of the alternative model minus that of the null model) for the PRS of each MRIBAG. The PRS was calculated using the split2 target GWAS data, with split1 GWAS data serving as the training set for the PRScs model. Bar plots represent the mean (center of bar), with error bars indicating ±1 s.e.

We estimated the SNP-based heritability (\({h}_{{SNP}}^{2}\)) for the seven MRIBAGs using GCTA21 software (Method 4), with values ranging from 0.29 to 0.47 (Fig. 3b). Supplementary Table 5 presents detailed statistics. We validated the GWAS signals through partitioned heritability analyses (Method 4) using LDSC software, revealing strong organ-specific enrichment. Notably, the heart MRIBAG exhibited chromatin state-specific enrichment across four distinct heart tissues (Fig. 3c). For example, significant heritability enrichment was shown in the right atrium in the H3K4me3 region (P = 1.00 × 10−6) and in the left ventricle in the H3K27ac region (P = 2.00 × 10−5) for the heart MRIBAG (Supplementary File 4).

We then assessed the genetic correlations (Method 4) between the seven MRIBAGs and 24 previously developed multi-organ, multi-omics aging clocks, including eight PhenoBAGs11 (excluding the brain PhenoBAG based on multimodal imaging), 11 ProtBAGs13 and five MetBAGs5. After Bonferroni correction, we found seven within-organ and inter-organ significant genetic correlations (P < 0.05/11), exemplified between the kidney MRIBAG and the renal PhenoBAG (gc = 0.23 ± 0.05; P < 2.00 × 10−5) and between the spleen MRIBAG and the hepatic MetBAG (gc = 0.23 ± 0.08; P < 7.00 × 10−4). We also performed genetic correlation between the seven MRIBAGs and 525 disease endpoints and found six significant signals (P < 0.05/525). For example, within-organ connections were demonstrated between the heart MRIBAG and two forms of hypertension, which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (for example, FinnGen code: I9_HYPTENS: gc = 0.28 ± 0.06; P < 1.00 × 10−5); cross-organ interactions were also identified between the adipose MRIBAG and substance abuse (gc = 0.27 ± 0.06; P < 5.00 × 10−5) (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Fig. 19 and Supplementary File 5).

We conducted bidirectional Mendelian randomization analyses (Method 4) between the seven MRIBAGs and 525 disease endpoints, ensuring at least seven valid linkage disequilibrium-considered SNPs as instrumental variables after quality control. Although the MRIBAGs were generally underpowered to meet this threshold, we identified six potential causal relationships. The within-organ interactions between the heart MRIBAG and hypertension were reaffirmed by a potential causal relationship from various forms of hypertension to the heart MRIBAG (for example, I9_HYPTENS: P = 2.12 × 10−7; odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 1.13 (1.08−1.18); number of instrumental variables = 110). Additionally, we identified a potential causal relationship from Alzheimer's disease to the liver MRIBAG (G6_AD_WIDE: P = 3.02 × 10−5; odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 0.91 (0.88−0.96); number of instrumental variables = 8), consistent with our previous findings linking Alzheimer's disease to the hepatic PhenoBAG11. Finally, we found that the kidney MRIBAG was negatively linked to two forms of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) (for example, T2D: P = 8.40 × 10−5; odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 0.78 (0.70−0.88); number of instrumental variables = 9) (Fig. 3e). Supplementary File 6 and Supplementary Figs. 20−25 present detailed statistics for our causal analyses and sensitivity check analyses.

Using split-sample GWAS analyses, we also developed PRSs for the seven MRIBAGs, with the first split serving as the training/source dataset and the second split serving as the test/target dataset (Method 4). Overall, these PRSs exhibit limited predictive power. In the second split population, the brain PRS exhibited the highest incremental R2 (2.18%; P < 1.00 ×10−10), whereas the spleen PRS accounted for an additional 0.70% (P < 1.00 × 10−10) of the variance in the spleen MRIBAG (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Table 6).

We conducted multiple post-GWAS analyses (Method 4) to identify potential druggable genes associated with the seven MRIBAGs. Our overarching hypothesis posits that these imaging-derived aging clocks, as AI-driven endophenotypes22 (see Supplementary Fig. 26 for a conceptual visualization), reside along the causal pathway of human aging and disease, linking genetic predisposition to multi-omics data, such as gene expression, proteomics and metabolomics, leading to disease outcomes and cognitive decline.

Initially, we mapped independent GWAS signals to genes using three approaches—(1) positional mapping, (2) expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping and (3) chromatin interaction mapping—identifying a total of 1,164 unique genes. To further refine these genes, we prioritized genes that demonstrated genetic evidence from both eQTL mapping and chromatin interactions, resulting in a final set of 246 unique genes linked to the seven MRIBAGs. For instance, MAPT was prioritized in the brain MRIBAG through both eQTL and chromatin interaction mapping and was previously identified as a genetically supported druggable gene23. Subsequently, to further extend genetic evidence to other omics data types, we conducted Bayesian co-localization analysis on genomic loci associated with the seven MRIBAGs and aging clocks derived from plasma proteomics13 (ProtBAGs) and metabolomics (MetBAGs5). The key hypothesis is that a causal variant positionally or functionally linked to a gene influencing both MRIBAGs and other omics-based aging clocks is more likely to play a causal role in human aging and disease. Our co-localization analysis identified a total of 40 MRIBAG−MetBAG or MRIBAG−ProtBAG co-localization signals (PP.H4.ABF > 0.8) (Fig. 4a). By integrating these findings with the 246 prioritized genes, we identified 62 MRIBAG–gene pairs (comprising 62 unique genes) that share at least one causal SNP with either MetBAGs or ProtBAGs (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary File 7).

a, To prioritize potential druggable genes, leveraging aging clocks derived from plasma proteomics (ProtBAGs) and metabolomics (MetBAGs), we filtered and mapped genes to retain only those showing significant co-localization with any ProtBAG or MetBAG. As an example, we highlighted a specific genomic locus demonstrating co-localization among the spleen MRIBAG, the immune MetBAG and the pulmonary ProtBAG. The shared causal variant (rs233721 on chromosome 12) exhibited a strong co-localization signal, with a posterior probability (PP.H4.ABF) of 0.99 between the spleen MRIBAG and the immune MetBAG, implying a single shared causal variant influencing both traits within this locus. To determine the significance of the H4 hypothesis, we set a threshold of PP.H4.ABF > 0.8. This variant was mapped to the TRAFD1 and ALDH2 genes through both eQTL mapping (for example, ALDH2 in the aorta from GTEx) and chromatin interaction mapping (for example, TRAFD1 in the left ventricle and liver). b, By integrating this multi-level genetic evidence, we identified 62 unique genes associated with the liver, spleen and pancreas MRIBAGs. LD, linkage disequilibrium.

Among the 62 genes with multi-level genetic evidence supporting their potential causal role in human aging and disease, we further explored existing drug−gene interaction data to identify potential drug repurposing opportunities and evidence. To achieve this, we queried the Drug Gene Interaction database (DGIdb) (https://dgidb.org/; query date: 21 March 2025) and identified nine genes (linked to the liver, spleen and pancreas MRIBAGs) with known interactions involving 122 unique drugs (Fig. 5a and Supplementary File 8). Among the 122 unique drugs, many indications are manifested, including immunosuppressant agents (for example, everolimus; DrugBank ID: DB01590), antipsychotic agents (for example, loxapine for the management of the manifestations of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia; DrugBank ID: DB00408), antidiabetic agents (for example, bromocriptine for treating T2D; DrugBank ID: DB01200) and antiparkinson agents (lisuride for the management of Parkinson's disease; DrugBank ID: DB00589), as well as many antineoplastic agents.

a, We queried the 62 prioritized MRIBAG genes in the DGIdb platform (https://dgidb.org/) to identify drug−gene interactions and potential drug repurposing opportunities. We show only the nine MRIBAG genes linked to existing drugs, whether approved or unapproved, using curated data via the DGIdb. For visualization, we annotated representative drug names; the complete results can be found at an online interactive webpage at https://labs-laboratory.com/medicine/mribag_gdi.html. b, Drug indications for existing drug−gene interactions related to the spleen MRIBAG-linked ALDH2 gene. c, The three-dimensional structure of the ALDH2 protein predicted by the AlphaFold model.

We highlighted the spleen MRIBAG-linked gene ALDH2 as exemplified in our co-localization analyses (Fig. 4a). Multi-level genetic evidence links the spleen BAG, ALDH2 and 15 drugs (loxapine, clozapine, rotigotine, sulpiride, prochlorperazine, terguride, sertindole, fenoldopam, pergolide, trifluoperazine, naltrexone, cabergoline, apomorphine, lisuride and bromocriptine) with multiple clinical indications. These indications include antipsychotic (for example, clozapine for treating severe forms of psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and for preventing suicide in patients who have this condition); antiparkinson (for example, rotigotine); antidepressive (for example, sulpiride, used to treat acute and chronic schizophrenia and major depressive disorder but potentially toxic with a high dose, with side effects for depression); antimigraine (for example, prochlorperazine, used to treat psychotic symptoms such as schizophrenia and non-psychotic anxiety but has off-label uses, including emergency use to treat migraine in adults and children); antihypertensive (for example, fenoldopam, a medication used to temporarily treat high blood pressure); antiemetics (for example, trifluoperazine, a medication used as an antipsychotic and an antiemetic); appetite suppressant; treatment of erectile dysfunction; antidiabetic; treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension; treatment of substance abuse; analgesic; and treatment of sexual dysfunction in women (Fig. 5b). The 15 drugs linked to ALDH2 encompass a broad range of therapeutic areas, many of which are relevant to aging-related diseases such as neurodegeneration, metabolic disorders and immune system aging. As a central immune organ, the spleen's aging may indicate immune dysfunction that contributes to neuroinflammation. ALDH2 could influence both immune cell activity in the spleen and neuroinflammation in the brain, especially concerning drugs for neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Drugs targeting ALDH2 (or related pathways) for neurodegenerative diseases may also affect systemic aging, positioning them as potential candidates for modulating spleen or immune aging as well (Supplementary Fig. 27).

We highlight the clinical potential of the seven MRIBAGs and their PRSs in predicting (1) the incidence of 53 individual disease conditions (with at least 50 patients) using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes; (2) all-cause mortality risk through survival analyses; and (3) differentiation in cognitive decline trajectories in Alzheimer's disease drug solanezumab (Method 5).

We found that the brain, adipose and pancreas MRIBAGs and the pancreas PRS could significantly (P< 0.05/7) predict non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (E119; 1.44 < hazard ratio < 1.70). The brain MRIBAG also predicted personal history of psychoactive substance abuse (Z864; hazard ratio = 1.27 (1.11−1.46); P = 6.70 × 10−4), anxiety disorders (F419; hazard ratio = 1.60 (1.20−2.11); P = 1.31 × 10−3) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (K922; hazard ratio = 1.46 (1.11−1.91); P = 6.63 × 10−3). The heart MRIBAG was associated with an increased risk of hypertension (I10; hazard ratio = 1.16 (1.05−1.28); P = 4.80 × 10−3), reinforcing findings from genetic correlation and Mendelian randomization analyses (Fig. 6a and Supplementary File 9).

a, The seven MRIBAGs and their PRSs show significant associations with the incidence of single disease entities (for example, I10 for hypertension). We only included disease entities with more than 50 cases (two-sided P < 0.05/7 = 0.0071 corrected for the number of organ systems), and non-cases are participants who do not show any disease diagnosis (disease free) after enrolling in the UKBB, so that all non-case populations remained the same reference population across all tasks. Age and sex were included as covariates in the Cox proportional hazard model. An asterisk (*) denotes results that remain significant after applying the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (two-sided P < 0.05/53 = 0.00094, accounting for the number of disease endpoints), whereas a hash symbol (#) indicates significance under a more stringent threshold (two-sided P < 0.05/53/7 = 0.00013). b, The brain, adipose, spleen and liver MRIBAGs showed significant associations with all-cause mortality risk. To further validate the negative associations of the spleen and liver MRIBAGs with mortality, we conducted a disease-free analysis, including only participants without any prior disease diagnoses, to rule out potential confounders. c, At week 240, PACC scores differed between the accelerated and decelerated aging groups—stratified by brain MRIBAG expression—among participants originally assigned to the drug group in the solanezumab trial. d, At week 240, PACC scores differed between the accelerated and decelerated aging groups among participants originally assigned to the placebo group in the solanezumab trial. e, At week 240 of the solanezumab trial, PACC scores in the accelerated aging group showed no difference between participants receiving the drug and those receiving a placebo. f, At week 240 of the solanezumab trial, PACC scores in the decelerated aging group showed no difference between participants receiving the drug and those receiving a placebo. Supplementary File 9 provides all statistical details, including sample size, P values, hazard ratios (HRs) and confidence intervals (CIs). In c–f, the shaded regions represent the 95% CI for the estimated PACC score. For a and b, each dot or shape represents the estimated HR for a given disease or mortality. The line extending from the dots or shapes shows the 95% CI for each HR. For c–f, all P values are two-sided, and the corresponding t values are reported for signals with P < 0.05.

We further found that several MRIBAGs significantly (P < 0.05/7) predicted all-cause mortality (Fig. 6b). Among these, the brain and adipose MRIBAGs were identified as risk biomarkers (hazard ratio > 1) for all-cause mortality, whereas the liver and spleen MRIBAGs (hazard ratio < 1) appeared to have a protective effect. We conducted additional sensitivity analyses by excluding participants with any disease diagnoses to assess disease-free survival. Despite the reduced sample size, the protective effect remained evident. For instance, the spleen MRIBAG retained nominal significance under this approach (P = 0.04; hazard ratio = 0.62 (0.40−0.99)). Supplementary Table 8a,b and Supplementary Figs. 28 and 29 present a detailed discussion on additional sensitivity check results.

Finally, we assessed the use of the brain MRIBAG for stratifying clinical trial participants into subgroups to (1) demonstrate differential cognitive decline trajectories across subgroups and (2) provide insights for future clinical trial design, using data from the A4 trial. As shown in Fig. 6c,d, participants exhibiting decelerated aging signatures (that is, youthful brain: MRIBAG below the median) showed a higher Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC) score than participants within the accelerated aging group (that is, aged brain), both in the drug group (P = 0.003 and t = 2.923) and the placebo group (P = 0.001 and t = 4.049). A permutation test showed that the cognitive differences between accelerated and decelerated agers, quantified by t values, were significantly more pronounced in the placebo group compared to the drug group (one-sided P = 0.03 based on 1,000 permutations). A one-sided P value was used, as our hypothesis was directional; we specifically aimed to test whether the placebo group exhibited stronger cognitive separation between aging subgroups, consistent with the observed pattern in cognitive trajectories (Fig. 6c,d). Furthermore, neither the decelerated nor the accelerated aging group exhibited significant drug effects (Fig. 6e,f) in preventing cognitive decline.

This study introduces seven MRI-based aging clocks by leveraging large-scale multi-organ and multi-omics data from 313,645 participants curated by the MULTI Consortium. Collectively, this work expands existing biological aging clocks and highlights their clinical potential for future research.

Overall, the age prediction models highlight limitations in relying on abdominal MRI features, including a limited number of informative features and substantial multicollinearity, which reduced model performance and hindered generalizability to unseen data. Compared to the brain imaging community24, the development of imaging protocols and standardized imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) for other organs may be relatively underdeveloped. This disparity is reflected in large-scale biobanks such as the UKBB, where the majority of well-characterized IDPs are derived from brain MRI (N > 4,000) and heart MRI, whereas imaging-derived features, returned and made available to the community, for other organs are limited in both number and diversity. Several factors contribute to this imbalance, including the historical focus of neuroimaging research, the availability of standardized brain imaging pipelines25 and the widespread adoption of advanced computational tools tailored for brain MRI analysis. Imaging data from other organs should also be incorporated into this framework. For instance, integrating retina imaging26 with brain MRI, genetic data and systemic biomarkers could reveal mechanisms underlying aging and disease.

The ProWAS results highlight both organ-specific aging mechanisms and systemic inter-organ communication, providing a foundation for understanding multi-tissue aging dynamics. Such organ specificity of the brain MRIBAG was also reinforced by two previous studies that used plasma proteomics data to develop brain tissue-enriched aging clocks (that is, the brain ProtBAG) using both SomaScan and Olink platforms. Oh et al.4 identified the three brain tissue-enriched proteins based on Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data to construct the brain ProtBAG, whereas Wen et al.13 leveraged the HPA platform, which integrates more extensive curation at both RNA and protein levels, to define brain tissue-specific proteins. Other proteins include CHI3L1, a well-established neuroinflammatory marker elevated in Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis27, and GDF15, a stress-induced cytokine linked to cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease and aging28,29. The significant metabolites identified in the MetWAS analysis further reinforce both cross-organ and within-organ associations. Although certain proteins or metabolites, such as GDF15 and FABP4, serve as systemic aging markers, others, such as NCAN and IGFBP6, exhibit tissue-specific roles. Shared underlying biological pathways may include inflammation30, extracellular matrix dysregulation31 and metabolic dysfunction32.

The results of our genetic analyses reveal that, although the MRIBAGs share certain genetic underpinnings, each organ also demonstrates a distinct genetic architecture shaped by its unique biological processes. Genetic correlations between the MRIBAGs and other multi-omics aging clocks, as well as the MRIBAGs' associations with various disease endpoints, strengthen the notion of both shared and organ-specific genetic influences. For example, the correlation between the kidney MRIBAG and the renal PhenoBAG highlights how kidney-specific genetic factors can interact with broader multi-organ aging mechanisms at multiple omics levels33. Notably, although our analyses show that these organs share common genetic influences that link them to broader disease pathways, they also exhibit unique, organ-specific contributions that reflect their individual physiological roles and functions. Together, these findings provide strong support for the hypothesis that the MRIBAGs share genetic influences across organs while also demonstrating distinct genetic signatures that contribute to the specificity of each organ's role in aging and disease. Supplementary Fig. 30 and Supplementary Table 9 performed mediation analyses to link the MRIBAGs to ProtBAGs and late-life depression34.

The broad spectrum of drug indications linked to the prioritized genes highlights the opportunity to repurpose existing therapies for targeting aging and age-related diseases in different organs, providing a promising direction for future therapeutic advancements. For example, everolimus, a rapamycin analog, has shown promise in extending lifespan and improving lifespan in humans35,36, particularly in delaying age-related diseases and improving immune function. It is known for its ability to suppress immune system activity, which can reduce chronic inflammation, a hallmark of aging. Studies have suggested that chronic low-grade inflammation, often referred to as ‘inflammaging'37, contributes to various age-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease38 and Alzheimer's disease39. Immunosuppressants may mitigate this process by modulating immune responses and promoting tissue repair and regeneration. Notably, the mTOR pathway35, targeted by drugs such as everolimus, has been shown to regulate cellular processes such as growth, survival and metabolism, and its inhibition has been linked to lifespan extension in model organisms, including yeast, worms and mice40.

The counterintuitive finding that higher values of the liver and spleen MRIBAGs are associated with a lower risk of mortality could reflect their role in preserving organ function and overall physiological balance as people age. Potentially, the higher MRIBAG values likely reflect healthier, more resilient organs that maintain their metabolic and immune functions more effectively over time. Specifically, a higher liver MRIBAG may signal better metabolic health, efficient detoxification and regulation of systemic inflammation, which are crucial for maintaining overall homeostasis. Similarly, a higher spleen MRIBAG could indicate better immune function, including more effective immune surveillance and response to infections and other stressors. In the context of aging, these organs might act as ‘reserve systems'41, buffering the body against environmental insults and chronic diseases, which would reduce the risk of mortality.

This study has several limitations. First, the analysis is based on cross-sectional data. Longitudinal studies will be crucial to better investigate the dynamic trajectories of MRIBAGs over time and their temporal relationships with health outcomes. Second, although the analysis focused primarily on genetic and imaging data, environmental factors such as lifestyle, diet and pollution were not considered, yet these may play important roles in aging and disease42. Third, the imaging features for the five abdominal organs and tissues were relatively underdeveloped, underscoring the need to implement more advanced feature engineering techniques and include external independent studies. Furthermore, the genetic analysis was focused primarily on individuals of European ancestry, and future studies should extend these findings to underrepresented populations to enhance their generalizability. Future refinement through larger, multi-ethnic GWASs and the inclusion of rare variants may improve their utility and biological interpretability. In addition, the current results derived from the UKBB study would benefit from confirmation in other large-scale cohorts to ensure their generalizability across populations and study designs. Moreover, as a future avenue, studies incorporating more Alzheimer's disease-oriented and AI-derived imaging biomarkers (for example, subtypes informed by tau or amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) data) may enhance statistical power and clinical relevance to benefit future clinical trials. Finally, the observed protective associations for the liver and spleen MRIBAGs are biologically ambiguous and complex. As such, these findings should be interpreted cautiously.

The MULTI Consortium is an ongoing initiative to integrate and consolidate multi-organ data and multi-omics data, including imaging, genetics and proteomics. Building upon existing consortia and studies, such as those listed below, MULTI aims to curate and harmonize the data to model human aging and disease across the lifespan. In the present study, in total, individual-level data for 313,645 participants were analyzed, including multi-organ MRI data across seven organs and tissues (Category ID: 100003), genetics, plasma proteomics data and metabolomics data. GWAS summary statistics from FinnGen and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) were downloaded and harmonized for our post-GWAS analyses. Refer to Supplementary Table 1 for comprehensive information, including the complete list of data analyzed and their respective sample characteristics.

The MULTI Consortium received approval from the institutional review board at Columbia University (AAAV6751). Participants provided written informed consent for each study that included individual-level data, whereas FinnGen and PGC provided only summary-level statistics. Specifically, the UKBB obtained research ethics approval and received guidance from an Ethics Advisory Committee, with additional ethical input provided to the Access Committee, which oversees decisions regarding access to data and biological samples. The BLSA protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the National Institute of Environmental Health Science, National Institutes of Health (03AG0325). For the A4 trial, institutional review board approval was obtained at each trial site, and all participants provided written informed consent. The study was conducted in accordance with International Council for Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

The UKBB43 is a population-based research initiative comprising approximtely 500,000 individuals from the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010. Ethical approval for the UKBB study was secured, and information about the ethics committee can be found here: https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/learn-more-about-uk-biobank/governance/ethics-advisory-committee.

This study collectively analyzed multi-organ MRI data from seven organ systems and tissues, including the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, spleen, adipose and kidney. For the genetic data, we conducted a quality check on the imputed genotype data43 for the entire UKBB population (approximately 500,000 individuals). Subsequently, we merged the processed data with the organ-specific populations for all genetic analyses. Finally, we also included Olink plasma proteomics data released by the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKB-PPP) and metabolomics data from the UKBB, which are detailed in the following sections.

The main goal of the BLSA is to understand the normal aging process. Tracking physiological and cognitive changes over time aims to identify risk factors for age-related diseases, study patterns of decline and discover predictors of healthy aging. BLSA44,45 brain MRI and SomaScan proteomics data (https://www.blsa.nih.gov/) were used to compare and replicate the ProWAS results from the UKBB Olink data. After quality checks in this study, we included 1,114 brain MRI scans at baseline and measurements of 7,268 plasma proteins from 909 participants quantified with the SomaScan version 4.1 platform. Age (years), sex (male/female), race (white/non-white) and education level (years) were defined based on participant self-reports.

The A4 study18,19 (https://atri.usc.edu/study/a4-study/) is a clinical trial study to test a specific way to prevent memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease (clinical trial number: NCT02008357). The A4 study focused on symptom-free adults at higher risk for Alzheimer's disease to assess whether an investigational drug (that is, solanezumab) could slow memory decline linked to amyloid plaques in the brain. It also examined whether solanezumab could delay Alzheimer's disease progression, measuring related brain changes using imaging, blood biomarkers and baseline PET scans to assess amyloid levels. This study analyzed 1,055 participants at baseline with brain MRI scans to derive the brain MRIBAG. Longitudinal outcomes from the clinical trial, with the PACC score as the primary measure over 312 weeks, were included. The PACC scores between groups were evaluated at week 240.

The FinnGen46 study is a large-scale genomics initiative that has analyzed more than 500,000 Finnish biobank samples and correlated genetic variation with health data to understand disease mechanisms and predispositions. The project is a collaboration between research organizations and biobanks within Finland and international industry partners. For the benefit of research, FinnGen generously made their GWAS findings accessible to the wider scientific community (https://www.finngen.fi/en/access_results). This research used the publicly released GWAS summary statistics (version R9), which became available on 11 May 2022, after harmonization by the consortium. No individual data were used in the current study.

FinnGen published the R9 version of GWAS summary statistics via REGENIE software (version 2.2.4)47, covering 2,272 disease endpoints, including 2,269 binary traits and three quantitative traits. The GWAS model encompassed covariates such as age, sex, the initial 10 genetic principal components and the genotyping batch. Genotype imputation was referenced on the population-specific SISu version 4.0 panel. We included GWAS summary statistics for 521 FinnGen disease endpoints in our analyses.

PGC48 is an international collaboration of researchers studying the genetic basis of psychiatric disorders. PGC aims to identify and understand the genetic factors contributing to various psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and others. The GWAS summary statistics were acquired from the PGC website (https://pgc.unc.edu/for-researchers/download-results/), underwent quality checks and were harmonized to ensure seamless integration into our analysis. No individual data were used from PGC. Each study detailed its specific GWAS models and methodologies, and the consortium consolidated the release of GWAS summary statistics derived from individual studies. In the present study, we included summary data for four brain diseases for which allele frequencies were present.

In our previous analysis of raw brain MRI data from the UKBB and other studies included in this work, we extracted 119 gray matter regions of interest from T1-weighted MRI to generate brain MRIBAGs through the iSTAGING consortium49. For the heart MRIBAG, we used 80 heart MRI traits from Bai et al.50 and used these imaging features in a previous study9. To develop the remaining five MRIBAGs based on abdominal MRI (Category ID: 105 (refs. 51,52,53,54,55,56)), we incorporated 16 imaging features for the adipose MRIBAG, four for the liver MRIBAG, three for the kidney MRIBAG, three for the spleen MRIBAG and three for the pancreas MRIBAG. Notably, in the development of adipose and kidney MRIBAGs, we observed a high degree of collinearity among certain imaging features, which led to overfitting. To mitigate this issue, we removed highly correlated features to improve model robustness.

The abdominal MRI data underwent initial quality control procedures prior to public release, including the removal of low-quality images and biologically implausible values. As noted on the UKBB website (https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/ukb/label.cgi?id=158), different pipelines were used to generate imaging features from abdominal MRI, and data should not be combined without careful consideration. To account for this, we ensured that each abdominal feature was derived from a consistent pipeline, selecting the one with the largest available sample size across different pipelines. For liver MRI metrics specifically, we included only images acquired using the IDEAL protocol (Data-Field 40063, acquisition protocol 2). Following these additional quality control steps, our analyses incorporated abdominal MRI biomarkers from all available UKBB participants for the liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas and adipose MRIBAGs.

Our previous study systematically evaluated age prediction performance across various AI/ML models using multimodal brain MRI features14 for the brain MRIBAG. Applying the same framework, we assessed the performance of models in deriving the six additional MRIBAGs using several ML methods. Hyperparameter tuning was performed through nested, repeated holdout cross-validation57 with 50 repetitions (80% training/validation and 20% testing). Specifically, the hyperparameters of each model were tuned using grid search: LASSO regression's alpha (α), linear support vector regressor's C and both α and L1-ratio for the elastic net. Due to the flexibility and large hyperparameter space of neural networks (for example, number of layers and neurons), they were not included in the nested cross-validation pipeline. Instead, the neural network was manually tuned and evaluated on the cross-validation test dataset, and the final model was subsequently assessed on the within-distribution, holdout test set. The within-distribution, holdout test dataset was held out to unbiasedly evaluate model performance (Supplementary Fig. 31).

To rigorously train the AI/ML models, we first defined participants without any pathologies based on ICD code and clinical history as CN (N = 5,291 for the heart MRIBAG, varying across the seven organs/tissues). We further split the CN into the following datasets:

CN within-distribution, holdout test dataset: 500 participants were randomly drawn from the CN population. Within-distribution, holdout test datasets are ideal for objectively evaluating ML model performance, especially in studies with large sample sizes, such as the present one.

CN training/validation dataset: 80% of the remaining 4,791 CN (taking the heart MRIBAG for illustration) were used for the inner loop 10-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter selection.

CN cross-validated test dataset: 20% of the remaining 4,791 CN were used for the outer loop 50 repetitions.

Patient dataset: 29,785 patients who have at least one ICD-10-based diagnosis.

The CN training/validation/test datasets were used for model development and were employed with a nested cross-validation procedure for four AI/ML models (LASSO regression and support vector regressor, elastic net and neural network), whereas the within-distribution, holdout test set provided an unbiased assessment of model performance. Model evaluation metrics included MAE and Pearson's r. Notably, consistent with our previous studies, only CN participants were included in the training/validation dataset for modeling and clinical interpretation considerations13. The BAG was determined by subtracting the participant's chronological age from the AI/ML-predicted age. Age bias correction was applied using the approach outlined by Beheshti et al.16 and was systematically discussed in our previous comment13. To summarize, we applied an age bias correction method commonly used in neuroimaging studies, where a linear regression of the BAG on chronological age is used to estimate and remove systematic age-related bias via the model's slope and intercept. Notably, to address potential domain shift in the patient data compared to the CN training set, we computed the regression parameters directly from the patient set to more accurately correct for this bias (refer to our comment13 for further details). Supplementary Fig. 32 details the feature importance across UKBB, BLSA and A4.

We used the original dataset (Category ID: 1838), which was analyzed and shared with the research community by the UKB-PPP58. The initial quality control procedures were described in the original study59, and we implemented additional quality control steps as outlined below. Our analysis focused on the first instance of the proteomics data (‘instance' = 0). We then integrated Olink files containing coding information, batch numbers, assay details and limit of detection (LOD) data (Category ID: 1839) by matching them to the proteomics dataset ID. Finally, we excluded Normalized Protein eXpression (NPX) values that fell below the protein-specific LOD.

We conducted ProWASs by linking the seven MRIBAGs to 2,923 unique plasma proteins measured in 53,016 participants (with sample sizes ranging from 10,018 to 39,489 per protein after quality control) using the Olink platform. The linear regression model adjusted for common covariates, including age (Field ID: 21003), sex (Field ID: 31), body weight (Field ID: 21002), height (Field ID: 50), waist circumference (Field ID: 48), body mass index (BMI) (Field ID: 23104), assessment center (Field ID: 54), protein batch number (Category ID: 1839), LOD (Category ID: 1839) and the first 40 genetic principal components. Additionally, organ-specific covariates were incorporated, such as brain positioning in the scanner (lateral, transverse and longitudinal; Field ID: 25756−25758), head motion (Field ID: 25741) and intracranial volume for the brain MRIBAG as well as diastolic (Field ID: 4079) and systolic (Field ID: 4080) blood pressure for the heart MRIBAG, among others. Multiple testing corrections were applied using Bonferroni adjustment (P < 0.05/2,923/7). To identify and exclude extreme outliers, we defined an upper threshold as the mean plus six times the s.d. for each protein/metabolite. Finally, ProWAS signals identified in the UKBB Olink dataset were compared with SomaScan data from the BLSA.

We used the original data (Category ID: 220), which were analyzed and made available to the community by Nightingale Health Plc. The original data (1) were calibrated absolute concentrations (or ratios) and not raw NMR spectra and (2), before release, had already been subjected to quality control procedures by Nightingale Health Plc60. Following the additional procedures described in Ritchie et al.61, we performed additional quality check steps to remove a range of unwanted technical variations, including shipping batch, 96-well plate, well position, aliquoting robo and aliquot tip. We focused our analysis on the first instance of the metabolomics data (‘instance' = 0). The analysis included 327 metabolites (comprising both small molecules and lipoprotein measures), of which 107 were non-derived metabolites and the remainder were composite metabolites, across 274,247 participants. Descriptions of these metabolites are provided in Supplementary Table 3.

We conducted MetWASs by linking the seven MRIBAGs to 327 plasma metabolites. The linear regression model adjusted for common covariates, including age (Field ID: 21003), sex (Field ID: 31), body weight (Field ID: 21002), height (Field ID: 50), waist circumference (Field ID: 48), BMI (Field ID: 23104), assessment center (Field ID: 54) and the first 40 genetic principal components. Additionally, organ-specific covariates were incorporated, such as brain positioning in the scanner (lateral, transverse and longitudinal; Field ID: 25756−25758), head motion (Field ID: 25741) and intracranial volume for the brain MRIBAG, as well as diastolic (Field ID: 4079) and systolic (Field ID: 4080) blood pressure for the heart MRIBAG, among others. Multiple testing corrections were applied using Bonferroni adjustment (P < 0.05/327/7).

We used the imputed genotype data from the UKBB for all genetic analyses. Our quality check pipeline focused on European ancestry in the UKBB (6,477,810 SNPs passing quality checks), and the quality-checked genetic data were merged with respective organ-specific populations for GWAS. We summarize our genetic quality check steps. First, we skipped the step for family relationship inference62 because the linear mixed model via fastGWA63 inherently addresses population stratification, encompassing additional cryptic population stratification factors. We then removed duplicated variants from all 22 autosomal chromosomes. Individuals whose genetically identified sex did not match their self-acknowledged sex were removed. Other excluding criteria included (1) individuals with more than 3% of missing genotypes; (2) variants with minor allele frequency (MAF; dosage mode) of less than 1%; (3) variants with more than 3% missing genotyping rate; and (4) variants that failed the Hardy−Weinberg test at 1 × 10−10. To further adjust for population stratification,64 we derived the first 40 genetic principal components using FlashPCA software65. Details of the genetic quality check protocol are described elsewhere11,14,34,49,66,67.

We applied a linear mixed model regression to the European ancestry populations using fastGWA63 implemented in GCTA21. We used fastGWA to perform the seven MRIBAG GWASs, adjusting common variates, including age, dataset status (training/validation/test or within-distribution, holdout test), age-squared, sex, interactions of age with sex, BMI, waist circumference, standing height, weight and the first 40 genetic principal components, as well as organ-specific covariates, including the brain scan positions for the brain MRIBAG and systolic/diastolic blood pressure for the heart MRIBAG. We applied a genome-wide significance threshold (5 × 10−8) to annotate the significant independent genomic loci. We previously conducted GWAS of 2,923 plasma proteins and 327 metabolites using fastGWA5,68.

For all GWASs, genomic loci were annotated using FUMA69. For genomic loci annotation, FUMA initially identified lead SNPs (correlation r2 ≤ 0.1, distance < 250 kb) and assigned them to non-overlapping genomic loci. The lead SNP with the lowest P value (that is, the top lead SNP) represented the genomic locus. Further details on the definitions of top lead SNP, lead SNP, independent significant SNP and candidate SNP can be found in the FUMA documentation (https://fuma.ctglab.nl/). For visualization purposes in Fig. 3a, we mapped the top lead SNP of each locus to the cytogenetic regions based on the GRCh37 cytoband.

We estimated the SNP-based heritability (h2) using GCTA21 with the same covariates as in GWAS. GCTA estimates the SNP-based heritability using a method called restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to quantify the proportion of phenotypic variance in a trait that the additive effects of all common SNPs can explain. The main steps involved in GCTA include constructing the genetic relationship matrix, modeling phenotypic variance and using REML to estimate the h2.

The partitioned heritability analysis via stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression calculates the extent to which heritability enrichment can be attributed to predefined and annotated genome regions and categories70. Three sets of functional categories and cell-specific and tissue-specific types were considered. First, the partitioned heritability was calculated for 53 general functional categories (one including the entire set of SNPs). The 53 functional categories are not specific to any cell type and include coding regions, untranslated regions, promoter regions and intronic regions. The details of the 53 categories are described elsewhere70. Subsequently, cell-type-specific and tissue-type-specific partitioned heritability was estimated using gene sets from Cahoy et al.71 for three main cell types (that is, astrocyte, neuron and oligodendrocyte), multi-tissue chromatin state-specific data (Roadmap72 and ENTEx73) and multi-tissue gene expression data (GTEx version 8 (ref. 74)). Bonferroni correction was performed for all tested annotations and categories. The detailed methodologies for the stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression are presented in the original work70. The linkage disequilibrium scores and allele frequencies for the European ancestry were obtained from a predefined version based on data from the 1000 Genomes project.

We estimated the genetic correlation (gc) using LDSC75 software. We employed precomputed linkage disequilibrium scores from the 1000 Genomes of European ancestry, maintaining default settings for other parameters in LDSC. It is worth noting that LDSC corrects for sample overlap, ensuring an unbiased genetic correlation estimate76. Statistical significance was determined using Bonferroni correction.

We constructed two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization by linking the seven MRIBAGs and 525 disease endpoints from FinnGen46 and PGC48. In total, two networks were established: MRIBAG2DE and DE2MRIBAG. The systematic quality-checking procedures to ensure unbiased exposure/outcome variable and instrumental variable selection are detailed below.

We used a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach implemented in the TwoSampleMR package77 to infer the causal relationships within these networks. We employed five distinct Mendelian randomization methods, including the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, Egger, weighted median and simple mode and weighted mode estimators. The STROBE-MR Statement78 guided our analyses to increase transparency and reproducibility, encompassing the selection of exposure and outcome variables, reporting statistics and implementing sensitivity checks to identify potential violations of underlying assumptions. First, we performed an unbiased quality check on the GWAS summary statistics. Notably, the absence of population overlapping bias79 was confirmed, given that FinnGen and UKBB participants largely represent populations of European ancestry without explicit overlap with the UKBB. PGC GWAS summary data were ensured to exclude UKBB participants. Furthermore, the GWAS summary statistics from all consortia were based on or lifted to GRCh37. Subsequently, we selected the effective exposure variables by assessing the statistical power of the exposure GWAS summary statistics in terms of instrumental variables, ensuring that the number of instrumental variables exceeded seven before harmonizing the data. Crucially, the function ‘clump_data' was applied to the exposure GWAS data, considering linkage disequilibrium. The function ‘harmonise_data' was then used to harmonize the GWAS summary statistics of the exposure and outcome variables. Bonferroni correction was applied to all tested traits based on the number of effective disease endpoints.

Finally, we conducted multiple sensitivity analyses. First, we conducted a heterogeneity test to scrutinize potential violations of the instrumental variables' assumptions. To assess horizontal pleiotropy, which indicates the instrumental variables' exclusivity assumption80, we used a funnel plot, single-SNP Mendelian randomization methods and the Egger estimator. Furthermore, we performed a leave-one-out analysis, systematically excluding one instrument (SNP/instrumental variable) at a time, to gauge the sensitivity of the results to individual SNPs.

PRS was computed using split-sample GWASs (split1 and split2) for the seven MRIBAG GWASs. The PRS weights were established using split1/discovery GWAS data as the base/training set, whereas the split2/replication GWAS summary statistics served as the target/testing data. Both base and target data underwent rigorous quality control procedures involving several steps: (1) excluding duplicated and ambiguous SNPs in the base data and (2) excluding high heterozygosity samples in the target data and (3) eliminating duplicated, mismatching and ambiguous SNPs in the target data.

After completing the quality control procedures, PRS for the split2 and split1 groups was calculated using the PRS-CS81 method. PRS-CS applies a continuous shrinkage prior, which adjusts the SNP effect sizes based on their linkage disequilibrium structure. SNPs with weaker evidence are ‘shrunk' toward zero, whereas those with stronger evidence retain larger effect sizes. This avoids overfitting and improves prediction performance. The shrinkage parameter was not set, and the algorithm learned it via a fully Bayesian approach.

We conducted multiple analyses to establish genetic evidence for prioritizing potential druggable genes in future drug repurposing. Our central hypothesis is that genes with functional implications and causal roles validated across multiple omics layers, such as genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics, are more likely to be actionable for drug repurposing, as they offer a stronger and more robust foundation for identifying therapeutic targets82,83.

First, we performed SNP-to-gene mapping via three approaches: positional mapping, eQTL mapping and chromatin interaction mapping. For eQTL and chromatin interaction mapping, we used data from various resources, including GTEx, PsychENCODE, EyeGEx, TIGER, DICE, eQTLGen, Blood eQTL, MuTHER, CommonMind Consortium, BRAINEAC, FANTOM5, the Brain Open Chromatin Atlas and the Roadmap 111 epigenomes, all consolidated through the FUMA platform. By requiring both eQTL and chromatin interaction support, we enhance confidence in selecting functionally relevant genes because eQTL mapping identifies genetic variants that regulate gene expression. Chromatin interaction mapping links distal regulatory elements (for example, enhancers) to target genes, offering spatial genomic context. Together, these criteria ensure that the prioritized genes are not only associated with GWAS loci but also have strong regulatory and functional evidence, making them more biologically plausible as druggable targets.

Subsequently, we connected MRIBAG, as an imaging-derived endophenotype, to aging clocks derived from plasma proteomics and metabolomics to further strengthen the genetic evidence for prioritizing these druggable genes. To achieve this, we used a Bayesian co-localization approach to assess whether the genomic loci associated with the seven MRIBAGs share common causal variants with the 11 ProtBAGs or the five MetBAGs. We used the R package ‘coloc' to investigate the genetic co-localization signals between two traits (for example, the brain MRIBAG versus the brain ProtBAG) at each genomic locus associated with the MRIBAG. This method (‘coloc.abf') examines the posterior probability to evaluate hypothesis H4 (PP.H4.ABF), which suggests the presence of a single shared causal variant associated with both traits within a specific genomic locus. To determine the significance of the H4 hypothesis, we set a threshold of PP.H4.ABF > 0.8 (ref. 84). All other parameters (for example, the prior probability of p12) were set as the default. For each pair of traits, the genomic locus was defined by default from FUMA for one trait, and then the ‘coloc' package extracted and harmonized the GWAS summary statistics within this locus for the other trait.

Finally, we searched the DGIdb platform (https://dgidb.org/) for genes that demonstrated both functional mapping evidence and causal associations to investigate their drug−gene interactions, revealing existing drugs and their therapeutic indications.

We investigated the clinical promise of the seven MRIBAGs and their PRSs (MRIBAG-PRS) in three sets of prediction analyses: (1) survival analysis for the incidence of single disease entities based on the ICD-10 code, (2) survival analysis for the risk of all-cause mortality and (3) differential response to the Alzheimer's disease drug (solanezumab).

We employed a Cox proportional hazard model while adjusting for covariates (that is, age and sex) to test the associations of the seven MRIBAGs with the incidence of ICD-based single disease entities. The covariates were included as additional right-side variables in the model. To train the model, the ‘time' variable was determined by calculating the difference between the date of death (Field ID: 40000) for cases (or the censoring date for non-cases) and the date attending the assessment center (Field ID: 53). Participants who were diagnosed for a specific disease of interest after enrolling in the study were classified as cases; non-cases were defined by participants without any disease diagnoses.

We employed a Cox proportional hazard model while adjusting for covariates (that is, age and sex) to test the associations of the seven MRIBAGs and seven MRIBAG-PRSs with all-cause mortality. The covariates were included as additional right-side variables in the model. The hazard ratio, exp(βR), was calculated and reported as the effect size measure that indicates the influence of each biomarker on the risk of mortality. To train the model, the ‘time' variable was determined by calculating the difference between the date of death (Field ID: 40000) for cases (or the censoring date for non-cases) and the date attending the assessment center (Field ID: 53). Participants who died after enrolling in the study were classified as cases. We also conducted a disease-free survival analysis, including only participants without any diagnosed conditions, to eliminate potential confounding effects from disease pathology.

To evaluate our hypothesis that individuals with varying aging clock paces may progress differently to cognitive decline, we analyzed clinical trial data from the A4 (ref. 18) study. Specifically, we investigated whether brain MRIBAG could be used to stratify participants into decelerated and accelerated aging groups and demonstrated different cognitive profiles at 240 weeks by taking solanezumab. The original trial did not demonstrate cognitive decline slowing compared to the placebo over 240 weeks, with the treatment group even showing a slight worsening in the PACC score. To evaluate this, we performed four comparisons using natural cubic spline modeling: (1) decelerated aging (for example, below the brain MRIBAG median) versus accelerated aging (for example, above the median) within the drug group and (2) within the placebo group; (3) between drug and placebo groups among participants with accelerated aging; and (4) between drug and placebo groups among those with decelerated aging.

From a statistical perspective, this is to model repeated measures (that is, PACC as the primary trial outcome for global cognition) as a continuous outcome in a mixed-effect model. We used the same method proposed by the original work from Donohue et al.85, in which the authors proposed a constrained longitudinal data analysis with natural cubic splines that treated time as continuous and used test version effects to model the mean over time for PACC. Fixed effects included the following terms: (1) spline basis expansion terms (two terms); (2) interaction of the spline basis expansion terms with treatment (two terms); (3) the version of the PACC test implemented; (4) baseline age; (5) education; (6) APOE4 carrier status (yes/no); and (7) baseline florbetapir cortical standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) value. At week 240, we compared the mean PACC values between each pair of the two groups.

a) For each organ-specific MRIBAG, we split the UK Biobank populations into healthy controls (CN, without any pathologies) and patients (PT) based on ICD-10 codes and their clinical history. b) To develop the 7 MRIBAGs, we trained two AI/ML models exclusively on the CN training/validation/test population using a nested cross-validation procedure to identify the optimal model. Hold-out datasets included the CN within-distribution, hold-out test dataset (N = 500), and the PT population. c) The study's analytical workflow encompassed deriving the 7 MRIBAGs and their PRSs, performing ProWAS, MetWAS, GWAS, and post-GWAS analyses, and assessing the predictive performance of the MRIBAG and MRIBAG-PRSs for single disease entities, mortality, and drug outcomes. Data from the BLSA and A4 studies were used to generate the brain MRIBAG in independent cohorts.

Proteome-wide association studies (ProWAS) between the 7 MRIBAGs and 2923 plasma proteins via a linear regression model, accounting for a full set of covariates. Representative significant (P-value < 0.05/2923/7, indicated by the dotted horizontal line) MRIBAG-protein associations are annotated by the respective gene symbol. We used the standardized β value as an effect size measurement.

STRING conducts protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis by combining various sources of interaction evidence, such as experimental data, computational predictions, and text mining. In addition to interactions, STRING can carry out functional enrichment analysis to identify Gene Ontology (GO) terms (for example, biological processes, molecular functions), KEGG pathways (for example, metabolic and signaling pathways), and protein domains (for example, shared structural motifs). a) PPI network of the brain MRIBAG-related proteins. b) Functional PSEA of the brain MRIBAG-related proteins. Results and figures are generated using STRING v12.0 (https://string-db.org/).

Metabolome-wide association studies (MetWAS) between the 7 MRIBAGs and 327 plasma metabolites via a linear regression model, accounting for a full set of covariates. Representative significant (P-value < 0.05/327/7, indicated by the dotted horizontal line) MRIBAG-metabolite associations are annotated. We used the standardized β value as an effect size measurement.

a) Top 25 MSEA results for the spleen MRIBAG-related small molecule metabolites. b) The MMI network results for these metabolite sets are displayed as follows: each node represents a metabolite set, with color indicating the enrichment P-value and size reflecting the fold enrichment ratio. Two metabolite sets are connected by an edge if the proportion of shared metabolites between them exceeds 25% of the total combined metabolites. Results and figures are generated using MetaboAnalyst v6.0 (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/). We used 3694 metabolite and lipid pathways from RaMP-DB (which integrates KEGG via HMDB, Reactome, and WikiPathways, curated via MetaboAnalyst) as the background metabolite dataset. Only metabolite sets with at least two entries were included.

a) ProWAS results for the PLA2G1B protein and the pancreas MRIBAG. b) ProWAS results for the VCAM1 protein and the spleen MRIBAG. c) ProWAS results for the BCAN protein and the brain MRIBAG. d) MetWAS results for the creatinine metabolite and the adipose MRIBAG. e) MetWAS results for the creatinine metabolite and the kidney MRIBAG. f) MetWAS results for total concentration of phospholipids (Total_P) and the spleen MRIBAG. A linear regression model was fitted, and the resulting Pearson's r and P-value are reported.

The trumpet plots display the inverse relationship between the alternative (effect) allele frequency and the effect size (β coefficient) for the 7 MRIBAGs. We present the independent, significant SNPs defined in FUMA. The dot size corresponds to the effect size, while the transparency of the dot is proportional to its statistical significance.

All supplementary figures, notes and tables are included.

This is study-specific code to produce the seven MRIBAGs using MLNI software.

When Chinese AI startup DeepSeek became a global sensation in January, it not only shocked Silicon Valley but also startled ByteDance, TikTok's parent company. The Chinese tech giant had already launched Doubao, its own flagship AI assistant app with tens of millions of users. But when DeepSeek became the best-known Chinese AI company overnight, no one was talking about Doubao anymore.

Now, ByteDance has gotten its revenge. By August, Doubao regained the throne as the most popular AI app in China with over 157 million monthly active users, according to QuestMobile, a Chinese data intelligence provider. DeepSeek, with 143 million monthly active users, slipped to second place. The same month, venture capital firm a16z also ranked Doubao as the fourth-most-popular generative AI app globally, just behind the likes of ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.

Doubao, which launched in 2023, was deliberately designed to be personable. Unlike most popular AI chatbots, Doubao's app icon features a human-looking avatar—a female cartoon character with a short bob that greets people when they open the app for the first time. The name Doubao literally translates to “steamed bun with bean paste,” mimicking “the nickname a user would give to an intimate friend,” ByteDance vice president Alex Zhu said in a public speech in 2024.

Compared to Western AI apps, “there's a warmer, more welcoming feel,” says Dermot McGrath, a Shanghai-based investor and technologist. “ChatGPT, for example, feels like a tool you open to complete a task and then close again. Doubao has more features and a more colorful user interface that keeps you interested longer.”

Doubao offers users a little bit of everything—it's like ChatGPT, Midjourney, Sora, Character.ai, TikTok, Perplexity, Copilot, and more in a single app. It can chat via text, audio, and video; it can generate images, spreadsheets, decks, podcasts, and five-second videos; it allows anyone to customize an AI agent for specific scenarios and host it on Doubao's platform for others to use. One of the most important things about the app, however, is that it's deeply integrated with Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, allowing it to both attract users from the video platform and send traffic back to it.

Somehow, ByteDance's ambitiously sprawling strategy for Doubao has turned out to be exactly what Chinese users wanted. A little over two years since its launch, Doubao has quietly become the AI app that Chinese people—particularly those who aren't very AI savvy—are actually using. But it has almost no name recognition in the West.

“It's marketed at people who are not the most technologically informed, people who may prefer voice chat and video interaction over text,” says Irene Zhang, a researcher at ChinaTalk, a newsletter about Chinese tech. “Some of the earliest Doubao users I heard of were my friends' grandmothers and aunties.”

While DeepSeek feels like “a first-generation AI app, similar to the early days of ChatGPT,” Doubao represents the second generation of AI platforms in China, says Poe Zhao, a Beijing-based tech analyst who writes the Substack newsletter Hello China Tech. Doubao “integrates richer functions, clear visual cues, and scenario-based guidance, which significantly reduces the cognitive barrier to using large models. That makes them far more approachable for mass-market users,” Zhao says.

Over time, ByteDance has introduced more and more features for Doubao, many of which it copied from its rivals. For example, when Google introduced an update that allowed Gemini to generate realistic 3D objects in August, Doubao quickly added a 3D preset function into its image generation menu.

Doubao doesn't necessarily have the most advanced AI capabilities on the market, but ByteDance does one thing especially well: encouraging users to share their interactions with the chatbot on social media. Douyin users can tag Doubao in the comments of a video and have it provide a text summary of the video's content, and Doubao users are also recommended Douyin videos in answers and can view them natively in Doubao without switching to a different app.

“It's where convenience meets dopamine, especially for young generations,” says Wei Sun, the principal AI analyst at Counterpoint Research, a Hong Kong–based technology market research firm. “It's just enough for virality. That light, low-effort user experience is exactly what drives social sharing and sticky engagement in China. It may not be the best in class, but it's best for distribution.”

As a result, Doubao-generated images are everywhere on Chinese social media platforms, distinguished by the Doubao watermark in their bottom right corner. For example, when a user asked what to do with the empty space in their bedroom on RedNote, China's hottest social media platform, the comments were filled with interior design suggestions rendered by Doubao. They ranged from practical ideas, like installing shelving and storage, to ridiculous jokes like opening a boba tea store in the room.

Influencers are also using Doubao's text-to-speech function to generate content, Zhang notes. The app allows them to build interactive audio chat agents with 20 different regional dialects, allowing them to generate the specific comedic effects that different audiences want. “There are these viral videos on Chinese internet of people talking to [Doubao] and essentially having it say voice-based memes. And that implicitly targets an audience that prefers voice over text,” Zhang says.

At the heart of Doubao's success is ByteDance's long legacy of developing viral mobile apps. The company obviously knows how to make popular, even addictive, platforms—just look at TikTok and Douyin. ByteDance is often referred to as the “app factory” in China because it regularly launches dozens of new apps for a plethora of different use cases. It has a strong institutional muscle for iterating fast, rapidly testing features, and driving users from one app to another.

This is where experts say ByteDance has a significant edge over DeepSeek, an AI startup that has almost no experience in building consumer-facing platforms. DeepSeek's early hype was driven by its first model's efficiency and performance, but its product remains fairly minimalistic—it's still basically just a text chatbot. While DeepSeek's AI has a reputation for excelling at math and logic tasks, it's lagging behind the competition when it comes to multi-modal functionality and onboarding new users.

Some consumers left DeepSeek because they were looking for image capability or autonomous agents, while others left because DeepSeek's servers often couldn't handle the amount of traffic the chatbot was getting, says McGrath. Many of them wound up converging on Doubao. QuestMobile data from August shows that almost 40 percent of users who left DeepSeek switched to Doubao instead.

ByteDance is now trying to bring Doubao to other parts of its technology ecosystem. The company has reportedly worked with makers of smart glasses, carmakers (including Tesla), and other device OEMs to embed Doubao as in-car assistants or AI companions, extending the reach of Doubao beyond smartphones and computers.

The classic problem with E2EE messaging on the web is that the point of E2EE is that you don't have to trust the server not to read your messages, but if you're using a web client you have to trust the server to serve you JS that won't just send the plain text of your messages to the admin.The properties of the web really exacerbate this problem, as you can serve every visitor to your site a different version of the app based on their IP, geolocation, tracking cookies, whatever. (Whereas with a mobile app everyone gets the same version you submitted to the app store).With this proposed system, we could actually have really trustworthy E2EE messaging apps on the web, which would be huge.(BTW, I do think E2EE web apps still have their place currently, if you trust the server to not be malicious (say, you or a trusted friend runs it), and you're protecting from accidental disclosure)

I wrote a coincidently related rant post last week that didn't set the front page of HN on fire so I won't bother linking to it but the TL/DR is that a whole range of supply chain attacks just go away if you host the files yourself. Each third party you force your users to request from is an attack vector you don't control.I get what this proposal is trying to achieve but it seems over complex. I would hate to have to integrate this into my build process.

Transparency adds a mechanism to detect when your server has been compromised. Basically you just run a monitor on your own device occasionally (or use a third party service if you like), and you get an email notif whenever the site's manifest changes.I agree it's far more work than just not doing transparency. But the guarantees are real and not something you get from any existing technology afaict.

Then we can really have security on the Web!
Audit companies (even anonymous ones but with a good reputation) could vet certain hashes as being secure, and people and organizations could see a little padlock when M of N approved a new version.As it is, we need an extension for that. Because SRI is only for subresource integrity. And it doesn't even work on HTML in iframes, which is a shame!

> A paranoid Tor user may not trust existing transparency services or witnesses, and there might not be any other trusted party with the resources to self-host these functionalities. For this use case, it may be reasonable to put the prefix tree on a blockchain somewhere. This makes the usual domain validation impossible (there's no validator server to speak of), but this is fine for onion services. Since an onion address is just a public key, a signature is sufficient to prove ownership of the domain.

Binary transparency allows you to reason about the auditability of the JavaScript being delivered to your web browser. This is the first significant step towards a solution to the ""JavaScript Cryptography Considered Harmful"" blog post.The remaining missing pieces here are, in my view, code signing and the corresponding notion of public key transparency.

Trump wanted big tech to leave China. By most appearances, he is getting what he wants.

Microsoft is reportedly the latest company to start decoupling some of its business in China. The big tech giant has asked multiple suppliers to prepare “out of China” production for the company's Surface laptop computers and data center servers, according to sources briefed on the matter who spoke to Nikkei Asia.

According to the sources, Microsoft wants to manufacture parts and components, and assemble products for new notebook computers and servers outside of China starting as early as 2026. The tech giant has already started shifting a large portion of its server production out of China in 2024, the sources said. Next on the list to be pushed outside of China is reportedly the production of Xbox consoles.

The report also alleges that Amazon Web Services is currently evaluating moving production of its AI data center servers outside of China and reducing sourcing from longtime Chinese suppliers. Meanwhile, other sources told Nikkei that Google is asking suppliers to expand server production capacity in Thailand.

Tech has been the most significant battleground in the tariff war between Washington and Beijing, and American big tech is caught in the crossfire.

Most American big tech companies have supply chains and manufacturing operations in China. All of these operations would be jeopardized if Trump follows through on his threats to impose 100% tariffs on China starting in November, as well as export controls on critical software.

Trump has been adamant about his desire for U.S. companies to decouple from China. He demanded that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan resign over perceived ties to China, and only backed down on his attack when the company agreed to sell a 10% stake to the U.S. government.

Trump's attacks are similar in tone to those he wielded in his first presidency. In 2019, Trump “ordered” U.S. companies to leave their China operations.

China, on the other hand, is also using its power over these companies as a battle tactic as the trade war between the two global superpowers escalates.

Just last week, China tightened export controls on some rare earth minerals, which are the lifeline of the tech industry and are especially a key component to the production of computer chips. Beijing is also now requiring companies to obtain licenses from the Chinese government before they can export any product that contains more than 0.1% China-sourced rare earths. China mines 70% of the world's rare earth minerals, and refines about 90%.

Beijing has also utilized a slew of antitrust actions against American tech giants. In a high-profile case last month, China's antitrust regulator concluded a preliminary probe that found Nvidia in violation of Chinese antimonopoly laws. The latest to face China's legal ire was Qualcomm. China's top market regulator launched an investigation last week into the American semiconductor company's acquisition of Israeli startup Autotalks.

China and the U.S. are inextricably linked when it comes to tech. Sources told Nikkei Asia that “removing Chinese suppliers from the supply chain is very difficult in real practice,” at least for AWS. But the tariff escalations are putting compounding pressure on these tech giants, and might be lighting the fuse for a wave of changes.

Birds poop for very scientific, evolutionary reasons. That said, the beauty of science is difficult to appreciate when it materializes as unwanted poop splotches on the hood of your car. But there may be particular colors or driving habits that might make a car more attractive to birds looking for a nice place to poop.

Earlier this month, Virginia-based company Alan's Factory Outlet published the “Bird Dropping Report,” which surveyed 1,000 U.S. drivers about their experience dealing with bird mess on their cars. The report combines survey responses with ornithology research, and its conclusions reveal a mix of expected yet surprising insights into the relationship between avian bowel activity and vehicle appearance.

Overall, brown, red, and black cars were most likely to be pooped on, whereas lighter colors, such as white or silver, tended to be spared from poop. As for brands, Ram trucks appeared to be most affected by bird splatter, followed by Jeep, Chevrolet, Nissan, and Dodge.

But the study also asked participants various questions about their general experience dealing with bird mess. For instance, 58% of respondents said that a bird pooped on their car more than once in the same day, with 11% reporting that it caused paint damage.

Around 30% argued that the birds had personally “targeted” their cars, particularly owners of Lexus (47%), Tesla (39%), and Dodge (35%) vehicles. For context, Dodge and Tesla rank 5th and 7th place, respectively, on the survey's top 10 brands most likely to be pooped on (Lexus did not make the top ten).

Another intriguing takeaway from the survey was that bird mess often interfered with drivers' daily routines. For example, 6% of participants canceled or delayed plans to address splatter issues on their car, whereas 14% reported getting pooped on while getting in and out of their car.

Dealing with bird poop can become a financial burden, too. 57% admitted to paying for a car wash specifically to deal with bird poop, whereas 39% directly cited bird poop as the reason for going to the car wash multiple times a month.

As a result, the “costs add up quickly,” the report noted. About a quarter of respondents said they spent more than $500 per year on “car washes and repairs related to bird mess.” For Tesla and BMW owners, vehicle maintenance costs due to bird poop often exceeded $500, according to the report.

The fear of bird poop also drove changes in driver behavior. More than half of survey participants expressed concern that their current parking setup didn't provide sufficient protection from bird poop, and 38% answered that they didn't mind walking an extra block or two to avoid “poop zones.”

The survey proposes several reasons as to why birds may be attracted to certain cars. Birds in urban locations merely like to roost under trees, power lines, or street signs, as they “provide safety and visibility for birds,” according to the report. Of course, that means that any cars parked under these prime locations are “in the line of fire,” it added.

But birds also see color differently from humans, due to an extra cone cell in their eyes that allows them to detect ultraviolet light. So it may be that brown, red, and black appear more attractive to birds—a tendency that has been explored by ornithologists before.

“If you've ever felt like your car is a magnet for bird droppings, you're not wrong,” the report stated. “Science suggests there may be more behind the mess than bad luck.”

T-Mobile has turned the wireless industry on its head with an offer that sounds too good to be true: free iPhone 17 devices for practically anyone who walks through their doors. Whether you're a loyal customer or someone fed up with your current carrier's inflated prices, T-Mobile is handing out Apple's latest flagship phones at zero cost.

See iPhone 17 at T-Mobile

Trade in any smartphone in any condition and claim an iPhone 17 Pro without spending a dime. New customers joining the Experience More or Experience Beyond plans don't even need a trade-in to secure a standard iPhone 17. And if you're bringing the entire family along, T-Mobile will give you up to four lines of unlimited service for just one hundred dollars per month, with each line qualifying for its own complimentary iPhone 17.

This isn't a limited-time offer gimmick meant only to pull in a few customers before reverting back to stealth mode: T-Mobile's got the infrastructure and faith backing such aggressive promotions because they run the fastest network in America, according to Ookla's Speedtest Intelligence data. Their first quarter 2025 readings revealed T-Mobile's decisive lead over the competition in speed and total performance. The company's been methodically growing its coverage area with 5G and adds towers and bandwidth that yield concrete improvements you can expect the moment you begin to use your brand-new device.

T-Mobile's ambitions extend beyond traditional cellular coverage with their T-Satellite service, which leverages orbital technology to reach locations other providers simply cannot access. This innovation ensures strong signals even in remote areas where competitors' networks fade into uselessness. The company has also optimized its integration with iOS, making these iPhone 17 promotions a natural extension of their network strategy rather than a desperate attempt to attract subscribers.

The economic benefits add up quickly for switchers: T-Mobile claims existing customers from competing networks can save up to twenty percent each month with a switch to an Experience plan. Those plans include in-flight Wi-Fi and Magenta Status benefits among others, but the large benefit remains in that no-cost iPhone 17 in the palm of your hand with your monthly fees lowered.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:tomshardware.com","Two Nvidia DGX Spark systems fused with M3 Ultra Mac Studio to deliver 2.8x gain in AI benchmarks — EXO Labs demonstrates disaggregated AI inference serving","https://www.tomshardware.com/software/two-nvidia-dgx-spark-systems-combined-with-m3-ultra-mac-studio-to-create-blistering-llm-system-exo-labs-demonstrates-disaggregated-ai-inference-and-achieves-a-2-8-benchmark-boost","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 15:20:04 GMT","

The company used its EXO tool to spread an inference workload across two DGX Spark systems and a Mac Studio.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


EXO Labs' primary project is EXO, an open-source framework for running large language models (LLMs) efficiently across mixed hardware setups. Rather than treating inference as a task bound to a single GPU or accelerator, EXO automatically spreads workloads across whatever devices you have—turning a cluster of desktops, laptops, workstations, servers, tablets, or even smartphones into a cooperative AI mesh. EXO's newest demo combines two of NVIDIA's DGX Spark systems with Apple's M3 Ultra–powered Mac Studio to make use of the disparate strengths of each machine: Spark has more raw compute muscle, while the Mac Studio can move data around much faster. EXO 1.0, currently in early access, blends the two into a single inference pipeline, and it apparently works shockingly well.

 




To understand how, you need to know that LLM inference has two distinct phases: first, the prefill stage, when the model reads and processes the user's prompt. This part is compute-bound, meaning it benefits from powerful GPUs like the Blackwell part in the DGX Spark. The decode phase follows, generating tokens one by one. That step is heavily bandwidth-bound, making the M3 Ultra's super-wide memory bus ideal. EXO's trick is to divide those phases between machines, streaming the model's internal data (called the KV cache) layer by layer so the two systems can work simultaneously instead of waiting on each other.

 




In EXO's benchmark with Meta's Llama-3.1 8B model, the hybrid setup achieved nearly a threefold speedup over the Mac Studio alone — matching the DGX Spark's prefill speed while keeping the M3 Ultra's quick generation time. The result is a 2.8× overall gain, and that was with an 8K-token prompt on a relatively modest 8B model. Longer prompts or larger models should see even greater gains.

This kind of ""disaggregated inference"" isn't exactly a novelty, but it's still very clever. It hints at a future where AI performance scales not by buying one massive accelerator, but instead by more intelligently orchestrating the hardware you already have. NVIDIA seems to agree: its upcoming Rubin CPX platform will use compute-dense Rubin CPX processors for the context-building prefill stage while standard Rubin chips with huge HBM3e memory bandwidth handle the decode stage—he same principle EXO is already demonstrating on off-the-shelf hardware.

 




EXO's early-access release is still in the experimental stages. The current open-source version (0.0.15-alpha) dates back to March 2025, and the full 1.0 build — with automated scheduling, KV streaming, and heterogeneous optimizations — isn't public yet. It's not plug-and-play software for consumers, at least not yet; for now, it's a research-grade tool proving that disaggregated inference can deliver real gains.

Even so, it's an exciting proof of concept. By making intelligent use of mixed hardware, EXO shows that high-performance AI doesn't have to be monopolized by data centers. It's enough to make you wonder about the potential of the devices sitting around your office.

PYUSD stablecoin is marketed as being ‘fully backed by US dollar deposits, US treasuries, and similar cash equivalents.'


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Even in 2025, some aspects of cryptocurrency seem rather risky, despite assurances that certain coins are fully backed, stable, and secure. A hair-raising case in point hitting the newswires today is provided by PayPal's crypto partner Paxos, which accidentally minted $300 trillion PYUSD a few hours ago. This so-called ‘stablecoin' is said to be “fully backed by US dollar deposits, US treasuries, and similar cash equivalents.” Despite that pledge, there is no way that such a gargantuan sum was backed by anyone or anything, as it is roughly equivalent to “more than double the world's estimated total GDP,” reports CNBC.

 




An official Paxos newsroom release or blog post hasn't yet been prepared to provide insight into this fat-finger error by the ‘PayPal USD' crypto issuer. This seems to go against the firm's transparency pledges, but perhaps someone is still busy typing out the full details of what caused this error. For now, we have to do with a brief, dismissive social media statement from Paxos, as embedded below.

At 3:12 PM EST, Paxos mistakenly minted excess PYUSD as part of an internal transfer. Paxos immediately identified the error and burned the excess PYUSD. This was an internal technical error. There is no security breach. Customer funds are safe. We have addressed the root…October 15, 2025

“At 3:12 PM EST [October 15], Paxos mistakenly minted excess PYUSD as part of an internal transfer,” reads the intro of the brief statement. “Paxos immediately identified the error and burned the excess PYUSD.” It would be interesting to have a measure of the firm's definition of ‘immediately.' However, according to cryptowatchers on platforms like Etherscan, the $300 trillion error persisted for roughly 20 minutes.

Paxos went on to unapologetically dismiss concerns over the gigantic financial blunder. ""This was an internal technical error. There is no security breach. Customer funds are safe,"" it asserted. ""We have addressed the root cause,"" the firm concluded, as a way of reassurance.

The vast sum central to this error bears no relation to the power of PayPal to cover a 1:1 exchange into USD. Market data shows that PYUSD actually has a market capitalization of ~$2.6 billion. It is currently the sixth-largest stablecoin and is set to prosper, as this type of value-backed crypto is becoming more established and broadly supported by banks and payment platforms.

Edited by Anushree Chaphalkar

 October 16, 2025  

Use of long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics for schizophrenia was associated with a 29% lower incidence of relapse and a 77% lower risk for all-cause mortality than oral antipsychotic use, a new study showed. Additionally, second-generation LAIs were linked to a significantly lower risk for disease relapse than first-generation LAIs.

“Overall, LAI antipsychotics, especially second-generation medications, could be more broadly considered for long-term use among this population, particularly at an early stage of disease,” the investigators wrote.

The author of an accompanying editorial wrote, “These results might help advance the use of LAI antipsychotics among older individuals with schizophrenia. However, given the increased likelihood of severe adverse events in this population, multiple, large, high-quality, prospective studies among ethnically diverse populations will be needed before the widespread and standard use of LAI antipsychotics among these individuals.”

This study was led by Yue Wei, PhD, Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health, Hong Kong Science Park, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China. The editorial was authored by Rajesh R. Tampi, Creighton School of Medicine, Omaha, Nebraska. Both were published online on September 30 in The Lancet Psychiatry.

This study did not account for antipsychotic dosages because of the different recording methods between LAI and oral medications in the database. Individuals with lived experience of schizophrenia were not included in the study design or conduct. Additionally, this study only included patients in the local public healthcare system, potentially missing those who sought care solely in the private sector.

This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Several investigators reported having financial or other ties with various organizations, including pharmaceutical companies. Full details were provided in the original article.

COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Cristian Roldan and Haji Wright got U.S. men's soccer coach Mauricio Pochettino's attention eight months ahead of the World Cup.

Given his first start in 13 months, Wright scored in the 33rd and 51st minutes off passes from Roldan to spark the Americans to their first comeback win under Pochettino in a 2-1 victory over Australia in exhibition match Tuesday night at Dick's Sporting Goods Park.

""That is what we expect when you give the opportunity to the player,"" Pochettino said. ""A player that performs like today, Haji, can be close. It's possible to be involved.""

Wright, 27, plays for Coventry in England, where leads the second-tier League Championship with eight goals. He has 11 goals in 13 games for club and country since August.

He scored the U.S. goal in the round of 16 at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar but hadn't started for the Americans since a friendly in September 2024 under interim coach Mikey Varas, a month before Pochettino took over.

Wright, who has seven goals in 19 international appearances, had never before scored for the U.S. in a game he started.

""They're putting me in positions to show what I can do and they're allowing me to be expressive in the field,"" he said of Pochettino and Coventry manager Frank Lampard. ""I'm not just stuck in the No. 9 as a typical striker. I'm allowed to move and be free-flowing.""

Folarin Balogun, the other top U.S. forward, scored the tying goal against Ecuador in a 1-1 draw last Friday in Austin, Texas.

""Picked up off where Flo was last game,"" defender Chris Richards said.

Roldan, a member of the 2022 World Cup roster who didn't get into a game in Qatar, returned to the national team last month as a late addition, a week after the September roster had been announced. He had not been with the national team since the CONCACAF Gold Cup in July 2023.

""My wife and I kept saying that we believe that we can make a late run, make a late push, and hopefully I'm making my case,"" Roldan said.

He was a 62nd-minute minute substitute in the 2-0 loss to South Korea on Sept. 6, went the distance in the 2-0 win over Japan three days later, entered in the 73rd minute against Ecuador and played until the 76th against Australia.

""Pochettino has done a great job of making me feel confident and comfortable here,"" Roldan said, ""and so just proud to be part of this, and hopefully I'm part of the next camp.""

Roldan, 30, has made 41 international appearances and impressed Pochettino with his play for the Seattle Sounders of Major League Soccer this summer.

""We need players with confidence, with self-belief, with a little bit of arrogance, with a little bit the being naughty, being competitive,"" Pochettino said. ""Maybe Cristian Roldan is an example of how if you want to build your perfect player, he has a little bit of everything.""

""I don't say that he's going to be in the next roster or is going to be in the World Cup, but I think at the moment or so far, after last camp and now, it's a player that we wanted to give the opportunity, we gave the opportunity and look what is going on.""

Pochettino also said he is thinking ahead to the 2030 World Cup cycle, even though it is after his contract ends.

""It's our responsibility to create some legacy or to try to create some core of players that behave in the same way and feel in the same way, respect the values that we were talking about, culture and everything,"" he said, ""maybe to have this core of players that they can that can arrive in 2030 in a different situation (than) that was this World Cup.""

After struggling for much of his first year in charge, the U.S. has put together a three-game unbeaten streak. The Americans will co-host next year's World Cup with Canada and Mexico.

""I am pleased, but I wanted more,"" Pochettino said. ""I wanted to perform better. I wanted to see individual players doing better. But that is my competitive blood.""

Australia went ahead after Jordan Bos bounced a throw-in that James Sands tried to clear only for the ball to spin into the penalty area. Bos chested the ball to himself, split Roldan and Sands, then beat Richards to the ball and hooked it with his left foot past Matt Freese's outstretched left arm for his second international goal.

""When you arrive to the World Cup, you cannot concede this type of goal,"" Pochettino said. ""In the World Cup if you start the game in the way that we start and we concede a goal like this ... then it's difficult to have another chance.""

United States President Donald Trump threatened to change FIFA World Cup 2026 host cities if concerned by safety.

Share

Save

Organisers of the 2026 FIFA World Cup have dismissed concerns that United States President Donald Trump could move matches from cities he does not deem “safe”.

Republican President Trump said last month that he would consider moving games from Democrat-led San Francisco and Seattle if they did not cooperate with his immigration and crime initiatives.

He raised the issue again this week, this time targeting Boston and its Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu, suggesting he could appeal directly to FIFA boss Gianni Infantino.

John Kristick, who led Canada, Mexico and the United States's successful bid to jointly host the 2026 finals, emphasised that planning has been under way for nearly a decade and remains unaffected by political rhetoric.

“From what I'm seeing, there's been zero distraction in terms of the preparedness,” Kristick, co-head of global events at Playfly Sports Consulting, said.

“Tickets are already being sold. Hospitality packages have been sold for almost a year now.”

More than one million World Cup tickets have been bought so far, FIFA said on Thursday, with fans from 212 countries and territories snapping up seats.

FIFA previously said that the global governing body for football has the final say on whether to move the 2026 World Cup, but this week noted, “Safety and security are obviously the governments' responsibility.

“They decide what is in the best interest for public safety,” FIFA added.

“We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to successfully host and fulfil all necessary requirements.”

Ricardo Trade, CEO of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil Local Organising Committee, said the abundance of good stadiums in the United States would make the possibility of relocating games “feasible”, so long as it does not happen after the December 5 draw.

“In a country like the United States, where every state has large, ready-to-use stadiums, I don't see why it wouldn't be possible,” said Trade, who also served as CEO of the CONMEBOL Copa America 2024 in the US.

New York and New Jersey, responsible for eight games, including the final, have maintained their focus, said NYNJ Host Committee CEO Alex Lasry, with daily fan festivals planned across the country's biggest metropolitan region.

“We've spoken to FIFA, we're working with the White House Task Force, I don't think there's any worry about the games being moved,” said Lasry.

“I have no concern, but if you know, anyone wants to move games, from Chicago to here or from anywhere to here, we're more than excited to have more games.”

Hello! That spare $12bn you find down the back of the sofa later — why not spend it on the world's biggest football club?

On the way:

💰 Are Real Madrid for sale?

🌡️ Poch, Pulisic and the weather

🤩 Lily Yohannes, from downtown

⛔ Coaches rejecting Rangers

Real Madrid are an investment dream. Their annual revenue clears €1bn (£870m; $1.2bn) and is unrivalled in world football. Historically, they have bossed the Champions League, with 15 European Cups and counting. Their global fanbase is as big as global fanbases get.

If they belonged to you, you'd cling to them at all costs. If you were in the market to acquire a top-end sports club, you would jump at the chance to buy into them. Except buying Madrid is impossible because the Spanish giants have never been for sale. Since the club's formation in 1902, Real Madrid, like their rivals Barcelona, have been owned by ‘socios', or club members, who number around 100,000 today.

So while oil-rich states acquired Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City, and the Premier League boomed with equity funding from the United States, the biggest team on the planet remained beyond the clutches of private investors. That, however, might be about to change. Real Madrid, one of football's most famous brands, could soon be sold, at least in part.

Florentino Perez, Madrid's all-powerful president, has been talking about altering their ownership model for some time. A proposal inviting external investment is likely to be discussed at a general assembly meeting next month. Madrid, despite their vast earning power, want more financial clout, especially on the transfer front. It's an admission by Perez that their cooperative will one day struggle to keep up with clubs fueled by private money. If you can't beat them, join them.

Perez's precise plans are fuzzy. Dermot Corrigan spoke to people with knowledge of goings-on at the Bernabeu to ask how any change to the Madrid model is likely to look. The picture is far from clear.

The bottom line, in Perez's view, is that the socios arrangement risks holding Madrid back. For the first time, he wants to allow investors to purchase chunks of the club, creating scope for cash injections. Discussions have been held about dividing Madrid's football operations from their business operations and letting speculators invest in the latter — although how (or if) that would work in practice is a moot point.

What Perez, above, won't countenance, seemingly, is ownership of the entire club passing into private hands, like City or PSG. He plans to retain the socios tradition in some form. That sounds a little fanciful. Madrid are hugely attractive with an estimated value of up to $11.7bn — not far off the Dallas Cowboys, the most valuable NFL franchise. Once investors get their teeth into them, they'll only try to take a bigger bite. This is one to follow and trust us, the investment world is watching.

Part of the rationale for Major League Soccer adopting a summer season was the diversity of the climate in the United States. You can bake on the southern border but freeze up north, and MLS has franchises at both extremes of the spectrum.

Mauricio Pochettino saw the contrast this week when the USMNT swerved from one friendly in sunny Austin to another in relatively chilly Denver. The temperature change — a drop of 20C/35F Poch said — was cited as a ‘massive risk' for injuries by the USMNT head coach after a 2-1 win in which Christian Pulisic suffered a muscle strain.

Leave aside for a moment the fact that tackles from Australia were flying in. (Pulisic, above, limped off after being brought down by one, and Chris Richards later said: “They're lucky it was a friendly. If the ref didn't give me a s*** yellow, I probably would have killed someone.”) Did Pochettino have a point, and should U.S. Soccer have been more careful with its scheduling?

It feels like a stretch — and Phil Buckingham spoke to an expert to check the theory. Pulisic came into the camp carrying an injury, and the conditions in Denver weren't Arctic. Given that the host cities for next year's World Cup stretch from Vancouver to Mexico City, adapting to different climates will be essential.

The issue boils down to Pulisic himself — and the importance of maintaining the health of a star who is not exactly new to fitness worries.

This should be a plum managerial job. Sure, Rangers have had fallow times in Scotland since their collapse in 2012 and once you get among the weeds, it doesn't look too pretty — but Ibrox still holds a certain appeal.

But after sacking Russell Martin, Rangers' decision-makers have found the gig has all the magnetism of aluminium. Steven Gerrard turned it down, even though he knows the club and won the title there previously. Perhaps knowing the club didn't help. Now Danny Rohl — unattached after quitting Sheffield Wednesday — has dropped out of contention too.

It reflects poorly on Rangers but it's also a window into the minds of out-of-work coaches, some of whom don't need to rush back into a job. In deciding on their next move, they can be choosy. Here's what Graham Potter said when he was asked about the Sweden vacancy: “I'm in a very good position financially. I don't have to consider finances as a reason to take a job or not.” After pay-offs from Chelsea and West Ham United, ain't that the truth?

It's impossible to say how high Lily Yohannes' ceiling is. Maybe she doesn't have one. She was starting in the Champions League at 16 and if there's any doubt about her world-class credentials, she knocked them out of the park by scoring a lob from the parking lot in OL Lyonnes' win against St Polten last night.

United States President Donald Trump threatened to change FIFA World Cup 2026 host cities if concerned by safety.

Share

Organisers of the 2026 FIFA World Cup have dismissed concerns that United States President Donald Trump could move matches from cities he does not deem “safe”.

Republican President Trump said last month that he would consider moving games from Democrat-led San Francisco and Seattle if they did not cooperate with his immigration and crime initiatives.

He raised the issue again this week, this time targeting Boston and its Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu, suggesting he could appeal directly to FIFA boss Gianni Infantino.

John Kristick, who led Canada, Mexico and the United States's successful bid to jointly host the 2026 finals, emphasised that planning has been under way for nearly a decade and remains unaffected by political rhetoric.

“From what I'm seeing, there's been zero distraction in terms of the preparedness,” Kristick, co-head of global events at Playfly Sports Consulting, said.

“Tickets are already being sold. Hospitality packages have been sold for almost a year now.”

More than one million World Cup tickets have been bought so far, FIFA said on Thursday, with fans from 212 countries and territories snapping up seats.

FIFA previously said that the global governing body for football has the final say on whether to move the 2026 World Cup, but this week noted, “Safety and security are obviously the governments' responsibility.

“They decide what is in the best interest for public safety,” FIFA added.

“We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to successfully host and fulfil all necessary requirements.”

Ricardo Trade, CEO of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil Local Organising Committee, said the abundance of good stadiums in the United States would make the possibility of relocating games “feasible”, so long as it does not happen after the December 5 draw.

“In a country like the United States, where every state has large, ready-to-use stadiums, I don't see why it wouldn't be possible,” said Trade, who also served as CEO of the CONMEBOL Copa America 2024 in the US.

New York and New Jersey, responsible for eight games, including the final, have maintained their focus, said NYNJ Host Committee CEO Alex Lasry, with daily fan festivals planned across the country's biggest metropolitan region.

“We've spoken to FIFA, we're working with the White House Task Force, I don't think there's any worry about the games being moved,” said Lasry.

“I have no concern, but if you know, anyone wants to move games, from Chicago to here or from anywhere to here, we're more than excited to have more games.”

FIFA has backed away from a potential conflict with President Donald Trump over his assertion that he could move some of next summer's World Cup matches out of U.S. cities he deemed unsafe.

In suggesting earlier this week that parts of Boston had been ""taken over"" by recent unrest, Trump said FIFA president Gianni Infantino would ""very easily"" move 2026 World Cup matches away from designated host cities if he asked him to.

In response, FIFA conceded that host countries are ultimately responsible for making sure their World Cup venues are safe.

""Safety and security are the top priorities at all FIFA events worldwide. Safety and security are obviously the governments' responsibility, and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety,"" a FIFA spokesperson said in a statement.

Earlier in the day, Boston mayor Michelle Wu implied the city was ready for a faceoff with Trump if he tried to move the matches scheduled for Gillette Stadium in nearby Foxborough.

""Much of it is locked down by contract so that no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it,"" Wu said on the ""Java with Jimmy"" show. ""We are going to continue to be who we are and that means, unfortunately, we are going to continue to be in a conversation in a way that is targeting Boston's values.""

The United States is scheduled to host 78 of 104 matches in the 2026 World Cup, expanded to 48 teams for the first time. FIFA had no comment on any of the cities or stadiums mentioned by Trump.

Trump also suggested that he would consider moving the 2028 Summer Olympics out of Los Angeles for similar reasons.

""If I thought L.A. was not going to be prepared properly, I would move it to another location if I had to.""

Felix Auger-Aliassime survived a major test from Damir Dzumhur on Thursday at the BNP Paribas Fortis European Open in Brussels, where he prevailed in a third-set tie-break to reach the quarter-finals.

The Canadian recovered from squandering three match points on return at 5-4 in the third set, eventually advancing 7-6(3), 4-6, 7-6(5) after two hours and 54 minutes. He now leads the Bosnian star 2-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

""I am feeling good and better now the match is over and I won,"" said Auger-Aliassime, who is 38-20 on the year according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. ""It was a tough day for different reasons and you just have to fight and get through. It was three hours but a lot of fun.""

Auger-Aliassime has fond memories competing in Belgium, having won the title in Antwerp in 2022 before the ATP 250 event relocated to Brussels in 2025. The 25-year-old has been close to his best in recent months, reaching the semi-finals at the US Open and the quarter-finals at ATP Masters 1000 events in Cincinnati and Shanghai.

With his latest win, Auger-Aliassime cemented his spot in 10th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. He is on 2,955 points, trailing eighth-placed Lorenzo Musetti by 480 points. Musetti is in action later on Thursday in Brussels. Auger-Aliassime, who is chasing his second appearance at the Nitto ATP Finals, will play Botic van de Zandschulp or American qualifier Eliot Spizzirri in the last eight.



In the opening match of the day, Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard advanced to the quarter-finals after Nikoloz Basilashvili was forced to retire. The fifth-seeded Frenchman led Basilashvili 7-5 when play was halted at the ATP 250. Mpetshi Perricard will next meet Musetti or Yannick Hanfmann.

Shang Juncheng has won September's Hot Shot of the Month award for his stylish play under pressure at the China Open.

Competing in his home city of Beijing, the 20-year-old pulled off a behind-the-back stunner to stay alive in a crucial point late in the third set against Arthur Cazaux. The Chinese star followed up the perfectly executed trick shot with a forehand winner, bringing the home fans to their feet as he soaked in the applause.




The clutch point brought up two break chances at 15/40 as Cazaux served for the opening-round match, though Shang was unable to claim either in an eventual 6-0, 6-7(5), 5-7 defeat.

With the award, Shang joins the likes of Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz on the fan-voted winners list. Stay tuned for more electrifying hot shots throughout the ATP Tour season.

Her credits included two turns on Broadway and the films ‘Valentino,' ‘Endless Love' and ‘Heathers.'


							By 

	Mike Barnes


Senior Editor


	Penelope Milford, who received an Oscar nomination for her supporting turn as Jane Fonda's bohemian roommate in Hal Ashby's Coming Home and portrayed a silent-film star in Ken Russell's Valentino, has died. She was 77.


	Milford died Tuesday in a rehabilitation facility in Kingston, New York, her sister, Candace Saint, and brother, Douglas Milford, told The Hollywood Reporter. She had been in a car accident in July.




	Milford, who appeared twice on Broadway early in her career, also played the fiancée of Don Murray's character in Franco Zeffirelli's Endless Love (1981) and was the hippie Westerburg High School guidance counselor Pauline Fleming in Michael Lehmann's Heathers (1988).

	In Coming Home (1978), Milford portrayed Vi Munson, whose brother (Robert Carradine) has just returned home after just two weeks in Vietnam with severe emotional problems. Her friendship with Fonda's Sally Hyde leads her roommate to volunteer at a Veterans Administration hospital.

	The effervescent Milford landed one of Coming Home's four acting Oscar nominations, with Fonda and Jon Voight winning the best actress and best actor prizes and Bruce Dern getting nominated for his supporting turn. (Milford would lose out to Maggie Smith of California Suite.)


	In 1977, she played silent-film star Lorna Sinclair in Valentino and shared a nude sex scene with Rudolph Nureyev in the biopic.

	











	Born in St. Louis on March 23, 1948, Penelope Dale Milford graduated from New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois. In New York, she studied acting with Wynn Handman at the American Place Theatre.


	She made her big-screen debut as an extra in Maidstone (1970), written and directed by Norman Mailer, then appeared with Richard Gere in an off-Broadway production of the musical Long Time Coming and a Long Time Gone.


	In 1972, Milford joined the Broadway cast of Lenny, starring Sandy Baron as comedian Lenny Bruce, and three years later landed a Drama Desk nomination for her performance in the long-running Civil War musical Shenandoah. In his review of the latter, Clive Barnes in The New York Times called her “fetching” and noted that she “sang with spirit.”


	Her résumé also included the films Man of a Swing (1974), The Last Word (1979), Take This Job and Shove It (1981), Cold Justice (1991), Normal Life (1996) and Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1996) and four acclaimed telefilms: 1980's Seizure: The Story of Kathy Morris, starring Leonard Nimoy, and The Oldest Living Graduate, starring Henry Fonda; 1982's Rosie: The Rosemary Clooney Story, starring Sondra Locke; and 1984's The Burning Bed, starring Farrah Fawcett.


	Milford also ran an art gallery in Los Angeles in 1985-87; taught acting; performed on local stages; and was active in the Woodstock Christian Science church. She moved to Saugerties, New York, in 2003 to remodel a historic home.

	











	Her brother Kim Milford — Rocky in the original American stage production of The Rocky Horror Show and a singer in a band with guitarist Jeff Beck — died of heart failure at age 37 in 1988.


	She was briefly married in the '80s to poet Michael Lally. In addition to her sister and brother, survivors include three nieces and nephews: Ollie, Amari and Correll.

Susan Lang believes the heartbreaking track is about her son Jeffrey. 


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	Amid the glitz and glamor of Taylor Swift‘s The Life of a Showgirl, one song, “Ruin the Friendship,” throws listeners a truly devastating curveball as the pop star sings about losing a former classmate way too soon — and according to Susan Lang, the track is about her late son Jeffrey.


	In a recent Tennesseean interview published after the release of Swift's Billboard 200-topping new album, Susan shared how she felt after hearing track six on the record for the first time. The Tennessee resident's son attended Hendersonville High School with the singer, but he died suddenly in 2010 while studying biology at the University of Tennessee Chattanooga, according to the publication.

	











	“They were really good friends,” Susan said of her son and Swift. “That's rare these days. They hung out at her house a lot. They were always joking around with each other.”


	On “Ruin the Friendship,” the 14-time Grammy winner reminisces on a crush she once had on a friend back when they were both teenagers. The track is sweet and wistful until it takes a somber turn in the third verse, which finds Swift singing, “When I left school, I lost track of you/ Abigail called me with the bad news/ Goodbye/ And we'll never know why.”




	“It was not an invitation/ But I flew home anyway/ With so much left to say,” Swift continues in the final chorus. “It was not convenient, no/ But I whispered at the grave/ ‘Should've kissed you anyway.'”


	In the interview, Susan marveled at how bittersweet it is that “after all this time, [Taylor] hasn't forgotten about him.” 


	“She's keeping his name alive,” she added. 


	Arriving on Oct. 3, The Life of a Showgirl quickly became Swift's most successful album yet in terms of opening-week numbers. The LP sold more than four million copies in its first seven days, setting a new record for the biggest debut for an album ever in the modern era, beating out previous record-holder 25 by Adele.


	Swift has not commented on who inspired “Ruin the Friendship,” but fans were quick to trace the lyrics back to Jeff. One photo that's been circulating online shows a teenage Swift wearing a camo shirt and flat-ironed hair, posing next to her late classmate, who sports a backward baseball cap.

The Life of a Showgirl's 12 tracks drew more than 1 billion streams worldwide in their first week of release. 


													By
												

	Eric Frankenberg



Pardon the understatement, but it's been a busy couple of weeks for Taylor Swift. On Oct. 3, she released The Life of a Showgirl, and its gargantuan impact has spread across the Oct. 18-dated Billboard charts. The set debuted atop the Billboard 200 with record-breaking numbers, and its entire tracklist dominates the top 12 spots on the Billboard Hot 100. More, its unprecedented success is global.


	The opening track on Showgirl, “The Fate of Ophelia,” arrives at No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts, becoming the first song to simultaneously debut atop both tallies and the U.S.-based Hot 100 since Swift's own “Fortnight,” featuring Post Malone, in May 2024. It's a common theme across her many chart achievements that her biggest competition is herself. This is her fourth song to accomplish this global hat trick, in addition to “Anti-Hero” in 2022 and “All Too Well (Taylor's Version)” in 2021.


	Swift goes on to dominate the upper reaches of both global lists, owning 12 of the top 13 spots on the Global 200 and 12 of the top 14 on Global Excl. U.S. From 216.9 million streams for “Ophelia” down to 81.3 million for “Honey,” the album's 12 tracks combined for just under 1.4 billion official streams worldwide (1.386 billion) in the week ending Oct. 9, according to Luminate.


	That total is the second biggest one-week global streaming sum for an album since the charts launched in 2020. It follows – you guessed it – Swift's The Tortured Poets Department from last year, which garnered 1.76 billion clicks in its first week, while coming in ahead of 2022's Midnights, with 1.16 billion. That gives her the top three global streaming weeks in the charts' five-year history. Bad Bunny and Drake are the only other acts to clear the one billion mark, each of whom did it once.


The Life of a Showgirl's first-week streaming numbers are eye-popping, but even more so considering the album's relatively brief track list. At 12 songs, it's the shortest collection among the top 15 biggest global album debuts, presenting an uphill battle against projects with 15, 20 and even 30-plus songs.


	On average, the 12 songs on The Life of a Showgirl drew 115.5 million streams worldwide in their first week. That isn't just a record in the global-chart era — it's double the next-closest competitor. Swift's Midnights (20 tracks) averaged 57.8 million, The Tortured Poets Department (31) averaged 56.8 million, and albums by BTS, Drake, Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar and Olivia Rodrigo exceeded 50 million per song. Swift already owned this record, and its runner-up slot, and now she has improved upon it by 99.97%.


	Of Swift's enormous global total, 674.4 million streams (49%) are from the United States and 711.7 million (51%) are from beyond (with the Global 200 reflecting activity in more than 200 territories). Among the 57 albums that have totaled 250 million streams in their first week since the global charts' inception, that split falls just about in the middle, unsurprisingly. It's more international than almost all such hip-hop and country sets, but more U.S.-centric than Latin and K-pop records.

Film Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Even with his latest film Jay Kelly in the midst of award season following its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival, George Clooney not only appears to have lined up his next project but also another A-list star with which to share the screen. Sources tell Deadline that Clooney and Annette Bening are set to star in upcoming book adaptation In Love, based on Amy Bloom's New York Times bestselling memoir In Love: A Memoir of Love and Loss. The film will be directed by Oscar nominee Paul Weitz, who co-wrote the script with Bloom.


In Love is an illuminating, modern love story about two people who make an impossible decision together that honors their enduring commitment to one another.

	“Amy's memoir is a contemporary fable of love, wit and existential stakes. I can't wait to do it justice with this amazing cast,” says Weitz.

	Eddie Vaisman and Julia Lebedev (Rental Family, Bad Education) developed the project and will produce for Sight Unseen. Andrew Miano and Weitz will produce for Depth of Field. Clooney will also produce with Grant Heslov for Smokehouse Pictures. Sébastian Raybaud will produce for Anton.


	“I have been so lucky to work with Eddie and Julie, so lucky to write with Paul and so grateful that this story of lasting love gets to be told on the screen, in Paul's gifted hands, by two of the greatest actors in America,” says Bloom.


In Love: A Memoir of Love and Loss was named Time magazine's No. 1 nonfiction book of 2022 and included on its list of 100 must-read books. Anton is fully financing and representing international rights. U.S. rights are being co-repped by Anton and CAA Media Finance. 

	











Jay Kelly has earned Clooney rave reviews on the festival circuit and is sure to have him in contention this award season in the lead actor circuit. The film, directed and co-written by Noah Baumbach, will have a limited theatrical run beginning November 15 before it bows on Netflix on December 5.


	Most recently, Clooney earned a Tony Award nomination for his Broadway debut in Good Night, and Good Luck, in which he starred as Edward R. Murrow in the stage adaptation of his Oscar-nominated 2015 film he co-wrote with Heslov. Making history as the first live Broadway performance to be televised simultaneously, the show aired on CNN to a worldwide audience.


	Through Smokehouse, Clooney's most recent directorial project was The Boys in the Boat, which he both directed and produced for MGM alongside Smokehouse partner Heslov. That film was based on the bestselling novel by Daniel James Brown. Clooney and Heslov also recently produced the Showtime series The Agency, which just wrapped its second season.


	For Bening, the Oscar-nominated actor will be seen next in The Bride, directed by Maggie Gyllenhaal and starring opposite Jessie Buckley, Christian Bale, Penélope Cruz and Peter Sarsgaard. She also has the Apple TV series Lucky starring alongside Anya Taylor-Joy, and is currently filming the Yellowstone spinoff series The Dutton Ranch.


	Best known for directing such acclaimed films like About a Boy, Weitz created and ran the Apple TV series Murderbot with his brother Chris Weitz. The series premiered in May and stars Alexander Skarsgård.


	Bloom is the author of the novels White Houses, Lucky Us, Away, Love Invents Us and most recently the national bestseller I'll Be Right Here; and the short story collections Where the God of Love Hangs Out, Come to Me (a finalist for the National Book Award), and A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You (a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award).


	Next up for Sight Unseen is the Searchlight pic Rental Family, which had its world premiere at the Toronto Film Festival and screens tonight at the BFI London Film Festival. Helmed by filmmaker Hikari and starring Brendan Fraser, it will hit theaters November 21 via Searchlight Pictures.


	Clooney is represented by CAA and attorney Stephen Clark. Bening is represented by CAA and Gochman Law Group. Weitz and Depth of Field are represented by CAA, Untitled and attorney Alex Kohner. Bloom is repped by WME.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Claire Danes and Matthew Rhys are the cat, mouse, and The Beast In Me in new trailer","https://www.avclub.com/the-beast-in-me-trailer-claire-danes-matthew-rhys","Thu, 16 Oct 2025 16:53:00 GMT","

“Maybe I am complicit, but I am not a monster,” Claire Danes' character says in the new trailer for Netflix's The Beast In Me. That one line could serve as a thesis of sorts for a surprising number of Netflix's recent offerings. Between releases like the final season of You and Monster: The Ed Gein Story, the streamer seems to have developed an odd fascination with critiquing the cultural true crime obsession its countless documentaries on the topic undoubtedly helped to engender. At the same time, many of those releases seem to either perform the same sort of sensationalism they aim to critique (in the case of Monster) or blame the audience for watching at all (You). We don't know if The Beast In Me will fall into either of these categories as of this writing, but it certainly seems to be treading similar ground.

An official synopsis of the series reads as follows: “Since the tragic death of her young son, acclaimed author Aggie Wiggs (Claire Danes) has receded from public life, unable to write, a ghost of her former self. But she finds an unlikely subject for a new book when the house next door is bought by Nile Jarvis (Matthew Rhys), a famed and formidable real estate mogul who was once the prime suspect in his wife's disappearance. At once horrified and fascinated by this man, Aggie finds herself compulsively hunting for the truth—chasing his demons while fleeing her own—in a game of cat and mouse that might turn deadly.”

Danes and Rhys are supported by a killer cast (sorry) that includes Brittany Snow, Natalie Morales, Jonathan Banks, Hettienne Park, and more. As can be seen in the trailer, their characters also share a precarious sort of chemistry. “You had to believe that they were equally matched adversaries, best friends, and soul enemies. It was a really surprising love story, this wild, undeniable attraction of the mind,” Danes told Vanity Fair in a recent interview. “They kind of rescue each other. They find company in each other. These deeply isolated characters finally discover a really perverse friend.”

All eight episodes of The Beast In Me premiere November 13 on Netflix. Watch the new trailer below:

Longtime Hallmark star Yan-Kay Crystal Lowe is slowly coming to grips with the shock of being diagnosed with stage three breast cancer at 44, which she publicly announced on October 10, 2025. But perhaps even more shocking is how the beloved “Signed, Sealed, Delivered” actress and director found out. 

Lowe, who just began chemotherapy treatments, has posted two clips of interviews she recorded with fellow creatives Mary Cruz and Selina Kaye, the founder of Hollywood Casting Studio, to help process through the emotions and details of her cancer journey. 

“Finding out was insane…the way it happened,” Lowe captioned one video, in which she described receiving the jarring news while shuttling her kids to activities.

A post shared by Crystal Lowe (@officialcrystallowe)

In an essay by Lowe that was People magazine published on October 10, she wrote that in February, she noticed a “large mass” in her right breast, and intuitively felt something wasn't right. When a mammogram and guided ultrasound showed nothing irregular, her doctor simply called it a “mystery.”

A couple of months later, the mass was still present, Lowe wrote, noting that “it was changing in size and placement, and my confusion (and fear) kept growing. I didn't feel any pain, but my nipple became inverted, so I went back to the doctor.” 

By then, the mass measured 10 centimeters, Lowe wrote, and she underwent an immediate blind biopsy. Typically, patients later receive biopsy results from an oncology nurse or doctor, but in a video Lowe posted on October 14, she told Kaye that didn't happen. 

Instead, Lowe said, she received “a really weird phone call” from her doctor . It came while Lowe was with her three-year-old son at a restaurant, who was “running around like crazy while I'm trying to go get my daughter (at) dance, so it was a whole storm of things,” she explained, adding that answered her phone anyway and heard her doctor ask her “what's up?” 

“And I said, ‘What do you mean, what's up? You called me,'” Lowe smirked. “And she said, ‘It's bad.' And I was like, ‘What do you mean? I don't know what you're talking about.'” 

Lowe told Kaye what happened next was surreal: “She said, ‘Oh, you have cancer.' And I was like, ‘I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to stop you for a second. You're gonna have to call me back in like 20 minutes, and we're gonna have to rehash this 'cause I cannot function right now.”

A post shared by Crystal Lowe (@officialcrystallowe)

In the caption of the video Lowe posted about her doctor's jarring phone call, she wrote, “I later found out that my doctor assumed someone else had called me. It was a mess. Driving home, trying desperately not to cry in front of my children. My daughter knew I was off…they always know. But I held it on as much as I could.” 

Lowe continued in her caption, “I still ask myself regularly.. why? How? But as time passes those questions because more like…ok how do I work through? What lessons will I get from this? Why am I being forced to stop? And thank you body for loving me enough to make it clear that I had to go back for a second opinion.”

Friends and fans expressed their shock about how it unfolded, including actress Lauren Samuels, who wrote, “I cannot believe how this was communicated to you. You're so strong Crystal ❤️❤️”

Someone else wrote, “What a shocking way to find out Crystal. It must have been like an out of body experience for you. Of course, there's no easy way. I still remember to this day the consultant telling me that my husband had bowel cancer. Your openness about this terrible illness will help so many people so I want to thank you for all that you're doing 🤗😘”

In the caption of another video Lowe shared on October 13, seen above, she wrote that since her diagnosis, she's found many “amazing survivors” online who understand what she's going through, noting, “I've learned so much. I have heard so many wonderful stories from all of you guys as well. I hope my story helps people feel like they aren't alone. Sharing has helped me so much already. Thank you for listening to my story.” 

Lowe has just begun chemotherapy infusions, and wrote in her People essay that she'll also undergo a double mastectomy, radiation, and reconstruction surgeries. As of October 15, GoFundMe campaign set up for her by her “Signed, Sealed, Delivered” co-star and dear friend Kristin Booth has raised $9,800 of an $11,000 goal to help Lowe, since she can't work while undergoing treatment. 

What stage is it? Did she get a PET SCAN?

So very sorry you have to undergo all what's ahead praying all goes well. I lost my husband due to stage 4 lung cancer from working taking out  in a building owned by Phoenix corporation. The year before he was given a clear diagnosis. He could take treatment but it would be extremely difficult with constant pain and sickness, but might give him less than another 6-9 months. He decided against it and I lot him just a couple months later.
My suggestion is please everyone, get checked regularly and follow up constantly and get second opinion instantly. Don't wait.
My prayers are going out for you and all others with all forms of cancer for a speedy recovery and cure. 💕

Just a little over a month after it hit the market, Amazon MGM‘s United Artists has scooped up the rights to “Lizard Music,” which is the next film from Benny Safdie that will reunite him with Dwayne Johnson. Clearly the box office disappointment for their first collaboration “The Smashing Machine” did nothing to dampen the excitement for their next team-up.

“Lizard Music” though is even stranger, a book adaptation that concerns lizard musicians from outer space that will star The Rock as a guy in his seventies known only as Chicken Man, mainly because he has a beloved companion named Claudia who happens to be a 111-year-old chicken. The film follows a boy who discovers a secret late-night broadcast of lizards playing otherworldly music, opening him up to an entirely new world of wonder that leads him to Chicken Man, who is also aware of the lizard musicians and teams up with the boy in order to find this hidden society.

The book is from cult author Daniel Pinkwater and is from 1976, and Safdie is both writing and directing. 

 










Though this is just Safdie's second solo movie as a director without his brother Josh, this is something of a big break from A24, which has been the home for “Good Time,” “Uncut Gems,” and “The Smashing Machine” all before this. A24 also co-produced Safdie's series he co-created with Nathan Fielder, “The Curse” that aired on Showtime. It's unclear if A24 was also in on acquiring the package, but IndieWire understands Amazon MGM picked it up in a competitive situation.

Scott Stuber, who runs United Artists, has worked with both Johnson and Safdie before. The Rock has starred in a handful of mega Netflix hits, including one of the streamer's biggest hits “Red Notice,” and Safdie also appeared in “Happy Gilmore 2” at Netflix. Stuber is producing for UA with Nick Nesbitt, and Safdie will also produce for Out for the Count Productions, as will Johnson for Seven Bucks Productions, and David Koplan for Magnetic Fields Entertainment.

For Johnson, just after bulking up even more for “The Smashing Machine,” he's been slimming down (at least for his standards) in order to play the septuagenarian Chicken Man. Anyone who has seen him on the red carpet at Venice or elsewhere during the “Smashing Machine” awards campaign would notice that he looks a little gaunter than usual, and that is all by design. 

 










“The Smashing Machine” has been a surprise disappointment, a bigger swing by A24 in terms of budget that did not pan out at the box office. The film carries a $50 million budget and has made just $17.1 million at the box office in over two weeks in theaters. It's the lowest opening of The Rock's career by far and a letdown for a movie that also has serious awards ambitions.

“We are so thrilled to partner once again with extraordinarily talented Dwayne Johnson, as well as work for the first time with the amazing creator, writer, and director Benny Safdie, on ‘Lizard Music.' Everyone at Amazon MGM and UA is deeply inspired by their previous collaboration on the critically acclaimed ‘The Smashing Machine.' We are so excited to now collaborate with them on this imaginative, entertaining, and cinematic story; ‘Lizard Music' is a tale that feels both timeless and unique. We are very fortunate that they have trusted us to be their studio partners,” Courtenay Valenti, Head of Film, Streaming and Theatrical, Amazon MGM Studios, said in a statement. 

“I've been lucky enough to work with Dwayne and Benny on multiple projects and have seen firsthand their incredible talents and connection as artists. The world they've created together for ‘Lizard Music' is unlike anything either has done before, and we couldn't be more excited to bring this wonderfully imaginative story to life,” Stuber added.

 










“I couldn't be more excited to go on this journey with Amazon MGM studios and United Artists. ‘Lizard Music' is a book I read to my two sons and we were riveted by its imagination and wonder. I love Daniel Pinkwater as a person and an author; the idea of making a movie where everyone can join the conversation is both thrilling and beautiful. To go on this adventure with Dwayne and to be able to watch him transform and become the Chicken Man is just beyond… I can't wait,” Safdie said.

Back in August, former Pixies bassist Paz Lenchantin announced her return with a solo album, Triste. Soon after the news went live, listeners on Reddit and YouTube noted glaring similarities between the lead single, “Hang Tough,” and Chico Buarque and Milton Nascimento's Brazilian classic “Cálice.” It turns out the song's authors, Buarque and the Tropicalía legend Gilberto Gil, were listening, too. In August, the duo filed a notice accusing Lenchantin of plagiarizing “Calice,” as reported in the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S. Paulo. Lenchantin, who was born in Argentina, made no public comment, but the song has since been removed from streaming services and the album tracklist displays another song title.

Reached by Pitchfork through a representative, Lenchantin declined to comment. Her label, Hideous Human, will release Triste tomorrow, October 17.

	The first single from Big L's posthumous Harlem's Finest: Return of the King album is here. Today, Mass Appeal released “u aint gotta chance,” pairing Big L's bars from a 1997 freestyle with a fiery verse from Nas. The song, gradually crafted by seven people, is the first glimpse of what listeners can expect from the Big L album, which drops on Halloween. Big L's brother Donald Phinazee says the project is comprised of “mostly the updated songs from [2010's] Return of The Devil's Son and a few freestyles the team built into new records.” The Return of The Devil's Son album, spearheaded by Phinazee and SMC Recordings, was removed from streaming services in 2021 due to licensing issues. 


	The project, co-executive produced by Big L's estate and Royce Da 5'9”, is part of Mass Appeal's Legend Has It … series, following albums from Slick Rick, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, and Mobb Deep, with forthcoming work from De La Soul as well as Nas and DJ Premier. Of the song, Mass Appeal co-founder Nas tells Rolling Stone, “even though Big L's not here with us now, to get on the song with him is still pressure. He left an outstanding amount of serious rhymes. So just approaching it is like, ‘Damn, I wish we were doing this together, but it's still an honor to do it.'”

	











	Big L starts off “u aint gotta chance” with bars pulled from a freestyle on U.K. DJ Tim Westwood's show. The freestyle includes an alternate third verse of Big L's “MVP” single that he performed in London in 1997. He rhymes with characteristic fury and precision on the beat, rhyming, “Cash I got plenty, Microphones? Rock many/Everything I touch is in the top twenty.” 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Mike Herard, the head of Big L's estate (who helped craft L's 1999 posthumous The Big Picture album), says the beat came together in a six-step process: DJ Critical Hype created the a cappella, which was sent to producer G Koop, who programmed the drums around L's verse. Herard sent that skeleton to producer 2One2, who added the song's sample. Producers Al Hug and Zach Niess added layers onto the song's chorus, while DJ Rob Swift made the hook from Big L a cappellas. From there, the song was sent to album executive producer Royce Da 5'9” “for a few tweaks” before Nas jumped on.

	Nas follows L with his own multisyllabic bars, rhyming urgently about being “the first Carlito of rap — well after G Rap,” on a verse that masterfully references Big L's knack for horrific bars (“I'll hold your skull with my fingers in your eye sockets”) and penchant for two-syllable rhyme sprees. In the verse, Nas proclaims, “I kept the doors open in them surplus army stores in ‘94 and up for certain,” and notes, “This year is the year of disrespectful comparisons/They jack anything on the internet.” The bars certainly seem related to Harlem rapper Jim Jones' viral assertions that he surpasses Nas' cultural impact among younger generations. On the track, Nas references artists “making funny music, it's doodoo, caca,” and raps, “gun to your head, tell the truth: Nas the monster that live under your bed.” 


	But when explicitly asked about the verse and his thoughts on Jones' comments, Nas completely sidesteps the latter. “I don't remember my rhyme on the Big L [song]. I remember the line that I started with. I don't remember what I was talking about other than trying to tap into the era of me and L,” he says (Nas spoke to us on September 30 in a wide-ranging discussion). “It was about my experience and the pain of not having him here. My verse was totally focused on Big L. Anything else? If it's not music related, then it doesn't even … [it's] not even anything that matters.” 


	Regardless of who the verse may or may not be about, “u aint gotta chance” is a strong setoff for Harlem's Finest: Return of the King. The project comes after Herard became the steward of L's estate in 2020 and attained a proper accounting of what's owned by, and owed to, the late rapper. In 2021, he told Rolling Stone that he “didn't think [L's] legacy was being handled properly” in a report that chronicled him never being paid royalties by Columbia Records for his debut Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous, and L's brother Donald Phinazee selling The Danger Zone and The Big Picture to RBC Records co-owner Brian Shafton for $20,000 due to medical bills. Shafton later purchased Big L's rhymebooks from Phinazee for $14,500, promising to put them in a “rap Hall of Fame” — while also acquiring ownership of the books' “compositions.”

	Via text, Phinazee admits, “When I released Return of the Devil's Son back in 2010, I had just come home from prison in 2008. I didn't know anything about the music business back then, so I leaned on people I met who I thought were handling the parts I didn't understand.” He says that his work on Return of the Devil's Son was an attempt to preserve L's legacy, but he “didn't think much about the business side at the time.” Since then, he says he's learned “alot about estate law, producer agreements — and those damn samples.”


	Phinazee views Harlem's Finest: Return of the King as “a gift for the day-one Big L fans,” noting that dropping the Nas collaboration first is “only right” for fans. “[Big L] and Nas came up when emceeing was a full-contact sport — lyrically and in real life. They were young warriors who pushed each other, but it was all respect,” he says. “Like any code of honor, the living salute the fallen. That's what this movement is about.“

The unexpected smell of sweet lavender in the room, the eerie sounds of violin music playing in the distance, or that creepy feeling of being watched. There are a number of unsettling incidents that have happened at the White House.

America's most historic address, 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. in Washington, DC, is also arguably the most well-known haunted house in the United States. In one particularly well-known instance, presidents, first ladies, White House employees and visitors have all claimed experiencing ghostly experiences, hearing strange sounds and even encountering real apparitions while leaving the bathtub, according to History.com.

Here are a few of the odd ghostly experiences that former occupants, staff and guests have had while at the White House:

Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph view of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS.

Astronomers analyzing observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using the W. M. Keck Observatory have discovered further unusual features of our third interstellar visitor, and confirmed the presence of a rare ""anti-solar tail"".

On July 1, 2025, astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) spotted an object making its way through our Solar System. That's no surprise, given the name. What was unusual, and highly interesting, was that the object appeared to be the fastest object of this type ever observed, and had an eccentricity of between 6.1 and 6.2. 

An eccentricity greater than 1 means it is an interstellar visitor, the third we have found so far, and will leave our Solar System once more. It was named 3I/ATLAS to reflect that it is the third interstellar object discovered, as well as the team that found it in our skies. 

3I/ATLAS has been subject to (dubious) speculation that it is not a natural object. Astronomers have since been tracking the object, which was confirmed to be a comet due to its outgassing. Though there is little reason to suspect 3I/ATLAS is anything other than a natural object, it is of high interest to scientists and the public alike, having traveled alone through interstellar space for possibly 10 billion years.

In a new paper, which has not yet been peer reviewed, an international team of researchers analyzed the spectra of the comet, used to determine the elements present on the object and in its coma, as it was viewed by the Keck-II-mounted Keck Cosmic Web Imager on August 24.

""One avenue to understanding these objects is from cometary activity or lack thereof,"" the team explains in their paper, adding that the activity is caused by solar radiation heating the surface materials of the comet. 

""When a comet warms, its volatile ices sublimate, lifting dust off the surface and creating the coma. Sunlight excites these gas molecules, which then re-emit light by resonance fluorescence – revealing the composition of the volatiles. For Solar System comets, this provides a window into the primordial composition of the Solar System. Interstellar objects enable similar studies for otherwise inaccessible stellar systems.""

                  

By analyzing the spectra of light reflected off the comet, astronomers can figure out what elements and compounds it contains. We already have a few puzzles presented by 3I/ATLAS in this regard, with a previous paper finding it has an ""extreme abundance ratio"" of iron/nickel.

""Emission lines of FeI and NiI are commonly found in the coma of Solar System comets, even at large heliocentric distances. These atoms are most likely released from the surface of the comet's nucleus or from a short-lived parent,"" the previous team explained in their paper. ""The presence of these lines in cometary spectra is unexpected because the surface blackbody equilibrium temperature is too low to allow the sublimation of refractory minerals containing these metals.""

While the chemical ratios are unusual, perhaps this is to be expected from an object which may be a 10-billion-year-old time capsule from an earlier age of the universe. The main puzzle is how these metals ended up in the comet's coma.

“At the distances at which comets are observed, the temperature is far too low to vaporize silicate, sulfide, and metallic grains that contain nickel and iron atoms,” the team added. “Therefore, the presence of nickel and iron atoms in cometary coma is extremely puzzling.”

The new paper reports the clear detection of nickel (Ni) and cyanide (CN), as reported by previous observations, and weak/no detection of the presence of iron (Fe). In this work, the team was able to get a better spatial profile of the comet and its coma, mapping where the elements are originating.

""The Ni is more centrally concentrated than CN, with the majority of Ni flux coming from the innermost 2,000 km [1,243 miles] of 3I/ATLAS,"" the team explains. ""On the other hand, the radial profiles suggest that CN, though still concentrated near the nucleus, extends farther out into the coma.""

The team suggests that nickel, which spreads out to around 594 kilometers (369 miles) and far less than cyanide at 841 kilometers (523 miles), may be released by an intermediate ""parent"" molecule which is quickly broken apart by solar radiation.

""Metals such as Ni may attach to PAHs to form Ni+PAH molecules (e.g., Ni-naphthalene Ni(C10H8) potentially). These molecules are easily unbound by absorbing light and may produce centrally concentrated Ni, as observed in 3I/ATLAS,"" the team writes. 

As well as this the team found other mysteries, including that the production rate of nickel relative to cyanide is ""higher than 2I/Borisov and orders of magnitude above the solar system comet median.”

One particularly interesting aspect of the comet is that it has developed an ""anti-tail"" or ""anti-solar tail"", which is a tail pointed towards the Sun, backed up by the new paper. Previously, sometimes-controversial Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb caused controversy (see) by suggesting in a paper with colleague Eric Keto, ""This phenomenon, observed at a distance of 3.8 au from the Sun, is not common and possibly observed for the first time in 3I/ATLAS."" However, before you suggest aliens like Loeb, it is not entirely unheard of.

There are two different types of anti-tail. One is actually an optical illusion, caused by the position of the comet and the Sun relative to Earth. 

                                    

A second type – the one seen in 3I/ATLAS – happens when large grains are ejected from the comet, but do not get pushed away by the solar wind on the comet's Sun-facing side.

""While such a morphology is certainly unusual – given that dust tails are typically directed antisolar due to radiation pressure acting on dust grains – it is not without precedent among distant active bodies,"" a paper on the topic explains. ""Notably, Farnham et al. (2021) reported a similar sunward enhancement in comet C/2014 UN271 (Bernardinelli–Bernstein), which they interpreted as the result of the slow ejection of relatively large dust particles predominantly from the sunlit hemisphere.""

As always, more observations of these objects are needed to learn about them, and the environments they evolved in. We will learn more by looking for more interstellar objects, something that will hopefully become easier when the Vera C. Rubin Telescope begins searching the skies. When we do find more, we may even be able to catch up with them.

The study, which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, is posted to preprint server arXiv.

He has been writing for Collider for over two years, and has covered everything from Marvel to the Oscars, and Marvel at the Oscars. He also writes obsessively about the box office, charting the many hits and misses that are released weekly, and how their commercial performance shapes public perception. In his time at Collider, he has also helped drive diversity by writing stories about the multiple Indian film industries, with a goal to introduce audiences to a whole new world of cinema. 

Much has been written and revealed about the near-miraculous achievement of getting a television show off the ground. Anybody that is able to do so can consider themselves incredibly lucky; fewer can claim to have created a show that stands the test of time. And even fewer have gone on to create multiple hits. Damon Lindelof is one of them. Having burst onto the scene with the generation-defining hit Lost, Lindelof sealed his legendary status with two HBO classics: The Leftovers and Watchmen. The Leftovers recently debuted in several European territories, and instantly secured a spot for itself on the HBO Max global viewership charts. 

Starring Justin Theroux and Carrie Coon, the show originally debuted in 2014, and was tragically canceled after just three seasons. However, Lindelof was allowed to conclude it on his own terms. Based on Tom Perrotta's novel of the same name, The Leftovers was set in an alternate reality where 2% of the world's population mysteriously disappears in a single moment, leaving the ""leftovers"" to pick up the pieces of their shattered psyches. While the first season proved to be divisive, the second and third seasons were hailed as landmark television. Ultimately, the show gained a devoted cult following, and is now considered among the greatest of all time. The Leftovers has an overall rating of 92% on the aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with the third and final season having settled at a near-perfect 99% score. 

The Leftovers was acclaimed for its philosophical tone, and for its sweeping themes of grief, loss, and love. However, the show's cancellation remains one of the most controversial creative decisions that HBO has made in the last decade. It does, however, represent the struggle that it constantly had with securing a large audience. According to FlixPatrol, The Leftovers was the eighth-most-watched show globally on HBO Max on October 15. The leader board was topped by the Mark Ruffalo-led Task. 

Lindelof followed The Leftovers up with his ""remix"" of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' seminal comic book Watchmen. The show ran, as intended, for one season. However, HBO has left the door open for Lindelof to pick it back up if he so desires. Since then, he has co-created the Peacock series Mrs. Davis, starring Betty Gilpin. The show ran for an eight-episode debut season, and there are currently no plans to bring it back. You can watch The Leftovers at home, and stay tuned to Collider for more updates.

Ellie Cohanim, a former State Department deputy special envoy, joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss how Israel is taking action to secure the remains of the rest of the hostages and why she believes the terror group will be 'forced to comply.'

President Donald Trump sent a strong message to Hamas Thursday, threatening to ""go in and kill"" Hamas militants if the group continues attacks in Gaza.

""If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them,"" Trump wrote in a fiery Truth Social post. ""Thank you for your attention to this matter!""

The move comes after Hamas was seen on video publicly executing opponents in Gaza City's main square, despite Trump's peace plan.

Gazans previously told Fox News Digital Hamas fighters were reappearing in the streets and reasserting control, having issued an ultimatum giving Israeli collaborators until Sunday to surrender and seek amnesty.

Hamas has not yet fulfilled the conditions of Trump's peace plan, failing to uphold its commitment to return all deceased hostages to Israel.

For years, Amazon Web Services was among the first, and often the largest, line item on a startup's budget. The AI boom is upending that spending pattern.

Internal documents obtained by Business Insider reveal that AWS has flagged a ""fundamental"" shift in how startups are allocating their cloud budgets. Increasingly, they're delaying AWS cloud adoption and diverting spending toward AI models, inference, and AI developer tools.

Instead of pouring money into traditional cloud services like compute and storage, these companies are spreading costs across newer AI technologies that are easier to switch between, according to the documents.

""Founders tell us they seek to adopt AWS at a later stage,"" one of the documents warned.

This suggests a seismic shift is happening in the cloud industry. AWS's dominance was built on startups that embraced its affordable, scalable computing services as an alternative to running their own data centers. But the generative AI boom has ushered in a new era, a ""Cloud 2.0"" stack of specialized hardware, software, and tools. As startups use these new AI offerings first, and wait longer to spend on AWS, the cloud giant's once-firm grip on this lucrative ecosystem could begin to loosen.

To be sure, startups are not abandoning AWS entirely, as they still need its cloud services at later stages. However, their behavior highlights how emerging AI technologies are capturing early IT budgets in new ways and potentially locking in customers before AWS's traditional offerings come into play.

The internal documents cited in this story, marked ""Amazon Confidential,"" are from March and July. They were written by employees on AWS' startup business team, including a person who works closely with Y Combinator startups. The documents were also reviewed by AWS executives who manage startup and venture capital relationships. BI verified the identities of these people. Jon Jones, former VP of global startups and venture capital at AWS, is also listed on the March document as one of the business owners responsible for this part of Amazon's cloud operations.

In addition, at least three current and former employees familiar with AWS's startup business told Business Insider that the concerns expressed in these internal documents were still valid as of September. These people asked not to be identified as they're not authorized to talk to the press.

Before publication, an AWS spokesperson said this story was using ""old data to reach outdated conclusions."" Startups continue to build on AWS, including leading AI startups such as Perplexity and Luma AI, which ""recently chose"" AWS, the spokesperson added.

""AWS remains the top choice for startups to build because we offer the best core services as well as the most innovative and powerful generative AI offerings,"" the spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement. ""Early stage startups experiment with many services and technologies, but when it comes time to choose the provider they trust with the future of their organizations, they overwhelmingly choose AWS.""

""In fact, we're seeing growth in adoption of AWS as startups are looking to our depth and breadth of services,"" the spokesperson added.

Many AI startups now make their first technology purchases from AI model providers such as OpenAI and Anthropic, followed by newer developer platforms such as Vercel, according to one of the AWS documents. That means founders are putting off decisions to buy AWS services until later, often when they require advanced capabilities such as compliance and security, the document explained.

Among Y Combinator's 2024 cohort, 59% reported using more than three AWS services, down by more than four percentage points from 2022, according to the document from March. Meanwhile, 88% of these startups were using OpenAI's models and 72% were using Anthropic's. Only 4.3% said they were using AWS's Bedrock developer tool, which gives access to various AI models.

The AWS spokesperson said this metric is ""at least a year old, and it's not indicative of usage or adoption of AWS.""

Earlier this year, AWS compiled a list of the top 1,000 AI startups for Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, along with an assessment of whether they were building primarily on the tech giant's cloud platform, according to the July document. The goal: What does it mean to be ""all in"" on AWS in the AI era?

With cloud spending rapidly growing beyond ""traditional compute,"" storage, databases, and analytics, ""this question is getting much harder to answer,"" AWS employees wrote in the July document.

New AI categories of spending ""can represent the majority of a startup's cloud consumption and are much less sticky than traditional services, allowing rapid shifts across an expanding list of providers,"" they warned in the document.

The AWS employees cited three newer AI cloud services that were grabbing early spending from these startups: GPU training and fine tuning, GPU inference, and AI-as-a-service, according to the document.

GPUs are special chips that power generative AI. That's a contrast to traditional cloud services, which run on CPUs. Training and fine tuning are ways to build and improve AI models, while inference is how models are run. AI-as-a-service provides access to models and other AI tools, usually via application programming interfaces (APIs) and subscriptions.

The AWS employees cited AI coding startup Cursor as an example of these issues, according to the July document. Cursor's spending on ""traditional infrastructure"" was less than 10% of what it spends on newer AI categories, even though the startup is considered ""all in"" on the AWS platform.

The ""majority"" of Cursor's spending goes toward API calls to external AI models and ""neocloud"" providers that primarily sell access to GPU servers, the document noted. It didn't mention specific neoclouds, but some of these newer AI cloud vendors include CoreWeave, Crusoe, Lambda Labs, and Nebius.

The AWS spokesperson told Business Insider that the concerns around ""all-in"" customers were ""false,"" without providing further details. Business Insider followed up on Thursday to ask for more specifics, but didn't get a response. A Cursor representative didn't respond to a request for comment.

To be sure, these documents are from March and July, and AWS may have turned things around with AI startups in recent months. However, revenue growth from this key part of Amazon has lagged behind some other cloud providers lately, on a percentage basis.

In the second quarter, Google Cloud and Microsoft's Azure each grew more than 30%, year-over-year, while AWS grew 18%. Neocloud revenue has soared by more than 200% in the past year, albeit from a much lower base, according to Synergy Research Group.

""With Azure and Google Cloud Platform growing faster than AWS, the once-strong incumbent's market position may lead to three equal players,"" Theory Ventures' Tomasz Tunguz wrote in a recent blog post.

Still, it's early in the AI cloud battle, and Amazon has prodigious resources and advantages. The company maintains a close and promising partnership with Anthropic, having invested billions of dollars in the leading AI lab. In July, Morgan Stanley estimated that Amazon could generate $5.6 billion in revenue by 2027 from Anthropic's use of AWS cloud services. In September, Wells Fargo upgraded Amazon to ""buy"" based on its belief that Anthropic will enable AWS growth to accelerate in 2026.

Investors also say that AI isn't necessarily cannibalizing AWS's cloud revenue. Some of the money startups are channeling into new AI services likely flows back to major cloud providers that supply GPUs and other AI cloud infrastructure. Still, AWS risks losing ground if it can't capture those early customers as spending shifts, they said.

""AWS is still a step behind Microsoft and Google in driving GPU demand and the ability to sell add-ons to these customers,"" Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, told Business Insider.

CB Insights data shows AWS losing some ground among the 1,100 leading AI startups. Between January 2024 and September 2025, AWS captured 30% of that market, trailing Google Cloud's 38%, but outpacing Microsoft Azure's 7%. That marks a decline from the prior two-year period (2022 to 2024), when AWS claimed 33%, Google Cloud 34%, and Microsoft 9%. Roughly 25% of the startups said they used more than two cloud providers.

AWS' AI pricing strategy isn't helping it win startup customers either.

Earlier this year, AWS found that 90% of early-stage startups in Radical Ventures' portfolio were building primarily on rival clouds, citing AWS's higher GPU costs compared with competitors, according to one of the documents from March.

Following that discovery, Jassy and AWS CEO Matt Garman met with Radical Ventures' leadership to craft a new strategy aimed at better targeting the firm's startup investments and offering a more complete suite of AWS services, according to this document. A representative from Radical Ventures declined to comment.

The AWS spokesperson said Cohere, Datology, and Twelve Labs are AWS customers and are part of the Radical Ventures portfolio.

Neocloud providers, such as CoreWeave, which specialize in GPU-based computing, may be starting to emerge as serious competitors for AWS. One of the documents noted growing demand among customers for access to ""small increments of GPU capacity"" with pay-as-you-go flexibility, an area where AWS is at a ""disadvantage"" compared with neoclouds.

Frustration with AWS's pricing has also surfaced publicly. Gavin Baker of Atreides Management recently wrote on X that AWS had raised prices for Nvidia's Blackwell chips. In response, Chamath Palihapitiya of Social Capital wrote that Amazon had become ""too expensive,"" adding that his portfolio company, 8090, had switched to using chips from Groq, another one of his investments.

The AWS spokesperson told Business Insider that the company is ""always working to optimize products and services for our customers,"" adding that it recently cut the price of EC2 Nvidia GPU-accelerated instances by 45%.

AWS also acknowledged in one of the documents that there's a notable shift toward ""industry-specific AI adoption,"" exemplified by the growth of startups such as Harvey in legal tech and Lila Sciences in biotech. AWS expected this trend to accelerate as AI moves deeper into specialized applications and intelligent agents, the document noted.

The AWS spokesperson said the company is seeing growth across ""all AI startups,"" from foundational models to vertical and horizontal solutions leveraging AI.

Another challenge for AWS is its lagging reputation in AI, which is making it increasingly difficult to secure speaking slots for executives at venture-capital events and other industry conferences, according to one of the documents. The issue is particularly pronounced in the Bay Area, where many of those opportunities are concentrated, it stated.

""2.5 years post the launch of ChatGPT, AWS is still viewed as playing catch up in AI by many public/private investors, founders, and industry influencers,"" the document warned.

The AWS spokesperson told Business Insider this is ""false,"" without providing further details.

This skepticism isn't limited to private investors. During Amazon's July earnings call, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak questioned Jassy about perceptions that AWS is falling behind in AI and losing market share to competitors. Jassy's answer did little to reassure investors, and Amazon's stock slipped further during the call.

AWS is also struggling to identify and engage early-stage startups that later evolve into major cloud customers. One of the internal documents noted that AWS's VC-driven discovery model isn't well-suited to the rise of ""AI-native solopreneurs and bootstrapped teams."" To address this, the company plans to develop a data-driven prediction model to better surface promising startups early on.

""This blind spot poses increasing risk to cloud market share,"" it stated.

The AWS spokesperson said the company continues to engage founders as early as possible, in collaboration with VCs through programs such as AWS GenAI Accelerator and AWS Activate.

Several Amazon employees told Business Insider that AWS's startup leadership team lacks deep experience in the venture ecosystem, which may be compounding the problem. The challenge was underscored by the abrupt departure of Jon Jones, AWS's vice president of startups and venture capital, who resigned last month after a year in the role.

Here's the full statement from the AWS spokesperson:

EXCLUSIVE: Beyond their seminal pairing as Michael and Kay Corleone in The Godfather films, Al Pacino and Diane Keaton had a long personal and romantic relationship offscreen. Because of that, and the fact he is in Paris shooting a film with Luc Besson, it has taken Pacino a few days to wrap his arms around the passing of his dear friend. Pacino shared those feelings with Deadline this morning:


	I am deeply saddened by Diane Keaton's passing.


	When I first heard the news, I was shaken. Diane was my partner, my friend, someone who brought me happiness and on more than one occasion influenced the direction of my life. Though over thirty years has past since we were together, the memories remain vivid, and with her passing, they have returned with a force that is both painful and moving.
