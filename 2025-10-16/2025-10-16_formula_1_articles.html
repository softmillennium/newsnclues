                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Check out the odds for this weekend's United States Grand Prix, from pole position to the Grand Prix victory. Odds are provided by F1's Official Betting Data Supplier ALT Sports Data, are subject to change and are presented in decimal form: for every $1 wagered you would win the figure represented by the odds; so, if Verstappen is favourite at 1.50, you would win $1.50 for every dollar bet. Three races have passed since a McLaren driver took the chequered flag first, with Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris not looking quite as dominant as they were. The Aussie's record in Austin also leaves much to be desired, with one DNF and a fifth-place return in his two visits. Mercedes driver George Russell reminded us in Singapore what he is capable of at his best. While you can't discount his chances for top honours, this isn't a Grand Prix at which he has shone in his career; his best result here is two fifth-place outcomes in 2022 and 2023. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc returns to defend his Texan crown after a rocky season in the red car. He's only managed five podiums and remains win-less, but past performances at this venue may excite him. Leclerc has driven onto the rostrum twice in his last three visits. Podiums have eluded his team mate this year, as Lewis Hamilton remains without any after 18 rounds. Despite his recent run, he's popped onto our radar because Ferrari have put a car inside the top three in the previous three trips to this track. After a difficult run, Mercedes rookie Kimi Antonelli is finding his groove again with consecutive top-six outings. Carlos Sainz showed in Baku that he can still compete with the best, despite trading Maranello for Grove. Consistency hasn't been a strong point for Liam Lawson, but the Kiwi knows how to nudge his way into the top six. He's pulled it off twice in his past eight appearances. Racing Bulls team mate Isack Hadjar also has two top-six finishes to his name, one of them a brilliant maiden podium at Zandvoort, while another driver to look out for is Alex Albon â€“ a five-time top-six finisher this year. Double World Champion Fernando Alonso collected his seventh top 10 of the season in Singapore. Lance Stroll has also contributed five top 10s to Aston Martin's cause, with three of them coming in his last seven starts. The issue for the Canadian is consistency, which is highlighted by a 12.40 finishing average in his past five attempts. Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda has displayed signs of improvement in recent appearances, recording two top 10s in the last four rounds. Turning to the rookies, Ollie Bearman continues to quietly go about his business, snatching his second top 10 in four starts over in southeast Asia. Another youngster who we're tracking in this category is Gabriel Bortoleto. The Brazilian is a four-time top 10 finisher this season, earning all of them in his last eight Grands Prix. Piastri last took pole in the Netherlands, which is better than his team mate, Norris, who previously did it in Belgium. Norris has lifted the Pirelli Pole Position Award four times this season, and he earned the honour here in Austin on his previous trip. However, he is definitely an outsider to replicate the performance in Texas. If you're hunting outsiders, then Ferrari is worth a peek after producing the fastest qualifier in two of the past four editions. Austin also hasn't proven a happy hunting ground for them in over a decade, last putting up the winning car in 2012, which happened to be Hamilton's final triumph for the team. They also have history on their side, with three victories in Texas since 2021. Ferrari are the defending winners, but they haven't properly challenged for top honours since Monaco, when Leclerc had a shot at toppling Norris. Besides that, they've had to settle for the minor podium places and points. The last one arrived in 2019, courtesy of Valtteri Bottas.</p>
