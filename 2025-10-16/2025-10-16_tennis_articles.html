                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Felix Auger-Aliassime survived a major test from Damir Dzumhur on Thursday at the BNP Paribas Fortis European Open in Brussels, where he prevailed in a third-set tie-break to reach the quarter-finals. The Canadian recovered from squandering three match points on return at 5-4 in the third set, eventually advancing 7-6(3), 4-6, 7-6(5) after two hours and 54 minutes. "I am feeling good and better now the match is over and I won," said Auger-Aliassime, who is 38-20 on the year according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. "It was a tough day for different reasons and you just have to fight and get through. It was three hours but a lot of fun." With his latest win, Auger-Aliassime cemented his spot in 10th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. Auger-Aliassime, who is chasing his second appearance at the Nitto ATP Finals, will play Botic van de Zandschulp or American qualifier Eliot Spizzirri in the last eight. Mpetshi Perricard will next meet Musetti or Yannick Hanfmann. © Copyright 1994 - 2024 ATP Tour, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Shang Juncheng has won September's Hot Shot of the Month award for his stylish play under pressure at the China Open.

Competing in his home city of Beijing, the 20-year-old pulled off a behind-the-back stunner to stay alive in a crucial point late in the third set against Arthur Cazaux. The Chinese star followed up the perfectly executed trick shot with a forehand winner, bringing the home fans to their feet as he soaked in the applause.




The clutch point brought up two break chances at 15/40 as Cazaux served for the opening-round match, though Shang was unable to claim either in an eventual 6-0, 6-7(5), 5-7 defeat.

With the award, Shang joins the likes of Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz on the fan-voted winners list. Stay tuned for more electrifying hot shots throughout the ATP Tour season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>204 in the PIF ATP Rankings, won a title. Vacherot's girlfriend, Emily Snyder, explained that behind the scenes there were plenty more interesting moments that made the Monagesque player's movie-like run even more riveting. At the time, there was concern he had torn his ACL. But Vacherot was able to return to action a month later, competing in several ATP Challenger Tour events, including one at the Rafa Nadal Academy by Movistar at the end of August. Shortly thereafter, Snyder messaged one of Vacherot's best friends about his progress. “Shanghai doesn't know what's coming,” she wrote. Little did Snyder know what was coming. There was some uncertainty about whether she would join her partner in China because Vacherot was originally outside of the qualifying cut. After battling through qualifying, Vacherot joined his cousin, Arthur Rinderknech, in the main draw. Vacherot would play one day and then the next, Rinderknech would try to join him in the next round. On days when Rinderknech played, Vacherot and his team would sit in the Frenchman's box. The group included coach and half-brother, Benjamin Balleret. We would go all together to the [same] Italian restaurant because Arthur was only traveling with one other guy,” Snyder said. “For a lot of the other matches, Ben — Val's coach and half brother — would come, and he would sit and almost kind of be like a coach for Arthur, too.” It was Golden Week in China, so there were many people on the streets and it was difficult to find a taxi. The only method they had to pay for one was Vacherot's phone, which was down to five per cent. The next day Vacherot upset Bublik and his breakthrough tournament was becoming increasingly notable. 204 was playing at a significantly higher level than that. At the same time, Snyder faced a dilemma. Her transit visa was only good for 10 days and she had planned to visit a friend in Singapore. But as Vacherot continued moving through the tournament, Snyder cancelled flights day after day until he defeated Tallon Griekspoor in the fourth round. At that point, she needed to leave the country for an evening. “At 4 a.m. after he beat Griekspoor, we were sitting there and he was like, ‘Okay, you have to take a flight. “But honestly to some extent, it was such a routine that it had been happening so much that it was like, ‘Okay, what flight are we booking today?' And he's pretty calm in those situations. It's more so me, that I [was] panicked.” After traveling back, there was barely enough time to get back to site for Vacherot's quarter-final match against Holger Rune. “I think what helped the entire time. It was one match at a time,” Snyder said. “I've always asked him whenever we're watching other people play, I'll be like, ‘What would be going through your head at this moment? “He's like, ‘You have nothing to lose if you're down, whereas if you're winning, then there's maybe a little bit more pressure, a little bit more stress'.” That was a fitting mindset for Vacherot's tournament. He lost the first set in six of his nine matches and won them all. “The entire time Val was like, ‘I have nothing to lose. Vacherot never stopped, making history in Shanghai. Shortly after the final, Snyder told Vacherot she used the same toilet every day to avoid changing things up. “Then he tells me, ‘I'm not even kidding you, I used the same exact shower every single day, twice a day, same shower',” Snyder said. Everything led up to this moment… ⁰⁰Arthur & Valentin, what a magical story ❤️⁰⁰#ItAllAddsUp | #RolexShanghaiMasters pic.twitter.com/ortZfXbDIt They returned home to Monte-Carlo on Monday, more than three years after they met at a Monaco bar during the summer of 2022. Snyder was studying abroad in Barcelona — she attended the University of North Carolina — when she took a weekend trip to Monaco. Vacherot was only at the bar that evening because he was injured, struggling with a stress fracture in his foot. When they arrived at the local airport, Vacherot's family members and closest friends from high school surprised him. On Tuesday when they went for lunch, three people stopped Vacherot after watching what he had accomplished in Shanghai. “Even now that we're back, I don't think it's hit either of us fully, what actually has happened,” Snyder said. Val was supposed to go play five Challengers after Shanghai, which obviously that's not the case now.” No part of this site may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system or transmitted in any way or by any means (including photocopying, recording or storing it in any medium by electronic means), without the written permission of ATP Tour, Inc..</p>
