                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tightly contested markets on the platform have seen recent swings, particularly as users consider Bitcoin's next stop, Solana's chances for a new all-time high, and the race to $5,000 that's brewing between Ethereum and Gold. Here's a deeper look into some of the most-traded markets on Myriad this week. (Disclaimer: Myriad Markets is a product of Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.) The biggest crypto liquidation of all time wiped out $19 billion worth of positions last week, sending BTC tumbling below $106,000 for a time before it rebounded back above $110,000. Now changing hands at $1o8,673, predictors on Myriad are asked where it's headed next—$120,000 or $100,000. Inspired by a bet between crypto personalities Mando and KeyboardMonkey, the market has see-sawed back and forth in the last 24 hours, briefly flipping in each direction as predictors are largely split and uncertain about Bitcoin's immediate future. In Thursday trading, predictors have flipped from bullish to bearish, at one point giving $120,000 around a 55% chance of hitting. But as Bitcoin dropped further, odds flipped to favor the $100K side which now is favored at 54%. A recent Glassnode report indicates that a deeper contraction is at risk if BTC stays on the lower end of the $108,000-$117,000 range. The top crypto asset is hanging there for now as trade war uncertainty lingers. President Trump is scheduled to speak at 3:00pm ET today, potentially impacting crypto and broader markets. Solana has been underperforming its major crypto peers, dropping more than 13% in the last week and changing hands at $190.50 on Thursday afternoon. Despite some calls for an “epic end of year,” SOL is dipping further away from a new all-time high—and Myriad predictors are feeling less confident as well. With DAT accumulations slowing and no ETF inflows in sight (just yet), predictors put the odds of a new all-time high at just 34% at the time of writing. The government shutdown is likely playing a role in delaying expected Solana ETF approvals. That move has provided Myriad predictors with a new market which sets gold alongside ETH in the race to $5,000, asking which asset will hit the milestone first. As it stands now, ETH will need around a 25.5% move higher to hit $5,000. Meanwhile, gold only needs around a 16% boost to resolve the market. Since that time, odds have swung back around 8.5% to favor ETH. Analysts told Decrypt this week that the “debasement trade,” or the move to hard assets to hedge against fiat currency inflations, may have another decade ahead of it. As it gains speed, will gold be able to maintain its edge against Ethereum? ETH has fallen further from $5,000 while gold moves up another 2% in early Thursday trading.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has had a rocky first half of October so far. Bitcoin's descent was particularly notable against the backdrop of gold (GC=F), which has climbed to new all-time highs past $4,200 and is up 16% in the past month. Bitcoin, by comparison, has yet to recover from Friday's losses and is down 8% in that period. "Right now, capital is clearly favoring gold due to its momentum and reduced volatility profile," Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, told Yahoo Finance. "There are also structural buyers in central banks, which provides a quasi-backstop to the trade." Wall Street veteran strategist Ed Yardeni explained its precipitous drop last week in a note on Wednesday. "The crypto derivatives ecosystem exacerbated bitcoin's recent fall," Yardeni wrote. "During the abrupt drop, liquidity dried up, with over $19 billion in liquidations across crypto futures and leveraged positions." When prices dropped rapidly, platforms automatically closed risky trades to prevent bigger losses, he said. Read more: What is bitcoin, and how does it work? Crypto bulls entered October with expectations of a strong month, as the token has risen in 10 of the past 12 years, according to Compass Point Research. The cryptocurrency hit all-time highs north of $126,000 per token last week, along with precious metals that also hit records, in what Wall Street has dubbed the "debasement trade," or a hedge against weakening fiat currencies. Crypto analysts predict bitcoin will close out the year higher, with JPMorgan forecasting a price target of $165,000. Click here for the latest cryptocurrency news, prices, updates, and more</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This milestone paves the way for Erebor to operate as a full-service national bank, focusing on serving high-growth sectors like cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence, and defense technology. The approval, announced on Wednesday, is conditional, requiring Erebor to meet additional capital, operational, and compliance benchmarks before full operations can commence. Insiders familiar with the process note that this step reflects a thawing in regulatory attitudes toward crypto-integrated banking, especially amid evolving federal policies. According to reports from Business Insider, Luckey's vision for Erebor emphasizes robust risk management and innovation, positioning it as a bridge between volatile tech ventures and stable financial infrastructure. Erebor's journey to this point has been marked by strategic maneuvering. This network appears to have facilitated the approval process, underscoring how personal ties can influence fintech regulatory outcomes. Critics, however, question whether such connections could lead to undue favoritism, especially given Luckey's vocal support for former President Donald Trump and his involvement in defense contracting. Looking ahead, Erebor's approval could signal a broader shift in Washington's stance on crypto-linked institutions. The bank plans to offer services such as stablecoin facilitation, high-yield deposits for tech startups, and specialized lending for defense and manufacturing—sectors Luckey knows well from his Anduril work. Yet, challenges remain: meeting OCC's stringent conditions will require substantial capital raises, estimated in the hundreds of millions, and navigating ongoing scrutiny from agencies like the FDIC. One key hurdle is competition from established players like JPMorgan Chase, which have ramped up crypto services, and fintech upstarts such as Revolut. Erebor's digital-first approach, devoid of physical branches, could lower costs but heighten cybersecurity risks—a concern amplified by recent high-profile hacks in the sector. Posts on X, formerly Twitter, from users like Mario Nawfal reflect public excitement, with discussions framing Erebor as a “new era for crypto banking,” though such sentiment often overlooks regulatory pitfalls. Ultimately, if Erebor succeeds, it could redefine banking for tech innovators, blending Silicon Valley's disruptive ethos with Washington's oversight. With preliminary approval in hand, the real work begins: proving that a crypto-focused bank can thrive under intense regulatory gaze while delivering value to underserved entrepreneurs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Interest in XRP and XLM price has once again gone through the roof this week as investors look beyond short-term market trends towards projects that are building long-term utility. The renewed interest in the two tokens is part of a broader search for digital assets to combine scalability, liquidity, and global adoption potential. This is accompanied by a new DeFi project, Remittix (RTX), which continues to make headlines after it passed through major milestones in its presale phase. Stellar (XLM) is currently selling at $0.3262, after a significant increase of 0.57 % in the last 24 hours. Ripple's XRP, on the other hand, maintains steady momentum at $2.43, a 1.64 % daily gain, supported by a $148.37 billion market cap and $5.82 billion trading volume, down 29.07 %. Both XLM price and XRP movements indicate investors are adopting a longer-term approach rather than reacting to daily volatility. Many holders of these established assets are beginning to diversify into early-stage crypto investments that show practical use cases, and this trend has brought attention to Remittix, a cross-chain DeFi project gaining recognition for its real-world functionality. Following its $20 million presale milestone, Remittix announced its first centralized exchange listing on BitMart, followed by a second listing on LBank after reaching $22 million raised. Beta testing for the Remittix Wallet is already live, allowing users to test crypto-to-fiat transfers with low gas fees and instant settlements. The Remittix team is now fully verified by CertiK and ranked #1 among pre-launch tokens, confirming its position as one of the best crypto presale 2025 contenders. While XLM price and XRP consolidate in good support levels, market sentiment is shifting towards tokens that demonstrate active development and concrete output. In a hyped-up crowded market, RTX is a nascent crypto project created for adoption, trust, and usability — aspects that are appealing to both XLM and XRP holders seeking long-term value in both centralized and decentralized platforms.

The crypto market was dealt another grueling sell-off on Thursday, with several altcoins facing double-digit moves to the downside while BTC and ETH began to challenge critical levels of support.

The move appears to be a continuation from the weekend's $500 billion bloodbath, with traders now actioning more caution to avoid another potential liquidation cascade.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>North Korean state-linked hackers have begun using public blockchains to deliver malware and steal cryptocurrency, in what researchers say is the first known case of a nation-state adopting the technique. Google security researchers said on Thursday that they observed a Pyongyang-backed hacking group, tracked as UNC5342, deploying a method known as EtherHiding — a way of embedding malicious code inside smart contracts on decentralized networks such as Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain. The technique makes it harder to block or remove malware, since the code is stored on blockchain ledgers that cannot be taken offline or altered. Since February, UNC5342 has used EtherHiding as part of a social-engineering campaign that lures developers — often those working in the cryptocurrency or tech industries — into downloading malware disguised as job-related files or coding challenges. That code installs the JadeSnow loader, which in turn delivers a more persistent backdoor known as InvisibleFerret that has been used in multiple cryptocurrency thefts. Because the malicious payloads are stored on decentralized blockchains, they cannot be removed by traditional takedown efforts. Attackers can also quietly update or replace their malware by modifying the smart contract, Google said. Blockchain's pseudonymous nature adds another layer of anonymity, making it difficult to identify those behind the operation. Google said EtherHiding was first used in 2023 by a financially motivated group known as UNC5142, but this is the first time a state-sponsored actor has adopted it. The company added that while the hackers rely on decentralized blockchains to store their code, they still interact through centralized web services that defenders can monitor or block to disrupt attacks. “In other words, UNC5142 and UNC5342 are using permissioned services to interact with permissionless blockchains,” the researchers said.</p>

MegaETH has sparked fresh attention by opening registration for a token sale through Sonar, a launch platform created by Jordan “Cobie” Fish. Instead of allowing tokens to be sold without oversight or transparency, the Sonar approach focuses on identity, accountability, and meaningful participation. MegaETH positions itself as a “real-time blockchain” compatible with Ethereum. Its claim is speed and user ownership, not hype or exclusivity. The project already raised $10 million through Echo in December 2024, created its native stablecoin MegaUSD (USDm) with Ethena Labs, and laid out a structure for ecosystem incentives. The choice of Sonar as a launchpad adds another layer. Built to promote transparent token sales without the heavy influence of private venture capital, it emphasizes fairness and community engagement. The system is designed to slow speculation and prevent a race for short-term exits. Instead of rewarding those who farm for token allocations, the platform integrates mechanisms that focus on building participation over time. These tokens cannot be traded and function as digital proof of authentic participation. They are tied to a points system that avoids the “earn-and-dump” mentality common in airdrop farming. In a public statement shared in early September 2025, the MegaETH team criticized traditional airdrop systems for encouraging artificial use and draining long-term value. Soulbound rewards instead aim to recognize real supporters while discouraging opportunists. This approach signals a shift away from incentives that attract superficial engagement. Jordan “Cobie” Fish, widely known for his role in co-founding Lido, is associated with decentralized initiatives that reject aggressive venture dominance. The platform is self-hosted and promotes accountability as a way to repair reputational damage left by presale-driven launches. This renewed format arrives at a time when sentiment around early token access has shifted. Instead of two-tier systems where VCs receive favorable terms and communities get leftovers, Sonar is positioning itself as a reset point. Whether this model scales depends on adherence to transparency, enforcement of participation rules, and global accessibility. I recommend you do this asap for the MegaETH sale on Sonar, could be huge. There is also an X and Discord connection button that may play a role in your allocation. If MegaETH's token sale concludes successfully under these parameters, it may influence how future fundraising evolves. Crypto networks may adopt stricter alignment between contribution and allocation. Participants who engage through community channels, development, or governance may receive more weight in distribution models. Regulated yet open-access token launches could challenge VC-dominated private rounds. Instead of deals occurring behind closed doors, projects might blend compliance with inclusivity using identity verification and structured lockups. Binding recognition to community involvement instead of token flipping could change the way value flows in early-stage ecosystems. Real-time blockchain infrastructure paired with community financing may attract developers, especially as MegaUSD and ecosystem tooling mature. It marks the first real test of a new approach to token sales one that tries to fix the mistakes of past ICOs without shutting people out. Whether this inspires a wider comeback of community-driven token launches will depend on what happens after the sale begins. Success will require careful execution, clear oversight, and a positive response from the public once tokens are distributed. If the approach works, 2025 may not be remembered as a repeat of old speculation but as the moment ICOs were reshaped to fit a more regulated and purpose-driven market. What happens next will decide if this is a one-time experiment or the beginning of a long-term change in how tokens are introduced to the public.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In remarks at DC Fintech Week on Wednesday, deputy governor for financial stability Sarah Breeden said the Bank would “play the role of banker” to large, systemic stablecoin issuers, a move aimed at bolstering financial stability and confidence in digital money. Under the proposed framework, major stablecoin issuers would be required to hold most of their reserves as deposits at the Bank of England, while a portion could be invested in short-term UK government bonds to earn a limited return. Breeden also revealed that the central bank is considering providing a liquidity facility for these bond investments, allowing solvent issuers to quickly access cash to meet redemptions during times of stress. Breeden said the BoE's direct role would help prevent contagion risks between commercial banks and stablecoin issuers. “Holding deposits with the central bank mitigates the financial stability risks that could otherwise arise from interconnectedness between commercial banks and systemic stablecoin issuers,” she said. “It avoids the risk of rapid outflows from a stablecoin backed by commercial bank deposits creating funding challenges for the bank, and it avoids the risk of a bank failure calling into question the solvency of a stablecoin issuer, as we saw in March 2023 when Circle's (CRCL) USDC briefly lost its peg.” Read more: Is Wall Street ready to venture beyond bitcoin and into altcoins? Smaller issuers will continue to be regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The move comes as global regulators race to catch up with rapid developments in digital money and as the US accelerates its own plans under the Genius Act, part of US president Donald Trump's broader financial deregulation agenda. On Thursday, Lord Ed Vaizey, former minister for the digital economy and current co-chair of the UK parliament's Crypto and Digital Assets All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), called on the Bank of England to publish its modelling underpinning it's proposals to impose ownership limits of £10,000 to £20,000 for individuals and £10m for businesses on all “systemic” stablecoins. In a debate in the House of Lords on Thursday he said: “Given the Bank of England's announcement that it plans to regulate how much stablecoin an individual can hold, does this not send a terrible signal to people who want to base their crypto businesses in the UK, and would the government ask the Bank of England to publish their modelling?

The end goal of these efforts is to gain unauthorized access to developers' machines, steal sensitive data, and siphon cryptocurrency assets – consistent with North Korea's twin pursuit of cyber espionage and financial gain. Besides resilience, EtherHiding also abuses the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions to make it harder to trace who has deployed the smart contract. "This development signals an escalation in the threat landscape, as nation-state threat actors are now utilizing new techniques to distribute malware that is resistant to law enforcement take-downs and can be easily modified for new campaigns," Robert Wallace, consulting leader at Mandiant, Google Cloud, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News. The infection chain triggered following the social engineering attack is a multi-stage process that's capable of targeting Windows, macOS, and Linux systems with three different malware families - "EtherHiding represents a shift toward next-generation bulletproof hosting, where the inherent features of blockchain technology are repurposed for malicious ends," Google said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Everstake, the largest global non-custodial staking provider for institutional and retail clients, has achieved two new milestones in its security and compliance program: alignment with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF 2.0) and full compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Together with existing SOC 2 Type II, ISO/IEC 27001:2022, and GDPR compliance, these achievements make Everstake the first crypto staking company to hold all five certifications that define institutional-grade infrastructure. The independent audits were conducted by Prescient Security, a global leader in cybersecurity assurance. Everstake's five-pillar certification framework bridges this gap, aligning staking with the same security and privacy standards trusted by global financial institutions. Everstake has completed an independent NIST CSF assessment, with a Cybersecurity Maturity Score of 4.16. Global benchmarks indicate that only 4% of organizations worldwide achieve the “Optimized” level on NIST-aligned maturity scales, positioning Everstake among a select group recognized for its advanced, adaptive cybersecurity practices. This accomplishment reaffirms Everstake's ongoing investment in security, governance, and technology. A Level 4 score confirms that the company not only meets global standards but also proactively anticipates and adapts to emerging threats—enhancing resilience and institutional confidence. The California Consumer Privacy Act compliance further strengthens Everstake's data protection framework, bringing transparency, user rights, and privacy standards to the U.S.-based customers — complementing its GDPR protections for European users. Everstake is the largest global non-custodial staking provider for institutional and retail clients, trusted by over 1,000,000 users across 80+ Proof-of-Stake networks. Founded in 2018 by blockchain engineers, the company supports $7 billion in staked assets, delivering institutional-grade infrastructure with 99.98% uptime and zero material slashing events since inception. Its globally distributed team of 100+ professionals is committed to making staking accessible to everyone while strengthening the foundations of decentralized finance. Everstake's provision of technology services allowing a user to stake digital assets is not an endorsement or a recommendation of any digital assets by it. Users are fully and solely responsible for evaluating whether to stake digital assets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leo Schwartz is a senior writer at Fortune covering fintech, crypto, venture capital, and financial regulation. So-called DATs are businesses that acquire a hoard of a given cryptocurrency, from Bitcoin to Dogecoin, and seek to operate a publicly-traded vehicle that provides sell exposure to those assets in the form of shares. Lee first learned about Bitcoin while serving as the chief strategist at JPMorgan in 2012, starting his own research company Fundstrat a few years later and building a reputation as an outspoken Bitcoin bull when much of Wall Street was still skeptical. In June, he became a crypto executive himself, joining a little-known publicly traded Bitcoin mining company called BitMine as it sought to rebrand itself into the largest institutional holder of Ethereum. The software CEO Michael Saylor pioneered the approach with his company MicroStrategy, which began accumulating large stockpiles of Bitcoin in 2020, quickly becoming a way for investors to get access to the volatile cryptocurrency through a publicly traded vehicle, long before the approval of exchange-traded funds. Though Ethereum has at times struggled in recent years amid the proliferation of other blockchains and its own technical challenges, Lee argued that it is still the “blockchain of Wall Street,” especially as financial firms explore the implementation of stablecoins and different tokenized assets, many of them native to Ethereum. BitMine, whose market capitalization sits above $15 billion, holds over three million Ethereum tokens, or around 2.5% of the total supply, though Lee's goal is to acquire 5%. While investors have more options to buy top cryptocurrencies than when Saylor began accumulating Bitcoin for MicroStrategy, Lee argues that BitMine still offers advantages, from reaping staking rewards to being included on major stock indexes. “We're essentially a liaison between how Wall Street views future upgrades to Ethereum,” Lee said. That doesn't mean that digital asset treasury companies as a broader asset class will prove successful, especially as more launch to hold different types of cryptocurrencies, including so-called “alt” coins such as Sam Altman's Worldcoin. Lee pointed out that many DATs are trading below their net asset value, or the worth of their underlying crypto holdings, as an increasing number launch into the public market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Capita also made representations for its fine to be reduced on account of its “very small margins” and claimed that it “held to an alternative standard” compared with similar cases – an assertion which the commissioner did not accept. The firm's target response time for taking this kind of mitigating action is one hour. About half of the outsourcer's roster of customers for which it manages pension schemes – which includes many public bodies, encompassing central government, local authorities, NHS organisations and police services – were affected by the breach. “Although Capita states that the profit margin from Capita's public sector work is modest, Capita is nevertheless a commercial business which exists to make a profit,” the ICO said in its full penalty notice, which also noted that company is a large business “with a variety of clients including those in the private sector”. 325Capita customers affected by the attack, potentially including numerous public bodies In arguing for a significant reduction in the ICO's planned penalty – which was originally slated at £45m – Capita also told the regulator that it is “a very small-margins business”, and suggested that “appears to have been held to an alternative standard to other similar businesses that have suffered comparable or serious cyber incidents”. While the initially proposed fine has been reduced by more than two thirds, an eight-figure punishment has still been imposed on the company – including an £8m penalty levied on the parent company Capita Plc and a £6m fine for specialist subsidiary Capita Pension Solutions Limited. When a company of Capita's size falls short, the consequences can be significant. As our fine shows, no organisation is too big to ignore its responsibilities.” He added: “Maintaining good cybersecurity is fundamental to economic growth and security. With so many cyberattacks in the headlines, our message is clear: every organisation, no matter how large, must take proactive steps to keep people's data secure. Testing timesThe ICO's investigation identified a number ways in which, prior to the attack, Capita had not taken sufficient steps to protect the customer data it holds and processes. This includes a “failure to prevent privilege escalation and unauthorised lateral movement… [which] allowed the attacker to escalate privileges, move laterally across multiple domains and compromise critical systems”. The firm also showed “failure to respond appropriately to security alerts” and ran a security operations centre that “was understaffed, and in at least six months before the incident, fell well below the target response times for responding to security alerts”. In an update posted on its website and issued on the London Stock Exchange, where it is listed, Capita expressed its regret over the incident and said that “following a detailed forensic investigation, all those identified as potentially impacted were contacted after the attack”. The firm's chief executive Adolfo Hernandez added: “As an organisation delivering essential public services as well as key services for private sector clients, Capita was among the first in the recent wave of highly significant cyberattacks on large UK companies. When I joined as CEO the year after the attack I accelerated our cyber security transformation, with new digital and technology leadership and significant investment. Following an extended period of dialogue with the ICO over the last two years, we are pleased to have concluded this matter and reach today's settlement.

The filing places Sony alongside an elite list of firms, including Coinbase, Circle, Paxos, Stripe, and Ripple, currently awaiting OCC approval to operate as national digital banks. According to Sony's filing, Connectia Trust plans to issue a USD-pegged stablecoin, hold corresponding reserves in cash or Treasuries, and provide digital asset custody and management services. So far, Anchorage Digital Bank remains the only crypto-native institution to secure a full de novo OCC charter, though it faced compliance challenges that led to a temporary cease-and-desist order in 2022, later lifted this August. 🏦 The US Senate has confirmed former crypto exec Jonathan Gould as OCC chief in a 50–45 vote, naming him the first permanent head since 2020.#OCC #JonathanGould https://t.co/ipM7YhaG8B The OCC has received over 15 applications from fintech and crypto entities seeking trust charters, a sign of renewed regulatory openness under OCC chief Jonathan Gould, a former blockchain executive confirmed earlier this year. Gould, who previously served as chief legal officer at Bitfury, has publicly emphasized that the OCC “does not impose blanket barriers” to banks engaged in digital asset activities. His confirmation marked a policy shift: in May, the OCC issued new guidance explicitly allowing national banks to buy, sell, and custody cryptocurrencies on behalf of clients, provided they meet safety and risk management standards. Notably, the agency recently approved Erebor Bank for conditional national status, showing a willingness to back digital-first institutions once again. The regulation clarity has sparked a surge of new OCC applications from financial and tech firms hoping to capitalize on what has become one of crypto's most lucrative markets. The total stablecoin market capitalization now exceeds $300 billion, dominated by Tether (USDT) and Circle's USD Coin (USDC), according to DefiLlama. If approved, Connectia Trust would join a new generation of federally chartered digital asset banks. Sony Bank, already known for steady profits from mortgage lending and foreign currency operations, has been expanding aggressively into digital banking. Earlier this year, it launched a next-generation banking system and the Sony Bank CONNECT app, designed to link its services with other Sony Group platforms and Web3 infrastructure. Like JPM Coin, Connectia Trust's tokens may initially operate as closed-loop settlement assets, used internally for treasury transfers, cross-border payments between subsidiaries, or digital transactions within Sony's entertainment network. Such integration would give Sony an edge in programmable money applications, aligning its financial arm with its global entertainment and gaming businesses, a potential first for a consumer tech conglomerate. Notably, Sony has been active for a while in the blockchain sector.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum is picking up speed again, not in price charts where it is currently struggling, but in the silent machinery beneath it. Together, they sketch a future where anyone, from institutions to small-time validators, can participate on the network in real time without needing supercomputers or deep pockets. The first significant milestone on that path is Fusaka, Ethereum's upcoming hard fork, tentatively expected in December. The planned upgrade blends improvements to Ethereum's execution and consensus layers in one coordinated release. Unlike Dencun, which introduced “blobs” to help rollups scale, Fusaka isn't chasing raw throughput. Instead, its role is subtler, focusing on making the network lighter, cheaper, and more efficient. Fusaka implements 12 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) aimed at streamlining validator workloads and improving how rollups post their data. While this doesn't directly raise TPS, it changes how efficiently Ethereum handles data. More rollup information can now fit per block without increasing node requirements. Notably, it also raises the gas limit from 45 million to 60 million, a 33% bump that gives Layer-2s more headroom to publish compressed transaction data. On Oct. 15, Ethereum scaling firm Brevis unveiled Pico Prism, a new zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) capable of producing cryptographic proofs almost as fast as the network creates blocks. Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake pointed out that this represents a leap from May's performance, when the SP1 Hypercube setup could only prove 94% of blocks within the same window. Notably, this is a prerequisite for Ethereum's long-term goal of sub-second settlement. “By year's end several teams will prove every L1 EVM block on a 16-GPU cluster, drawing less than 10kW total. Drake believes these developments fit into his long-term projection of “gigagas L1, teragas L2.” In this scenario, Ethereum's throughput on its base layer for high-value activities like payments and trading rises to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS). “L1 throughput has grown 100x since genesis ten years ago, from 20 kilogas/sec to 2 megagas/sec. With zkEVMs we can 100x again, in half the time.” Ethereum's march toward faster, cheaper transactions comes with a quieter problem of its technical debt piling up. Ethereum developer Federico Carrone, better known as Fede's Intern, cautions that many of the network's core development tools, especially the Solidity programming language, are losing momentum. According to DeFiLlama, it is responsible for more than 86% of the smart contract language used in the blockchain network's over $200 billion DeFi protocols. His concerns echo those of Paradigm CTO Georgios Konstantopoulos, who had previously said Solidity's ecosystem was “in a problematic state.” He argued that maintaining complex infrastructure depends on time, continuity, and deep expertise, which cannot be obtained overnight. In addition, Carrone noted that Ethereum's planned gas-limit increase under the Fusaka upgrade poses another risk. Carrone warned that many execution clients have not significantly improved their performance and may struggle to process larger blocks. “Ethereum's technical debt keeps growing, not only because of constant and necessary protocol evolution, but because a large set of dependencies and repositories are stagnating. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power. He believes that decentralized technology has the potential to make widespread positive change. Catch the latest in crypto by following us on X.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds exhibited contrasting fortunes on Wednesday as participants continue to tread carefully in the wake of Friday's historic flash crash. The Bitcoin ETFs registered $104.1 million in net outflows on Oct. 15, negating the $102.7 million gains they made on Tuesday and continuing the back-and-forth flow data witnessed since last week's market turmoil. Grayscale's GBTC led the outflows with $82.9 million, followed by Invesco's BTCO with $11.1 million, according to data compiled by The Block. BlackRock's delayed flow data subsequently confirmed its IBIT fund also saw $10.1 million exit, while the other ETFs experienced zero flows for the day. In contrast, the Ethereum ETFs attracted $169.6 million combined on Wednesday, led by $164.3 million worth of net inflows into BlackRock's ETHA. Since Friday, the Bitcoin ETFs have experienced $332.3 million in net outflows, and the Ethereum ETFs have seen a total of $197.6 million exit. The turmoil began late Friday after Trump posted on Truth Social that he would impose 100% tariffs on all Chinese imports, responding to China's threat to cut off exports of rare earth metals, which are critical to U.S. technology manufacturing. At its worst, Bitcoin fell 15% toward $100,000 on some exchanges, while Ethereum dropped over 20% and the broader crypto market witnessed more substantial losses. Cascading liquidations saw at least $20 billion of positions wiped out as some cryptocurrencies briefly fell literally to zero — the largest crypto liquidation event in history in U.S. dollar terms. As liquidation data is imperfect, with some exchanges still underreporting in incomplete bursts, the true figure is likely far higher. Other cryptocurrencies have similarly struggled amid the uncertainty, with Ethereum currently trading for $4,046 — down 7.4% over the same period. "Structural effects from the unwind mean liquidity will likely stay thin as market participants recover from forced selling," K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde said earlier this week. "Historically, such deleveraging phases lead to short-term stagnation and cautious trading, but they also tend to mark exhaustion points, creating fertile ground for longer-term recovery once stability returns."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Central banks are striving to keep control of the cryptocurrency wave by launching their own digital currencies — but they are moving too slowly and risk being left in the dust as private sector stablecoins sweep all before them. But unless other countries also adopt CBDCs, India will not see the benefits, Malhotra admitted. But in the meantime, stablecoins outstanding globally have hit $280bn, according to analysts at Citigroup. “I would rather urge all those presidents from central banks and other jurisdictions that we need to promote the CBDC, because this has huge advantages over stablecoins,” Malhotra said. Concern among central bankers that stablecoins might eat CBDCs' lunch is palpable, but in truth there is “no CBDC lunch to eat,” said Timothy Massad, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center on Regulation and Markets. The Atlantic Council has counted 137 countries and currency unions, representing 98% of global GDP, which are exploring a CBDC. But just three have actually launched one — the Bahamas, Jamaica and Nigeria. Progress on CBDCs from major global central banks is limited. “But you have seen very limited take-up,” Massad told GlobalMarkets. The European Central Bank has said 2029 is a realistic date to have its CBDC ready and launched, but this is likely to be a best case scenario. “No one believes quick moves should be done,” Lithuania's vice-minister of finance Januš Kizenevič told GM. Yet by 2030, when the ECB's proposed CBDC may be only months old, Citi analysts expect stablecoins outstanding to have reached $1.9tr in a base case and $4tr in a bull case. Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at Circle, the world's largest regulated stablecoin issuer, pointed to emerging use cases that were “impossible when stablecoins were on the edge of finance”. “You've seen announcements from Deutsche Börse in Europe partnering with Circle and using our euro-denominated stablecoin as a new form of collateral,” Disparte said. Last week, 10 leading international banks announced they were jointly exploring a 1:1 stablecoin backed by G7 currencies. Tom Zschach, chief innovation officer at Swift, expects dollar-denominated stablecoins, tokenised commercial bank deposits and CBDCs to exist side by side — likely serving different use cases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The bank is backed by billionaire Peter Thiel and other prominent tech investors. JUST IN: 🇺🇸 U.S. approves Erebor, a new "cryptobank" backed by Palmer Luckey and Peter Thiel Erebor aims to be “the most regulated entity conducting and facilitating stablecoin transactions” pic.twitter.com/SVYWlzCfOC Erebor submitted its application on June 11 and received conditional approval after a four-month review process. The OCC granted preliminary conditional approval to Erebor Bank after thorough review of its application. The bank must complete compliance, cybersecurity, and capital adequacy reviews before launching full operations. Erebor plans to serve businesses in artificial intelligence, defense, manufacturing, and digital assets. The bank will also provide services to payment processors, venture funds, and trading firms. Bank filings show Erebor expects to hold approximately $1 million in cryptocurrency for transactional purposes. A source close to the company described Erebor as aiming to be “a stable, low-risk, reliable bank doing normal banking things without screwing everyone over with undue risk.” The institution positions itself as a replacement for Silicon Valley Bank, which failed in March 2023. The approval comes as multiple crypto companies seek expanded banking licenses. Circle, the USDC stablecoin issuer, has applied to establish a national trust bank. Banking trade groups have opposed granting charters to crypto companies, citing policy concerns. Custodia Bank founder Caitlin Long suggested the issue may require court resolution. The policy allows outsourcing crypto custody to third parties meeting safety standards. Gould was confirmed by the Senate in June with a 50-45 vote. Under his leadership, the OCC removed “reputation risk” references from guidance documents. President Donald Trump recently signed the GENIUS Act, establishing oversight rules for stablecoin issuers. Congress is debating additional crypto market structure legislation and central bank digital currency limits. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen, and Ron Wyden raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest. They questioned whether the OCC can maintain impartial oversight given Trump's involvement in crypto ventures. Erebor's backing includes Palmer Luckey, founder of Anduril Industries, and venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale. 📈 Futures & Crypto Trader 🔍 Sharing charts, strategies, & mindset tips to help you level up 🚨 Not Financial Advice Follow on X @Pro_Trader_Edge Cardano Price discussions have taken center stage this week, with analysts observing steady movements amid… Parameter is a publication which covers AI, Tech, Finance, Crypto and more.</p>
