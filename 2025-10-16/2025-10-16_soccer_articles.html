COLUMBUS – The Columbus Crew and U.S. Soccer announced today the that 17-year-old Crew Academy striker Chase Adams has been named to the United States Under-17 Men's National Team's roster for the 2025 FIFA U-17 World Cup held in Doha, Qatar.

A native of Naperville, Ill., Adams most recently joined the national team camp in Fayetteville, Ga. in preparation for the FIFA U-17 World Cup. He also represented the team in Noordwijk, Netherlands as they played two friendly matches against Netherlands.

During the Concacaf U-17 World Cup Qualifiers, Adams was named to the Best XI and earned best-player honors. He finished the competition as the top scorer after tallying 10 goals against U.S. Virgin Islands in a World Cup Qualifying match on Feb. 11. Adams scored again four days later against Cuba to bring his total to 11 goals in just two matches as the team topped Group F.

Adams earns the opportunity after his first double-digit scoring season in MLS NEXT Pro, when he led Crew 2 with 10 goals in 1,582 minutes while adding two assists. In 2024, he was named Crew Academy Player of the Year after posting nine goals in 19 matches for Crew 2.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Colin Udoh reveals the role he played in 'helping' Nigeria secure a World Cup play-off place after their 4-0 win over Benin. South Africa's 3-0 win over Rwanda that booked them a place in the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico was not only a strong footballing performance but also a symbol of the resilience that coach Hugo Broos has instilled in the team. Bafana Bafana faced a self-made crisis heading into the final game, as they trailed Benin by two points at the top of Group C. After relinquishing top spot by having their March win over Lesotho overturned for fielding the ineligible Teboho Mokoena, they dropped two more points in a 0-0 draw with Zimbabwe on Saturday. However, Benin 's 4-0 defeat by Nigeria left Bafana with a fighting chance: Victory over Rwanda was all they needed to progress. That match led to the departure of his predecessor, Molefi Ntseki, and the Belgian's subsequent appointment as head coach. Almost five years later, he has delivered on his mission to overhaul Bafana Bafana's belief in their own abilities -- with his focus on youth paying off. I couldn't understand it," Broos told ESPN in 2021 after making early progress in changing the results and culture of the team. "So then I started to see who was playing. There were so many players of 27, 28, 29 years old. "I said: 'Yes, that's right, but if you do not play the younger players, then when are they going to have experience?' "So, therefore, I started also with young players who had quality. That process has now paid dividends, with a dominant performance led by young players who were cool, calm and collected from the first whistle to the last. Bafana led 2-0 at halftime, courtesy of a long-range Thalente Mbatha strike and a curling finish by Oswin Appollis, before Evidence Makgopa's 72nd-minute header sealed the win that saw South Africa qualify for their fourth World Cup -- and their first since they hosted the tournament in 2010. Broos, alone, cannot take credit for the development of players such as Mbatha, Appollis and Makgopa -- Orlando Pirates stars in their mid-20s -- but the former Cameroon head coach, who won the 2017 AFCON against all odds, was a driving force for South Africa's nationwide shift in attitudes towards young players. Then at Baroka FC, Makgopa had not been fancied to lead the line at international level, but Broos took a chance on him and it paid off. Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns -- the two dominant clubs in South Africa over the past decade -- also deserve their fair share of credit. Sundowns have invested heavily under the ownership of Confederation of African Football president Patrice Motsepe, who bought a controlling stake in 2003 and then the remaining shares the following year. Off the back of a disappointing spell in charge of Bafana Bafana, a reinvigorated Mosimane led Sundowns to their first CAF Champions League title in 2016 -- only the second by a South African club; Pirates previously won it in 1995. None could quite match the financial might of Sundowns, but Pirates improved their talent development and recruitment structures -- and their streamlined squad has closed the gap on a Sundowns side now struggling with fatigue and player discontent after the FIFA Club World Cup, a tournament that saw them impress on the global stage but face struggles keeping their players away from prying eyes elsewhere in the world. Broos has often encouraged Bafana Bafana players to move overseas, but facing an injury crisis heading into a decisive qualifier, he started with an entirely locally-based XI. South Africa started five Sundowns players -- Ronwen Williams, Khuliso Mudau, Aubrey Modiba, Mokoena and Thapelo Morena -- five Pirates players -- Mbatha, Appollis, Makgopa, Nkosinathi Sibisi and Sipho Mbule -- and one from TS Galaxy, Khulumani Ndamane. That, alone, speaks volumes of the quality in South Africa's club football. What is new -- first and foremost -- is the apparent end of the days when South African players were viewed as too comfortable and pampered to win when the going got tough.</p>

While fans have experienced long waiting times to purchase tickets and seen exorbitant ticket prices on third-party websites, FIFA says about 6 million tickets will be available for the World Cup with three more ticket-buying phases later this year. The tournament begins at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City on June 11, 2026, and will end with the final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey on July 19, 2026. "As national teams across the globe compete for a place at the historic FIFA World Cup 26, I am thrilled so many football-loving fans also want to be part of this watershed event in North America," FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a statement. It's an incredible response, and a wonderful sign that the biggest, most inclusive FIFA World Cup in history is capturing the imagination of supporters everywhere. Already, tickets have been purchased by fans in over 200 countries and territories, led by our enthusiastic hosts in Canada, Mexico and the United States of America." Fans will be informed in mid-November to early December when they can purchase tickets. Similar to the first phase, this will consist of an application, followed by a randomized selection process. During this phase, fans will be able to submit applications for specific matches after the final draw has revealed most of the group-stage matchups. More than 4.5 million people signed up for the Visa Presale Draw from Sept. 10 to 19, including 1.5 million on the first day. FIFA began sending emails to fans who were not selected for the Visa Presale Draw on Wednesday, Oct. 15. The email read: "Dear Football Fan, thank you for your interest in purchasing FIFA World Cup 26™ tickets during the Visa Presale Draw. Unfortunately, your entry was unsuccessful, and you have not been allocated a time slot to purchase tickets during this sales phase."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MIAMI (AP) — More than 1 million tickets have already been sold for next year's World Cup, FIFA said Thursday in its first update on numbers since the official start of sales began earlier this month. FIFA said people from 212 different countries and territories have already purchased, even though only 28 of the 48 spots in the field have been filled. “As national teams across the globe compete for a place at the historic FIFA World Cup 26, I am thrilled so many football-loving fans also want to be part of this watershed event in North America,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a release. He added, “It's an incredible response, and a wonderful sign that the biggest, most inclusive FIFA World Cup in history is capturing the imagination of supporters everywhere.” FIFA did not reveal any specific figures about how many tickets have been sold for certain matches, or offer any breakdowns by host site. The buyers who purchased the tickets in this first round of availability were selected out of 4.5 million applicants in a lottery that took place last month. The entry period for the next draw will open to fans on Oct. 27, FIFA said, noting that single-match tickets to all 104 games, along with venue- and team-specific tickets, will be released. It is unknown how many of those seats will be available for sale to the public. Most matches, and almost all seats, were set at a much higher price. Ticket costs are expected to fluctuate as soccer's biggest event utilizes dynamic pricing for the first time. A third phase, termed a random selection draw, will start after the final draw of teams on Dec. 5 determines the World Cup schedule. Tickets also will be available closer to the tournament “on a first-come, first-served basis.” FIFA also said Thursday that it has opened its official resale platform for tickets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Cristian Roldan and Haji Wright got U.S. men's soccer coach Mauricio Pochettino's attention eight months ahead of the World Cup. Given his first start in 13 months, Wright scored in the 33rd and 51st minutes off passes from Roldan to spark the Americans to their first comeback win under Pochettino in a 2-1 victory over Australia in exhibition match Tuesday night at Dick's Sporting Goods Park. "A player that performs like today, Haji, can be close. Wright, 27, plays for Coventry in England, where leads the second-tier League Championship with eight goals. He has 11 goals in 13 games for club and country since August. Wright, who has seven goals in 19 international appearances, had never before scored for the U.S. in a game he started. "They're putting me in positions to show what I can do and they're allowing me to be expressive in the field," he said of Pochettino and Coventry manager Frank Lampard. Folarin Balogun, the other top U.S. forward, scored the tying goal against Ecuador in a 1-1 draw last Friday in Austin, Texas. "Picked up off where Flo was last game," defender Chris Richards said. "My wife and I kept saying that we believe that we can make a late run, make a late push, and hopefully I'm making my case," Roldan said. "Pochettino has done a great job of making me feel confident and comfortable here," Roldan said, "and so just proud to be part of this, and hopefully I'm part of the next camp." Roldan, 30, has made 41 international appearances and impressed Pochettino with his play for the Seattle Sounders of Major League Soccer this summer. "Maybe Cristian Roldan is an example of how if you want to build your perfect player, he has a little bit of everything." "I don't say that he's going to be in the next roster or is going to be in the World Cup, but I think at the moment or so far, after last camp and now, it's a player that we wanted to give the opportunity, we gave the opportunity and look what is going on." Pochettino also said he is thinking ahead to the 2030 World Cup cycle, even though it is after his contract ends. "It's our responsibility to create some legacy or to try to create some core of players that behave in the same way and feel in the same way, respect the values that we were talking about, culture and everything," he said, "maybe to have this core of players that they can that can arrive in 2030 in a different situation (than) that was this World Cup." After struggling for much of his first year in charge, the U.S. has put together a three-game unbeaten streak. The Americans will co-host next year's World Cup with Canada and Mexico. I wanted to see individual players doing better. Australia went ahead after Jordan Bos bounced a throw-in that James Sands tried to clear only for the ball to spin into the penalty area. Bos chested the ball to himself, split Roldan and Sands, then beat Richards to the ball and hooked it with his left foot past Matt Freese's outstretched left arm for his second international goal. "In the World Cup if you start the game in the way that we start and we concede a goal like this ... then it's difficult to have another chance."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The NextGen White Paper, developed over the past year with input from college athletic directors, coaches, players, professional league executives, and governance leaders, provides a roadmap to align college soccer with today's rapidly changing athletic and professional landscape. “The goal is simple: keep what's great, improve what's not, and make sure the system works for today's student-athletes and tomorrow's game.” For decades, college soccer has been one of the most important player development platforms in the United States, producing generations of players, coaches, referees, and administrators who have shaped the sport at every level. The recommendations, which span competition structure, scheduling, and operational alignment, aim to strengthen that foundation while adapting to new realities such as NIL, conference realignment, and expanded professional leagues. “College soccer has had a massive impact in developing generations of players, coaches, and leaders across the sport, but with the game evolving rapidly on both the men's and women's side of the game we need to proactively determine changes that will have a positive impact,” said Cindy Parlow Cone, President of U.S. Soccer. “That's why U.S. Soccer is committed to helping college soccer modernize and strengthen its role within the development pathway, while still providing student-athletes the educational and community experiences that make the college game so special. “Our job was to listen, analyze, debate, and recommend,” said Dan Helfrich, Chair of the NextGen Committee and former CEO at Deloitte Consulting. It's a modernization plan that strengthens well-being, reduces costs, and creates new opportunities for growth. If we do this right, college soccer will thrive for decades and serve as a model for other sports facing similar pressures and opportunities.” To read the full NextGen College Soccer White Paper, click here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>United States President Donald Trump has taken aim at the city of Boston over safety concerns ahead of FIFA World Cup 2026 football fixtures. United States President Donald Trump has threatened to relocate FIFA World Cup 2026 matches set to be played next year in suburban Boston, after suggesting that parts of the city had been “taken over” by unrest. Trump was asked about Boston's Mayor Michelle Wu, a Democrat whom he called “intelligent” but “radical left”. “We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup games. Trump has previously made similar threats against San Francisco and Seattle. Trump has previously suggested he could declare cities “not safe” for the 104-game football tournament and alter a detailed hosting plan that FIFA confirmed in 2022. It includes games at NFL stadiums near New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. “We hope every one of our 16 Host Cities will be ready to successfully host and fulfil all necessary requirements,” the FIFA statement added. Trump has insisted that “if somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni – the head of FIFA who's phenomenal – and I would say, ‘Let's move into another location', and they would do that.” The president meant FIFA head Gianni Infantino, a close ally. Speaking on a local podcast on Wednesday, Wu questioned how Trump could take away the games with less than a year to go. She said most everything is already “locked down by contract” so no single person “even if they live in the White House currently can undo it”. “There's no ability to take away the World Cup games,” Wu said. “There's no real threat when it comes to saying cities are so unsafe that they can't host the games.” Among the seven matches that will be played at Gillette Stadium in the Boston suburb of Foxborough will be five group stage matches, one match in the round of 32, and a quarterfinal match on July 9, 2026. The news of so many big games was a surprise to local organisers. I don't think FIFA could have done a better job.” The tournament is expected to bring $1.1bn in local economic impact, create over 5,000 jobs, and generate more than $60m of tax revenue throughout the region, according to organisers. They also expect that more than two million visitors will come to New England throughout the tournament's 39-day span. He said in that interview that the only donation he'd ever made to Trump was a “strong donation to his inauguration” following his 2016 election. Sitting presidents typically receive gifts from sports teams during celebratory White House visits — a personalised jersey is standard — but Kraft gave Trump a ring as well, the team confirmed at the time. Kraft decided after the team's April 2017 visit to have a ring made for Trump so he would have something special to display in his presidential library, the team said. But Kraft said in that same 2024 Breakfast Club interview that he hadn't spoken to Trump since the January 6, 2021 attack by Trump supporters on the US Capitol. Democratic and Republican leaders across Massachusetts have pushed back against the National Guard deployment in Boston, and Wu, who is running unopposed for re-election, often cites the city's historical low crime rates. Wu touts the fact that gun violence fell to the lowest level on record in her first year in office and has continued to decline. Boston saw a historical low number of homicides in 2024, a total 24 — but the city has surpassed that number so far in 2025 with 27, the police department said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATLANTA (Oct. 16, 2025) – Twenty-four players have been called up to the U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team training camp outside of Philadelphia, Pa. that will run from Oct. 20-28. From Oct. 20-23, the camp will run concurrently with the U.S. Women's National Team's time in Philadelphia so U.S. head coach Emma Hayes and her staff can observe trainings. The U-23 programming in Philadelphia is another step in U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes' emphasis on this age group and its importance along the player pathway to the full National Team. Hayes also held a “Futures Camp” last January alongside the USWNT in Florida. “We've been preparing players to not only help us qualify for the 2027 World Cup but also with a view to the ‘28 Olympics and beyond, and this is one of the reasons the Under-23 program is so valuable,” said Hayes. “Along with the senior team roster, we want to prepare 50-plus players every camp so there is dual messaging, exposure to our principles of play and the alignment around our framework. This U.S. U-23 WNT roster features players with five birth years ranging from 2006 to 2002, which is the age cut-off for players to be a part of the U.S. U-23 WNT this year. Goalkeepers (3): Liz Beardsley (Houston Dash; Lakeland, Fla.), Leah Freeman (Bay FC; Berkeley, Calif.), Neeku Purcell (Seattle Reign; Seattle, Wash.) Defenders (9): Natalie Bain (Xavier University; Alexandria, Ky.), Eva Gaetino (Paris Saint-Germain FC, FRA; Dexter, Mich.), Ella Hase (Racing Louisville FC; Orland Park, Ill.), Emily Mason (Seattle Reign; Flemington, N.J.), Quincy McMahon (San Diego Wave; Highland Ranch, Colo.), Ayo Oke (CF Pachuca, MEX; Lawrenceville, Ga.), Jayden Perry (Portland Thorns FC; Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif.), Evelyn Shores (Angel City FC; Atlanta, Ga.), Gisele Thompson (Angel City FC; Studio City, Calif.) Forwards (6): Emeri Adames (Seattle Reign; Red Oak, Texas), Maddie Dahlien (Seattle Reign; Edina, Minn.), Jameese Joseph (Chicago Stars FC; Beltsville, Md.</p>

A FIFA spokesperson told ESPN that governments have final say in deciding "what is in the best interest for public safety." President Donald Trump and FIFA president Gianni Infantino talk in the Oval Office of the White House after signing an executive order for a task force related to the FIFA World Cup, in Washington, D.C., on March 7, 2025. "Safety and security are obviously the governments' responsibility, and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety. "We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to successfully host and fulfill all necessary requirements." Fox News Digital reached out to FIFA for comment. The situation surrounding Boston's standing as one of the host cities for next year's tournament began this week when Trump suggested that he would have games moved out of Boston while discussing an incident that occurred in the city this week when a group of people took over one of the city's streets in a violent display. You know, some are extremely low IQ. Mayor Wu speaks as the Mayor and City leaders hold a press conference on violence and drug use in DTC on Feb. 26, 2025. The president added that he could call on FIFA President Gianni Infantino to make the relocation happen if he felt it was necessary. "The answer is yes, if somebody's doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location,' and he would do that. And this is the right time to do it." Trump doubled down on his threat Wednesday, adding that, "We have the right to do that with FIFA" if the city doesn't "straighten it out." "If we think there's any reason that, whether it's Boston or anywhere else, that they're not doing their job, we're going to take those World Cup games and move them someplace else." FIFA President Gianni Infantino, right, hands the FIFA World Cup Winners Trophy to President Donald Trump during an announcement in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, Aug. 22, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) In a statement to Fox News Digital, Wu said the city is "honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions." Boston is currently set to host seven matches when the World Cup comes to North America next summer. The slate includes five group-stage games, one Round of 32 fixture and the first quarterfinal, on July 9. Fox News Digital's Jackson Thompson contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>North America's World Cup is going to be a crypto-fueled mess. FIFA is already one of the most corrupt, greedy, and short-sighted governing bodies in sports — but even they've found a way to top themselves. Tickets to a global sporting event like the World Cup were always going to be high, but FIFA is pushing those figures into the stratosphere. Every single stage of the event is being priced out for sports fans, with tickets being offered for prices that vastly exceed what they were in Qatar for 2022. For example, a first round match at Qatar would have set you back anywhere from $11 USD in the low-cost fan section, which represents a tiny fraction of tickets sold — then escalating to the highest price tickets costing $200 USD. For the next World Cup those same affordable fan tickets are rising to $60 each, a 545% increase. Again, these are for a tiny fraction of the stadium known for not really being attainable because it requires a lottery. So, what's the next cheapest seat you can buy? Yep, the most expensive group stage ticket in Qatar is now the cheapest option in North America — and this is only for games featuring teams people don't really want to see. If there's a specific team you're hoping to catch, then good luck. This is because FIFA is introducing what it's calling “variable pricing,” similar to booking an Uber during a surge period. Instead of simply pricing the event and adding on a premium for, say, England vs. France — instead they're waiting to see what the demand for tickets is going to be, and then pricing tickets accordingly. FIFA's idea is: If you don't pay it, someone else will — and who cares if soccer fans can't afford it? For the first time ever FIFA is selling RTB vouchers, or “Right to Buy.” These are vouchers which grant you the ability to then purchase a guaranteed ticket for a game. Right now you can go onto their official website and purchase an NFT for a quarter final game in Kansas City with prices starting at $549. This is one of the cheaper options. Semi-final vouchers in Dallas begin at $1,196 — and because greedy crypto chuds got in on this, there are NFTs for New York City starting at a cool $100,000. Let's go back to this Kansas City example. Let's say you've purchased your dumb NFT for $549, because that's the only way to get a ticket. Then as the event approaches you get an email from FIFA saying you can now buy your ticket for the quarter final for $4,000. You decide that's too expensive, because of course it is. Don't worry, because you can re-sell your NFT through the FIFA site and perhaps recoup your money! The bad news is that FIFA is taking a 15% transaction fee on every resold RTB token. These unbelievably ghoulish morons have turned the simple process of buying a ticket for an event into a cryptocurrency scheme. It's almost as if a global sporting event was organized by someone who pays for a checkmark on Twitter. Out of the gate the cheapest option right now is to purchase two NFTs for June 26 and $244 — for a total of $488. No idea what time the game is, forget who's playing. You luck out and get two teams nobody cares about, because this keeps the price lower. Every ounce of excitement I had for this next World Cup is gone. Instead it's been replaced with a white-hot passion to see all this stupidity go down in flames. A daily roundup of all your sports news Collins has finally found a ‘home' in the NWSL with Bay FC. After a leg fracture put a pause on his fast rise, the Bayern star is determined to come back soon, even stronger.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trent Alexander-Arnold's move to Real Madrid was one of the standout stories of the summer, but his first few months in Spain have been anything but straightforward. Since completing his £10 million transfer to Real Madrid in June, Alexander-Arnold has faced the demanding expectations that come with joining one of Europe's elite clubs. The England international has made ten appearances across all competitions for Real Madrid, showcasing glimpses of his trademark passing range and attacking influence. However, his adaptation to Xabi Alonso's tactical system has required patience, with the 27-year-old starting only two La Liga matches before a hamstring injury halted his progress in mid-September. The setback ruled him out of five consecutive fixtures, including key domestic and European encounters. Real Madrid's medical department initially feared a longer absence, with the right-back a doubt for the Champions League clash against his former club Liverpool on 4 November. However, recent developments suggest his recovery is progressing ahead of schedule. According to reports from Spain, Real Madrid's medical team are cautiously optimistic that Alexander-Arnold could be fit in time for El Clásico against Barcelona on 26 October. Should his recovery continue without complications, Alexander-Arnold could play a part in at least one of those matches before the anticipated reunion with Liverpool at Anfield. A potential return to his former home would undoubtedly be emotional. His decision to join Real Madrid marked the end of an iconic chapter, and his comeback game could see him face the team he once captained on European nights. For Madrid, his recovery could not come at a better time. Xabi Alonso's side have managed well in his absence but are aware of how Alexander-Arnold's creativity and composure can elevate their play.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former USWNT star Christen Press announces on "Good Morning America" that she will retire from professional soccer at the end of the NWSL season. The NWSL still lacks a unified academy system, but with the college draft being abolished and combines -- including a youth combine to scout talent as young as 13 -- age is not holding recruitment back as it did in years past. Several of the stars in the making from last year's U19 rankings have aged out of this category: U.S. women's national team stars Alyssa Thompson, Jaedyn Shaw and Olivia Moultrie, and Japan international Manaka Matsukubo have all since turned 20. - After scandals, can new owners return Portland Thorns to glory? Age: 18 Position: Defender Club: Houston Dash (on loan with Dux Logroño) Country: USA Her place on the best and deepest team in the league doesn't help with earning game time right now, but it is a great long-term development tool. She has played for the U.S. at several youth national team levels. Still the youngest player in the league, Whitham has earned minutes in six league games as well as several Concacaf Champions Cup games. She scored her first pro goal earlier this month before departing for the U17 World Cup. Chicago signed her to a long-term deal, so she is part of another rebuild there. Earning regular minutes is a major part of development at such a young age, and McCammon has quietly chipped away at that task in Seattle. With no goal contributions, her stats don't jump off the page, but 14 matches played -- including five starts -- for a team contending for a home playoff game shows the trust that Reign head coach Laura Harvey has in the young midfielder. Age: 18 Position: Midfielder Club: Houston Dash (pre-contract with Boston Legacy for 2026) Country: USA Ricketts plays with a flair on the wing that can excite any casual observer. She plays with the swagger and confidence of a young player who knows no limits. She'd be higher on this list too, if not for a knee injury that cut her 2024 season short and kept her out for half of 2025. Long, the daughter of Current co-owners Angie and Chris, has slowly built up first-team minutes in her debut season after leaving Duke University as a freshman to turn pro. She has one assist in nine appearances for Kansas City -- no small feat considering the team's depth of international firepower up top. Age: 17 Position: Winger Club: San Diego Wave FC Country: USA Barcenas is probably the most viral player on this list. She has done more of that in 2025 as a reliable substitute (even with limited minutes). Melanie Barcenas slots in the goal for San Diego Wave FC Age: 18 Position: Forward Club: Angel City FC (on loan to Djurgården) Country: South Korea Progress has been incremental for Phair, who signed a long-term extension this summer and immediately went on loan to Sweden's Damallsvenskan. She has earned more minutes there than she had at Angel City in the first half of the season, but Phair is still fighting for first-team appearances. Age: 18 Position: Forward Club: Portland Thorns FC Country: Colombia Portland invested significantly in signing Loboa -- her contract runs through 2028 with a club option for 2029 -- after she scored her first international goal and played in all six games at Copa America this summer for finalists Colombia. Age: 18 Position: Midfielder Club: Portland Thorns FC (on loan from Arsenal) Country: England Harbert's entire Arsenal senior career to date has been spent on loan, but those around the club have high expectations for the England youth international and expect she will eventually make it to the Lionesses' senior team. Even if Portland proves to be a pit stop, Harbert's ceiling is high. Age: 18 Position: Defender Club: San Diego Wave FC Country: USA Armstrong is strong in duels and growing into her own as a center-back. Granted, San Diego's 31 goals conceded this season isn't great, but Armstrong, in large part, was tasked with filling the gigantic shoes of Naomi Girma, who left for Chelsea in the offseason. Age: 19 Position: Forward Club: Seattle Reign FC Country: USA Age: 17 Position: Forward Club: San Diego Wave FC Country: USA Ascanio's production is up from last year, with four goals and an assist for a Wave team that has generally struggled going forward. It's a rare combination, especially in the USWNT pool. Have you seen that assist on Manaka Matsukubo's recent goal for the North Carolina Courage? That was Riley Jackson doing what she does on the ball. Manaka Matsukubo gets on the scoresheet for North Carolina Courage Yes, that was her lone assist of the year, but she leads all players on this list in expected assists (3.77), which speaks to her potential. North Carolina has also struggled as a team this season, but that dip is not indicative of Jackson's potential. Kennedy Fuller gets on the scoresheet for Angel City FC Fuller's four goals and three assists have been a bright spot in an inconsistent season filled with change for Angel City. Still, Fuller has the makings of a long-term No. She is also productive for a midfielder -- regardless of age -- with seven total goal contributions. Fuller has made tremendous gains in her second season as a professional. Multiple coaches have compared Bugg's skill set to that of USWNT defender Naomi Girma, who landed at No. 2 on ESPN's ranking of the top 50 players last year. She possess the subtle balance of vision and technical skill of an elite center back, and she is also good for an epic highlight. Thompson's older sister, Alyssa, is better known internationally -- especially after her blockbuster transfer to Chelsea on England's deadline day -- but Gisele is also a talented player turning heads within the NWSL and U.S. Soccer. She has made her name thus far at fullback and has five assists for Angel City, which is tied for the NWSL lead. Hutton is a brave, two-way midfielder who can protect the back line with crunching tackles and spark the attack with progressive passes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"It was a wonderful day, very much in the Bavarian spirit, with an atmosphere like at the Oktoberfest. I felt very much at home," said the president, who joined in the celebrations for several hours and answered questions, posed for selfies and signed autographs: "Our fans, especially in Bavaria, carry this club." Under the watchful eyes of the two fan club chairmen Marcus Fritsch and Markus Preisinger, Hainer signed the Golden Book of the market town of Plößberg, three hours away from Munich, and thanked them for their invitation and hospitality. "Anyone born a Bayern fan can count themselves lucky," he said, speaking from the heart of those present: he himself had always been a fan of the Reds, ever since the days of Franz Beckenbauer, he said during the event, "and I just love the way people have been passionate about this unique club for generations. 25 and 20 years ago respectively, when the two fan clubs were founded, FC Bayern was a traditional German club with great national appeal, Hainer said, pointing out the joint development: The club management led by Uli Hoeneß and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge established the supporting pillars of financial solidity, down-to-earth values and strong regional roots. On this basis, FC Bayern became a global brand, "while at the same time never forgetting where the foundation stands: our fans, especially in the Munich area, carry this club. That much was evident again today at this doubl celebration." FC Bayern now has over 410,000 members and 330,000 fan club members worldwide, making it the largest club in the world, and Hainer stressed: "This popularity doesn't come about by itself" - the club has established many dialogue formats and introduced a volunteer programme called 'PACK MA'S', among other things, which allows members to actively get involved in the club. “It's important to me that our club maintains a dialogue with its fans, in all its facets, especially as you always take important input back to Säbener Straße. The two fan clubs had even organised Meisterschalen and Champions League trophies specially for the resident's visit - a glittering backdrop for a glittering event.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's suggestion that he could move 2026 World Cup games out of U.S. cities he deems unsafe rippled through soccer and political circles in late September. It sparked a wide range of reactions, many tinged with confusion, because the U.S. government had no official role in choosing World Cup host cities; and it does not have any explicit authority to relocate World Cup games. Nonetheless, Trump's comments elicited responses from host city mayors and World Cup organizers. Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell ripped Trump's “ignorance,” and said in a statement: “We're working every day to make the World Cup a safe, welcoming, and fun experience.” The following is a rundown of what else has been said and whether games could actually be moved. The reporter continued: “You have a number of cities that are pushing back against your immigration and deportation, as well as your crime initiatives.” Trump interjected again: “I don't think they're very much pushing back at all.” The reporter went on: “But some of those cities have World Cup games. Trump cut him off yet again: “They're gonna be very secure.” “It will be safe for the World Cup,” he said, despite both Memphis and Chicago also being uninvolved. He then went on another tangent about JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, who has accused Trump of deploying National Guard troops to Democrat-controlled cities in an effort to exert “authoritarian” control ahead of next year's midterm elections. Trump concluded: “If any city we think is gonna be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup … we won't allow it to go to [those cities], we'll move it around a little bit. When repeating his remarks in another Oval Office media session, Trump said he would call in a personal favor with FIFA president Gianni Infantino. The World Cup is owned and operated by FIFA, soccer's global governing body. Trump, therefore, cannot unilaterally cancel those contracts and move games to other cities. The contracts, some of which have been obtained via public records requests, do require cities to implement robust security and public safety measures. If FIFA deems a city unsafe, it could, potentially, terminate the agreements and relocate matches. “Public safety officials, including our Republican-appointed Police Board, are working daily to ensure the games in Kansas City are safe for all,” Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas told The Athletic in a statement via a spokeswoman. In December will bring the World Cup Draw to Washington, D.C., largely so that Trump can be involved. Trump, in theory, could leverage this relationship and push Infantino to pull games out of cities whose mayors resist him, which is what he insinuated in his Oct. 14 remarks. We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to fulfill all necessary requirements for a successful 2026 World Cup.” Trump's other potential lever is the $625 million in security funds that Congress allocated to World Cup cities this summer. That money will be split proportionally — not equally — among the 11 U.S. host cities, depending on their needs. The cities will submit their costs and requests for reimbursement, according to Andrew Giuliani, head of the White House's World Cup task force. It's unclear if Trump, who chairs the task force, could potentially politicize and withhold some of that funding. Trump has clashed with Democratic mayors throughout his second term over immigration policy and other topics. After his federal takeover of D.C., he has threatened to send troops to Chicago and other cities, even as many mayors and governors say that crime is not out of control and federal assistance is not necessary or welcome. The World Cup host cities in left-leaning states with Democratic mayors that Trump could target would include Seattle, San Francisco and the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Boston. Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas and Kansas City are also led by Democrats. The U.S. men's national team is due to play its group games in L.A. and Seattle. At this stage, eight-and-a-half months out from the World Cup opener, finding new host cities would be unrealistic. It would be extremely difficult for a 12th city to cram all that planning into eight months. FIFA set the World Cup schedule, complete with dates and locations, in 2024. It has already sold hospitality packages to specific stadiums, and opened ticket sales earlier this month. According to one person briefed on the planning efforts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose details, FIFA has previously told local organizers that it will not be relocating games. “The facts are clear: violent crime is down 20% in Seattle. We are making record-breaking progress on police hiring with nearly 130 officers hired this year. My proposed 2026 budget also makes additional investments in safety preparations for the World Cup, including new removable vehicle barriers at Pike Place Market and Seattle Center campus. “While we are doing our part to make safety improvements ahead of hosting games, the Trump administration has made our city less safe by withholding critical funding for counterterrorism tools. While the City's lawsuit has successfully released a portion of this funding, President Trump's words about safety don't align with his administration's actions. A spokesperson for Harrell had previously told KOMO News: “While the president continues to peddle baseless, divisive, and empty threats, our administration is doing the hard work to prepare for this opportunity. We're advancing plans with FIFA and local partners to ensure Seattle is a destination and that we make the most of this special event.” Hana Tadesse, a spokeswoman for the Seattle World Cup host committee, wrote in a statement to The Athletic: “We are committed to ensuring a safe, welcoming, and memorable experience for fans, players, visitors, and residents alike. Since being selected by FIFA as a host city, we've worked closely with them, the White House Task Force for FIFA World Cup 26, community partners, and law enforcement, and are confident in our planning and coordination in advance of next summer's matches. Seattle looks forward to shining on the world stage and hosting an event that is not only spectacular, but safe for all.” Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, who has previously said that “Boston will not back down” from the Trump administration amid legal threats over immigration policies, initially said in response to a question about Trump's World Cup comments: “We are very excited for the summer that Boston will have next year. It's going to be an incredible show of what our city's made of as we welcome people from all over the world [for the World Cup and other events]. With Boston specifically targeted in Trump's latest threat, Wu simply said, “Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions.” Planning for World Cup is already underway, and we are fully committed to delivering an unforgettable tournament that this country, and this region, will be proud of well beyond 2026.” Philadelphia Soccer 2026 said in a statement to The Athletic: “We appreciate President Trump's commitment to safety and security for this global event, and we share that same commitment, as do our colleagues across the nation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Trump was front and centre at the Club World Cup final and has a strong relationship with FIFA President Gianni Infantino. But on two occasions in recent times, the 79-year-old has threatened to take World Cup games away from host cities. His threats in September focused on Seattle and San Francisco following recent demonstrations, as he said, "If any city we think is going to be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup ... because they're playing in so many cities, we won't allow it. But I hope that's not going to happen.” Trump said the cities are "run by radical left lunatics and that don't know what they're doing" and recently turned his attention to Boston. He was also asked if he would work with Michelle Wu, the Democratic mayor of Boston, but proceeded to criticise her. "We could take them away,” Trump said in regards to possible moving of World Cup games. “Their mayor is not good … She's radical left, and they're taking over parts of Boston. He added: “If someone is doing a bad job, and I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni [Infantino], the head of Fifa, who is phenomenal, and say let's move it to another location. Wu has responded by stressing that FIFA's host cities are "locked down by contract so that no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it". LA were awarded the Olympics in 2017 and need to raise $7 billion for the event, which is set to bring 15 million visitors. But when City of Angels was ravaged by wildfires earlier this year, there were calls for Trump to move the Games elsewhere in the US - though it would not be his decision alone as he would have to consult the International Olympic Committee (IOC). “On that one I'd probably have to get a different kind of a permission, but we would do that.” In August, Trump signed an executive order to create a White House taskforce who will focus on smoothing out any issues related to the Games, including security, visas for athletes and coaches and transportation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Global soccer body FIFA issued a statement to multiple news outlets on Wednesday confirming the U.S. government has the ability to move 2026 World Cup matches amid recent comments from President Donald Trump regarding host city safety. Question marks surrounding moving World Cup games—78 of 104 are slated to take place in the U.S. next year—have arisen as Trump has questioned the safety of cities including Boston and Chicago. FIFA, seemingly going against comments made by vice president Victor Montagliani, sided with the U.S. government and Trump in a new statement. “Safety and security are the top priorities at all FIFA events worldwide. Safety and security are obviously the governments' responsibility, and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety. We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to successfully host and fulfill all necessary requirements,” FIFA said to The Athletic among others. Montagliani, also president of Concacaf, had previously said FIFA holds “jurisdiction” around moving games. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. The U.S. president turned his attention to Boston and city mayor Michelle Wu on Tuesday during a meeting with Argentinian President Javier Milei. If somebody's doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni [Infantino], the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location,' and he would do that. And this is the right time to do it.” Mayor Wu responded to Trump's remarks on “Java with Jimmy” this past Wednesday. “Much of it is locked down by contract so that no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it,” Wu said. “We're in a world where for drama, for control, for pushing the boundaries ... ongoing threats ... are issued to individuals and communities who refuse to back down and comply or be obedient to a hateful agenda.“ President Trump first cast doubt over World Cup host cities in September, saying, “It will be safe for the World Cup. It remains unclear how the U.S. government and/or FIFA would go about moving games, which cities would serve as secondary locations and more.
