Ellie Cohanim, a former State Department deputy special envoy, joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss how Israel is taking action to secure the remains of the rest of the hostages and why she believes the terror group will be 'forced to comply.' President Donald Trump sent a strong message to Hamas Thursday, threatening to "go in and kill" Hamas militants if the group continues attacks in Gaza. "If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them," Trump wrote in a fiery Truth Social post. "Thank you for your attention to this matter!" The move comes after Hamas was seen on video publicly executing opponents in Gaza City's main square, despite Trump's peace plan. Hamas has signed onto President Donald Trump's plan as IDF forces start withdrawing from the enclave. Gazans previously told Fox News Digital Hamas fighters were reappearing in the streets and reasserting control, having issued an ultimatum giving Israeli collaborators until Sunday to surrender and seek amnesty.

FIRST ON FOX: A federal grand jury indicted two alleged Antifa members with terrorism-related charges for a July 4 attack on an ICE facility in Texas. "For the first time ever, the FBI has arrested anarchist violent extremists and charged these Antifa-aligned individuals with material support to terrorism," FBI Director Kash Patel said in a statement. "This was a planned and coordinated terrorist attack on the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas, where armed extremists tried to murder U.S. officers on July 4th," he continued. A group ambushed corrections and police officers outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas, on July 4, 2025, creating a distraction with fireworks and graffiti before firing upon officers with semiautomatic rifles. (Mark David Smith/Fort Worth Star-Telegram/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) "We are executing under President Trump's new authorities at record speed. To date, the FBI has made over 20 arrests tied to this case and related Antifa networks. No one gets to harm law enforcement. Not on our watch," Patel added. Attorney General Pam Bondi also hailed the charges, vowing further prosecutions against Antifa members. Arnold and Evetts are alleged to have participated in the ambush of federal agents at the ICE detention facility along with nine others. Authorities say the suspects used fireworks as a distraction while vandalizing vehicles outside the facility. Top row, left to right: Marciela Rueda, Savanna Batten, Joy Gibson, Meagan Morris a.k.a. Bottom row, left to right: Zachary Evetts, Nathan Baumann, Ines Soto, Elizabeth Soto, Seth Sikes. The wounded officer fell to the ground but was able to return a few shots. Coconspirator-1 continued to fire additional rounds until his rifle jammed. Ten individuals have been charged for their roles in the shooting of an Alvarado police officer at the Prairieland Detention Center. The charges come weeks after President Donald Trump signed an executive order seeking to classify Antifa as a terrorist organization.

Callais, during oral arguments on the legality of certain Voting Rights Act provisions. Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson sparked debate Wednesday after she invoked the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) during oral arguments to illustrate how the government can remedy discrimination — an exchange that quickly took off on social media, where some critics accused her of comparing Black voters to disabled persons. The back-and-forth took place during nearly three hours of oral arguments in Louisiana v. Callais, which centers on states' obligation to consider race when drawing congressional maps under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Jackson's remarks were a follow-up to questions posed by Justice Elena Kagan, who had also pressed counsel for Louisiana on what remedies the government must provide in cases of discrimination under the 14th and 15th Amendments, and if they must take into account issues of intent. "Going back to this discriminatory intent point — and the fact that remedial action, absent discriminatory intent, is really not a new idea in civil rights laws. And my paradigmatic example of this is something like the ADA," Jackson said. "Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act against the backdrop of a world that was generally not accessible to people with disabilities. And so it was discriminatory, in effect, because these folks were not able to access these buildings — and [it] didn't matter whether the person who built the building, or the person who owned the building, intended for them to be exclusionary. "Congress said the facilities have to be made equally open to people with disabilities, if readily possible. Jackson went on to note that the idea of Section 2 is that the government "is responding to current-day manifestations of past and present decisions that disadvantaged minorities," and to "make it so they now have equal access to the voting system, right? They're disabled," she said, drilling down on the hypothetical. Voting rights activists protest outside the Supreme Court as the court prepares to hear arguments in a case challenging Louisiana's congressional map in Washington on Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025. "It's not race-based," Jackson quickly agreed of the ADA and other discrimination laws. "But what you're saying, then, that if the problem of no access is about race, 'it's just too bad,' because you can't have a remedy that relates to race?" Activists and participants gather in front of the Supreme Court during the re-argument of Louisiana v. Callais on Oct. 15, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Legal Defense Fund) Despite the heavy backlash that erupted on social media and suggestions that she was describing Black people or other minorities as "disabled," Jackson's remarks were not unique — nor were they unique in the eyes of the Supreme Court. As she noted during the same exchange, the "disabled" terminology was used by the Supreme Court in a 2021 case, Allen v. Milligan, which also dealt with race-based redistricting issues in the state of Alabama and issues of discriminatory intent. In Milligan, Jackson said, the Supreme Court "used the word disabled — we said, that's a way in which you see that these processes are not equally open." The court's conservative majority seemed poised to significantly weaken Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, though to what extent it will do so remains to be seen.

Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law on Monday that approved a study on potential inequities in youth sports, including "race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, income, or geographic location." The Youth Sports for All Act, AB749, calls for a commission to be formed to carry out "an assessment of the need and potential for a centralized entity to improve access to and involvement in sports for all youth, regardless of race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, income, or geographic location, that addresses issues in youth sports." The listed issues include "How to foster a safe, supportive, and inclusive environment for youth sports." Gavin Newsom's office doubles down amid controversy over transgender athlete AB Hernandez in the San Jurupa Valley School District. The California Assembly's vote to pass AB749 comes months after it, and its Democrat majority, voted to block two bills that would have banned biological males from girls' sports on April 1. Now, the new law comes while the state is embroiled in a divisive culture war over trans athletes in girls' sports. The U.S. Department of Justice has sued the state's educational agencies for policies that enable biological males to compete in girls' sports, while 17 school districts have now passed a resolution to oppose those policies. California has been the largest state to defy President Donald Trump's "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" executive order, joining Democrat strongholds like Minnesota, Maine and Illinois in upholding state laws to protect trans inclusion. The California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) has allowed trans athletes to compete in girls' high school sports since 2014, when state law AB 1266 was enacted. As a result, the 17 school boards have made it a point to speak out against the state's Democratic leaders, and express their support for protecting girls' sports. Oakdale Joint Unified School District Board of Trustees President Clayton Schemper led the initiative. "As the Board President, I brought forth this resolution because to me, it's just common sense. There is clearly a biological difference between boys and girls and that is no more obvious than on the playing field," Schemper told Fox News Digital. "All we ask is that CIF stand for what is right and uphold its protections by ensuring fairness in girls' sports. Tonight, I encourage all school boards in California to do the same and to fight not only for, but alongside, our girls." Earlier in October, the biggest high school district by enrollment and land area in the state passed a similar resolution. Kern High School District regularly enrolls more than 40,000 students and employs more than 1,700 staff per year across its 31 schools, became the 16th district to do so on Oct. 6. Kern High School District (KHSD) trustee Derek Tisinger told Fox News Digital that he and his colleagues had to witness a Christian school forfeit to one of the schools in its district over a trans athlete last month. "People try to say, ‘hey, it only affects a small amount of people,' but there were probably 30 girls that practiced and dreamed their whole life about playing volleyball, and they didn't get to play," Tisinger said. This season, Jurupa Valley High School's girls' volleyball team has seen 10 regular-season games forfeited from its schedule, Fox News Digital previously reported. The team is currently embroiled in a national controversy after two of its senior players filed a lawsuit against the Jurupa Unified School District (JUSD), citing their experience with a trans athlete. Newsom's office previously provided a statement to Fox News Digital, deferring responsibility for the situation to the CIF, CDE and state legislature. "CIF is an independent nonprofit that governs high school sports. The California Department of Education is a separate constitutional office. CIF and the CDE have stated they follow existing state law — a law that was passed in 2013 and signed by Governor Jerry Brown (not Newsom) and in line with 21 other states. A bipartisan survey by the Public Policy Institute of California found the majority of California residents oppose biological male trans athletes competing in women's sports. That figure included more than 70% of the state's school parents. "Most Californians support requiring transgender athletes to compete on teams matching the sex they were assigned at birth," the poll stated. "Solid majorities of adults (65%) and likely voters (64%) support requiring that transgender athletes compete on teams that match the sex they were assigned at birth, not the gender they identify with. An overwhelming majority of public school parents (71%) support such a requirement." Jackson Thompson is a sports writer for Fox News Digital. He previously worked for ESPN and Business Insider.

(AP Photo/Jessica Hill, File) For many college basketball experts, selecting the greatest players of the women's poll era sounds easy — until they try it. But narrowing the list from there gets tricky, inevitably leaving out talented players, including those who sharpened their skills during later professional careers. And in the spirit of the Top 25 rankings, the choices are certain to spark a debate and prompt plenty of handwringing among those who were in a position to vote. “Nearly impossible,” Rebecca Lobo, a former UConn standout and NCAA champion, said of the assignment. But then I'm like wait, there's too many no-brainers and not enough slots.” They were instructed to consider only the athletes' college careers. “It was extraordinarily difficult especially to try to hone in on a players' college career and eliminate their pro career from your brain,” Lobo added. Taurasi helped UConn win three national championships, including carrying the Huskies to the last two basically on her own during her junior and senior season. There's so many great women who paved the way.” Clark led Iowa to back-to-back NCAA championship game appearances while setting the career scoring record for any Division I women's or men's basketball player. Iowa guard Caitlin Clark drives up court in the second half of a second-round college basketball game against West Virginia in the NCAA Tournament, Monday, March 25, 2024, in Iowa City, Iowa. “Being named an AP All-American is one of the most storied honors in college sports,” Clark said. Tennessee's Candace Parker (3) passes around North Carolina's La'Tangela Atkinson in the first half of the NCAA college basketball tournament regional final, Tuesday, March 28, 2006, in Cleveland. Miller, one of the original NCAA greats, starred for USC and led the Trojans to consecutive championships in 1983-84. “I grew up watching Cheryl Miller play,” Parker said. My dad was like ‘This is who we wanted you to be.' I'm honored to be on this list with her.” The second team's backcourt is UConn's Sue Bird and Virginia's Dawn Staley. The Lady Vols' Chamique Holdsclaw, UConn's Maya Moore and Lusia Harris of Delta State are on the second team frontcourt. Holdsclaw was a three-time NCAA champion and twice earned the tournament's MOP honor. Moore was part of the Huskies' dynasty that won a then-record 89 consecutive games. She helped the Huskies to consecutive titles in 2009-10. “I'd watch these two teams play and I'm not sure who would win,” UConn coach Geno Auriemma said of the first and second teams selected by the panel. Auriemma has four former players on the first two teams, but would enjoy looking to the bench at a group of reserves that includes: UCLA's Ann Meyers Drysdale, Kansas' Lynette Woodard and Texas Tech's Sheryl Swoopes in the backcourt. For the frontcourt, there is USC's Lisa Leslie, Baylor's Brittney Griner and South Carolina's A'ja Wilson. When you're great in one generation, you're going to be great in any generation,” said Meyers Drysdale, who also was a member of the voting panel. “I don't think there's any name that is wrong or there's any name that is right. There's so many great players that are going to be left off.” The voting panel included former players Deb Antonelli, Nancy Lieberman, Rebecca Lobo, Ann Meyers Drysdale, Christy Winters-Scott; poll founder Mel Greenberg and current and former AP sportswriters Aaron Beard, Oscar Dixon, Doug Feinberg, Stephen Hawkins, Janie McCauley, Chuck Schoffner and Teresa Walker.</p>

The 2022 NCAA women's swimming champion, Lia Thomas, who is transgender, will be the recipient of the Voice of Inspiration Award at Rainbow Labs' Violet Visionary Awards on Thursday. Thomas' national title sparked nationwide backlash and is considered one of the catalysts in the battle over transgender athlete participation in girls' and women's sports. The award"honors an individual whose story and actions ignite hope and courage within the LGBTQ+ community," according to Rainbow Labs' website. Penn Quakers swimmer Lia Thomas prepares for the 100 free at the NCAA Swimming & Diving Championships at Georgia Tech. We will uplift the power of LGBTQIA+ expression – in fashion, art, dance, voice, and story – as a revolutionary force fueling queer joy and collective freedom," the site says, adding that it will "[celebrate] LGBTQIA+ leaders, mentors, and changemakers who are lighting the way for the next generation." Riley Gaines, who competed against Thomas and tied the former UPenn swimmer at the national tournament, was not pleased. University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas and Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines react after finishing tied for fifth in the 200 freestyle finals at the NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships on March 18, 2022, in Atlanta Georgia. The only people Will Thomas inspires are other men who realized you can take everything from women – our records, our spaces, our opportunities – and still get a standing ovation," Gaines told OutKick, using Thomas' birth name. OutKick first reported on Thomas' recognition at the event. The event is sponsored by both the Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles Football Club, among others. Both clubs did not respond to a request from OutKick about whether Thomas should be honored as a "voice of inspiration." The Dodgers previously honored the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, a group of anti-Catholic drag "nuns," with their Community Hero Award at Pride Night in 2023. Their original invitation was rescinded after backlash from both fans and players, but they were reinvited, and the team issued an apology. Twenty-nine states have regulations regarding trans athletes in girls' and women's sports. President Donald Trump signed an executive order prohibiting trans athletes from competing against females in February.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump was telling a Rose Garden audience about his efforts to quell violence in the nation's capital when, as if on cue, his words were drowned out by the wail of sirens from passing vehicles. “Listen to the beauty of that sound,” Trump said, grinning. The moment encapsulated how Trump's law-and-order-at-all-costs push has become a centerpiece of his second term — something he said has surprised him. “Now it's like a passion for me,” Trump said on Wednesday as he touted the results of a crackdown named “Operation Summer Heat” in the Oval Office, during which he said the FBI had made 8,000-plus arrests. He's deployed troops to Democratic-majority cities and directed federal officials, often with their faces obscured by masks, to round up people living in the country illegally. He's suggested urban areas could become military “training grounds” and toyed with invoking the Insurrection Act so political opponents can't use the courts to foil his plans. Now settled into his second term, the Republican president has embraced the kind of tough-on-crime approach he was unable to achieve as naysayers checked his most extreme instincts during his first four years in office. FBI Director Kash Patel speaks during an event with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office at the White House, Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025, in Washington. Trump's efforts have drawn resistance from local leaders. But elsewhere, his moves have dramatically altered day-to-day lives. Earlier this year, he took control of the California National Guard in response to protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles and sent the National Guard into Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tennessee. Trump's embrace of the hardest possible line against crime suspects dates back to his days as a real estate mogul back in the gritty days of 1970s and '80s New York, when crime was rampant. His mindset burst into public view when he stirred racial tensions by calling for the execution of the Central Park Five, a group of Black and Hispanic teenagers wrongly convicted of rape in 1989. Bring Back Our Police!” Those convictions were vacated in 2002, after evidence linked a serial rapist to the crime. J. Lawrence Turner of the Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church in Memphis. But his advisers at the time staunchly opposed many of his calls to more broadly deploy the military to beat back unrest. Trump's former defense secretary Mark Esper later told CBS' “60 Minutes” that Trump had asked during the protests whether the National Guard could be tougher on demonstrators. Just shoot them in the legs, or something,'” Esper said he recalled Trump saying. However, a Trump signature bipartisan achievement in his first term was a 2018 criminal justice reform measure meant to reduce federal prison populations and address disparities in sentencing, after lobbying from advocates including Kim Kardashian. Trump was attacked from the right for that policy, though, during the 2024 Republican primary and rarely spoke about his criminal justice reform bill while campaigning. He instead drew cheers with calls for the death penalty for drug dealers and those who kill police officers. Trump now sees getting tough on crime as a winning political issue heading into next year's midterm elections. “We're going to save all of our cities, and we're going to make them essentially crime-free,” he said Wednesday. Recent polling from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found his administration's tough-on-crime approach has emerged as one of his best issues, amid frustrations over his handling of the economy and immigration. The vast majority of Americans, 81%, see crime as a “major problem” in large cities, even as statistics show violent crime is down across the nation following a coronavirus pandemic-era spike. The shift also reflects a Trump no longer encumbered by chiefs of staff, generals and others who saw their duty as reining in his most extreme impulses and have long been replaced by loyalists. “This time around, he has people around him that are not simply supporting what he's doing, they're encouraging him,” said Patrick G. Eddington, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. The White House rejects suggestions Trump's crackdown on crime has anything to do with race. In Portland and Chicago, as in Los Angeles previously, the goal is protection of federal authorities working on priorities like immigration enforcement. Still, deploying troops to cities gives Trump the opportunity to paint Democratic opponents as soft on crime while overstating — often in apocalyptic terms — how bad the problem really is. He spent weeks suggesting Portland is “on fire” and declared Washington “a raging hellhole.” He now suggests Washington crime has fallen to zero, which also isn't true. Maya Wiley, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said the administration's efforts are an extension of Trump's brand, which she described as “using race overtly to drive division, to consolidate a base and to use that to usurp power a president does not have, or should not be deemed to have.” Indeed, Trump now routinely speaks of criminals as people without redemption. “They're sick,” he said recently, “and we're taking them out.”</p>

Scoreboards at the National Assembly show the results of a no-confidence motion vote on French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu's government in Paris, Thursday, Oct. 16, 2025. PARIS (AP) — French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu survived two votes of no-confidence Thursday that could have toppled his fragile new government and plunged France deeper into political chaos. Lecornu's survival also spares any immediate need for President Emmanuel Macron to dissolve the National Assembly and call snap legislative elections, a hazardous option that the French leader took in 2024 and which he had signaled that he might take again if Lecornu fell. Lecornu, a close ally of the French president, faced two no-confidence motions filed by Macron's fiercest opponents — the hard-left France Unbowed party and Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Rally and her allies in Parliament. Le Pen's second motion got just 144 votes, well short of a majority, backed only by her party, its allied Union of the Right for the Republic and a handful of other lawmakers. “I am sure that there's a path,” she said. But Lecornu isn't out of the woods yet. To get the votes he needed, Lecornu dangled the possibility of rolling back one of the flagship but most unpopular reforms of Macron's second term as president, which will gradually raise France's retirement age from 62 to 64. With 69 lawmakers, Socialist backing for Lecornu's removal would have tipped the outcome against him. But just seven Socialists broke ranks in voting for the France Unbowed motion. The conservative Republicans, with 50 lawmakers, also withheld backing for Lecornu's removal, despite a fiery appeal for support from Éric Ciotti, a former Republicans leader who since 2024 has allied with Le Pen's far right. “Don't compromise yourselves by supporting this government. In the closest-run first motion, just one Republicans lawmaker backed Lecornu's removal. But for Le Pen's second motion, with lower stakes because it had little chance of succeeding, three Republicans broke ranks and voted against the prime minister, underscoring that conservative tolerance for Lecornu could quickly run dry in the coming weeks or months. Lecornu's still fragile position could yet crumble if Socialist or Republicans lawmakers change tack and support any future no-confidence votes if they don't get what they want in the budget negotiations that are sure to be fractious. Lecornu has promised not to use a special constitutional power to railroad the budget through Parliament without lawmakers' approval — which was the tool that Macron's government employed to impose the 2023 pension reform despite a firestorm of protests. Building consensus in Parliament for tax hikes, spending cuts and other budget measures to start reining in France's ballooning state deficit and debt promises to be extremely difficult, with the National Assembly deeply divided since Macron dissolved it in June 2024. The ensuing legislative elections produced no outright winner and precipitated the political deadlock that has gripped France ever since, with Macron's prime ministers falling in quick succession. The prospect of a hard-fought presidential race when Macron's second and last term ends in 2027 is also complicating consensus-building, with political parties already looking to score points with voters. Addressing lawmakers before they voted, Lecornu urged them to put those considerations aside for now. “History, in any case, will judge these political maneuvers very harshly, where the platform of the National Assembly has essentially been confused with an advertising platform,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During a joint town hall with Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez with CNN, host Kaitlan Collins asked about a hot topic for the past several months — whether the New York congresswoman would mount a primary challenge to the aging Schumer. “I mean, no!” Ocasio-Cortez said, exasperated and waving her hands. “I don't think this is about…” she added, trailing off, and joined by Sanders. “This is what we're talking about!” Ocasio-Cortez yelled with a nervous laugh. “You have a country that is falling apart!” he yelled. “And let me tell you what the real issue is, let's see if CNN talks about it,” the Vermont senator began, going on to outline his problems with the United States, including a lack of guaranteed healthcare, paid family leave, medical leave, the minimum wage, homelessness, Trump's treatment of climate change, and the presence of “oligarchs on top who have more and more power every day.” “Let's talk about that issue, not her own political future. Ocasio-Cortez has remained a favorite of the progressive Democratic cause, with her perceived stock rising as Democratic leaders struggle to counter the rising prominence of partisans to their left. Elsewhere in the town hall, Ocasio-Cortez continued positioning herself as a progressive Democratic leader in future elections by using inflammatory rhetoric against Republicans, claiming Republicans believe women are “inferior” and “don't deserve equal rights,” that LGBT people are “subhuman,” and uses “white supremacist” messaging to “radicalize a generation of young boys in particular, away from healthy masculinity and into an insecure masculinity that requires the domination of others who are poorer, browner, darker, or a different gender than them.” Despite this, she said that she will not “question your motive” or “allegiance to this country” if you disagree with her as a Republican, and that Republicans are stoking division.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A judge in Illinois said she has “serious concerns” over whether federal law enforcement agents are following her order to avoid violent encounters with protesters and journalists in Chicago. “I'm not happy,” Ellis said with evident exasperation in her voice. In response, Ellis announced Thursday she will require all federal agents with body cameras to have them on during encounters with immigration protesters. The judge initially required all agents to wear cameras, but agreed to some flexibility after Sean Skedzielewski, an attorney representing the Trump administration, said it would be logistically impossible to immediately equip all agents with bodycams. “It would require a tremendous amount of resources,” Skedzielewski said. Ellis – an Obama appointee – issued a temporary restraining order last week after a coalition of local journalists and protesters sued the Trump administration, saying federal law enforcement agents were targeting people engaging in peaceful activity, including multiple reporters who said they had pepper balls fired on them despite being identified as press. Since then, the plaintiffs said there are at least two incidents in which they believe agents did not follow the order, including a confrontation on Chicago's southeast side Tuesday following a traffic accident involving US Border Patrol. “There's a reason the Chicago Police Department has policies about car chases and where they occur, and where they need to stop,” said the judge. She also demanded that the field director of the Operation Midway Blitz appear in court on Monday at 10:30 a.m. local time, “to explain to me why I am seeing images of tear gas being deployed and reading reports that there were no warnings given before it was deployed out in the field.” Chase involving federal agents led to a crash and angry community response in Chicago Federal agents are also prohibited from using tear gas and less-lethal munitions on anyone who does not impose an “immediate threat to safety.” “You can't shoot ‘em in the head (with pepper balls),” Ellis said. Chicago Pastor Shot by ICE speaks to CNN in first TV interview: ‘We could hear them laughing.' Video of a pastor being repeatedly shot by pepper balls during a demonstration outside at an ICE facility near Chicago earlier this month drew widespread outcry. Skedzielewski suggested the news coverage that prompted the judge's anger may be misleading, saying Ellis is relying on “one-sided and selectively edited media reports.” Ellis acknowledged some details in news reports may be under dispute, adding that is why she wants to speak to the field director on Monday. JB Pritzker – who is not a party to the lawsuit – said Wednesday he was not convinced Ellis' order is being followed after continuing intense encounters. “They're the ones throwing tear gas when people are peacefully protesting.” Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino's role in Chicago.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democratic candidates raised more than Republicans in all but one of the five most competitive Senate races in recent months, new campaign fundraising reports show. Building cash reserves for next year's high-priced midterm battles could help Democrats as they try to flip four seats from Republicans, a difficult task that will require beating longtime GOP senators or winning in states that have turned unfriendly to progressives. His $12 million haul in the July-September window was more than twice the combined amount raised by three best-known Republicans vying to challenge him next year. He entered October with more than $21 million in cash reserves. His fundraising advantage is likely to dwindle once Republicans settle on their Senate nominee next year. Georgia GOP voters are deciding between former football coach Derek Dooley, who has the backing of Gov. Those totals exclude money the campaigns announced as coming from their joint fundraising committees. Adding those in, Cooper's political operation still outperformed Whatley's committees. Democrats view North Carolina as one of their best hopes for picking up a Republican seat next year, given the retirement of two-term GOP Sen. Thom Tillis. In Maine, Democrat and oyster farmer Graham Platner raised $3.2 million, exceeding the $1.9 million collected by five-term Republican Sen. Susan Collins, a top target for Democrats next year. Mills' first required financial disclosure — detailing her fundraising and spending in the final three months of 2025 — won't be due until early next year. Platner, a first-time candidate who has been endorsed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, has made clear he does not intend make way for Mills and released his first television ad this week. Jordan Wood, a former congressional aide who also is seeking the Democratic nomination, reported collecting nearly $1.5 million during the quarter, Federal Election Commission records show. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez discuss government shutdown in CNN town hall In neighboring New Hampshire, where Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen is retiring, Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas raised $1.8 million, outperforming former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, who brought in a little more than $968,000. Rep. Haley Stevens narrowly led the Democratic field with a $1.9 million haul. State Sen. Mallory McMorrow and former Wayne County health official Abdul El Sayed followed close behind.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump unveiled another project on Wednesday for revamping the country's capital, announcing plans to build a large triumphal arch to mark the 250th anniversary of American independence next year. Trump, who made a decadeslong career as one of the country's most prestigious developers, including with acclaimed projects on some of New York City's most valuable real estate, has taken great pride in bringing his builder's eye to Washington. As president, he has taken on a number of projects, including redoing the iconic Rose Garden and undertaking efforts to build a new ballroom in the White House. More than three dozen organizations and people attended the dinner in the East Room with Trump, including Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon. “Chief executives throughout history have contributed to making the White House special, and nothing of this magnitude has been done,” Trump told them. He thanked attendees for their contributions and told them leftover funds from the ballroom project would likely be used to construct the Independence Arch. That development is set to soar above the Lincoln Memorial. A top White House official said the arch was Trump's idea, according to CNN. Architect Nicolas Leo Charbonneau, a partner at Harrison Design, is leading the project. Charbonneau shared a watercolor sketch of the arc to X last month. “America needs a triumphal arch,” he said, adding the monument would be placed in the traffic circle in front of Arlington National Cemetery.</p>

Other Trump administration officials, including Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and Secretary of the Navy John Phelan, are also scheduled to speak, according to reports. As for closures and travel interruptions, Pirek said the only stoppages that will occur are some trains at Camp Pendleton. She mentioned there will be “multiple rehearsals” before Saturday's event, and a “detailed risk assessment” was conducted beforehand. “In advance of the training event and demonstration, we conducted a detailed risk assessment,” Pirek said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At first sight, in the third week of the government shutdown, things seem to be working out better than expected for the opposition party locked out of Washington power. They've made their key issue — looming health insurance premium hikes — a national story. And contrary to stereotype, they didn't immediately cave, showing supporters a backbone. In classic shutdown politics, this might have laid a decisive trap for their Republican opponents, as the human cost of the showdown mounts to create a political imperative for the party in power to find an off-ramp. But this is the nihilistic age of Trump. So assumptions that governed previous shutdowns over 30 years of bitter partisanship in Washington may not apply. Republicans are willing to talk about extending the subsidies but won't do so until Democrats back down and vote to reopen the government on their terms. “Anyone that thinks that tomorrow they'll suddenly start negotiating, I think is smoking something that is illegal in many states,” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who votes with Democrats, said at a CNN town hall on Wednesday night. Senate Republican Majority leader John Thune told MSNBC Thursday he could guarantee Democrats a vote on extending Obamacare subsidies but could not guarantee the measure would pass. Shutdowns usually end when the political, human and economic pressure becomes so acute that one party has to quit. A week ago, there was signs President Donald Trump might be tempted by the chance of a deal, and seemed less dialed into the Republican strategy of defiance. He's fired thousands of federal workers and is promising more will lose their jobs in a calculated show of spite to Democrats. Democrats' efforts to highlight their campaign is also difficult amid the kaleidoscope of chaos constantly stirred by a president who has — for now — made peace in Gaza; threatened to send troops to more US cities; and might have unleashed a regime-change campaign in Venezuela in a single week. In Washington, at least, the health care issue keeps getting drowned out. And Trump's willingness to ignore legal constraints and apparent belief that federal money is his own personal political slush fund opened the way to workarounds so he can pay service members and FBI agents while other furloughed federal workers go without wages. Trump plans to divert tariff revenues to keep nutrition assistance for pregnant women and mothers of young children from running out. By delaying the expiration of such funding, he may be able to defray political damage and set the stage for weeks more of shutdown. It's also unclear whether Trump — a billionaire who probably hasn't lined up at a crowded airport security checkpoint in decades and who often seems to be looking out mostly for himself — is susceptible to the mounting tales of human anguish and inconvenience imposed by the shutdown. And he sure doesn't feel the stigma of heading a government that is closed. Indeed, he's used the opportunity to further eviscerate a federal machine devastating by his indiscriminate job cuts. He's not destroying the town to save it. Or can they hit on a political incentive for the president to tempt him into talking and a possible deal in a way that would undercut House Speaker Mike Johnson's position? But they will keep coming up against the same problem. This is a president who denied the result of a free and fair election, who declined to bow out of politics when he was convicted of a crime, and who seems to regard the Constitution as a list of rules to be flouted. With this track record, there's no reason to believe that any pressure will force him to change his behavior. Democrats must also consider whether the mounting consequences of the impasse, in terms of lost jobs, missed pay checks for federal workers, and economic and social fallout, can be justified by any feasible political result. “I just don't see what's going to get us out of it, because what my Democratic colleagues are asking for, you know this, it's just not realistic,” Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy told CNN's Manu Raju. Democratic leaders might also have expected more blowback to Johnson's refusal to recall the House, but complaints that lawmakers are loafing off while citizens get hurt don't yet seem to be cutting through. Early polling showed that most voters blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, but more recent surveys suggest the politics have not yet turned disastrous for either party. One problem for Democrats is that they are viewed so unfavorably by Americans there may be little confidence they can do anything right. Still, the core Democratic argument in the shutdown is potent because it's rooted in a concern millions of Americans share — rising health care costs and the seemingly endless premium spikes that batter consumers every year. Proof that they are fighting on the right ground can be seen in the way many Republicans agree with their position — most notably pro-Trump Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley said Wednesday that he was facing no pressure from his constituents to end the shutdown. People understand it's over health care,” he said. This explains why winning a simple concession on ACA subsidies, for instance, may not be enough to declare a political victory, even if a comprehensive win may not be realistic. For nearly 10 months, Democrats have been battered by Trump. Programs their voters hold dear have been destroyed. The democracy they cherish has come under severe assault. And a party that has been wandering the wilderness looking for purpose has been able to do almost nothing to stop it. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine represents Virginia, which borders the capital and, along with Maryland, stands to suffer most from federal government firings and furloughs. But Kaine told CNN's Jake Tapper on Wednesday that his voters aren't ready to give in. We are tiring of the layoffs, we're tired of canceling economic development projects and having funds pulled back from the state. Unless sentiments change among Kaine's voters, it may be a while before Democratic senators feel unbearable pressure to call a halt. The next outside leverage point may be Thanksgiving, when the annual travel crush would be a nightmare amid airport security delays and air traffic control snarls caused by workers calling in sick after working weeks without a paycheck. But the holiday is still six weeks away. This story has been updated with additional details.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crust-less sandwiches from Smucker's and Trader Joe's are displayed, Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025, in Detroit. Smucker's crust-less sandwiches are displayed on shelf at a Target in Warren, Mich., Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025. Crust-less sandwiches are displayed on shelf at a Trader Joe's grocery story in Royal Oak, Mich., Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025. Smucker Co. is suing Trader Joe's, alleging the grocery chain's new frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are too similar to Smucker's Uncrustables in their design and packaging. In the lawsuit, which was filed Monday in federal court in Ohio, Smucker said the round, crustless sandwiches Trader Joe's sells have the same pie-like crimp markings on their edges that Uncrustables do. Trader Joe's boxes also show a sandwich with a bite mark taken out of it, which is similar to the Uncrustables design, Smucker said. “Smucker does not take issue with others in the marketplace selling prepackaged, frozen, thaw-and-eat crustless sandwiches. But it cannot allow others to use Smucker's valuable intellectual property to make such sales,” the company said in its lawsuit. A message seeking comment was left Wednesday with Trader Joe's, which is based in Monrovia, California. Michael Kelber, chair of the intellectual property group at Neal Gerber Eisenberg, a Chicago law firm, said Smucker's registered trademarks will help bolster its argument. But Trader Joe's might argue that the crimping on its sandwiches is simply functional and not something that can be trademarked, Kelber said. But it wasn't easy to mass produce them. Smucker spent years trying to perfect Uncrustables' stretchy bread and developing new filling flavors like chocolate and hazelnut. Kelber said one of the biggest issues companies debate in cases like this one is whether the copycat product deceives consumers. Smucker claims that's already happening with Trader Joe's sandwiches. In the lawsuit, Smucker showed a social media photo of a person claiming that Trader Joe's is contracting with Smucker to make the sandwiches under its own private label. This isn't the first time Smucker has taken legal action to protect its Uncrustables brand. In 2022, it sent a cease and desist letter to a Minnesota company called Gallant Tiger, which was making upscale versions of crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with crimped edges. Smucker said Wednesday that it hasn't taken further action but continues to monitor Gallant Tiger. Smucker likely felt it had no choice but to sue this time around, Kelber said. “For the brand owner, what is the point of having this brand if I'm not going to enforce it?” Kelber said. Kelber said trademark cases often wind up being settled because neither company wants to go through an expensive trial. Smucker's lawsuit comes a few months after a similar lawsuit filed against the Aldi by Mondelez International, which claimed that Aldi's store-brand cookies and crackers have packaging that is too similar to Mondelez brands like Chips Ahoy, Wheat Thins and Oreos.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“It was destined for me,” Reese said during an interview before the show began. I'm so happy to be sitting in this room with so many amazing models and women. The team that put this all together has been amazing. Reese said she hired a modeling coach to “perfect my walk.” “I walk, sleep, hoop,” she said. Reese, 23, made her debut on the Victoria Secret runway wearing pink floral lingerie set adorned with blossoms and lace detailing, paired with a dramatic feathered stole draped across her arms. The wrap was covered in soft pink and rose-toned textures. The 6-foot-3 Reese donned the signature angel white wings that have defined the show for decades, a new stage for an athlete known for her confidence, charisma and crossover appeal. She walked to the tune of Lumidee's “Never Leave You (Uh Oooh, Uh Oooh. Reese is a former Louisiana State University national champion and NCAA tournament most outstanding player in 2023. “One of her biggest dreams was to walk this show,” said celebrity stylist Law Roach, a co-host on the pink carpet who helped reinvent Zendaya, turned Celine Dion into a fashion icon and is a close friend to Reese. I told her, ‘I don't think that's a big dream at all. “And for that to happen in a year or less, that she's walking the show and, I mean, she looks stunning, like the hair, the makeup, her presence, she's ready, she's excited. The show was livestreamed on YouTube, Instagram, TikTok and Prime Video in the U.S. The show is a mix of music and celebrities, with Madison Beer sporting pink wings performing “Make You Mine” with lingerie-clad models strutting on the catwalk. K-pop group TWICE hit the runway too, performing “This is For” and “Strategy.” Karol G sang “Ivonny Bonita” before she walked solo in red wings and lingerie ensemble. Reese has become one of the most visible figures in women's sports. Her style, outspokenness and social media influence have helped bridge the gap between sports, fashion and pop culture. The lingerie show began in 2001 and took place annually for nearly two decades. Victoria's Secret canceled the show in 2019, but brought it back last year, with Reese attending.
