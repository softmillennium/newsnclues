                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Genome-wide sequencing revealed a previously undescribed variant in the PPIB gene (peptidylprolyl isomerase B). This gene contains the blueprint for an enzyme that helps proteins in the body to adopt their correct structure and breaks down proteins with faulty structures.In cultured cells from affected individuals, the research team showed that this gene variant impairs the function of mitochondria - the "power plants" of cells. Impaired mitochondrial function is detectable in most known forms of hereditary optic atrophy. By analysing archived genome data, a total of twelve additional affected individuals carrying the same genetic mutation were identified in eight other families. "We have thus succeeded in describing the PPIB gene as a new optic atrophy gene," says study leader Wolfgang M. Schmidt from the Center for Anatomy and Cell Biology at MedUni Vienna, summarising the results of the research. "The identification of this genetic variant creates the possibility of a genetic diagnosis, which has been lacking in many cases," adds co-study leader Thomas P. Georgi from the Department of Ophthalmology at Med Uni Graz. The disease can be inherited; around 20 forms of optic atrophy are currently known. Most variants involve a disturbance of mitochondrial function. Despite advances in genetic diagnostics, the exact genetic cause remains unclear in around 60 percent of those affected.This study - a collaboration between the Center for Anatomy and Cell Biology at MedUni Vienna, the Department of Ophthalmology and Optometry at MedUni Vienna, the Center for Cancer Research at MedUni Vienna and the University Eye Clinic at MedUni Graz - has now filled this gap with regard to the PPIB gene. Future studies will clarify how exactly the PPIB variant influences cell metabolism and whether further genetic changes in this gene are associated with optic atrophy. A recurrent missense variant in the PPIB gene encoding peptidylprolyl isomerase B underlies adult-onset autosomal dominant optic atrophy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While plowing a wheat field in rural Washington state in the 1990s, William Wallace spotted a gray plane overhead that he believed was releasing chemicals to make him sick. The rancher began to suspect that all white vapor trails from aircraft might be dangerous. He shared his concern with reporters, acknowledging it sounded a little like "The X Files," a science fiction television show. Its treatment as a serious issue underscores that under President Donald Trump, unscientific ideas have unusual power to take hold and shape public health policy. The concept posits that airplane vapor trails, or contrails, are really "chemtrails" containing toxic substances that poison people and the terrain. Another version alleges planes or devices are being deployed by the federal government, private companies, or researchers to trigger big weather changes, such as hurricanes, or to alter the Earth's climate, emitting hazardous chemicals in the process. Several GOP lawmakers and leaders in the Trump administration remain convinced the concepts are legitimate, though scientists have sought to discredit such claims. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is planning to investigate climate and weather control, and is expected to create a task force that will recommend possible federal action, according to a former agency official, an internal agency memo obtained by KFF Health News, and a consultant who helped with the memo. The plans, along with comments by top GOP lawmakers, show how rumors and conspiracy theories can gain an air of legitimacy due to social media and a political climate infused with falsehoods, some political scientists and researchers say. The agency has interviewed applicants to lead a "chemtrails" task force, said Jim Lee, a blogger focused on weather and climate who Delany said helped edit the memo, which Lee confirmed. "HHS does not comment on future or potential policy decisions and task forces," agency spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in an email. The memo alleges that "aerosolized heavy metals such as Aluminum, Barium, and Strontium, as well as other materials such as sulfuric acid precursors, are sprayed into the atmosphere under the auspices of combatting global warming," through a process of stratospheric aerosol injection, or SAI. The memo claims, without providing evidence, that the substances cause elevated heavy-metal content in the atmosphere, soil, and waterways, and that aluminum is a toxic product used in SAI linked to dementia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, asthma-like illnesses, and other chronic illnesses. The July 14 memo was addressed to White House health adviser Calley Means, who didn't respond to a voicemail left by a reporter seeking comment. High-level federal government officials are presenting false claims as facts without evidence and referring to events that not only haven't occurred but, in many cases, are physically impossible, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California. In May, he was asked on "Dr. Phil Primetime" about chemicals being sprayed into the stratosphere to change the Earth's climate. "It's done, we think, by DARPA," Kennedy said, referring to a Department of Defense agency that develops emerging technology for the military's use. We're bringing on somebody who's going to think only about that." DARPA officials didn't return a message seeking comment. Deploying chemtrails to poison people is just one of many baseless conspiracy theories that have found traction among Trump administration health policy officials led by Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist before entering politics. He continues to promote a supposed link between vaccines and autism, as well as make statements connecting fluoride in drinking water to arthritis, bone fractures, thyroid disease, and cancer. The World Health Organization says fluoride is safe when used as recommended. "This is an issue that really matters to MAHA," said Delany, referring to the informal movement associated with Kennedy that is composed of people who are skeptical of evidence-based medicine. "It is unconscionable that anyone should be allowed to spray known neurotoxins and environmental toxins over our nation's citizens, their land, food and water supplies," Delany's memo states. Scientists, meteorologists, and other branches of the federal government say these assertions are largely incorrect. Some points in the memo are accurate, including concerns that commercial aircraft contribute to acid rain. But critics say the memo builds on kernels of truth before veering into unscientific fringe theories. Efforts to control the weather are being made, largely by states and local governments seeking to combat droughts, but the results are modest and highly localized. It isn't possible to manipulate large-scale weather events, scientists say. Severe flooding in the United Arab Emirates in 2024 couldn't have been caused by weather manipulation because no technology could create that kind of rainfall event, Maarten Ambaum, a meteorologist at the University of Reading who studies Gulf region rainfall patterns, said in a statement on the floods. Similar debunked claims emerged this year after central Texas experienced devastating floods. Research into changing the climate has been conducted, including work by one private company that engaged in field tests. Still, federal agencies say no ongoing or large-scale projects are underway. "Solar geoengineering is not occurring via direct delivery by commercial aircraft and is not associated with aviation contrails," the agency says on its website. Misperceptions about weather, climate control, and airplane contrails extend beyond the Trump administration, scientists said. In September, a congressional House committee hearing titled “Playing God With the Weather — A Disastrous Forecast" involved two hours of debate on the once-fringe idea. Frequently citing chemtrails, GOP lawmakers have introduced legislation in about two dozen states to ban weather modification or geoengineering. Florida passed a bill to establish an online portal so residents can report alleged violations. Ron DeSantis said in a press statement this spring. Bill Maher dove into the chemtrail myth on his podcast "Club Random," saying, "This is nuts. And "Chemtrails," a psychological thriller, wrapped filming in July. Social media has given wing to the chemtrails concept and other fringe ideas involving public health. There is no evidence of such a link, public health leaders say. There is no evidence of such a connection, scientists and researchers say. More severe weather events due to global warming may be driving some of the baseless theories, scientists say. And risks occur when such ideas take hold among the general population or policymakers, some public health leaders say. Climate researchers, including Swain, say they've received death threats. The memo and focus at HHS on climate and weather control are alarming because they perpetuate conspiracies, said David Keith, a professor of geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Imposter participants are individuals who provide deceptive or inaccurate data to take part in health research or automated computer 'bots' that mimic human behavior and responses. The issue has grown in recent years as online recruitment has become central to modern health research and can impact all types of studies, from surveys to randomized controlled trials. Although some reports suggest that monetary benefit is a driver, not all studies offer financial incentives, so other motives, such as boredom, curiosity, or even an ideological intent to disrupt research, may also play a role. A 2025 review showed that 18 of 23 studies that looked for imposter participants in their data sets found them, with rates ranging from 3% to a high of 94%. Researchers should routinely integrate imposter participant detection and prevention into online research, while considering the potential effect on their study population, write the authors. Common safeguards include identity verification procedures or CAPTCHA tests (asking participants to complete a task, such as to read and type distorted letters). At a minimum, they say studies should transparently report which safeguards were used and acknowledge their limitations, and journals should encourage consistent and transparent reporting of these safeguards. Funders and institutions should also invest in infrastructure and training to help researchers keep pace with evolving tactics, while clinicians and policymakers should be cautious when interpreting studies that use online recruitment if imposter participant prevention is not mentioned. They concluded, "Imposter participants are more than a nuisance; they are a systemic threat to health research. In an age where online recruitment underpins everything from randomized controlled trials to surveys, they risk undermining the integrity of health research and the decisions built on it."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The prevalence of obesity in the United States could rise sharply under a new definition of obesity released earlier this year by the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology Commission. Researchers from Mass General Brigham found that when applying the new criteria, which expands upon the traditional use of body mass index (BMI) to include measures of body fat distribution, the prevalence of obesity increased from about 40 percent to about 70 percent among over 300,000 people included in their study. The rise was even more pronounced among older adults. Additionally, the researchers found that those newly added individuals also had a higher risk of adverse health outcomes. Their results are published in JAMA Network Open. Lindsay Fourman, MD, Study Co-First Author and Endocrinologist, Metabolism Unit, Endocrinology Division, Department of Medicine, Mass General Brigham Traditionally, obesity has been defined by BMI, which estimates body fat based on a person's weight and height. But other anthropomorphic measures-such as waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, or waist-to-hip ratio-may further account for fat distribution and aid in differentiation between muscle and fat mass. Under the new framework, a person is classified as having obesity if they have a high BMI plus at least one elevated anthropometric measure (a condition the authors term "BMI-plus-anthropometric obesity"), or if they have a normal BMI and at least two elevated anthropometric measures (a condition termed "anthropometric-only obesity"). The new definition also distinguishes between preclinical and clinical obesity, with clinical obesity defined as the presence of obesity-related physical impairment or organ dysfunction. This increase was entirely driven by the inclusion of individuals with anthropometric-only obesity. Importantly, the study found that those with anthropometric-only obesity – who would not have been classified as having obesity by the traditional definition – had a higher risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality than people without obesity. "We have always recognized the limitations of BMI as a single marker for obesity because it doesn't take into account body fat distribution," said senior author Steven Grinspoon, MD, Chief of the Metabolism Unit in the Endocrinology Division of the Mass General Brigham Department of Medicine. "Seeing an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in this new group of people with obesity, who were not considered to have obesity before, brings up interesting questions about obesity medications and other therapeutics." The researchers emphasize that further studies are needed to better understand the causes of and optimal treatments for anthropometric-only obesity. The research team previously developed a therapeutic that reduces waist circumference and plans to explore the utility of different treatment strategies in this newly defined population. "Identifying excess body fat is very important as we're finding that even people with a normal BMI but with abdominal fat accumulation are at increased health risk," Fourman said. "Body composition matters – it's not just pounds on a scale."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study, led by experts at the University of Nottingham, has found that combining certain types of dietary supplements is more effective than single prebiotics or omega-3 in supporting immune and metabolic health, which could lower the risk of conditions linked to chronic inflammation. The kefir and prebiotic mix was provided by Chuckling Goat Ltd. It contains a mix of naturally occurring probiotic bacteria and yeasts, which form during the traditional fermentation of goat's milk with live kefir grains. These grains are living cultures that house dozens of beneficial microbial species. When kefir (rich in live beneficial microbes) is combined with a diverse prebiotic fiber (which feeds them), a synbiotic effect is obtained - the fiber nourishes the microbes, helping them thrive and produce beneficial metabolites like butyrate, which has anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating effects throughout the body. Over six weeks, healthy participants taking the synbiotic saw the broadest reduction in inflammation-related proteins compared to those taking omega-3 or fiber alone. The findings suggest that pairing beneficial microbes with prebiotic fiber could help support immune and metabolic health more effectively than single supplements. Systemic inflammatory markers are signals in the blood that show how much inflammation is happening throughout the body, not just in one specific area, like the gut or an infection. The findings of the study showed that the participants' overall levels of inflammation across their whole body went down, suggesting an improvement in general immune balance and lower risk for conditions linked to chronic inflammation (like heart disease or other metabolic conditions). Our study shows that while all three dietary approaches reduced inflammation, the synbiotic - combining fermented kefir with a diverse prebiotic fiber mix - had the most powerful and wide-ranging effects. This suggests that the interaction between beneficial microbes and dietary fiber may be key to supporting immune balance and metabolic health."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at the Medical University of Vienna have taken a closer look at a previously largely unknown component of the immune system: the protein molecule TRAT1 (T Cell Receptor Associated Transmembrane Adaptor 1) plays a central role in how so-called T helper cells (a specialised subgroup of immune cells) distinguish between attack and self-control - an important mechanism for restraining inflammation and preventing autoimmune diseases. The T helper cell compartment is divided into effector T helper cells, which actively fight intruders, and regulatory T cells (Treg), which prevent an excessive immune response. Until now, only part of how this balance is controlled was understood. A research team at the Medical University of Vienna, led by Ralf Schmidt and Klaus Schmetterer (Department of Laboratory Medicine), has now been able to show that TRAT1 acts like a switch in these processes. If TRAT1 is switched off using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tool, these cells become more active but lose their ability to produce certain inflammatory messengers such as interleukin-17. In the "protective" cells (Treg), on the other hand, TRAT1 supports their inhibitory function - but in a complex way: it enhances the suppression of other immune cells, but not uniformly for all cell types. Our data show that TRAT1 is a dual regulator of the immune system. Klaus Schmetterer, Study Leader and Professor, Medical University of Vienna However, these results, which were determined in cell culture, also have high clinical relevance: altered expression patterns of TRAT1 were found in data series of immune cells from patients with graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and systemic lupus erythematosus. "In the long term, these findings could also help to develop new cell-based immunotherapies - such as tailor-made CAR-Treg cells that specifically prevent unwanted immune reactions. We have already been able to prove this in a novel 3-dimensional cell culture model for transplant rejection," explains Tobias Frey, first author of the study.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Led in Ireland by consultant neurologists Professor Norman Delanty of RCSI and Beaumont Hospital and Dr Daniel Costello of Cork University Hospital (CUH) – two of the country's busiest neurology departments – the trial involves multiple sites across Europe, with Irish patients making up more than half of those enrolled. Short-term EEGs (typically around 30 minutes) and seizure diaries can be unreliable, especially when seizures are infrequent or hard to classify. While inpatient video-EEG in Epilepsy Monitoring Units (EMUs) remains the gold standard, it is resource-intensive and difficult to access. Ireland has just six dedicated EMU beds, and patients often require hospital stays of up to eight days. The trial in collaboration with Danish medical technology company UNEEG Medical A/S, focuses on the use of UNEEG EpiSight, a subcutaneous EEG (sqEEG) system that enables remote monitoring of brain activity for up to 36 months in people with epilepsy. Designed as a complementary tool within epilepsy services, the UNEEG EpiSight records continuously, including during sleep, and transmits data wirelessly to support clinical decision-making. Implantation is performed through a brief outpatient procedure, carried out by Consultant Neurosurgeons Mr Kieron Sweeney at Beaumont and Beacon Hospitals, and Mr Wail Mohammad at Cork University Hospital, along with their expert teams. The innovation builds on promising findings from a previous study led by Professor Delanty, Consultant Neurologist at Beaumont Hospital, FutureNeuro Investigator and Honorary Clinical Professor at RCSI, recently published in Epilepsia, which showed that an earlier version of the technology reliably detected all recorded seizures and 90% of significant brain abnormalities in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. This trial will assess whether long-term, outpatient sqEEG monitoring can address these challenges. By capturing brain activity in real-world settings over extended periods, the system could help clinicians detect seizure patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed, particularly those that happen at night, support earlier diagnosis, and reduce the need for repeated hospital visits. Professor Delanty said: "FutureNeuro's involvement reflects our commitment to embracing the huge progress in the safe use of technology in clinical practice. This trial will help us better understand the clinical impact of long-term brain monitoring, with the potential for significant downstream benefits – such as reducing inpatient admissions, shortening time to diagnosis, and avoiding unnecessary treatments. Dr Daniel Costello added: "This diagnostic tool holds significant potential for clinical care. It could help detect seizures that go unrecognised, provide a clearer picture of seizure frequency, and reveal the cumulative impact on brain function. The potential to monitor brain activity long-term, outside of hospital, is an important step forward." We are excited by the potential of this trial and delighted that so many Irish patients are involved, highlighting the world-class epilepsy research taking place here. This innovative technology could provide that insight without long hospital stays or lengthy waiting lists, improving quality of life for people with epilepsy while easing pressures on hospital services. We will follow this important trial closely and look forward to its findings." This trial represents a fundamental shift toward precision medicine in epilepsy care, where treatment decisions can be based on comprehensive, objective data rather than limited traditional monitoring methods.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a global public health threat. Recent reports estimated that 4.95 million deaths in 2019 were associated with AMR. Beyond antibiotics, it has also been shown that the use of nonantibiotic medications (NAMs), such as diuretics, statins, and proton pump inhibitors, contributes to the emergence of AMR. Australian researchers led by Henrietta Venter at the University of South Australia, Adelaide, conducted laboratory experiments to determine whether commonly used NAMs, at concentrations similar to those found in the intestinal environment of nursing home residents, could enhance ciprofloxacin-induced mutagenesis in Escherichia coli. The drugs tested included ibuprofen, diclofenac, acetaminophen (paracetamol), furosemide, metformin, atorvastatin, tramadol, temazepam, and pseudoephedrine. The researchers chose nursing homes as a model environment because older adults often take multiple medications, not only antibiotics but also analgesics, sleep aids, and antihypertensive drugs. Some individuals may take up to nine different medications per day. This population also represents one of the highest consumers of antibiotics, which are frequently overused in long-term care facilities for treating urinary and respiratory infections. Because NAMs are often prescribed alongside antibiotics, the team measured mutation frequencies in the presence of ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic known to induce genetic mutations and widely used to treat urinary tract infections, among the most common bacterial infections in older adults. The frequent use of ciprofloxacin has already led to the emergence of ciprofloxacin-resistant E coli, posing a growing threat in nursing home settings. To test the effect of the nine NAMs, as well as combinations of two NAMs, researchers evaluated mutation frequency in two E coli strains: E coli BW25113 (a derivative of the standard laboratory strain E coli K-12) and E coli 6146, which was isolated from the feces of a nursing home resident. The antimicrobial susceptibility of mutants induced by NAM exposure was then assessed, and the genetic mechanisms of resistance were analyzed through whole-genome sequencing. Overall, the results showed that two commonly used painkillers, ibuprofen and acetaminophen, can significantly exacerbate antibiotic resistance through mutation at concentrations relevant to the gut. This was reflected in an increased number of bacterial mutants and higher maximum cell density. When bacteria were exposed to both ibuprofen and acetaminophen, the resulting mutation frequency was similar to that of ibuprofen alone, suggesting no cumulative effect from combining the two drugs. In addition, mutants from both E coli strains, BW25113 and 6146, exhibited reduced sensitivity (atleast fourfold) to multiple antibiotics.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers say the findings underscore the critical need for accessible physician wellness programs and reduced stigma around doctors seeking help. Meanwhile, general hepatologists had lower rates of unhealthy alcohol use (11.2%) compared to U.S. physicians overall, (15.3%). Transplant hepatologists regularly counsel their patients on evidence-based treatments for alcohol use disorder, yet our findings suggest that many within this specialty may themselves benefit from similar support. We need to normalize access to confidential, high-quality treatment and remove the stigma and fear of professional consequences that often prevent physicians from seeking help." The survey, conducted among American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases members, provided several insights into alcohol use behaviors of hepatologists including: Among the recommendations in the study: normalizing access to physician wellness and treatment programs; confidential access to counseling and alcohol use disorder treatments; and reducing stigma about attending state physician health wellness programs, which Patel said have shown success. "Creating a culture that supports self-referral and early intervention is crucial for physician health and, ultimately, patient care." Patel said this may suggest the prevalence of unhealthy alcohol use may be higher than reported in the survey.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brain organoid models with Neanderthal genetics were more susceptible to the impacts of lead than human brains, suggesting that lead exposure was more harmful to Neanderthals. Until now, scientists believed lead exposure was largely a modern phenomenon, linked to human activities such as mining, smelting, and the use of leaded petrol and paint. By analysing 51 fossil teeth from hominid and great ape species, including Australopithecus africanus, Paranthropus robustus, early Homo, Neanderthals, and Homo sapiens, the team discovered clear chemical signatures of intermittent lead exposure stretching back almost two million years. Using high-precision laser-ablation geochemistry at Southern Cross University's GARG Facility (located in Lismore, NSW) and Mount Sinai's Exposomics state-of-the-art facilities, the researchers found distinctive 'lead bands' in the teeth, formed during childhood as the enamel and dentine grew. These bands reveal repeated episodes of lead uptake from both environmental sources (such as contaminated water, soil, or volcanic activity) and from the body's own bone stores, released during stress or illness. Our data show that lead exposure wasn't just a product of the Industrial Revolution – it was part of our evolutionary landscape." Professor Renaud Joannes-Boyau, Head of the GARG research group, Southern Cross University "This means that the brains of our ancestors developed under the influence of a potent toxic metal, which may have shaped their social behaviour and cognitive abilities over millennia." Using human brain organoids, miniature, lab-grown models of the brain, they compared the effects of lead on two versions of a key developmental gene called NOVA1, a gene known to orchestrate gene expression upon lead exposure during neurodevelopment. The modern human version of NOVA1 is different from that found in Neanderthals and other extinct hominids, but until now, scientists did not know why this change evolved. This effect was far less pronounced in organoids with the modern NOVA1 variant. "These results suggest that our NOVA1 variant may have offered protection against the harmful neurological effects of lead," said Professor Alysson Muotri, Professor of Pediatrics/Cellular & Molecular Medicine and Director of the UC San Diego Sanford Stem Cell Institute Integrated Space Stem Cell Orbital Research Center. "It's an extraordinary example of how an environmental pressure, in this case, lead toxicity, could have driven genetic changes that improved survival and our ability to communicate using language, but which now also influence our vulnerability to modern lead exposure." The altered FOXP2 activity in particular points to a possible link between ancient lead exposure and the evolutionary refinement of language abilities in modern humans. While lead exposure today is mostly due to human industry, it remains a serious global health issue, particularly for children. The findings underscore how deeply intertwined environmental toxins and human biology have been and warn that our vulnerability to lead may be an inherited legacy of our past. "Our work not only rewrites the history of lead exposure," added Professor Joannes-Boyau, "it also reminds us that the interaction between our genes and the environment has been shaping our species for millions of years, and continues to do so." The study analysed fossil teeth from Africa, Asia, Europe, and Oceania, using advanced geochemical mapping to identify patterns of childhood lead exposure. Laboratory experiments with brain organoids carrying either modern or archaic NOVA1 genes examined the effects of lead on brain development, with a focus on FOXP2, a gene central to speech and language. Genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data were integrated to build a comprehensive picture of how lead may have influenced the evolution of hominid social behaviour and cognition.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why are we able to recall only some of our past experiences? A new study led by Jun Nagai at the RIKEN Center for Brain Science in Japan has an answer. Surprisingly, it turns out that the brain cells responsible for stabilizing memories aren't neurons. Published in the scientific journal Nature on Oct 15, the study shows how emotionally intense experiences like fear biologically tag small groups of astrocytes for several days so that they can re-engage when a mouse recalls the experience. It is this repeated astrocytic engagement that stabilizes memories. But when it became clear that engrams-the actual memory traces that exist in neurons-cannot alone account for stabilized, long-term memories, Nagai and his team turned to astrocytes for a solution. Neurons produce a protein called Fos when activated, and experiences can also trigger Fos production in some astrocytes. To monitor how astrocytes across the whole brain respond during learning and recall, the researchers developed a new system that can fluorescently label astrocytes with active Fos, but not neurons, and only if Fos is active during a specific time period, which is controlled by giving an animal a shot of 4-OHT. Further experiments showed that Fos activity in these astrocytes requires input from the neurons in the amygdala that form the fear-memory engram in question, as well as simultaneous input from neurons that use the compound noradrenaline as a transmitter. So why does the Fos activity in astrocytes only happen during recall? To confirm their theories, when the researchers blocked Fos⁺ astrocyte signaling during recall, the mice had unstable memories and did not react as if they remembered anything during the recall test. On the flip-side, when the team forced the astrocytes to activate, animals were able to recall only mildly unpleasant experiences as if they were very unpleasant and even generalized their recalled experiences to other cages where they never experienced anything unpleasant. Nagai says that in the short term, their discovery could help us understand PTSD and related conditions in which emotionally intense memories persist abnormally or are activated by overgeneralized objects in the environment. As he explains, "these findings could lead to new therapeutic approaches that target the astrocytic memory switch, leading to therapies that gently dampen traumatic memories while sparing others." Beyond biology, the astrocyte-tagging process might inspire AI models that mimic human memory filtering. Current AI systems are data-hungry and energy-intensive; by learning from astrocytes-which select memories efficiently based on emotional salience and recurrence-we may design more energy-efficient, context-aware AI systems that remember just enough." Jun Nagai at the RIKEN Center for Brain Science The team's next goal is to figure out how astrocytes become "eligible" to gate memory stabilization and to test whether specific types of memories can be suppressed or enhanced by manipulating them. The astrocytic ensemble acts as a multiday trace to stabilize memory.
