T-Mobile has turned the wireless industry on its head with an offer that sounds too good to be true: free iPhone 17 devices for practically anyone who walks through their doors. Whether you're a loyal customer or someone fed up with your current carrier's inflated prices, T-Mobile is handing out Apple's latest flagship phones at zero cost. And if you're bringing the entire family along, T-Mobile will give you up to four lines of unlimited service for just one hundred dollars per month, with each line qualifying for its own complimentary iPhone 17. Their first quarter 2025 readings revealed T-Mobile's decisive lead over the competition in speed and total performance. The company's been methodically growing its coverage area with 5G and adds towers and bandwidth that yield concrete improvements you can expect the moment you begin to use your brand-new device. T-Mobile's ambitions extend beyond traditional cellular coverage with their T-Satellite service, which leverages orbital technology to reach locations other providers simply cannot access. This innovation ensures strong signals even in remote areas where competitors' networks fade into uselessness. The economic benefits add up quickly for switchers: T-Mobile claims existing customers from competing networks can save up to twenty percent each month with a switch to an Experience plan. Those plans include in-flight Wi-Fi and Magenta Status benefits among others, but the large benefit remains in that no-cost iPhone 17 in the palm of your hand with your monthly fees lowered.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Innovation can be a tough business, especially when it comes to mobile phones. While new form factors like Samsung's foldable Galaxy Z Fold and Z Flip have already been solidified with seven generations, other iterations (looking at you, iPhone Plus and iPhone Mini) haven't quite survived the test of time. It's too early to know for sure precisely how that experiment will pan out, but rumblings in the here and now aren't exactly painting a rosy picture. That makes practical sense from Samsung's part (if people aren't buying it, you probably shouldn't sell it), but given the unique challenges of making thin phones, there could also be more going on behind the scenes. [Exclusive] “Not Selling Well at All”… Samsung to Discontinue Ultra-Slim ‘Galaxy Edge' Line Samsung Electronics has decided to discontinue its ultra-slim smartphone lineup, the “Edge” series. As Raymond Wong, Gizmodo's senior editor, consumer tech, already wrote, upgrading thin phones from generation to generation is likely to be quite difficult (and for that reason, you shouldn't count on the iPhone Air 2 having an ultrawide camera). A thin phone, quite simply, gives you less room to play around with. In the current reality, the constraints of thin phones may be too great—great enough that a generation-to-generation leap could require more research and development money than it's worth. Given that thin phones are already difficult to make and that demand has proven low, thin phones may have a tougher time evolving than Samsung and Apple predicted they might. Don't get me wrong: I haven't used the iPhone Air at length, but I've messed around with it, and it's an impressive feat of engineering. Which would make sense: Many folks also care a lot about camera quality and battery life, and if the iPhone Air can't compete on those fronts, it may also have a limited audience. New reports suggest Samsung's first-ever smart glasses might be around the corner. There's not much left to the imagination after specs and other details were leaked. It's certainly got more graphics performance than Apple's latest and greatest chip. Please be patient and judge phones when they actually hit the scene. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 will be powering many flagship Android phones next year, and it has a few surprises beyond its silly name.</p>

Helion Energy has secured a Conditional Use Permit from a Central Washington county to start the next phase of development for what it hopes will be the world's first commercial fusion plant. It's building a 50 megawatt fusion facility named Orion that aims to harness the same nuclear reactions that fuel the sun and stars. The new permit from Chelan County allows for construction of the fusion generator building and follows a public notice and comment period. “As a company of builders with a single-minded focus on making electricity from fusion commercially practical, we couldn't be more excited to move into this next phase of construction for the Orion power plant,” said Helion CEO David Kirtley in a statement. RELATED: Helion breaks ground on what could be the world's first fusion plant despite significant uncertainty Chelan County Commissioner Kevin Overbay acknowledged Helion's significant community engagement with the region ahead of permitting and construction, and cheered its role as an energy pioneer. “To be the home of fusion energy would enhance the legacy of our area as a continued leader in clean energy production.” While construction continues, Helion is still working at its Everett, Wash., headquarters to develop the technology needed to commercially generate power from fusion — a feat that no one has yet accomplished.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Last week, a new round of the U.S.-China trade war commenced. More importantly, China expanded its export control framework beyond raw materials, now reaching actual products and complex devices made outside of China. This means that a product produced anywhere in the world, but containing rare earth materials from China, may be subject to Beijing's export licensing regime if the value of rare earth materials in this product exceeds 0.1%. Starting early November, China will add five heavy rare-earth elements to its export controls list, including erbium, europium, holmium, thulium, and ytterbium, as well as their alloys, oxides, compounds, and finished materials. This round of China's export controls targets rare earth elements that generate, manipulate, and sense light or magnetism, which are critically important for dozens of devices and industries. By tightening export controls over these materials, China is increasing its influence over both the supply of rare earths and the foundational building blocks that the computing, defence, and telecommunication industries rely upon worldwide. While companies in these industries have the flexibility to switch from one supplier to another, doing so is difficult and expensive because they have downstream partners that need to validate and qualify all the components they use. China's export controls policy evolved from restricting fundamental semiconductor materials such as antimony, gallium, and germanium (Round I) to advanced interconnect metals (Round II), then to functional rare earths used in chipmaking, telco, and storage devices (Round III, scandium and dysprosium). This is clearly not an isolated move, but is a part of a multi-stage plan that now spans every level of the electronics and semiconductor ecosystem from wafer substrates to photonics and magnetics. While this hurts several industries, it does not hurt them significantly more than the prior rounds (particularly the April 2025 round), so we could consider the new list as an expansion of the Round III rather than an all-new Round IV (more on this later), though for simplicity we will call it this way. While there have been conversations about replacing China-originated materials, from semiconductor production and broader industries, the main limitation seems to be the lack of efficient technologies for processing rare earth elements. The newly imposed export regulations now also include rare-earth production and processing equipment, covering over 20 types of industrial machinery. Advanced crystal-growth furnaces are particularly important for antimony, gallium, germanium, and other rare-earth elements used in semiconductor manufacturing, though the exact purity levels and applications vary. High-purity materials are essential to minimize defects and ensure the consistent electrical properties demanded by process technologies. While it is theoretically possible to use different crystallization reactors, presses, and furnaces, the final material, although pure, will differ from that produced using standard tools. This may require requalification of the semiconductor process technology, which might take months and incur significant costs. To that end, it will become difficult for foreign companies to mine and refine rare earth materials outside of China with the new regulation. In addition, a new regulation introduced last week extends the same legal framework to the mining reagents, separation chemicals, and mineral feedstock required to produce or refine rare earths. Until now, China has mainly regulated exports of refined metals and oxides, while mining reagents and separation chemicals have been lightly monitored. By adding these materials to the list of controlled items, China is closing an option for companies to buy Chinese reagents or ores and perform refining elsewhere. This means even if a foreign refinery exists, it cannot legally operate without a Chinese export license, which further reinforces China's control not just over mined output but over the mining and refining hardware, consumables, and chemical know-how. The new export restrictions on five rare earth elements, mining and refining tools, and chemicals used for their mining and refining, clearly expand China's control over rare earth supplies and solidify the country's market share, the final set of restrictions is absolutely unprecedented as they expand export controls beyond China's borders. Starting December 1, China will require foreign companies to obtain a dual-use Chinese export license if their products contain Chinese-origin rare-earth materials (≥ 0.1 % by value) or were manufactured using Chinese rare-earth mining, refining, or magnet-production technologies. The rule applies to all companies, regardless of geography. However, the most painful part is that China's Ministry of Commerce will review export license applications related to the production or research of advanced logic (14nm and below), or 3D NAND (256-layer+ memory chips), as well as AI technologies with potential military applications. This means that China's ministry may refuse to supply materials to any chipmaker in the world, whether it is TSMC producing AI processors for Nvidia, or Micron producing 3D NAND memory for its latest SSD. From a strategic point of view, Round IV of China's rare earth materials export restrictions marks China's shift from being the world's largest supplier of rare earths to the global watchdog over rare earth materials and products. China already controls exports of foundational materials like antimony, gallium, germanium, as well as crucially important bismuth, indium, molybdenum, and tungsten. Furthermore, now that China intends to control the means of rare earth mining and refining, as well as applications that use rare earth metals, the next step could be controlling the particular end user of finished products, just like the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security controls end users of products made using American technologies. This will require a global tracing system to identify Chinese rare-earth content across the supply chain, but the ongoing feud between China and the U.S. has demonstrated that both countries are willing to go great lengths to protect national interests.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company used its EXO tool to spread an inference workload across two DGX Spark systems and a Mac Studio. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. EXO's newest demo combines two of NVIDIA's DGX Spark systems with Apple's M3 Ultra–powered Mac Studio to make use of the disparate strengths of each machine: Spark has more raw compute muscle, while the Mac Studio can move data around much faster. EXO 1.0, currently in early access, blends the two into a single inference pipeline, and it apparently works shockingly well. That step is heavily bandwidth-bound, making the M3 Ultra's super-wide memory bus ideal. EXO's trick is to divide those phases between machines, streaming the model's internal data (called the KV cache) layer by layer so the two systems can work simultaneously instead of waiting on each other. Longer prompts or larger models should see even greater gains. This kind of "disaggregated inference" isn't exactly a novelty, but it's still very clever. It hints at a future where AI performance scales not by buying one massive accelerator, but instead by more intelligently orchestrating the hardware you already have. NVIDIA seems to agree: its upcoming Rubin CPX platform will use compute-dense Rubin CPX processors for the context-building prefill stage while standard Rubin chips with huge HBM3e memory bandwidth handle the decode stage—he same principle EXO is already demonstrating on off-the-shelf hardware. EXO's early-access release is still in the experimental stages. The current open-source version (0.0.15-alpha) dates back to March 2025, and the full 1.0 build — with automated scheduling, KV streaming, and heterogeneous optimizations — isn't public yet. It's not plug-and-play software for consumers, at least not yet; for now, it's a research-grade tool proving that disaggregated inference can deliver real gains. By making intelligent use of mixed hardware, EXO shows that high-performance AI doesn't have to be monopolized by data centers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seems to be a common theme in 2025: Actually-healthy companies cosplaying as struggling companies, as an excuse to justify layoffs and other activities that transfer wealth and power from employees to management and shareholders. Like, does anyone think any of these BigTech (and MediumTech) companies who are all doing layoffs are really "struggling" and "vulnerable"? I've actually always liked working for companies in which the objective was straight forward. But layoffs are a reality and reducing headcount at times is part of that. And, yes, of course layoffs are something that need to be justified, just as with firing an individual employee, as you know -- the "employee is not being productive" is a justification. However the best work I ever did was done when I didn't have a pressure of being fired for offending the wrong person, and that I had the psychological safety to think longer term- since a short term "time-waste" often converted to better long term outcomes for everybody. I felt the same way until I worked at a company where almost nobody ever got fired or laid off. Anyone who was hired was basically guaranteed their job until the end of time because the leadership didn't like letting anyone go.It only took a couple years until every time you needed to do something you'd run into some employee somewhere who wasn't doing their job. Even many people who seemed capable and appropriately skilled started slacking off when they realized there were never any consequences at all.It was like a broken windows theory for the workplace. As people looked around and saw that others were doing almost no work, it started to spread. Always working under threat of layoff and seeing good coworkers let go when you're already overburdened isn't good.

There's a sort of apathy osmosis that happens when you realise that you can't actually do anything because everyone else is sort of checked out... so the you, yourself, sort of check out too.I get anxiety and "itchy" if I don't move towards my goals with any kind of swiftness. I get anxiety and "itchy" if I don't move towards my goals with any kind of swiftness. To the point I even had a boss say that part of this happens because nobody is there to spank adults when they need it (seriously), rather than intervene too strongly and have to find a replacement or hurt feelings or something. Or another contract worker, I got an apology from said boss... but he insisted she's better now than she used to be, the latest incident is mild compared to incidents before I arrived. Sounds like you've never worked here, but in the US that's always been the case.US corporations do not need you shilling for their rights, they are doing very well in that department without your help, thank you very much. US corporations do not need you shilling for their rights, they are doing very well in that department without your help, thank you very much. Layoffs are a signal to markets of struggles, and firms absolutely do, in practice, need to justify them (and their scale and focus) to avoid the risk of a self-fulfilling market perception that they signal a problems that they do not fully resolve. Another factor is that retained employees that learn of companies layoff frequently become concerned about their own position and the treatment of the workers that were laid off, reducing employee morale. High performers may start looking for another job in order to avoid expected future layoffs.Then there's the impact on potential future employees, who will also know about the layoffs. These employees will be aware of recently layoffs and will expect more money from said company who will also have to train the new employee that replaced the one they laid off before.Finally, you have the impact on potential customers or existing customers. Some customers have relationships with employees that are laid off, and this can be jarring.

All of these effects are not typically beneficial to the company or it's shareholders. Replacing workers has serious cost disadvantages: recruiting itself costs money (the HR staff dedicated to that, external headhunters, "employer branding" measures, job exhibition rents and swag), layoffs cost reputation, and new workers need to be trained in your company specific procedures from timetracking to expense refunds.Unfortunately, these costs are all too often hidden deep in the balance sheets, which makes just dumping off entire departments while hiring up other departments appear much more financially attractive than it is in reality, all costs considered.

So if they change those goals for some reason, then the letting-go should be allowed.I really wish there was some sort of UBI to disincentivize clinging to a near-useless (in terms of ultimate goals) job. Heck, just making unemployment not contingent on getting fired (another perverse incentive) would be an improvement.

So what companies do is over hire during growth and lay off later to capture the value created by these workers. Corporations are greedy and let go of many good people. It's really hard to get rid of bad people, even in the US. But you wouldn't believe how many bad people were in big tech because of the COVID over hiring.I've seen dozens, if not hundreds of people, who went to FAANG and added next to no value. As a manager in one of these companies, I had to deal with a mix of great people and many who were absolutely taking advantage of the company. Good for them, but it's not surprising that the party would end someday. I've seen dozens, if not hundreds of people, who went to FAANG and added next to no value. As a manager in one of these companies, I had to deal with a mix of great people and many who were absolutely taking advantage of the company. Good for them, but it's not surprising that the party would end someday. If someone hired a lot of people who had to be laid off later, they would get more supervision and review of future hires. I've never seen anyone run into any kind of difficulty letting go an at-will employee. This has been my experience at two different companies in multiple cases with egregious underperformance. I suppose if an employee assaulted/harassed someone or was doing something else outright illegal like theft or embezzlement, they would be shown the door immediately. But if someone is half-assing their work and dragging the team down, everyone has to put up with it for months as they get second chances, micromanagement, and other special attention before they can actually be let go.I think it's due to the litigiousness of the US culture. Yes, US companies can fire people at will, but they can also file lawsuits at will, which are costly (time+money) no matter the outcome. Yes, US companies can fire people at will, but they can also file lawsuits at will, which are costly (time+money) no matter the outcome. Just "We aren't doing this work anymore and don't need you" and that was that. And if that employee can show that other people were allowed to wear green shirts without being fired, they can use that to support an illegal discrimination claim against the company.The reason it takes effort and documentation to fire people is because companies want to have a uniform set of rules that are applied equally to all employees. They also want documentation to support the firing. Having a consistent process, applied equally and with supporting documentation discourages people from even trying to bring frivolous lawsuits.Having additional process is also a check on managers. Some managers try to fire anyone they disagree with, dislike, or even to do things like open headcount so they can fill it with a nepotism hire. They also want documentation to support the firing.

Some managers try to fire anyone they disagree with, dislike, or even to do things like open headcount so they can fill it with a nepotism hire. Then there's the perverse incentive that bigger teams usually equals a promotion. So if you're the honest manager who manages a tight team and fires people, you won't get promoted as often.Top management knows this, of course. To sidestep these misaligned incentives a company-wide one-time layoff is really effective. To sidestep these misaligned incentives a company-wide one-time layoff is really effective. There are laws against that at any size, and you are looking for a lawsuit if you give a reason.It's best to just tell them their position has been eliminated due to restructuring (has to be provable if you're a big company), and give them no reason beyond that. It's best to just tell them their position has been eliminated due to restructuring (has to be provable if you're a big company), and give them no reason beyond that. It was incredibly rough- a lot of people who weren't being told they needed to shape up or ship out were instead simply told they're being shipped out. The only upside is managers got better about supporting employees later on who weren't performing, including putting people on PIPs rather than letting them coast. You can definitely argue it's not fair to pay somebody extra for not doing a job but the alternative seems to be you keep paying them even more to keep not doing a job (and possibly doing negative work).Rather than put somebody on a pip for x months just offer them x months of salary to quit. Rather than put somebody on a pip for x months just offer them x months of salary to quit. There's a legal distinction which impacts whether or not the employee is eligible for unemployment benefits, among other things. The company could be sued by a non employee too. And if your company procedure requires a PIP, then you do that. Nothing you've said sounds difficult in the slightest. They hired expecting a certain type of growth. Many project managers that had been with the company through ups and downs. End of 0 interest rates is the more likely reason. A company can be successful by most metrics, but if certain trends are not heading in the right direction, then faith in the stock drops, employee compensation goes down, future investments become dicey, etc.This is the nature of public companies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brook.ai, a Seattle-area health technology startup that uses AI to help clinical teams to deliver remote care, raised a $28 million Series B round led by UMass Memorial Health and Morningside. Founded in 2015, Brooks' platform combines data analytics, automated nudges, and support from clinicians and health coaches to help patients manage chronic conditions from home. The company says its approach can cut hospital readmissions — such as for congestive heart failure — and improve metrics like hypertension control. It promotes its platform as a turnkey system that can be deployed in 30 days. Brook reported 204% patient growth over the past year, and an 82% retention rate. Brook began as a diabetes management startup, combining data from devices and coaching to support glucose control. It later broadened its scope, layering in hypertension, metabolic health, and general chronic disease care. But the sector faces hurdles, including complex data integration, long sales cycles, and regulatory burdens. He co-founded Brook with the company's chief product officer, Kit Macgillivray, a longtime strategy consultant and executive who worked with Nissim at Telmap for several years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Between October 11 and 13, the Sun unleashed a torrent of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Now, these powerful bursts of solar plasma and magnetic energy are on a collision course with Earth. Space weather forecasters expect them to arrive tonight and cause the northern lights—or Aurora Borealis—to stretch farther south than usual. NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center issued a G2 (moderate) geomagnetic storm watch for Thursday, October 16, with the strongest impact expected between late Thursday night and Friday morning. NOAA's aurora forecast for tonight shows 15 states above the aurora view line, meaning they have a decent chance of seeing the northern lights. Those states include Alaska, Washington, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Wyoming, and Iowa. If you're hoping to catch a glimpse of the aurora tonight, make sure to choose a viewing location with minimal light pollution, a clear view of the northern horizon, and cloudless skies. It's been a wild week for solar activity. One of these flares, which erupted on October 13, is associated with one of the CMEs currently heading toward Earth. When an Earth-facing sunspot—a cooler region on the Sun's surface caused by a concentration of magnetic field lines—produces a CME, the ejected material hurtles toward our planet at breakneck speed. Once it reaches Earth's magnetic field, the influx of charged particles and energy can trigger a geomagnetic storm. Depending on its severity, a geomagnetic storm may increase the likelihood of visible auroras, disrupt power grids, satellites, and other infrastructure, and cause radio blackouts. This compounding effect can intensify a geomagnetic storm's strength and duration, making it more likely to disrupt technology and produce auroras at lower latitudes than usual. That said, forecasters aren't anticipating any severe impacts from tonight's storm. There's always a chance that an oncoming storm could be stronger—or weaker—than anticipated. But for folks in the northern U.S. hoping to see some dazzling aurora this week, it certainly looks like tonight is the best chance. Scientists suspect that smaller "tornadoes" of solar plasma and magnetic field may be escaping our detection. The IMAP probe will collect near real-time data about space weather.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PYUSD stablecoin is marketed as being ‘fully backed by US dollar deposits, US treasuries, and similar cash equivalents.' When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Even in 2025, some aspects of cryptocurrency seem rather risky, despite assurances that certain coins are fully backed, stable, and secure. A hair-raising case in point hitting the newswires today is provided by PayPal's crypto partner Paxos, which accidentally minted $300 trillion PYUSD a few hours ago. This so-called ‘stablecoin' is said to be “fully backed by US dollar deposits, US treasuries, and similar cash equivalents.” Despite that pledge, there is no way that such a gargantuan sum was backed by anyone or anything, as it is roughly equivalent to “more than double the world's estimated total GDP,” reports CNBC. An official Paxos newsroom release or blog post hasn't yet been prepared to provide insight into this fat-finger error by the ‘PayPal USD' crypto issuer. This seems to go against the firm's transparency pledges, but perhaps someone is still busy typing out the full details of what caused this error. For now, we have to do with a brief, dismissive social media statement from Paxos, as embedded below. At 3:12 PM EST, Paxos mistakenly minted excess PYUSD as part of an internal transfer. “At 3:12 PM EST [October 15], Paxos mistakenly minted excess PYUSD as part of an internal transfer,” reads the intro of the brief statement. However, according to cryptowatchers on platforms like Etherscan, the $300 trillion error persisted for roughly 20 minutes. Paxos went on to unapologetically dismiss concerns over the gigantic financial blunder. It is currently the sixth-largest stablecoin and is set to prosper, as this type of value-backed crypto is becoming more established and broadly supported by banks and payment platforms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“When you play video games, you essentially transfer your perception, usually through a first-person view of the camera, to different environments,” Pim de Witte, CEO of Medal and General Intuition, told TechCrunch. He noted that gamers who upload clips tend to post very negative or positive examples, which serve as really useful edge cases for training. De Witte says the founding team has already made strides: General Intuition's model can understand environments it wasn't trained on and correctly predict actions within them. It's able to do this purely through visual input; agents only see what a human player would see, and they move through space by following controller inputs. This approach, the company says, can transfer naturally to physical systems like robotic arms, drones, and autonomous vehicles, which are often manipulated by humans using video game controllers. General Intuition's next milestone is two-fold: generating new simulated worlds for training other agents, and autonomously navigating entirely unfamiliar physical environments. That technical approach is shaping how the company plans to commercialize its technology, and sets it apart from competitors building world models. “Our goal is not to produce models that compete with game developers,” de Witte said. Instead, the startup's gaming applications center around creating bots and non-player characters that can surpass traditional “deterministic bots,” or preprogrammed characters that produce the same output every time. De Witte also has a background in humanitarian work, which informs the startup's focus on powering search and rescue drones, that sometimes have to navigate unfamiliar environments and extract information without GPS. While major AI labs focus on building ever more powerful large language models, General Intuition believes true AGI requires something LLMs fundamentally lack.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The news last week that Dominion Voting Systems was purchased by the founder and CEO of Knowink, a Missouri-based maker of electronic poll books, has left election integrity activists confused over what, if anything, this could mean for voters and the integrity of US elections. The company, acquired by Scott Leiendecker, a former Republican Party operative and election director in Missouri before founding Knowink, said in a press release that he was rebranding Dominion, which has headquarters in Canada and the United States, under the name Liberty Vote “in a bold and historic move to transform and improve election integrity in America” and to distance the company from false allegations made previously by President Donald Trump and his supporters that the company had rigged the 2020 presidential election to give the win to President Joe Biden. The Liberty release said that the rebranded company will be 100 percent American-owned, that it will have a “paper ballot focus” that leverages hand-marked paper ballots, will “prioritize facilitating third-party auditing,” and is “committed to domestic staffing and software development.” The press release provided no details, however, to explain what this means in practice. A search on LinkedIn shows numerous programmers and other workers in Serbia who claim to be employed by the company. A Liberty official, who agreed to speak on the condition that they not be named, told WIRED only that Leiendecker “is committed to 100 percent … domestic staffing and software development.” An unnamed source told CNN, however, that Liberty will continue to have a presence in Canada, where its machines are used across the country. Philip Stark, professor of statistics at UC Berkeley and a longtime election-integrity advocate, says Liberty's assurance about domestic-only workers is a red herring. But Stark and other election experts believe this is unrealistic and appears to be aimed just at making the company “look good” to right-wing critics. If Liberty plans to replace foreign Dominion workers with US ones, this will likely also slow down any review and rebuilding. What's more, Stark, who developed procedures for risk-limiting audits used in some jurisdictions to verify the integrity of election results, says the only audits that can provide assurances about election outcomes are postelection audits of paper ballots. An audit of voting software can't even provide assurance that a voting machine hasn't been subverted, because the software and machine configurations can be altered after auditing and certification. A software audit can only identify existing vulnerabilities, but many of these have already been identified by third-party computer security experts who examined Dominion code in the past. News of the acquisition apparently caught Dominion customers off guard last week. Leiendecker reportedly held a conference call on Friday with Colorado county election clerks who were angry that they'd learned of the sale from media reports instead of the company. Leiendecker's acquisition of Dominion is not a big surprise, however. Knowink and Dominion have worked together closely for a while. Dominion has used Knowink as a subcontractor when bidding for election contracts in order to offer customers a turnkey election solution that includes voting machines and poll books. And Leiendecker's acquisition continues a long history of consolidation in the voting industry. Currently, the top three are Election Systems & Software, Dominion (now Liberty Vote), and Hart InterCivic, in that order. Sequoia left in large part due to financial issues. Dominion equipment is used across 26 states plus Puerto Rico. Knowink electronic poll books, which replace traditional paper poll books used to verify the eligibility of voters when they sign in at precincts, are used in 29 states plus the District of Columbia. But there are jurisdictions across 14 states, covering 20 million registered voters, that use both Dominion and Knowink systems. Knowink poll books even interact with Dominion voting machines since a voter smart card inserted into the poll books gets encoded and then inserted into voting machines to pull up a digital ballot for the voter. Nonetheless, some might be confused about why Leiendecker would want to acquire Dominion, since the voting machine industry has never been particularly lucrative. A 2017 study estimated it to be a $300 million-a-year business, with Dominion's annual revenue estimated at the time to be about $100 million. It's not clear how much Dominion is worth today. A more recent report produced by an accounting firm hired by Dominion to support its claim for damages in Fox defamation lawsuit said the company would have been worth about $741 million in December 2020 if not for Fox's false election-rigging claims. On social media, users have expressed concern about Leiendecker's close ties to the Republican Party as a possible reason for his interest in buying Dominion, raising questions about whether he sides with conspiracy theories about Dominion and the 2020 election. Recent settlements in Dominion lawsuits against conspiracy theorists raises further questions about this, as have Leiendecker's connection to Trump ally Ed Martin. Leiendecker didn't respond to questions about these concerns. Following the 2020 election in which right-wing Trump supporters accused Dominion of having ties to Venezuela—apparently confusing the company with Smartmatic, a voting machine company founded by Venezuelan engineers—and rigging the election, Dominion filed defamation lawsuits against right-wing news outlets Fox News and One America News Network for $1.6 billion for amplifying the false claims. But last month, Dominion reached agreements with OAN, Powell, and Giuliani for undisclosed terms. Dominion still has pending lawsuits against Lindell and former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne. The Liberty official who spoke with WIRED says these will be ending soon as well. But Stefanie Lambert, Byrne's attorney, wrote in an email to WIRED: “There is no settlement. Dr. Byrne is looking forward to trial.” A lawyer for Lindell did not respond to an inquiry but Lindell told Infowars this week that he will never settle with Dominion. The settlements raise questions about whether Leiendecker simply didn't want to be saddled with lawsuits or if he was doing right-wing defendants a favor by forcing Dominion into settlements favorable to them. Leiendecker didn't respond to a question about the undisclosed settlement terms. While Leiendecker hasn't directly addressed the issue around conspiracy theorists and election manipulation publicly, his response to allegations of vote-rigging made more than a decade ago suggests he considers election integrity to be paramount, even when doing so might not be politically advantageous. Leiendecker was appointed by Missouri's Republican secretary of state to investigate St. Louis elections administration after problems arose in the 2000 election there, according to Axios. Leiendecker was then hired by Ed Martin to be the Republican director of the St. Louis City Board of Election Commissioners from 2005 until 2009 Martin, now a staunch Trump ally and supporter of his stolen-election claims, is currently the US pardon attorney and prior to this served under the current Trump administration as the interim US attorney for DC, where he demoted prosecutors who worked on January 6 insurrection cases. Five years after hiring Leiendecker, Martin ran unsuccessfully as a GOP candidate for a congressional seat against the Democratic incumbent and was backed by the St. Louis Tea Party. Similar to what occurred following Trump's 2020 presidential loss, Martin alleged there were irregularities in the vote counting. St. Louis Public Radio reported that he directed this challenge at Martin. During his time as director of the St. Louis elections board, Leiendecker was widely credited by both political parties for improving the election board's procedures and ensuring that it processed votes more efficiently than previous boards. When it comes to future elections, Leiendecker has said in Liberty's press release and media statements that the company is committed to providing election technology that leverages “hand-marked paper ballots” in “compliance with President Trump's executive order.” Trump, acting on his false vote-rigging claims, has called for all-paper elections, and his March executive order has called for all voting systems to use or produce a voter-verifiable paper ballot that voters can review to ensure machines didn't alter their votes. Some media outlets have interpreted Leiendecker's statements to mean he aligns with Trump's stance to ban systems that don't produce a paper record. The Liberty official who spoke with WIRED says Leiendecker meant only that Liberty will offer products that “enable compliance with federal and state standards”—whatever those standards may be. Current voting system standards advise states to use systems that produce a paper record but cannot require this; states decide on their own what voting systems they use. Similarly, Trump has no authority to decide what voting systems states use; the Constitution gives this authority to states alone, and the EO is currently being litigated in court. These ballots are produced by so-called ballot-marking devices, or BMDs—voting systems that allow voters to make selections through a touchscreen tablet or other assistive device, which then prints a paper ballot showing the voter's selections that the voter can read to verify that the machine marked their votes correctly. Dominion makes a BMD called the ImageCast X, most of which produce ballots with QR codes, which is used in all or parts of 15 states, according to Verified Voting, which tracks election equipment usage in the US. Many election-integrity activists want states that use these types of ballots to tabulate only from the human-readable portion of the ballot, not the QR code or bar code, or simply have voters fill out regular paper ballots by hand instead.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon One Medical, the retailer's primary care provider acquired in 2022, is launching a pay-per-visit virtual healthcare service for children ages 2 to 11, the company announced on Thursday. Amazon started offering a pay-per-visit virtual healthcare service for adults in 2024. “This service isn't meant to replace a family's relationship with their child's pediatrician, but rather to serve as a convenient option for those ‘in-between' moments for parents with time-sensitive concerns who don't already have on-demand access through a One Medical membership,” said Natasha Bhuyan, MD, family physician and national medical director for Amazon One Medical, in a press release. The move comes as companies like Walgreens, CVS, and Walmart are scaling back their retail health services. Amazon last week debuted prescription vending machines at its One Medical clinics, starting in Los Angeles. These new kiosks could disrupt brick-and-mortar pharmacy businesses, which are already struggling. Prior to joining the publication in 2021, she was a telecom reporter at MobileSyrup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spotify on Thursday announced a series of deals with major record labels to develop new AI products designed ensure fair compensation and center artists and songwriters in the experience. Spotify didn't delve into the specifics of how the new tools would operate, but the company already offers generative AI experiences for users, including with its AI DJ that plays a personalized selection of songs and others that allow users to request playlists using AI prompts, for instance. Spotify was recently criticized for allowing an AI-generated band's music to go viral on its service, raising questions about whether the future of music would push human artistry to the side. Last month, the company revamped its AI policy to cut down on spam, particularly users who upload AI content at mass scale, create duplicates, and manipulate the search and recommendations systems. Spotify notes the system will expand beyond artists to include other rightsholders and distributors over time. “Some voices in the tech industry believe copyright should be abolished. “If the music industry doesn't lead in this moment, AI-powered innovation will happen elsewhere, without rights, consent, or compensation. In addition, Spotify said it has begun building a generative AI research lab and product team focused on building out new technologies that reflect its principles that artists should be able to choose if and how they participate in the AI music ecosystem.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That line from a new Microsoft Windows ad, spoken by a confused bystander, will double as a litmus test for the company's latest attempt to bring its flagship operating system into the era of artificial intelligence. Microsoft announced a series of new and updated AI features for Windows 11 on Thursday morning, aiming to move people beyond typing and clicking toward more human-like interactions with computers. It's part of a larger push by Microsoft to redefine the personal computer around AI. “It doesn't replace the keyboard and mouse, necessarily. More broadly, the company is betting that Windows users will begin treating their PCs less as tools and more as collaborators. The company largely missed the smartphone era and has struggled for relevance on mobile devices that run on operating systems from Apple and Google. With AI quickly becoming the next major platform shift, Microsoft wants that transition to start on Windows, not somewhere else. Microsoft says it will launch as an experimental feature in Copilot Labs for people enrolled in the Windows Insider program, starting with a narrow set of use cases. Microsoft says it has built a new security framework for Copilot Actions, which is disabled by default and runs the AI agent in its own contained workspace and dedicated user account with limited access to user folders. More broadly, the announcement signals a change in Microsoft's AI strategy for Windows. The company's big “AI PC” push began last year with the announcement of Copilot+ PCs, which have a special NPU chip designed for AI tasks. With these latest updates, Microsoft is now focusing more on AI features that will work on any Windows 11 PC, not just the models with special hardware. Copilot+ PCs will get some exclusive features to set them apart, like a new integration for scheduling Zoom meetings using the “Click to Do” feature.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Windows 10 support ended on October 14, and we're about to see a wave of people upgrade to Windows 11; Microsoft seems intent on putting advanced Copilot features at the fingertips of as many people as possible—and convincing them they're worth using. The company is introducing new Copilot features across all Windows 11 devices, featuring direct voice interaction with Copilot in apps and throughout the operating system. This capability has been available on smartphones for many years with varying degrees of success, as well as Microsoft's own Copilot+ line of laptops. “It's been almost four decades since the PC changed the way you interact with it, which is primarily mouse and keyboard,” says Yusuf Mehdi, consumer chief marketing officer at Microsoft. “But what if you can go beyond that and talk to it? In our minds, voice would become the third input mechanism to use with your PC.” Mehdi cited Microsoft's own observations of how people interact with its PCs via voice, such as through dictation, note-taking, voice typing, and transcriptions. Mehdi also says people use the Copilot app twice as much when using voice instead of typing, due to ease of use. “But we think that's what's actually going to change a lot.” With voice-powered Copilot arriving on all Windows 11 computers, Microsoft hopes people will begin using its AI features more. Mehdi seemingly forgot to mention “touch” as an input mechanism from his history lesson. Microsoft famously invested quite a lot in trying to transform the PC into a touch-first operating system with Windows 8 and its push into Windows tablets (and Windows Phone), which was ultimately abandoned outside of specific devices like the Surface Pro. Copilot Vision allows AI to view your screen and offer assistance based on this context. It's been a feature of Copilot+ PCs since June, but now it'll be available broadly across all Windows 11 computers, even those without an NPU (neural processing Unit). Google recently added a similar capability to its Chrome browser. If you're looking for a certain action or menu in a complicated piece of software, Copilot Vision can quickly point you in the right direction. It's a floating toolbar that can follow you around to any app or part of Windows, given the context of what's on your screen, whether that's the whole desktop or just a particular window. That means less prompting, and combined with voice control, it's more akin to having a knowledgeable friend standing over your shoulder. Microsoft calls it “Highlights,” which can be triggered just by asking Copilot to “show me how,” whether that's while editing a photo, checking your calendar, or writing a grocery list. Mehdi also talked about Gaming Copilot, which brings Copilot Vision into the world of gaming, whether on a PC or a device like the new ROG Xbox Ally. I saw a demo of it in action, with the assistant offering directions to a player about what missions to take next in an open-world adventure. Copilot Actions can do things on your behalf locally with an app or operating system, just by following natural language instructions. So, rather than have Copilot Vision show you where to find that obscure setting in Adobe Photoshop, Copilot Actions can just go turn it on for you. A feature called Connectors, available now for Windows Insiders, lets you take actions locally on your PC directly from the Copilot app, such as opening files from OneDrive, opening emails, or even creating a PowerPoint presentation. Microsoft says third-party applications like Google Calendar or Gmail will work within the Copilot app. So long as you've permitted Copilot to have access to those apps, Copilot can not only locate those apps and files, but it can also take action on them or in them. While this replicates some of the functionality of Recall, the security-troubled AI feature exclusive to Copilot+ PCs, Microsoft says they will live side by side. Copilot Actions have been a part of Microsoft's 365 Copilot enterprise tools since late 2024, but this is the first time they'll be rolled out widely to average Windows users. Microsoft says it'll be available “in the coming months,” and this time you'll be able to use Copilot Actions with text prompts instead of just voice. The idea of taking action on apps from within a search is not dissimilar to what Apple is doing with Spotlight Actions and shortcuts in macOS Tahoe. For now, Copilot is still something you have to call up, whether with voice or by clicking the app (built into the Taskbar search bar). But it's not hard to imagine Copilot growing into the primary interface of Windows. Will any of this actually get people to use Copilot more?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aside from a MAGA hat, there is likely no object that feels more emblematic of US President Donald Trump's return to the White House than the Tesla Cybertruck. The blunt angles and steel doors look futuristic, for sure, but only if the future looks a lot like RoboCop. To some, it's a metallic status symbol. To others, it's fascism on wheels. “To me, it's just a vehicle that I love,” says Andrew Castillo, a stock trader from Los Angeles. “It has no political affiliations at all to me.” We're standing in the parking lot of McCormick's Palm Springs Classic Car Auctions. All around us, a dozen Cybertruck owners—and their cars—bake in the 100 degree heat. They've arrived for a meetup organized by Michael Goldman, who runs the 53,000-person Facebook group Cybertruck Owners Only. WIRED is here to learn how it feels to be out in public in such a politically charged vehicle. Do owners like the attention—or are they adding bumper stickers decrying Elon Musk? “Your cars are fucking ugly!” she screams before peeling off. “Some people just aren't playing with a full deck of cards,” he says serenely. Interviews have been edited and condensed for clarity. Name: Michael GoldmanAge: 37Location: Palm SpringsJob: Entrepreneur and owner of a construction company.Cybertruck's nickname: “Beastie” What does your wife think about the car? Once she took the kids out in it and we went off-roading and she saw that I was towing my big dump trailers for work and everything else, she was like, “OK, this thing's actually pretty cool. I'm not a fan of the way that it looks, but it's pretty cool and all the features are great.” A while back, I went into Whole Foods to drop off an Amazon package. So I go in, and of course a lady in an electric Mustang comes and puts this note on my car. [It read: “This is an extension of your small dick.”] She doesn't know these cars record 24/7. So it recorded her putting the note on, and when I came out, I saw the note, and naturally I'm looking to see who put the note on my car. And sure as heck she's right there. So I got out and said to her, “Why'd you feel the need to put a note on my car?” She said, “That's because you're driving this and I'm offended.” She called me a Nazi! So we start talking and she says, “Well, I saw you get out of your truck with your boots, and you're like a big white man. I guess I just assumed because Elon's a Nazi and you fit the profile …” I stopped her and I was like, “My last name is Goldman, what heritage do you think that is?” She's like, “That's Jewish. My wife is Jewish.” I said, ‘OK, so you just accused me of being a Nazi when I'm a Jew. Is that a safe assumption?” She said yes, and I said, “OK, so did you ever get profiled anytime in your life for being gay?” And she says, “Yeah, all the time. I hated it.” And I was like, “Well, do you realize that you just profiled me based off of the vehicle that I drive and me wearing work boots and being a big white guy as being a Nazi when it's completely something totally different?” And she broke down in tears and apologized. I'm a huge supporter in the gay community out here. So to call me a Nazi homophobe, it just blew my mind. Name: Russ TaylorAge: 44Location: Ladera Ranch, Orange County, California.Job: Runs a business called Smugglers Runs, which does “postapocalyptic off-road” rallies When did you order your truck? When I first saw it come out, [Elon Musk] was like, “Go to Cybertruck.com.” Before he even finished the sentence, I was already there and put in my reservation. And obviously there's total polar opposites of people on the design scale, but I loved it. I've always been kind of a cyberpunk, so I fell in love with it right away. How do you feel about becoming a political lightning rod? People occasionally just flip [me] off or whatever, but nobody's come up to me and tried to make a statement about anything. [Editor's note: Taylor was arrested and plead guilty to conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding in the January 6 attack on the Capitol. He was later pardoned by President Trump.] Names: Frank Brabec and Diane BrabecAges: Frank, 58; Diane, 63Location: Indio, CaliforniaJobs: Frank is a consultant in the health care industry; Diane is a dog mom and former zookeeperCybertruck Nickname: “Computruck” That takes a bit of getting used to. Frank: We have two Old English sheepdogs, and it's just a huge area back there for them. Diane: We've only been flipped off like three times. Frank: And they all really seem like angry people just in general. I'm just amused because, first of all, little kids flip out. And I've got little toys in the truck, and I give them out, and kids pose in front of [the car] for pictures. For the most part, it's been this love that I've never experienced in other cars. So when people give negativity, I'm just like, ‘OK.' Name: Jose ReynosoAge: 55Job: Small business ownerLocation: Palm Springs, California Why did you decide to get the car? [Reynoso's car is wrapped in his business logo.] By then I had already spent the money on the truck and accessories and all that. So it was sad to see that. Well, for the CEO of a company that makes a product that a lot of Americans buy and use on a daily basis to put us in the middle of everything because of his controversies. Because when everything was going on, we were the targets. We saw wives and kids being harassed and affected by strangers just because we were driving a Tesla. There was so much hate coming in. And among all that, there's a lot of love. So why isn't it your daily driver? And I noticed that people, especially with the big controversy, my clients probably don't want to see a vehicle like that with such high controversy come in and be a part of their experience. Name: Andrew CastilloAge: 40Location: Los AngelesJob: Stock trader When did you get your truck? I'd preordered the Cybertruck when it was first announced. Then they released the rendering three months later, and I saw the way it looked and I'm like, nope, cancel. I'm not driving that thing around. Then I got my wife the Model S for Christmas. I put an order back in for the Cybertruck and I started building the excitement after that. How do you feel about it now? Now, everything else to me—and I'm not talking down on anybody else's stuff, I still love a lot of other vehicles out there—but everything else, to me, those soft lines and everything, it all kind of blends together. And the Cybertruck obviously stands out. I mean, we take the trailer out a lot, and I can go to a campground and there's 50 kids that come out: “Cybertruck, Cybertruck, Cybertruck.” I carry little toys inside the frunk so I can pass them out and give them to kids, and they love it. Anything you don't like about it? I can't really see the front out of the windshield because it's so long. When I had my Bentley and I met other people with Bentleys or Rolls-Royces, it was exclusive. What's the biggest reaction you've gotten from someone while driving it? A couple of months ago, I think it was in Idaho, my son and I stopped at this place where they had a bunch of bears. This person literally drove through the grass, through the bears, and cut off the other cars and was behind me following me out. And I'm like, dude, who the heck is this? The mom was like, “My son loves Cybertrucks. He's autistic, and he's watching Cybertrucks on his iPad right now.” So he got inside, it was hot, my son was in the backseat, and the air conditioner was on in the truck. We were standing outside, and it was hot. We're literally out there for two hours. That was one of the good moments. Name: Landon CastilloAge: 8 years oldLocation: Los Angeles What do you like about the car? Are you a fan of Elon Musk? Do you get a big reaction from other kids when you drive the mini Cybertruck? Name: Roger DavisLocation: San DiegoAge: Not givenJob: Entrepreneur What do you like about the truck? What I love about the truck is just how it's so polarizing. I just love that it's completely outside of the box. In July, Tesla rolled out a software update to integrate Grok into many of its vehicles. In June of this year, I wanted to put the truck through its paces. The Rubicon is a very famous, 22-mile, off-road trail, and it usually takes two to three days. It was way more difficult than I could have ever imagined. And we had just finished and I was in the vehicle by myself, and I was driving along a little stream, and all of a sudden through the trees I felt the light hit me. Imagine if you're flush, like how your face blushes, but over my whole body. Names: Shawn Hyman and Nannette VaglicaAges: Shawn, 63; Nannette, 62Jobs: Shawn sells window coverings; Nannette is a branch manager for a credit unionLocation: Palm Desert, California What do you like about the Cybertruck? How big a factor was Elon Musk in your decision to buy the car? Shawn: Well, I've been a huge fan of Elon Musk for years. Nanette: I just think he's a brilliant mind. He's an incredibly intelligent man, and he seems to push the right buttons most of the time. I didn't have a problem with his politics, anyway. Even Tesla's basically just going to be a technology company that builds cars. Name: Alex FergusonAge: 32Location: Austin, TexasJob: Cybertruck wrapper How did you get into wrapping Cybertrucks? When Tesla announced this vehicle was going to come out, I went in and I bought all the domain variations of “wrapping Cybertrucks.” A lot of people really like space designs. So even with the back of this truck, it's got a black hole. So that's what we try to go for now. But yeah, we've done a lot of really cool space ones that people love.
