                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prominent progressives dismiss GOP's proposition to discuss healthcare subsidies only after government reopens The Senate vote on a short-term Republican funding bill failed with just 51 votes. A second vote on Pentagon funding on Thursday could begin the process of fully funding military operations and ending the lapse in military pay if it passes. “At some point, Democrats have to take yes for an answer,” Thune said. On Wednesday evening, the progressive senator Bernie Sanders and representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pre-emptively rejected that kind of promise during a 90-minute CNN town hall, insisting they need actual legislation signed into law before they will budge. When asked if a Trump pledge would be enough, Sanders replied mockingly: “Oh yeah, no doubt, because the president is a very honest man.” The New York congresswoman and Vermont senator rejected any short-term fix, calling it an attempt to delay political pain until after next year's midterm elections. Meanwhile, the House speaker, Mike Johnson, has kept the chamber out of session for four weeks after Republicans passed their funding bill, with GOP leaders arguing that returning to Washington would only reduce pressure on Senate Democrats. Johnson and the Democratic minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, have traded barbs over the month, and have now agreed to debate on C-Span, though no date has been set. He did not rule out the potential for the shutdown to run until Thanksgiving, over a month away: “I hope it doesn't last through Thanksgiving,” he said. The standoff has left federal workers without paychecks for weeks, with no end in sight. At the CNN town hall, one worker with four children asked how he was supposed to feed his family.</p>

On Monday, October 13, legal representatives for murdered Palestinian journalist Saleh Aljafarawi filed complaints and demands for investigation with the International Criminal Court and multiple UN committees and special rapporteurs, Sara Segneri, a partner at Confinium Strategies, announced this week on social media. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. Aljafarawi wrote a letter to be shared in the event of his death: Do not think that my martyrdom is the end, but rather the beginning of a long journey toward freedom. “The account deletion not only infringes on Saleh's right to free speech, but it also violates the public's right to know information about ongoing atrocities, and interferes with the investigations into war crimes and other international law violations in Palestine,” Segneri said. She continued: “I have included this in our filings, both as to Meta's actions, but also wrongdoing by countries acting in concert with Meta or directing their actions.” Over the last two years, Meta repeatedly suspended or restricted Aljafarawi's account, Segneri said. “This was part of Meta's ongoing censorship of anything related to Palestine that was not pro-Israel, and their content moderation problems in distinguishing between reporting on atrocities vs. praise for ‘dangerous organisations,' e.g. Hamas,” Segneri told The Carceral Report in an email. Human Rights Watch documented, between October and November 2023, over a thousand instances of censorship of content on Instagram and Facebook that had been “posted by Palestinians and their supporters, including about human rights abuses.” Last year, The Intercept reported that Jordana Cutler, Meta's Israel & the Jewish Diaspora policy chief, “personally pushed for the censorship of Instagram accounts belonging to Students for Justice in Palestine,” although it was unclear if her efforts were successful. More total journalists and media workers were killed in the Iraq war over a more than twenty year period — from the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 to March of this year. However, in Iraq, about 13 journalists were killed per year. In Gaza, about 13 journalists were killed each month, according to the report. “Israel is engaging in the deadliest and most deliberate effort to kill and silence journalists that CPJ has ever documented,” the press freedom group said in a statement on its website. Before his murder, Israeli military officials had repeatedly threatened al-Sharif. I lost my father and several relatives as part of the efforts to force me to stop my news coverage,” al-Sharif told Drop Site News earlier this year. “Despite the threats and danger, I will not, and will never, stop this coverage — until my last breath, because I am fighting for a just cause.” Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At the South Louisiana Ice Processing Center in Basile, detainees say they were forced into hard labor – and sexually assaulted and stalked by an assistant warden In multiple legal complaints, immigrants detained at the South Louisiana Ice Processing Center (SLIPC) in Basile, Louisiana, said they were recruited into an unsanctioned work program that forced them to perform hard manual labor for as little as $1 per day. Detainees also alleged that queer people were targeted by an assistant warden who stalked, harassed and sexually assaulted them. “I was treated worse than an animal,” said Mario Garcia-Valenzuela, one of the detainees. “We don't deserve to be treated like this.” Garcia-Valenzuela, a trans man detained at SLIPC, has alleged that, as part of the unsanctioned work program, Reyes forced him to move heavy cabinets and cinder blocks, and to clean using industrial-strength chemicals without gloves or protective gear. When Garcia-Valenzuela complained of injuries from the work program, he said, Reyes and his associates forcefully stripped him naked and mocked him. Kenia Campos-Flores, who is trans and non-binary, told the Guardian that they suffered from persistent migraines and chest pain after exposure to cleaning chemicals they were made to use during unofficial, overnight work shifts. Campos-Flores also alleged in a complaint they were persistently sexually harassed by Reyes, who entered their dorm and stole possessions including their boxers. Another trans detainee, Monica Renteria-Gonzalez, complained that a stripper chemical he was told to use to clean the facility floors seeped through his fabric shoes and burned the skin of his feet. On more than one occasion, while Renteria-Gonzalez was bent over cleaning, he said, Reyes came up from behind and inappropriately touched him. The assistant warden also told Renteria-Gonzalez he was watching the detainee through security cameras, including while he was showering. A fourth detainee, identified by the pseudonym Jane Doe, is a cisgender, queer woman who said that Reyes forced her to perform oral sex on him on a “near daily basis” between February and May 2024, threatening to kill her if she refused, according to her complaint. Doe, who was deported to the Dominican Republic in January this year, has chosen not to share her name or speak publicly because she fears that Reyes will make good on his threat to find and harm her, her lawyer said. Taken together, the detainees' stories present a troubling pattern of mistreatment and abuse inside SLIPC, their attorneys said. Though the alleged abuse took place across two presidential administrations, advocates worry that conditions inside detention facilities could further deteriorate amid the Trump administration's present push to arrest and detain a record number of immigrants. Trans and queer immigrants in detention are especially vulnerable, advocates said, given that the administration is also moving to roll back key civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ people in federal custody. They were submitted in September by Robert F Kennedy Human Rights, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Louisiana and the National Immigration Project. “It was designed to target vulnerable trans men or masculine-presenting LGBTQ people, who [Reyes] coerced into participating.” When detainees tried to report their abuse, Decker said, Ice officials repeatedly disregarded them. Officials dismissed multiple reports of abuse in accordance with the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act (Prea), Decker said, as well as complaints to the Ice office of inspector general (OIG), the department charged with oversight of Ice. The Guardian attempted to locate Reyes though multiple means, including public records and social media searches and were unable to contact him. But, Renteria-Gonzalez and Garcia-Valenzuela, who remain detained at SLIPC, told the Guardian other staff at the facility have continued to retaliate against them, placing them in solitary confinement and denying them full access to medical care. But in 2019, it opened as an Ice detention facility, operated by Geo Group, one of the largest private prison and surveillance firms in the US. Over the past several years, the detention center, which houses mostly women as well as a few trans people, has attracted a string of allegations of civil and human rights violations, medical neglect and poor hygiene. A 2025 report by the Yale Law School also found that detainees were “left hungry, cold, and in an atmosphere detainees describe as abusive”. “It's devastating and heartbreaking, everything that they do to us in here,” said Renteria-Gonzalez, who first arrived at the facility in May 2023. He said his decision to remain in detention while his immigration case is under review – rather than accept deportation – has been painful. “It is for my daughter and my family that I have endured everything that I have in this detention facility for the past 28 months,” he said. Reyes would often come into his dorm late at night – at around 2 or 3am – to wake him up for his night shift. Each recruit worked alone, during different times or in different parts of the detention facility – meaning they were often alone with Reyes, the detainees allege. “He used to sit on his phone and asked us for personal information to look us up on Facebook and stuff.” Sometimes, he said, Reyes entered detainees' dorms late at night for no particular reason, and would take their used underwear and personal hygiene products. On other occasions, Renteria-Gonzalez alleged in the complaint, Reyes would stalk him as he went to and from the showers and ask invasive questions: “And after, he would say: ‘Tell me what were you doing in the shower? Garcia-Valenzuela had fled to the US in 2014 from Mexico, where he was tortured by members of a drug cartel. “Because I know that as soon as they deport me, I'm going to be handed over to the cartels and I'm going to be tortured and killed – ripped into pieces.” But in SLIPC he faced a new kind of horror. He alleged that on more than one occasion he was told to move heavy metal filing cabinets back and forth across a room. But an Ice officer responded that “even if we take off your transgender marker, there is no hiding that you are transgender”, noting Garcia-Valenzuela's physical appearance, he said. To Garcia-Valenzuela's knowledge, no follow-up investigation into Reyes was conducted. “GEO strongly disagrees with these baseless allegations, which are part of a long-standing, politically motivated, and radical campaign to abolish ICE and end federal immigration detention by attacking the federal government's immigration facility contractors,” said Christopher V Ferreira, a Geo group spokesperson. Ferreira added that “GEO has comprehensive policies in place for the reporting and investigation of all incidents that occur at the Center, including instances of assault and/or sexual assault. Geo did not respond to questions about Reyes's employment status at SLIPC. The detainees who filed complaints against Reyes and other SLIPC staff said that they faced harsh retaliation for doing so. When Jane Doe filed a Prea complaint with Ice using a paper form and through the phone hotline, detailing that Reyes had sexually assaulted her, she received no response, according to her legal complaint. But afterwards, Reyes redoubled his efforts to stalk her, the complaint alleges – and forced her to perform oral sex on him, saying he had her cornered in the facility's “camera blind spots” where no one would see them. He repeatedly cornered Doe as she was en route to the medical center to receive treatment, and told her he would watch her on cameras while she was receiving medical evaluation. After he reported that Reyes had sexually assaulted him, Renteria-Gonzalez said, Reyes burst into his housing unit and yelled, “You should have never put my name on it!”, in reference to the complaint to Ice. Renteria-Gonzalez said he was then placed in solitary confinement for two weeks. After Renteria-Gonzalez reported harassment from another officer, his complaint was dismissed as “unsubstantiated” and the officer came back and told him: “They can't do nothing to me,” according to the complaint. He said staff at the detention center falsely reported that he had attempted self-harm, and needed to be placed under suicide watch, even though he had not in fact tried to hurt himself. There was no spoon provided, he said, and there was a note that instructed him to eat it “like a dog”. Shortly after that incident, he said, a doctor at the facility suddenly – without explanation – stopped providing him access to medication for hand pain that had been exacerbated by his working in Reyes's night-shift program. “I have to stay in the back-most corner of my bed, and eat there,” he said. The allegations of abuse at SLIPC come at a time when the health and safety of trans people in federal custody is especially under threat, advocates say. On the first day of his presidency, Donald Trump unveiled a flurry of executive actions targeting trans rights, rolling back anti-discrimination protections and mandating that people in immigration detention be placed in facilities based on their sex assigned at birth. As soon as Trump took office, the agency began omitting data on the number of transgender people in immigration detention from its reports. “The government is essentially refusing to acknowledge the existence of trans people, let alone their humanity,” Decker of RFK Human Rights said. Although a federal judge has blocked enforcement of Trump's ban on transgender healthcare in federal prisons, Decker told the Guardian that inside detention centers, guards and staff have been emboldened to deny healthcare to trans clients, or retaliate against them for requesting care. “I worry that the situation will only get worse from here for trans people,” she added. The divisions included employees tasked with regularly visiting detention centers, investigating complaints and preparing reports for Congress. Detainees facing discrimination, neglect and abuse now have even fewer options for recourse, Decker said. It's a scary, difficult moment to speak out, said Campos-Flores, a 37-year-old single parent of two children who came to the US from El Salvador when they were 11 years old. During the seven months that Campos-Flores was detained at SLIPC, they would call their parents every day, just to reassure them that they were still alive. But they couldn't stay away from their children, who are US citizens – so they crossed back into the US and were again apprehended. But after finishing their sentence, it is likely they will be transferred back to SLIPC before deportation – and face the same officers who harassed them, or ignored their complaints. He is also gay, he likes boys, and I don't want him to experience anything like what I have experienced,” they said.</p>

The world's best and most ambitious young pianists have descended on Warsaw for the Frederic Chopin International Piano Competition — for some, a gateway to classical music glory. In his famous tragic play Romeo and Juliet, the English playwright William Shakespeare wrote, “What's in a name?” As it turns out, there is quite a lot in a name, particularly a surname, which is commonly known as a person's last name in Western societies. A closer look at the history of surnames reveals some fascinating insights into their origins. It may come as a surprise to some that up until about 1,000 years ago, surnames were Continued from yesterday（延續自昨日） https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang While many early surnames in England were strongly influenced by the work people did, like Carpenter or Plumber, jobs were not the only factor. Physical characteristics, personal nicknames, geographical locations and even parents' first names also played a role. It's not hard to imagine how the color of a person's hair could have led to a surname like “Redhead” or “White,” while a darker complexion might have resulted in the last name “Black.” Meanwhile, someone known as a quick runner might have earned the surname “Swift,” while a clever or cunning individual could have been called “Fox” Many popular English expressions originate from the world of sports. Later, sports like hockey and soccer adopted it to mean scoring three goals in a game. Nowadays, this phrase means to achieve any three successes consecutively, not just in sports.</p>

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes (D) has issued a stark warning to U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana): Seat Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva (D-Arizona), or face a lawsuit. Johnson has thus far refused to seat Grijalva, who won a special election to represent the seventh congressional district of Arizona more than three weeks ago. It is atypical for a person who has won a special election to wait this long to be officially sworn in. On Tuesday, Mayes sent a letter to Johnson expressing frustration over his refusal to seat Grijalva, noting that the delay leaves people in Grijalva's district without representation in the House and unable to access constituent services that other lawmakers can readily provide. Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout. “On behalf of the State of Arizona, I demand that the Honorable Adelita Grijalva be sworn into office as the representative for Arizona's Seventh Congressional District and be allowed to assume her seat without further delay,” Mayes wrote in her letter. And the more than 813,000 residents of Arizona's Seventh Congressional District currently have no representation in Congress. The House and Johnson have acted “in violation of the Constitution” in refusing to seat Grijalva, Mayes said, citing Supreme Court precedent to back her claims. She also stated that Johnson “is without authority to refuse her oath and admission.” Johnson's excuses for refusing to seat Grijalva are “ever-shifting, unsatisfactory, and sometimes absurd stories,” Mayes wrote. She cited one excuse in particular — Johnson's staff has claimed the government shutdown is playing a role in his decision-making, which suggests that GOP leadership in the House “is trying to use Arizona's constitutional right to representation in the House as a bargaining chip” against Democrats, she said. Mayes reiterated her demands in subsequent interviews, saying in a CNN appearance this week that it appears she will have “no other choice except to take Speaker Johnson to court” if he doesn't comply. Grijalva has pledged that when she is seated, she will sign a discharge petition forcing a vote on the Epstein files despite Johnson's objections. When asked whether this was the reason for the holdup in a Fox News interview on Wednesday, Johnson answered glibly. She doesn't know how it works around here.” In response, Grijalva blasted Johnson for patronizing her. Your job as Speaker is to swear me in @SpeakerJohnson. “Your job as Speaker is to swear me in @SpeakerJohnson. That's how things work,” she said in a post on X. “It took @SpeakerJohnson less than 24 hours to swear in his Republican colleagues,” Grijalva wrote. Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest as part of renewed efforts to end Russia's war against Ukraine, Trump announced on Oct. 16. "The United States' initial meetings will be led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, together with various other people, to be designated," Trump wrote on TruthSocial. It remains unclear who will represent Russia at the meeting. "President Putin and I will then meet in an agreed-upon location, Budapest, Hungary, to see if we can bring this 'inglorious' war between Russia and Ukraine to an end," the U.S. president added. Zelensky rejected Putin's invitation to meet in Moscow, calling it impossible while Russia bombs Ukraine, but repeatedly said he is ready to meet the Russian leader on neutral ground. Trump and Putin also met in Alaska on Aug. 15 to discuss prospects for a peace settlement in Russia's war and broader bilateral cooperation — their first meeting since Trump's return to office. Since the Alaska summit, no tangible progress has been made toward peace. Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported that the meeting convinced Putin he could intensify air strikes on Ukraine without facing serious pushback from Washington. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose government is widely seen as illiberal, has blocked or delayed military aid to Ukraine, maintained ties with Putin, and echoed Kremlin narratives. The call came as both sides signal entrenched positions: Moscow warned of escalation, while Washington weighed new measures that could reshape Ukraine's battlefield capabilities. Trump said on Oct. 15 that Ukraine wants to "go offensive" in the war against Russia and that he will decide whether to approve such a strategy after meeting with Zelensky in Washington on Oct. 17. Putin warned on Oct. 5 that arming Ukraine with long-range missiles capable of reaching Siberia would mark "a new stage of escalation" and could derail any progress in U.S.-Russia relations. Tim Zadorozhnyy is a news editor at The Kyiv Independent. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor. The announcement followed a phone call between the two leaders, during which they also agreed to hold a high-level U.S.-Russia meeting next week. The move follows President Volodymyr Zelensky's Oct. 14 decree to strip Odesa Mayor Hennadiy Trukhanov of his Ukrainian citizenship. Explosions have been reported in Kharkiv, Izium, Kropyvnytskyi, and Poltava. Earlier, the Air Force issued a nationwide missile warning after Russia launched MiG-31 bombers. "There will be no oil, (Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is) not buying his oil from Russia, it started — you know, you can't do it immediately, it's a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon," U.S. President Donald Trump said. Another Ukrainian military training ground was hit by a Russian missile strike on Oct. 16, wounding troops. "President (Donald) Trump has instructed the ambassador and myself to tell our European allies that we would be in favor of whether you would call it a 'Russian oil tariff' on China or a 'Ukrainian victory tariff' on China," U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump's Gaza deal is disastrous for the West's enemies, particularly Iran, Russia and China The most important, and most immediate, consequence of the Gaza deal is how it is likely to prompt a wider accommodation with Israel. Preventing that rapprochement is why Hamas attacked on Oct 7 2023 and why Hezbollah (in Lebanon) and the Houthis (in Yemen) immediately joined them, backed by their Iranian sponsors. They passed that venomous hatred down to generations of children. It was the heart of their “educational” curriculum. If their hatred is constant, what changed to prompt the attacks on October 7? But the Islamist regime in Tehran knew that killing over 1,200 Israelis in an unprovoked attack would ensure military retaliation and stall any wider regional bargain as long as the war continued. They knew that taking hostages and holding them would prolong the conflict. They knew, too, that using Gazan civilians as “protective shields” would ensure thousands of Muslims were killed in the war, no matter how hard Israel tried to avoid those casualties. The civilian deaths and destruction would pose an insurmountable obstacle to regional peace as long as the fighting dragged on. Meanwhile, the fighting would divert attention from Iran's fundamental strategic goal: building a deliverable nuclear weapon to threaten Israel and perhaps eliminate it entirely. For almost two years, Iran and its terrorist proxies managed to fulfil their goals. First, Israel held off the terror onslaught from Gaza and Southern Lebanon. After those networks had been crippled and no longer posed a strategic threat, the Jewish state moved onto its main target: Iran and its nuclear programme. Israel managed to destroy much of that programme on its own, but some was buried deep underground, beyond the reach of its fighter jets. To take out those deep facilities, Israel needed (and received) help from America with its heavy, penetrating bombs and its huge, stealthy aircraft to deliver them. The combined success of the Israeli and American air forces is quite likely to have destroyed Iran's nuclear facilities and delayed their rebirth for years. Iran never expected this devastating, comprehensive response, or its total success. Iran could no longer afford to pay the terrorists or replenish their weapons. It has proved to be overwhelmingly powerful, not only militarily but also economically and technologically in a region that only respects strength. Moreover, it proved beyond doubt that it is willing to use its military force to protect its vital interests. It is not just a strong horse; it is ready to pull its weight, however costly that might be. The key will be Saudi Arabia, when it finally signs onto the Abraham Accords, engineered by Jared Kushner during Trump's first term and likely to be extended now by his efforts and those of Steve Witkoff. But Russia and China have also been further marginalised as Middle Eastern players. That role was based mainly on its alliance with the Assad regime in Syria and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Today, Assad's regime is gone and its replacement, though no friend of Israel, will be wary of taking on its powerful neighbour without significant external support. With Iran diminished, expect Turkey to step in as leader of the Islamic world. Ankara hopes to make Syria a junior partner, limit the influence of the Kurds, and cement its status as Israel's major regional foe. That's a troublesome prospect for Jerusalem, but not nearly as bad as a powerful Iran on the threshold of nuclear weaponry. Globally, Trump has emerged as the most consequential US leader since Ronald Reagan. His achievement of a regional deal that includes both Israel and the Muslim states is unprecedented. With that tectonic shift, America and Israel have solidified their positions as the key powers in the Middle East, militarily and economically. That's true, even if Phase Two in Gaza goes poorly. Under Trump, it wants to assert itself as the region's only outside power but, crucially, it wants to do so with a much smaller, less costly footprint. That means regional powers will pay for Gazan reconstruction and security. Incidentally, those lower prices will add to the damage America and Ukraine are already inflicting on Russia. Turmoil in the Middle East had delayed that full-scale military commitment. Trump won't be diverted and dragged into a heavier commitment there. He is determined to let the Europeans pay for that. Let them buy the weapons for Kyiv that only America can produce. Trump keeps saying that this joint US-European effort can move Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table. He can't stop now with so little to show for such a monumental sacrifice. The only deal Putin would consider is one he could discard as soon as he had replenished his military. Nato members understand this grim logic of deceit and will install troops in Ukraine as a tripwire if Putin reneges. That tripwire means a Russian invasion would inevitably kill those Western troops and draw Nato members into a war that Russia could not win. Knowing that he cannot pull off a deceitful pause and fearing for his life if he settles for a costly draw, Putin is very unlikely to end his costly war-of-choice. Trump may talk optimistically about negotiating with Putin, but the Russian dictator is more likely to lie on the undertaker's table before he sits at the bargaining table, sincerely seeking a compromise. Short of a durable bargain (and that's unlikely), the most probable outcome is slow Ukrainian progress on the battlefield, taking back territory as the Russia economy implodes and loses its war of attrition. These wider strategic issues are front and centre now because of Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu's success in the Middle East. For Israel, that success means a much bigger, much more secure role in the region for the first time since its founding in 1948. That role is based on military and economic prowess and the recognition by most Muslim states, at long last, that Israel is here to stay and that it is more valuable as an economic and security partner than as a perennial pariah. (The governments of Keir Starmer and Emanuel Macron haven't learnt that lesson.) These changes are bad news for the West's enemies in Iran, China, and Russia. They are very good news, though, for America and its allies in the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. His latest book is Free Speech 101: A Practical Guide for Students.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A posthumous memoir by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre offers an expanded account but few new revelations about her longstanding claims to have been sexually trafficked by the late financier to billionaires, politicians and Britain's Prince Andrew. Giuffre told her story in interviews and lawsuits for 16 years. But she has added details and description of how her alleged experiences with Epstein – after what she said was a traumatic childhood and other instances of sexual abuse – affected her psychologically and left her struggling to cope. Giuffre's memoir was completed before she died by suicide in April.The Associated Press “I needed him not to be a selfish, cruel pedophile. So I told myself he wasn't one,” she wrote about her mindset at the time. Giuffre first met Epstein in the summer of 2000, weeks before she turned 17, while working at the spa at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida. Maxwell has denied participating in any sexual abuse and called Giuffre's account of being trafficked a lie, as have all of the men she has publicly accused. Speculation that Epstein was involved in a global sex trafficking ring continues to cause headaches for the Trump administration, which has been under pressure to publicly release more records related to the FBI's investigations of Epstein and Maxwell. Family of Virginia Giuffre says they are shocked that Trump said Epstein ‘stole' her And why haven't they led to the prosecution of any more abusers?” Trump “couldn't have been friendlier,” Giuffre said, adding that he offered to help her find babysitting work. Giuffre also mentions that she was once present for dinners Epstein had with former President Bill Clinton and former Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, but she also didn't accuse them of any wrongdoing. Three years later, Palm Beach police began investigating Epstein after the parents of another teenage girl reported that their daughter had also been paid for a sex act. Police identified multiple underage girls with similar stories about being hired to give sexualized massages, but the investigation ended in 2008 when Epstein pleaded guilty to procuring a person under 18 for prostitution. In the book, Giuffre wrote that Epstein and Maxwell persuaded her to become a recruiter who found other girls who would perform sexualized massages on Epstein – something she called “the worst thing I've ever done in my life.” Maxwell was convicted in 2021 of charges including sex trafficking and is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Many Epstein victims have told their stories publicly over the years, but Giuffre always stood apart with her claim to have been “loaned” to Epstein's rich and powerful friends and acquaintances. The Associated Press typically does not name people who say they are the victims of sexual abuse unless they have come forward publicly with their stories, as Giuffre has.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nestlé will cut around 16,000 jobs worldwide over the next two years as it works to slash costs, including through automation, the world's largest food company said Thursday. Most of the layoffs – about 12,000 – will affect white-collar professionals as Nestlé targets “operational efficiency,” including by automating processes and using shared services, the company behind such brands as KitKat and Nesquik said in a statement. Another 4,000 roles will go in manufacturing and the supply chain as part of measures to improve productivity. The overall job cuts will amount to almost 6% of Nestlé's workforce. “The world is changing, and Nestlé needs to change faster,” new CEO Philipp Navratil said in the statement. “This will include making hard but necessary decisions to reduce headcount.” The announcement comes as the rise of artificial intelligence has fueled fears over potential job losses in various industries. The chief executive of Anthropic, a leading AI lab, warned in May that AI could cause a dramatic spike in unemployment. Nestlé says on its website that it uses AI in a number of functions, including research and development. In its last annual report, it also said it employs automation and advanced analytics in promotional activities, such as work on discounts and in-store displays. The planned layoffs add to turmoil at the Swiss company after an unexpected removal of its previous chief executive in early September. Laurent Freixe was dismissed for failing to disclose a romantic relationship with a direct subordinate, which breached Nestlé's code of business conduct. The company's organic sales, a measure of underlying growth, rose 4.3% in the third quarter, it also said Thursday. Nestlé reiterated its commitment to investing over the medium term despite “ongoing risks from macroeconomic and consumer uncertainties.” Consumers in the United States have grown pessimistic in recent months as they worry about inflation, which could worsen because of higher US tariffs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu survived two no-confidence votes in parliament on Thursday, winning crucial backing from the Socialist Party thanks to his pledge to suspend President Emmanuel Macron's contested pension reform. The two motions presented by the hard-left France Unbowed and the far-right National Rally (RN) secured just 271 and 144 votes respectively – well short of the 289 votes needed to bring down Lecornu's days-old government. “A majority cobbled together through horse-trading managed today to save their positions, at the expense of the national interest,” RN party president Jordan Bardella wrote on X. By putting the pension reform on the chopping block, Lecornu threatens to kill off one of Macron's main economic legacies at a time when France's public finances are in a perilous state, leaving the president with little in the way of domestic achievements after eight years in office. There are 265 lawmakers in parliament from parties that said they would vote to topple Lecornu, and only a handful of rebels from other groups joined their cause. If Lecornu had lost either vote, he and his ministers would have had to immediately resign, and Macron would have come under huge pressure to call a snap parliamentary election, plunging France deeper into crisis. But despite the outcome of Thursday's votes, Lecornu still faces weeks of arduous negotiations in parliament over passing a slimmed-down 2026 budget during which he could be toppled at any point. “The French need to know that we are doing all this work… to give them a budget, because it is fundamental for the future of our country,” said Yael Braun-Pivet, the president of the National Assembly and an ally of Macron. “I am pleased to see that today there is a majority in the National Assembly that is operating in this spirit: work, the search for compromise, the best possible effort,” she added. After winning the pension concession, the Socialists on Wednesday set their sights on including a tax on billionaires in the 2026 budget, underlining just how weak Lecornu's hand is in the negotiations. France is in the midst of its worst political crisis in decades as a succession of minority governments seek to push deficit-reducing budgets through a truculent legislature split into three distinct ideological blocs. Reforming France's generous pension system has been political kryptonite ever since Socialist President Francois Mitterrand cut the retirement age to 60 from 65 in 1982. In France, the average effective retirement age is just 60.7, compared to the OECD average of 64.4. Although that only brings French policy into line with other European Union member states, it chips away at a cherished social benefit beloved by the left.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These stories topped Thursday's headlines across Russia. Israel and Hamas continue to implement the peace plan, albeit with delays and frequent accusations against each other. Another incident occurred on October 15: the Palestinian movement handed over four bodies of hostages to Israel, but one of them turned out to be a Gaza resident. "Israel and Hamas are reacting more to outside pressure from the United States and regional states, which are deeply interested in formally ending the current phase of the conflict. Therefore, they leave room for maneuver at each stage, try to avoid binding measures or agreements and preserve the maximum number of options for exiting the deal by accusing the other side of undermining the agreements reached," he explained. That said, the White House, apparently, considers the issue of exchanges closed, as it does not put pressure on either side to accelerate. Political analyst Dastan Tokoldoshev, in an interview with Izvestia, notes that Trump's threats were rather an attempt to frighten the opponents, "and, apparently, Hamas is also well aware of this." "Most likely, the United States will deploy full-scale military and economic assistance to Israel, support the technical strengthening of the IDF, but will not involve its own military personnel, who are already slated to be deployed in a coordination center they are establishing on Israeli soil," Tokoldoshev concluded. "Regardless of Israel saying that it is ready for self-isolation, its society and economy are not ready for this, and, therefore, the cabinet of ministers is under serious pressure both from within, from diasporas and lobbying pro-Israel groups, including in the United States. It is quite difficult for the cabinet to ignore these demands," he added. Syria's new authorities seeks to renew relations with Russia, Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa said during the first-ever meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on October 16. The recognition of Syria's new authorities actually happened some time ago, even though not everyone in Russia was happy with it, so it was somewhat "incomplete," noted Kirill Semyonov, an expert from the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC). The Syrian economy requires investments, and al-Sharaa's visit is an opportunity for Russia to strengthen its presence in energy, transport, and ports through concessions and joint ventures, but only if the military presence is maintained, believes Nikolay Sukhov, senior researcher at the Center for Middle East Studies under the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations. Damascus needs a new legal and financial framework for cooperation, not one associated with Assad's legacy," he explained. Sukhov does not rule out that Russia could help form a new Syrian army from Assad's former opponents. According to Semyonov, it was decided to retain the military bases long ago, but it is their efficiency that matters for Moscow; it is also necessary to determine whether both facilities are still required. Sukhov believes that the visit of Syria's interim leader to Moscow is a strategic message both domestically in Syria and externally as an additional security guarantee for the new authorities. Moscow supports the state-building efforts of Syria's leadership and may even help facilitate their reconciliation with the Kurds and Druze, Semyonov concluded. Sukhov has ruled out such a scenario. "It is more likely to be a detailed discussion about the assets the new authorities are interested in," he noted. It includes an updated concept titled the "European Drone Defense Initiative." Nadezhda Arbatova, head of the Department of European Political Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations, told Nezavisimaya Gazeta that the comprehensive plan for implementing the program to strengthen the European Union's defense capabilities is a consistent step toward a goal outlined in the EU White Paper for European Defense. To achieve this goal, Brussels believes Europe must act swiftly and jointly, gradually forming a defense potential capable of real-time responses to security threats. "Discussing the roadmap at the upcoming EU summit will focus on specific issues of closing critical gaps in the EU's defense potential and its support for Ukraine. It seems that this top-level meeting is intended to compensate for Brussels' dissatisfaction with the outcome of the EU summit in Copenhagen on October 1-2. Convened to reach consensus on key priorities of rearming Europe, for the EU leadership it turned into an unpleasant display of competition for influence, political disputes, and hidden agendas that hinder strengthening Europe's defense potential," the expert said. This may be regarded as a move toward the Europeanization of the transatlantic partnership, which requires not only developing joint NATO-EU mechanisms but also steady political and financial commitments from the US' European allies. Russia and India have managed to adjust the structure of mutual trade: consumer goods have been added to energy resources. India has started paying for them in yuan, but the ruble is still used in most transactions. "It must be noted that the trade turnover between Russia and India is extremely lopsided. By expanding its exports to Russia, India can offset imbalances in mutual trade and reduce the large balance of rupees in our country," Yevgeny Smirnov, head of the Department of World Economy and International Economic Relations at the State University of Management, told Izvestia. Transactions are carried out by direct payments in rubles and rupees. However, the expert community notes that there are still some difficulties. "In particular, the speed and continuity of mutual settlements in trade are limited by the fact that the payment systems and banking systems of Russia and India are still not fully compatible. The key problem is challenges in converting Indian rupees received by Russian exporters, since they cannot be exchanged for other reserve currencies or, for example, transferred offshore. Russian oil accounted for 34% of India's total hydrocarbon imports, as, with discounts, it remains the most cost-effective type of raw material. Singh noted that a very simple logic is in place here, as India, above all, thinks about itself, its national security, consumers and relations with various countries. More than 25% of the country's GDP comes from this sector, analyst Yelena Kozhukhova from Veles Capital pointed out. It traditionally was the largest consumer of steel, cement, equipment and services, added Kirill Lysenko, sovereign and regional rating analyst at the Expert RA agency. The US may be hurt by the tariff war to a greater extent, believes economist Yegor Susin. "China is not only the largest exporter and manufacturer but is also a holder of the US state debt, so Beijing has powerful levers of pressure. So far it is rather the US businesses that are losing revenue due to the tariffs as they have to pay for customs," Susin pointed out. He added that had Beijing not been confident in its economy, it wouldn't have escalated. In the future, competing by using bans and tariffs will become even more common, Susin believes. The interdependence of the US and China remains high, even though in 10-20 years it may weaken due to efforts by both countries, said analyst Kirill Kononov from BCS - World of Investments. Kozhukhova notes that in the event the sides do not reach an agreement, competition in hi-tech sectors, such as IT, may increase. And China's IT sector may become more independent as the country has rare-earth metals, while for US companies this may mean bigger problems. The tariff war may be a chance for China to secure the yuan as an international currency, increase exports to Asian markets and improve relations with India, believes Novikova.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US president advised to prioritise those who have been ‘targeted for peaceful expression of views online' Donald Trump could offer political asylum to Europeans who oppose migration. The major overhaul of the American immigration system, some of which has already been implemented, would also give preference to English speakers and white South Africans. The US president has spearheaded a major crackdown on immigration, suspending refugee admissions on his first day in office and announcing plans to slash the number of refugees allowed from 125,000 per year to 7,500. Mr Trump has been advised to prioritise Europeans who have been “targeted for peaceful expression of views online, such as opposition to mass migration or support for ‘populist' political parties”. US officials have been monitoring the political landscape in Europe to determine whether citizens could be eligible for refugee status. Earlier this year, the White House criticised a decision by Germany's foreign office to classify the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party as Right-wing extremist. Mr Trump warned European nations in a speech at the United Nations that their countries were “going to hell” because of unchecked immigration. “They've been invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody's ever seen before. He has claimed that Afrikaners face racial persecution in South Africa, which is disputed by the government. It suggests the administration only welcome “refugees who can be fully and appropriately assimilated, and are aligned with the president's objectives”. A limit on the number of refugees resettling in certain communities that already have a large number of immigrants could also be put into place. Since returning to power in January, Mr Trump has enacted a forceful crackdown on undocumented immigrants. New polling from The New York Times and Siena University suggests the majority of Americans support a crackdown on immigration but think Mr Trump's forceful approach has gone too far. He has even faced some backlash from his own base. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican congresswoman and one of Mr Trump's most ardent supporters, publicly condemned the crackdown on immigration. “That's a fact that also cannot be ignored, and as a conservative and as a business owner in the construction industry and as a realist, I can say we have to do something about labor, and that needs to be a smarter plan than just rounding up every single person and deporting them just like that, right?” Popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who endorsed Mr Trump in November, labelled the deportations as “horrific”. He also said on a recent podcast: “When you're just arresting people in front of their kids and just normal, regular people that have been here for 20 years – everybody who has a heart can't get along with that.” Earlier this week, the US revoked the visas of at least six people for public comments they had made about the murder of Right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, who was shot while addressing a crowd at an event in Utah last month. In a post on X, the State Department said the US had “no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Teck Resources' Highland Valley Copper Mine is seen near Logan Lake, B.C., last month.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press U.S. President Donald Trump's increasing interventionist push into the Canadian critical-minerals sector may propel Ottawa to follow suit, but some industry players are cautioning the federal government to tread carefully. In the past few weeks, the Trump administration announced it had taken equity stakes in two Canadian critical-minerals companies, Lithium Americas Corp. LAC-T and Trilogy Metals Inc. TMQ-T. The U.S. government has also recently taken equity positions in chip maker Intel Corp. INTC-Q and rare-earths company MP Materials Corp. MP-N Opinion: Washington buying stakes in Canadian miners creates national-security dilemma for Ottawa Unlike the recent Trump administration transactions, CGF deals have been done at terms that are far closer to market rates, and in conjunction with private-sector stakeholders. Yannick Beaudoin, chief executive officer of Canada Growth Fund Investment Management Inc., said in an e-mail that CGF is “pleased to bring its investor's lens to unlock Canadian projects, support economic growth, and strengthen critical minerals supply chains for Canada, its allies, and its trading partners.” The Globe and Mail asked Natural Resources Minister Tim Hodgson whether Ottawa plans to take more equity stakes in companies and at more aggressive terms, similar to Mr. Trump's actions. “The Government of Canada continues to assess its economic tool kit to ensure its supports for critical minerals projects and companies are fit for purpose, recognizing geopolitical developments and emerging trends in global investment landscapes,” Carolyn Svonkin, spokesperson for Mr. Hodgson, replied in an e-mail. Government and private industry invariably have different goals that are difficult to reconcile, she said. While a company's primary responsibility is to shareholders, governments' objectives are political. There is also an inherent conflict of interest in having Ottawa as a shareholder because it has the power to grant or deny permits, which can make or break a company. On regulation, she added, “You can't regulate a project that you have an economic interest in, that violates basic fundamental principles of good governance and fairness.” He said they can lower the cost of capital by up to 50 per cent. Currently, flow-through shares can only be issued if the proceeds are used to fund mining exploration and development. While government grants and loans only benefit a few players, broader access could help the entire industry. Study and track financial data on any traded entity: click to open the full quote page.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Amid frequent news reports about hacks and leaks, a key truth is often overlooked: the United States does not have a cybersecurity problem. The multibillion-dollar cybersecurity industry largely exists to compensate for insecure software. Since at least 2021, for instance, hackers connected to China's Ministry of State Security and People's Liberation Army have exploited the same types of flaws that the Morris Worm feasted on decades ago. And just this year, Russian Federal Security Service hackers exploited an unpatched flaw in networking devices to compromise thousands of routers and switches connected to U.S. infrastructure. These vulnerabilities endure because software vendors face few incentives to prioritize security. And because much of the code that underpins critical infrastructure is decades old, rewriting it securely has long been too expensive and time-consuming to make business sense. But capabilities—including the accelerating power of artificial intelligence—are emerging to fix these software problems across entire digital ecosystems. A better and more secure approach to software is within reach. In the popular narrative, hackers—whether they are individual rogue actors, state-sponsored groups, or teams backed by criminal syndicates—are mysterious and clever, deviously exploiting careless employees and misconfigured servers. But most intrusions do not succeed because attackers wield exotic cyberweapons. They succeed because widely deployed technology products are installed with well-known and preventable defects. Most buyers have no practical way to judge whether the software they purchase is secure. They must take vendors at their word, which creates little incentive for the designers or sellers of software to invest in protections that customers cannot see or measure. As a result, software vendors compete on aspects that are more obvious to buyers: lower prices, getting their products to market first, and convenient functionalities such as one-click integrations with other systems or easy remote access. But focusing on these features often comes at the expense of adequate safeguards against cyberthreats. Market forces simply do not incentivize prioritizing security in the design process. This has led to the rise of the cybersecurity aftermarket—a sprawling ecosystem of antivirus systems, detection capabilities, firewalls, and much more—which essentially provides bolt-on solutions to address software insecurities. And although the cybersecurity industry has evolved into an impressive community of talented innovators, its interventions are necessarily rearguard actions. In the United States, there is no enforceable baseline standard for what security protections software must have, nor are there penalties for insecure software, essentially making unsafe design a rational business choice. When catastrophic breaches occur, software companies create patches rather than redesign the product to be more secure. Until these companies are held liable and regulators enforce standards, exploitable code will remain the foundation of digital infrastructure. Prevention would be much better than a set of inconsistently applied and sometimes flimsy cures. For decades, even well-intentioned software companies could not justify efforts to create more secure products. But increasingly powerful artificial intelligence is changing this calculus. New technology holds the promise of making it possible to cheaply and effectively produce newer, safer code and also fix the weaknesses of older code, which would drastically reduce cyber-risk to global digital infrastructure. Major technology firms report that AI systems generate roughly a quarter of their code, a share that could rise above 80 percent within the next five years. Relying on AI to fix software has some risks: because AI models are learning from decades of imperfect human code, they could reproduce the same vulnerabilities that plague current software. Trained purposefully on secure coding standards and continuously refined through feedback, AI can correct human errors, not perpetuate them. Over time, AI will produce more secure code than any human developer can. From 2023 to 2025, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ran an AI Cyber Challenge to test whether AI systems could autonomously find and patch software flaws. Private sector firms, including companies such as Google, Meta, and Microsoft, which build software that Americans use every day, are taking similar action, using AI systems to detect and fix vulnerabilities. Most important, AI will help tackle the hardest challenge in securing software: aging code that supports much of the world's digital infrastructure. The design choices made when this code was written have left deeply rooted weaknesses. Rewriting all this legacy code to be more secure has, until recently, been prohibitively expensive and risky—the digital equivalent of trying to rebuild an airplane midflight. But as AI becomes increasingly powerful, it offers the promise of millions of agents simultaneously reading, understanding, and transforming insecure code at scale. AI is thus an economic breakthrough as well as a technical one: it makes the painstaking work of rewriting the network of insecure software affordable. This risk is real: AI will enable adversaries to automate their offensive strategies at the same time as defensive systems automate detection and response. But the more profound impact of AI should be upstream, in prevention rather than reaction. By helping build software that eliminates the vulnerabilities that adversaries seek to exploit, AI can address the root cause of cyber insecurity. Instead of purchasing an endless cascade of products to compensate for defective software, organizations could pay for software that is measurably more secure out of the box—and for AI-assisted tools that maintain its defenses automatically. Programmers will no longer write code that needs fixing later; AI assistants will help them create systems with security built in from the start. Old, fragile systems will be continuously modernized, removing dangerous flaws that attackers exploit today. Ending the cybersecurity aftermarket by creating high-quality software at scale requires ambitious leaders willing to take bold action. Incremental tweaks won't close the gap between today's fragile, defect-ridden ecosystem and a future in which software is designed to be secure. Most critically, the AI systems that will help secure software must themselves be built securely. AI models can be manipulated through corrupted training data; they can make unpredictable decisions that even their creators can't fully explain; they may depend on software components sourced from untrustworthy suppliers; and they can introduce entirely new weaknesses that adversaries can exploit, such as the potential to trick an AI model into revealing sensitive data. Rolling out AI-enabled features as quickly as possible, without first ensuring they are secure, would only repeat the same mistakes that created today's fragile digital ecosystem. The White House AI Action Plan, released in July, acknowledges these challenges, calling for security, transparency, and accountability to be built into AI systems from the outset. Clear guardrails on the development, deployment, and use of AI systems should be designed to prevent abuse while preserving room for innovation. California's new AI accountability law, enacted in September, provides one model for how to establish transparency and risk-assessment obligations that could shape a coherent national approach. Just as customers can evaluate cars through crash-test ratings, appliances through energy-efficiency labels, or food through nutrition labels, buyers should have a similar ability to assess how the software products that Americans rely on every day are built. Consumers should know whether basic protections such as secure authentication are turned on by default, how quickly security flaws are fixed, and whether products give customers the tools to detect and recover from intrusions. In January 2025, the Biden administration launched the U.S. Cyber Trust Mark, a label to certify that Internet-connected devices such as smart home products meet standard cybersecurity criteria. Similar to how Energy Star labels verify products' energy efficiency and encourage consumers to buy efficient appliances, the Cyber Trust Mark will help market forces reward companies that invest in security. All software products, not just Internet-connected devices, should have transparent labels to enable a race toward security as the default. Regulators also have a responsibility to ensure that the burden for software vulnerabilities falls on vendors, not buyers. As a result, pipelines, railways, financial services, and communications systems are each governed by different standards, which are enforced by different agencies. The patchwork of overlapping requirements drives superficial compliance rather than genuine risk reduction. A better approach, as recommended by the Cyberspace Solarium Commission—a bipartisan panel of lawmakers, former officials, and industry leaders established by Congress in 2019—would be to focus on the software that underpins every sector, not the sector itself, by establishing a clear liability framework to hold software producers responsible when negligent design or development practices lead to security failures. In addition to improving software liability, harmonizing remaining sector-specific cybersecurity rules is critical. Conflicting mandates leave companies navigating inconsistent demands from multiple regulators. A more effective model would consolidate leadership under the Office of the National Cyber Director, an entity created by Congress in 2021 to coordinate national cybersecurity policy, which would empower a single entity to drive strategy, determine priorities, and ensure policy coherence rather than regulatory chaos. Yet more than four years after the Department of Homeland Security submitted secure software standards for inclusion in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the corpus of processes governing public procurement, there is still no finalized rule requiring vendors to attest to secure development practices. Federal procurers could take a lesson from the finance corporation JPMorgan Chase, which recently issued an open letter to its software suppliers setting clear expectations that their products should prioritize security over rushing features to market. Early reports suggest that its vendors are responding by strengthening development practices and offering greater transparency—a demonstration of how purchasing power can drive accountability upstream. The consequences of America's failure to solve its software quality problem are becoming more severe. Power grids, hospitals, pipelines, ports, and financial networks now run almost entirely on software, leaving them exposed to escalating risks of corruption and disruption. Companies and regulators can continue treating software insecurity as a fact of nature—reacting to breaches, layering on patches, and blaming users—or they can make security the default setting. Despite growing awareness of the problem among both policymakers and businesses, progress toward effective solutions has been limited. Some agencies have advanced initiatives encouraging software companies to build security into their products, but there is still no binding national framework. The issue rarely ranks as a political priority—neither in Congress, which has yet to pass sweeping liability or design mandates, nor in the executive branch, which oscillates between rhetoric and restraint. Meanwhile, powerful industry lobbies and major technology firms continue to resist reforms that might raise costs or slow the race for feature-rich product releases. But the Trump administration's continued focus on harnessing the federal government's vast procurement power—and on expanding initiatives promoting more secure design for both traditional and AI-enabled software—offers a potential inflection point. If coupled with clear standards and enforcement mechanisms, these efforts could begin to transform security from an afterthought into a market expectation. Reducing preventable software flaws would free up resources and personnel to focus on deterring and disrupting adversaries—for instance, expanding offensive cyber-capabilities to impose costs on those who target U.S. critical infrastructure—shifting the balance of power from constant defense to proactive deterrence. Human expertise and machine intelligence will work in concert to strengthen critical systems, safeguard innovation, and preserve the United States' technological edge. Cybersecurity should no longer mean a permanent defensive struggle. It should mean the deliberate design of a safer digital world.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to relocate World Cup matches set to be played next year in suburban Boston, after suggesting that parts of the city had been “taken over” by unrest. Trump was asked about Boston's mayor, Michelle Wu, a Democrat whom he called “intelligent” but “radical left.” “We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup games. He suggested “they're taking over parts of Boston” without offering details, but added “we could get them back in about two seconds.” Trump's comments came during his meeting with Argentina President Javier Milei and it wasn't immediately clear what he was referring to by parts of Boston having been seized. Earlier this month, however, there were multiple arrests in connection with a pro-Palestinian protest that turned violent on Boston Common. Trump has previously suggested he could declare cities “not safe” for the 104-game soccer tournament and alter a detailed hosting plan that FIFA confirmed in 2022. It includes games at NFL stadiums near New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Trump nonetheless said, “If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni – the head of FIFA who's phenomenal — and I would say, ‘Let's move into another location' and they would do that.” The president meant FIFA head Gianni Infantino, a close ally.

LUGANSK, October 16. /TASS/. The liberation of the settlement of Alexeyevka in the Dnepropetrovsk Region will facilitate the establishment of a security zone on the border with the Zaporozhye Region, Russian military expert Andrey Marochko told TASS.

"Russian forces continue advancing westward, liberating the Zaporozhye Region and concurrently creating a buffer zone in the Dnepropetrovsk Region. The defense ministry's reports about the liberation of Alexeyevka is yet another evidence of this," he said.

The Russian defense ministry reported about the liberation of the settlement of Alexeyevka in the Dnepropetrovsk Region on October 15.</p>
