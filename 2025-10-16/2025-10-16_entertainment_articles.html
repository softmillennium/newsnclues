                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. Just a little over a month after it hit the market, Amazon MGM‘s United Artists has scooped up the rights to “Lizard Music,” which is the next film from Benny Safdie that will reunite him with Dwayne Johnson. “Lizard Music” though is even stranger, a book adaptation that concerns lizard musicians from outer space that will star The Rock as a guy in his seventies known only as Chicken Man, mainly because he has a beloved companion named Claudia who happens to be a 111-year-old chicken. The film follows a boy who discovers a secret late-night broadcast of lizards playing otherworldly music, opening him up to an entirely new world of wonder that leads him to Chicken Man, who is also aware of the lizard musicians and teams up with the boy in order to find this hidden society. Though this is just Safdie's second solo movie as a director without his brother Josh, this is something of a big break from A24, which has been the home for “Good Time,” “Uncut Gems,” and “The Smashing Machine” all before this. A24 also co-produced Safdie's series he co-created with Nathan Fielder, “The Curse” that aired on Showtime. It's unclear if A24 was also in on acquiring the package, but IndieWire understands Amazon MGM picked it up in a competitive situation. Scott Stuber, who runs United Artists, has worked with both Johnson and Safdie before. The Rock has starred in a handful of mega Netflix hits, including one of the streamer's biggest hits “Red Notice,” and Safdie also appeared in “Happy Gilmore 2” at Netflix. Anyone who has seen him on the red carpet at Venice or elsewhere during the “Smashing Machine” awards campaign would notice that he looks a little gaunter than usual, and that is all by design. “The Smashing Machine” has been a surprise disappointment, a bigger swing by A24 in terms of budget that did not pan out at the box office. The film carries a $50 million budget and has made just $17.1 million at the box office in over two weeks in theaters. It's the lowest opening of The Rock's career by far and a letdown for a movie that also has serious awards ambitions. “We are so thrilled to partner once again with extraordinarily talented Dwayne Johnson, as well as work for the first time with the amazing creator, writer, and director Benny Safdie, on ‘Lizard Music.' We are so excited to now collaborate with them on this imaginative, entertaining, and cinematic story; ‘Lizard Music' is a tale that feels both timeless and unique. We are very fortunate that they have trusted us to be their studio partners,” Courtenay Valenti, Head of Film, Streaming and Theatrical, Amazon MGM Studios, said in a statement. The world they've created together for ‘Lizard Music' is unlike anything either has done before, and we couldn't be more excited to bring this wonderfully imaginative story to life,” Stuber added. “I couldn't be more excited to go on this journey with Amazon MGM studios and United Artists. I love Daniel Pinkwater as a person and an author; the idea of making a movie where everyone can join the conversation is both thrilling and beautiful.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Even with his latest film Jay Kelly in the midst of award season following its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival, George Clooney not only appears to have lined up his next project but also another A-list star with which to share the screen. Sources tell Deadline that Clooney and Annette Bening are set to star in upcoming book adaptation In Love, based on Amy Bloom's New York Times bestselling memoir In Love: A Memoir of Love and Loss. In Love is an illuminating, modern love story about two people who make an impossible decision together that honors their enduring commitment to one another. Noah Baumbach On The Humanity Of His George Clooney Vehicle 'Jay Kelly': "We Want To See Movie Stars Represent Us" - Contenders London George Clooney Says 'Ocean's 14' Budget Got "Approved At Warner Bros." & "Probably Start" Filming "In About 9 Or 10 Months" “Amy's memoir is a contemporary fable of love, wit and existential stakes. I can't wait to do it justice with this amazing cast,” says Weitz. Andrew Miano and Weitz will produce for Depth of Field. Clooney will also produce with Grant Heslov for Smokehouse Pictures. “I have been so lucky to work with Eddie and Julie, so lucky to write with Paul and so grateful that this story of lasting love gets to be told on the screen, in Paul's gifted hands, by two of the greatest actors in America,” says Bloom. Anton is fully financing and representing international rights. U.S. rights are being co-repped by Anton and CAA Media Finance. Jay Kelly has earned Clooney rave reviews on the festival circuit and is sure to have him in contention this award season in the lead actor circuit. The film, directed and co-written by Noah Baumbach, will have a limited theatrical run beginning November 15 before it bows on Netflix on December 5. Most recently, Clooney earned a Tony Award nomination for his Broadway debut in Good Night, and Good Luck, in which he starred as Edward R. Murrow in the stage adaptation of his Oscar-nominated 2015 film he co-wrote with Heslov. Making history as the first live Broadway performance to be televised simultaneously, the show aired on CNN to a worldwide audience. Through Smokehouse, Clooney's most recent directorial project was The Boys in the Boat, which he both directed and produced for MGM alongside Smokehouse partner Heslov. That film was based on the bestselling novel by Daniel James Brown. For Bening, the Oscar-nominated actor will be seen next in The Bride, directed by Maggie Gyllenhaal and starring opposite Jessie Buckley, Christian Bale, Penélope Cruz and Peter Sarsgaard. Best known for directing such acclaimed films like About a Boy, Weitz created and ran the Apple TV series Murderbot with his brother Chris Weitz. The series premiered in May and stars Alexander Skarsgård. Helmed by filmmaker Hikari and starring Brendan Fraser, it will hit theaters November 21 via Searchlight Pictures. Clooney is represented by CAA and attorney Stephen Clark. Bening is represented by CAA and Gochman Law Group. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. Whether you're a total believer in aliens or roll your eyes at conspiracy theorists, there's something to be appreciated in Dan Farah's “The Age of Disclosure.” The documentary attempts to apply some journalistic legitimacy to ideas that, until recently, were confined to obscure forums and podcasts, featuring 34 government officials from both political parties making the case that our government knows a lot more about extraterrestrial life than it's telling us. If you're open to the idea (and at peace with the fact that you can't see any visual evidence yet), the documentary plays like a sci-fi thrill ride underscored by the optimistic notion that we might have a very exciting century ahead of us if this information begins to be disclosed. And if you're not convinced by any of the testimony, you might be morbidly fascinated by the performance art of watching so many allegedly serious people would go on the record about such things. The film, which premiered at the 2025 SXSW Film and TV Festival before distribution rights were acquired by Prime Video, follows alleged government whistleblower Luis Elizondo. Elizondo has become a dashboard saint for alien research enthusiasts after claiming to have resigned as the director of the Pentagon's classified Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program over what he saw as bureaucratic opposition to telling people the truth. He outlines a series of unexplainable phenomena that military and intelligence officials have witnessed over the past century, including flying objects that defy all laws of physics and travel exponentially faster than anything mankind has ever produced, which the military has categorized as Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (or UAPs, for short).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Maybe I am complicit, but I am not a monster,” Claire Danes' character says in the new trailer for Netflix's The Beast In Me. We don't know if The Beast In Me will fall into either of these categories as of this writing, but it certainly seems to be treading similar ground. But she finds an unlikely subject for a new book when the house next door is bought by Nile Jarvis (Matthew Rhys), a famed and formidable real estate mogul who was once the prime suspect in his wife's disappearance. At once horrified and fascinated by this man, Aggie finds herself compulsively hunting for the truth—chasing his demons while fleeing her own—in a game of cat and mouse that might turn deadly.” As can be seen in the trailer, their characters also share a precarious sort of chemistry. “You had to believe that they were equally matched adversaries, best friends, and soul enemies. These deeply isolated characters finally discover a really perverse friend.” All eight episodes of The Beast In Me premiere November 13 on Netflix.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Back in August, former Pixies bassist Paz Lenchantin announced her return with a solo album, Triste. Soon after the news went live, listeners on Reddit and YouTube noted glaring similarities between the lead single, “Hang Tough,” and Chico Buarque and Milton Nascimento's Brazilian classic “Cálice.” It turns out the song's authors, Buarque and the Tropicalía legend Gilberto Gil, were listening, too. In August, the duo filed a notice accusing Lenchantin of plagiarizing “Calice,” as reported in the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S. Paulo. Lenchantin, who was born in Argentina, made no public comment, but the song has since been removed from streaming services and the album tracklist displays another song title. Reached by Pitchfork through a representative, Lenchantin declined to comment. Her label, Hideous Human, will release Triste tomorrow, October 17. © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hallmark Channel's 16th annual Countdown to Christmas kicks off on October 17, 2025, and we're feeling extra jolly about this year's onscreen pairings. With two jam-packed months of movies and series ahead, it was no picnic picking just a few couples we can't wait to see, given all the magical match-ups. So — in no particular order, cue the holiday meet-cutes and bring on those snow-capped romances! Fans have been wanting a reunion between Hallmark Channel heartthrob Tyler Hynes and “When Calls the Heart” queen Erin Krakow since the final moment of their first movie together — 2021's “It Was Always You.” In July, they announced their reunion with a hilarious teaser set to Peaches & Herb's “Reunited” and, understandably, fans went wild. But on the loooong flight, she finds herself haunted by her past, present, and future, AND unexpectedly reunited with her ex, played by Hynes. Will she rediscover Christmas magic and true love all in one flight? “Christmas Above the Clouds” premieres on November 8 at 8 p.m. Eastern time. We have been pumped for this pairing since Hallmark announced “Merry Christmas, Ted Cooper!” We hope Kimberley Sustad's brilliant brand of dry, offbeat humor gets to shine alongside the adorably quirky and smirky Robert Buckley. According to the logline, Buckley plays Ted Cooper, a TV weatherman who loves Christmas but has experienced three really bad Christmases in a row. Positively determined to make this Christmas very merry, he faces a bunch of injuries and obstacles on his way home for the holidays — including landing in Urgent Care with a doctor who was his former crush, played by Sustad. These two are not only funny but have huge hearts, so they know how to make a rom-com seriously sparkle. Keep in mind: Sustad is one of three screenwriters behind the “Three Wise Men” franchise, tasked with crafting all the touching moments that occur as hilarity ensues. “Merry Christmas, Ted Cooper!” premieres on October 25 at 8 p.m. Eastern time. Britt, who's quickly become a fan favorite as part of “The Groomsmen” trilogy with Tyler Hynes and Jonathan Bennett. Their unique combo of talents will certainly come in handy for “Tidings For the Season,” in which Britt plays Adam Kade, a serious local news anchor whose life “takes an unexpected turn in early December” when he meets 10-year-old Robbie, his biggest fan, and Robbie's single mom, Lucy, played by Mowry-Housley. To balance out the bad news by reporting good, uplifting stories, too. “Tidings of the Season” premieres on November 16 at 8 p.m. Eastern time. 2025 has been a big year for the longtime “When Calls The Heart” star, who not only married his real-life leading lady, co-star Erin Krakow (who made our Top 8, too), but he also landed his first leading role in a Hallmark movie with “The Christmas Cup.” Hearties can't wait to see another side of Rosenbaum as a rom-com leading man and we think he's been perfectly paired up with Rhiannon Fish, who seems to spark genuine, sizzling onscreen chemistry with every actor she works with. In “The Christmas Cup,” Fish plays Staff Sergeant Kelly Brandt, who returns home for the holidays in low spirits due to a potentially career-ending knee injury. Her family tries to boost her spirits by convincing her to lead a hometown team in the local Christmas Cup competition, and sparks fly when she receives help from Fire Captain Quinn Stokley, played by Rosenbaum. “She's Making a List” delivers an onscreen reunion of rom-com royalty — Hallmark Channel's queen of Christmas Lacey Chabert is paired up with one of Hallmark's meet-cute kings, Andrew Walker, for the first time since their 2018 flick, “My Secret Valentine.” It turned out that Hallmark was one step ahead, already working on finding the right script and timing for the two to come back together. According to the synopsis, Chabert plays Naughty or Nice inspector Isabel Haynes, who is “assigned to evaluate mischievous 11-year-old Charlie.” But things get complicated when she unexpectedly falls for Charlie's widowed father, Jason Duncan, played by Walker. “She's Making a List” premieres on December 6 at 8 p.m. Eastern time. In “A Christmas Angel Match,” longtime Hallmark stars Meghan Ory and Benjamin Ayres play two “rival” angels who have to work together on Earth to match up human couples during the holiday season. As they're butting heads, we get to see Ayres put his comedic chops to good use as the “fun and spontaneous” angel, which is how Ory's older, wiser angel describes him in one preview — and she does not see it as a compliment. Ayres and Ory are old pros at making onscreen magic, but he told EntertainmentNow that portraying angels was an intriguing and super sweet challenge, unlike anything they've done before. “A Christmas Angel Match” premieres on October 17 at 8 p.m. Eastern time. We really can't think of a better duo than Nikki DeLoach and Kristoffer Polaha to headline Hallmark's first-ever partnership with Nashville's iconic Grand Ole Opry to tell a gritty-but-charming story layered with grief, healing, time-travel, and the rich history of an iconic landmark. Both actors excel at stories like these, from DeLoach's deeply emotional “The Gift of Peace” to Polaha's time-travel hit “A Biltmore Christmas.” Oh, and did we mention they've been friends for more than two decades? “A Grand Ole Opry Christmas” will be an onscreen reunion for DeLoach and Polaha, who co-starred in the TV series “North Shore” in 2004 and 2005. The movie was a major undertaking, filmed in Nashville and Kansas City with a star-studded cast that includes Hallmark favorites Sharon Lawrence, James Denton, and Eliza Hayes Maher, as well as country superstar Brad Paisley and a dozen cameos from fellow country artists. DeLoach and Polaha will be the glue that holds it all together, which sounds like a grand plan to us. “A Grand Ole Opry Christmas” premieres on November 29 at 8 p.m. Eastern time. It's not lost on us that the final movie of Hallmark Channel's Countdown to Christmas extravaganza, premiering days before Christmas, is a celebration of mother(s) and child. “The Christmas Baby” brings together longtime Hallmark stars Ali Liebert and Kat Barrell as a busy couple who live and work together. Liebert and Barrell's excitement about the movie is absolutely contagious. They've both already shared heartwarming posts about working together and how proud they are of the movie, including Barrell writing on October 10, “If this doesn't make your heart sing with joy then I've got nothing left to help you.” Sounds like the perfect way to wrap up Countdown to Christmas!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I think everyone was pretty worried, honestly,” Wolfhard tells Time magazine in a new feature story about the season (along with a cover image that's definitely … interesting). “The way that Game of Thrones got torn to shreds in that final season, we're all walking into this going, ‘We hope to not have that kind of thing happen' … But then we read the scripts. Yet fans clearly embraced the super-sized scope when season four premiered three years ago. “We were nervous about season four,” co-creator Ross Duffer said. “It was such a relief when it got the viewership it did because you don't want to scale down for your final season … or an abbreviated final season … these were all possible realities.” The final season has been pegged at a reported $50 million to $60 million per episode. Co-creator Matt Duffer noted that he's been surprised that while the team is considering various ways to expand the franchise, Netflix hasn't exerted more pressure to come up with a direct sequel. “I'm kind of surprised there hasn't been more pressure [from Netflix],” he said. “They would love us to go in and pitch it, but they haven't forced us to do it.” Netflix chief Bela Bajaria added, “When they're ready, I'm ready.” (It also seems likely that such an idea would be kept under wraps until after the final episode airs to prevent spoilers.)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Life of a Showgirl's 12 tracks drew more than 1 billion streams worldwide in their first week of release. Pardon the understatement, but it's been a busy couple of weeks for Taylor Swift. On Oct. 3, she released The Life of a Showgirl, and its gargantuan impact has spread across the Oct. 18-dated Billboard charts. U.S. charts, becoming the first song to simultaneously debut atop both tallies and the U.S.-based Hot 100 since Swift's own “Fortnight,” featuring Post Malone, in May 2024. U.S. From 216.9 million streams for “Ophelia” down to 81.3 million for “Honey,” the album's 12 tracks combined for just under 1.4 billion official streams worldwide (1.386 billion) in the week ending Oct. 9, according to Luminate. That total is the second biggest one-week global streaming sum for an album since the charts launched in 2020. It follows – you guessed it – Swift's The Tortured Poets Department from last year, which garnered 1.76 billion clicks in its first week, while coming in ahead of 2022's Midnights, with 1.16 billion. Bad Bunny and Drake are the only other acts to clear the one billion mark, each of whom did it once. The Life of a Showgirl's first-week streaming numbers are eye-popping, but even more so considering the album's relatively brief track list. At 12 songs, it's the shortest collection among the top 15 biggest global album debuts, presenting an uphill battle against projects with 15, 20 and even 30-plus songs. On average, the 12 songs on The Life of a Showgirl drew 115.5 million streams worldwide in their first week. Swift's Midnights (20 tracks) averaged 57.8 million, The Tortured Poets Department (31) averaged 56.8 million, and albums by BTS, Drake, Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar and Olivia Rodrigo exceeded 50 million per song. Of Swift's enormous global total, 674.4 million streams (49%) are from the United States and 711.7 million (51%) are from beyond (with the Global 200 reflecting activity in more than 200 territories). It's more international than almost all such hip-hop and country sets, but more U.S.-centric than Latin and K-pop records. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show is known for its fun and energetic performances. Rather than walk down the runway with a serious expression, like many other fashion shows, models are often playful, smiling, and even dancing while they show off their lingerie. A post shared by Victoria's Secret (@victoriassecret) The musicians set to perform at the 2025 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show on Wednesday, October 15, are K-pop group TWICE, Missy Elliott, Karol G, and Madison Beer. Livestream the show on October 15 at 7PM ET on Prime Video and Amazon Live or our YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram.” Fans have shared their excitement, writing, “Twice will show them how REAL performance is done with LIVE VOCALS,” and “SLAYYY QUEENSSS.” A photo of Karol G posted on Instagram was also shared to generate excitement about her inclusion in the show. A post shared by Victoria's Secret (@victoriassecret) “First Bad Bunny at the superbowl n now Karol g in VS,” a fan wrote. “Here we are proud of KAROL G,” another comment reads. “Excellent decision is a great working entrepreneurial woman, disciplined, and above all, what she does she does with love and passion,” a third person shared. Madison Beer's inclusion in the event has also been met with great excitement. “Madison Beer is taking the stage—and trust us, you're going to want to turn it up,” the caption of her announcement on Instagram reads. “So proud of her i'm crying,” a fan wrote. And last, but certainly not least, we have the music legend Missy Elliott! Elliott's announcement was shared on the official Victoria's Secret Instagram account. “Missy Elliott performing at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show? To say fans are happy would be an understatement. Reactions include, “I'm watching this fashion show now for the first time in YEARS!!!! ET, with the pink carpet event happening 30 minutes earlier at 6:30 p.m. Social media will be flooded with clips from the event, but it will also be broadcast live from Brooklyn's Steiner Studios in New York.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the first things you'll see upon entering the ornate terminal at Washington, D.C.'s Union Station are gaggles of National Guard troops loitering about, clad in full tactical camo. Wander around the city and you'll encounter similar gaggles posted up at almost every major point of interest, as well other federal forces whose agents have for months now been brutalizing anti-ICE protesters around the nation. They're there because Donald Trump has prioritized a physical and legal crackdown against his political opposition, one that has primarily targeted Democratic cities and lawmakers. The administration has recently directed its attention toward protesters, free speech, and liberal nonprofit groups, in particular, with the president signing an order labeling anti-fascists a domestic terror group, and a memo targeting “anti-Christianity,” “anti-capitalism,” and “anti-Americanism,” as the administration sees them. Over 2,500 events have been planned across the United States and abroad, with some of the largest expected to take place in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and, of course, Washington, D.C. The Republican ecosystem has been working hard to demonize the protest movement ahead of this weekend's demonstrations, adopting Trump's framing of his opposition as anti-American terrorism. No Kings is a coalition of grassroots demonstrations bolstered by liberal and left-leaning advocacy groups. At the time, organizers told Rolling Stone that in order to defeat a tyrant “you need to have a visible demonstration that Americans are against authoritarian overreach.” But they are not blind to the reality that the events will be taking place amid Trump's sweeping crackdown against anti-ICE protesters in major Democratic cities, and that Republicans are openly attempting to brand opposition to the president as terrorism. MAGA's Unhinged Reaction to Bad Bunny at the Super Bowl: What's Happened So Far “This is about one thing and one thing only: to score political points with the terrorist wing of their party, which is set to hold […] a hate America rally in D.C. next week,” Emmer said Friday of the upcoming protests. “[We] want to be out there carefully, peacefully speaking our minds,” Lisa Gilbert, co-president of Public Citizen — one of the organizations participating in the No Kings coalition — tells Rolling Stone. “The one thing we cannot be in this moment is cowed by what [Trump] is threatening, and we won't be bullied into fear and silence in this moment.” The Trump administration's escalation of its campaign against Democratic and progressive nonprofits followed the assassination of right-wing activist and organizer Charlie Kirk — even though senior law enforcement officials don't believe Kirk's killer was working with any organization on the left, with one senior administration official recently telling Rolling Stone the prospect was “never on anyone's radar.” “I think it's very clear that they're lashing out because they fear this kind of peaceful, organized people power, and that's true of authoritarian regimes all over the world,” says Ezra Levin, co-founder of Indivisible — a progressive activist group focused on peaceful resistance to the Trump regime. Administration officials have told Rolling Stone that they intend to make Trump's enemies, including progressive groups, “suffer,” while another source said that White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller declared the administration to be “at war” with left-leaning groups. Levin dismissed Republican attempts to rebrand Saturday's events as “hate America” rallies. “[It's] encouraging that they're taking note and worried about what a peaceful display of the people's power is going to do to their own image […] and then part of it is serious. They are coming after our First Amendment rights, and that's the whole point of doing this protest.” Trump even flat-out bragged that “we took the free speech away” earlier this month while signing an executive order aimed at punishing anyone who burns the American flag. Earlier this month, he complained that Republicans had “to take care of this little gnat that's on our shoulder called the Democrats” during a speech at the Norfolk Naval base. Days before, he told senior military leaders gathered at Quantico that “America is under invasion from within. No different than a foreign enemy, but more difficult in any ways because they don't wear uniforms. At least when they're wearing a uniform you can take them out.” On the insinuation that the protests are being stocked with paid attendees or receiving funding from extremist boogeymen, something Trump and Republicans in Congress like Ted Cruz says needs to be investigated, Gilbert laughs. It is not funded centrally in any way,” she says.

On Saturday — in communities big and small — millions of Americans will do exactly that.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Susan Lang believes the heartbreaking track is about her son Jeffrey. “They were really good friends,” Susan said of her son and Swift. They hung out at her house a lot. The track is sweet and wistful until it takes a somber turn in the third verse, which finds Swift singing, “When I left school, I lost track of you/ Abigail called me with the bad news/ Goodbye/ And we'll never know why.” “It was not an invitation/ But I flew home anyway/ With so much left to say,” Swift continues in the final chorus. “It was not convenient, no/ But I whispered at the grave/ ‘Should've kissed you anyway. In the interview, Susan marveled at how bittersweet it is that “after all this time, [Taylor] hasn't forgotten about him.” The LP sold more than four million copies in its first seven days, setting a new record for the biggest debut for an album ever in the modern era, beating out previous record-holder 25 by Adele. Swift has not commented on who inspired “Ruin the Friendship,” but fans were quick to trace the lyrics back to Jeff.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He was a real-life boogeyman who spent years preying on underage girls while being shielded from prosecution by his immense wealth and powerful connections. It's not just that things like a creepy birthday letter the president allegedly wrote to him have become a matter of public record (though Trump denies authoring the document); there's also the administration's embarrassing, ongoing failure to disclose more material related to federal investigations of Epstein after many assurances to the MAGA base that they would release these supposed bombshell files. And so “Jeffrey Epstein” is a name that still commands headlines. One database search returned information on nearly 300 Jeffrey Epsteins around the U.S. Rolling Stone reached out to dozens of them in hopes of learning how the Epstein story has affected their day-to-day lives over the past few years. Perhaps understandably, only three replied to share their experiences. Jeff L. Epstein, 53, resides in an area of New Jersey outside Philadelphia and works full-time as a singer covering Frank Sinatra, the Beatles, Elvis Presley, and many others, in senior living centers, where he says residents are thankfully not too plugged into news developments involving the other Jeffrey Epstein. (He also says that only his older relatives call him Jeffrey.) When the topic does come up, he's taken to feigning confusion, acting as if he doesn't follow the news himself. “Every now and then some resident, like 80 years old, might say, ‘Will you ever release the tapes? “And I'm like, ‘Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about — what are you referring to?” This strategy, he says, tends to shut down the conversation quickly and effectively. With the latter's arrest and suicide in 2019, he recalls, things turned “nightmarish,” particularly online. Elsewhere on social media, people have demanded to know why his username is “Jeff Epstein,” assuming it's an intentional provocation. In some instances, he has tried to roll with the unfortunate coincidence, like when he occasionally made appearances on the YouTube show of comedian Graham Elwood, who would introduce him by saying, “No, not that one!” Epstein acknowledges that the bit “was pretty funny.” More recently, though, Epstein says, he is trying to reclaim his name. '” He told the open mic host to introduce him by his full name going forward.

Asked whether the name has caused him much grief, another Jeff Epstein, a 45-year-old warehouse manager in New Jersey, says, “You have no idea!” His friends, at least, appear take a certain pleasure in the unfortunate coincidence. Epstein shares an email thread between him and a few pals about being approached for this interview — one person advises that he tell Rolling Stone “that you haven't been laid in six years because of this, and make sure they put your picture and address in the article.” I can't make this shit up.” He admits that the remarks are pretty much inescapable. Epstein knows how to take these interactions in stride, however. Then there's Jeff Epstein, 57, who runs a flooring company in Tuscon, Arizona — and says that his name has thankfully never put a dent in his business. “My customers get a kick out of it,” he says. “When they don't know my full name, and I call them, because of my iPhone, it says Jeffrey Epstein is calling. And so I've had customers block my phone immediately, then I have my office call and tell them, ‘No, no, that's Jeff. “Sometimes I don't get anything for months at a time, and then some weeks, I'll have three or four people mention it,” with some asking if it's his real name. It's funny, if the news is on when I walk in, I'll hear my name three or four times in two minutes. Why This Nineties High School Punk Band Is Suddenly Bigger Than Ever Britney Spears Fires Back at Kevin Federline's Memoir Accusations: ‘I Have Had Enough' What ‘Monster: The Ed Gein Story' Gets Right and Wrong “I'm non-political, so that also helps,” Epstein says of his random connection to reviled criminal frequently invoked in partisan attacks. Even so, he has a clear personal interest in seeing the Epstein case come to some kind of resolution. “Would definitely love to have no one talking about my name anymore,” he continues. Although they've each found ways to deal with the headache, these Jeffrey Epsteins agree that it's a tired subject. At this point, they've all heard the same lines thousands of times. “It's run its course, but just won't go away,” Epstein says. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Disney+'s Percy Jackson And The Olympians show has not been shy about plucking actors from the “comedy gods” pantheon to fill out its own celestial order, and the show has just revealed a big one: Per reporting from Variety, the streaming series has just tapped former Saturday Night Live star Kate McKinnon to play its version of Greek love goddess Aphrodite. As the deity (whose previous credits include turning statues into women, turning women she was mad at into much stinkier women so that their husbands would cheat on them, and the whole Trojan War thing), McKinnon will subject Walker Scobell's Percy to tests related to love before offering him her aid. (Presumably by making some of his own enemies extra-stinky, so that their significant others will cheat on them.) (Don't blame us, Apollonius of Rhodes wrote it.) She joins a cast that includes, amongst its adult gods, Jason Mantzoukas, Timothy Omundsun, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Jay Duplass, Toby Stephens, and Courtney B. Vance, the latter taking over the role of Zeus from the late Lance Reddick. The Percy Jackson series is currently gearing up for the release of its second season, which is scheduled to debut on Disney+ on December 10, 2025.
