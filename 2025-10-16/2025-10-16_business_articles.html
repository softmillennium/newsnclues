By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Internal documents obtained by Business Insider reveal that AWS has flagged a "fundamental" shift in how startups are allocating their cloud budgets. Instead of pouring money into traditional cloud services like compute and storage, these companies are spreading costs across newer AI technologies that are easier to switch between, according to the documents. "Founders tell us they seek to adopt AWS at a later stage," one of the documents warned. This suggests a seismic shift is happening in the cloud industry. AWS's dominance was built on startups that embraced its affordable, scalable computing services as an alternative to running their own data centers. As startups use these new AI offerings first, and wait longer to spend on AWS, the cloud giant's once-firm grip on this lucrative ecosystem could begin to loosen. To be sure, startups are not abandoning AWS entirely, as they still need its cloud services at later stages. However, their behavior highlights how emerging AI technologies are capturing early IT budgets in new ways and potentially locking in customers before AWS's traditional offerings come into play. The internal documents cited in this story, marked "Amazon Confidential," are from March and July. They were written by employees on AWS' startup business team, including a person who works closely with Y Combinator startups. The documents were also reviewed by AWS executives who manage startup and venture capital relationships. In addition, at least three current and former employees familiar with AWS's startup business told Business Insider that the concerns expressed in these internal documents were still valid as of September. Before publication, an AWS spokesperson said this story was using "old data to reach outdated conclusions." Startups continue to build on AWS, including leading AI startups such as Perplexity and Luma AI, which "recently chose" AWS, the spokesperson added. "Early stage startups experiment with many services and technologies, but when it comes time to choose the provider they trust with the future of their organizations, they overwhelmingly choose AWS." "In fact, we're seeing growth in adoption of AWS as startups are looking to our depth and breadth of services," the spokesperson added. Many AI startups now make their first technology purchases from AI model providers such as OpenAI and Anthropic, followed by newer developer platforms such as Vercel, according to one of the AWS documents. That means founders are putting off decisions to buy AWS services until later, often when they require advanced capabilities such as compliance and security, the document explained. Among Y Combinator's 2024 cohort, 59% reported using more than three AWS services, down by more than four percentage points from 2022, according to the document from March. Only 4.3% said they were using AWS's Bedrock developer tool, which gives access to various AI models. Earlier this year, AWS compiled a list of the top 1,000 AI startups for Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, along with an assessment of whether they were building primarily on the tech giant's cloud platform, according to the July document. With cloud spending rapidly growing beyond "traditional compute," storage, databases, and analytics, "this question is getting much harder to answer," AWS employees wrote in the July document. The AWS employees cited three newer AI cloud services that were grabbing early spending from these startups: GPU training and fine tuning, GPU inference, and AI-as-a-service, according to the document. That's a contrast to traditional cloud services, which run on CPUs. The "majority" of Cursor's spending goes toward API calls to external AI models and "neocloud" providers that primarily sell access to GPU servers, the document noted. It didn't mention specific neoclouds, but some of these newer AI cloud vendors include CoreWeave, Crusoe, Lambda Labs, and Nebius. Business Insider followed up on Thursday to ask for more specifics, but didn't get a response. To be sure, these documents are from March and July, and AWS may have turned things around with AI startups in recent months. However, revenue growth from this key part of Amazon has lagged behind some other cloud providers lately, on a percentage basis. Neocloud revenue has soared by more than 200% in the past year, albeit from a much lower base, according to Synergy Research Group. "With Azure and Google Cloud Platform growing faster than AWS, the once-strong incumbent's market position may lead to three equal players," Theory Ventures' Tomasz Tunguz wrote in a recent blog post. Investors also say that AI isn't necessarily cannibalizing AWS's cloud revenue. Some of the money startups are channeling into new AI services likely flows back to major cloud providers that supply GPUs and other AI cloud infrastructure. Still, AWS risks losing ground if it can't capture those early customers as spending shifts, they said. "AWS is still a step behind Microsoft and Google in driving GPU demand and the ability to sell add-ons to these customers," Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. CB Insights data shows AWS losing some ground among the 1,100 leading AI startups. Between January 2024 and September 2025, AWS captured 30% of that market, trailing Google Cloud's 38%, but outpacing Microsoft Azure's 7%. That marks a decline from the prior two-year period (2022 to 2024), when AWS claimed 33%, Google Cloud 34%, and Microsoft 9%. Roughly 25% of the startups said they used more than two cloud providers. AWS' AI pricing strategy isn't helping it win startup customers either. Earlier this year, AWS found that 90% of early-stage startups in Radical Ventures' portfolio were building primarily on rival clouds, citing AWS's higher GPU costs compared with competitors, according to one of the documents from March. Following that discovery, Jassy and AWS CEO Matt Garman met with Radical Ventures' leadership to craft a new strategy aimed at better targeting the firm's startup investments and offering a more complete suite of AWS services, according to this document. One of the documents noted growing demand among customers for access to "small increments of GPU capacity" with pay-as-you-go flexibility, an area where AWS is at a "disadvantage" compared with neoclouds. Gavin Baker of Atreides Management recently wrote on X that AWS had raised prices for Nvidia's Blackwell chips. In response, Chamath Palihapitiya of Social Capital wrote that Amazon had become "too expensive," adding that his portfolio company, 8090, had switched to using chips from Groq, another one of his investments. AWS expected this trend to accelerate as AI moves deeper into specialized applications and intelligent agents, the document noted. The AWS spokesperson said the company is seeing growth across "all AI startups," from foundational models to vertical and horizontal solutions leveraging AI. Another challenge for AWS is its lagging reputation in AI, which is making it increasingly difficult to secure speaking slots for executives at venture-capital events and other industry conferences, according to one of the documents. "2.5 years post the launch of ChatGPT, AWS is still viewed as playing catch up in AI by many public/private investors, founders, and industry influencers," the document warned. The AWS spokesperson told Business Insider this is "false," without providing further details. During Amazon's July earnings call, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak questioned Jassy about perceptions that AWS is falling behind in AI and losing market share to competitors. Jassy's answer did little to reassure investors, and Amazon's stock slipped further during the call. AWS is also struggling to identify and engage early-stage startups that later evolve into major cloud customers. One of the internal documents noted that AWS's VC-driven discovery model isn't well-suited to the rise of "AI-native solopreneurs and bootstrapped teams." "This blind spot poses increasing risk to cloud market share," it stated. Several Amazon employees told Business Insider that AWS's startup leadership team lacks deep experience in the venture ecosystem, which may be compounding the problem.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A woman who says she was abused by the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein sued Bank of America and the Bank of New York Mellon Wednesday, alleging the banks knowingly provided financial services that enabled his sex trafficking operation for years. "We don't think the suit has any merit, and we're going to contest it vigorously," BNY CEO Robin Vince said Thursday, in a CNBC interview on "Squawk on the Street." Bank of America declined to comment. The woman, referred to in court papers as Jane Doe, is seeking an unspecified amount of damages from both banks. She is represented by law firms Boies Schiller and Edwards Henderson, who previously secured settlements of $75 million and $290 million with Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan, respectively, over their alleged financial ties to Epstein. Neither Deutsche nor JPMorgan admitted wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. The circumstances of his death, as well as his social relationships with wealthy and powerful individuals, fueled theories that others were involved in his crimes. His case has become a political headache for President Donald Trump's administration. After pledging during the 2024 campaign to release files from the Justice Department's investigation into Epstein, the administration reversed course this year, prompting an outcry from Trump's conservative base and members of Congress. She said she became financially dependent on Epstein, who raped her, forcibly touched her, and forced her to engage in sex acts with other women at least 100 times between 2011 and 2019. "As Congress works toward unraveling how Jeffrey Epstein was able to orchestrate his criminal sex trafficking enterprise for decades without detection, we are taking another important step forward toward justice for survivors," Sigrid McCawley, a lawyer for Jane Doe, said in a statement. Jane Doe said she opened a Bank of America account in 2013 at the direction of Richard Kahn, Epstein's former accountant, and that Kahn regularly sent her money for rent through the account. Doe said in 2015, Kahn's assistant told her that Epstein was adding her to the payroll for a "sham company" and that she would receive funds through her Bank of America account. Her lawyers wrote that those transactions should have raised red flags for Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank. Epstein had pleaded guilty to state-level prostitution charges in Florida in 2008 as part of an arrangement that allowed him to avoid federal prosecution. The lawsuit against BNY said the bank gave a line of credit to MC2, a modeling agency that the lawsuit said Epstein and French model scout Jean-Luc Brunel used to traffic victims. In total, BNY processed $378 million in payments to women trafficked by Epstein, the lawsuit said. Both lawsuits said the banks should have filed Suspicious Activity Reports with the U.S. Treasury Department. The lawsuits said such reports could have helped law enforcement stop Epstein sooner.

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Is Google's latest AI image-editing tool an Adobe-killer? When Google launched its Gemini 2.5 Flash model — better known by its more fun codename Nano Banana — in August, it became a viral hit. Because of its ability to edit images using AI for free (or at a low cost if you're using it through the API), we wondered if it might spell bad news for Adobe, which sells competing image software. Data provided to Business Insider by Appfigures, an analytics company, reveals that as downloads of Gemini skyrocketed around the time of Nano Banana's release, downloads of Firefly, Adobe's generative AI image and video app, began to slump. After launching in June, Firefly was experiencing "impressive" growth, with downloads in August up 150% over the previous month, Randy Nelson, Appfigures' head of insights, told Business Insider. Adobe could not immediately be reached for comment. After Google rolled out Nano Banana to the Gemini app on August 26, Firefly downloads dropped by more than half over the following week, while Google's app skyrocketed. As of October 6, Gemini downloads were up 331% compared to the last week of July, while Firefly was down 68% — its lowest since the arrival of Nano Banana — per the Appfigures data. To further put that into perspective, Google's Gemini app had 6.1 million more downloads last week than the week it integrated the new image model, according to the data, while Firefly saw 2 million fewer downloads. Further analysis from Appfigures of different territories shows that Gemini had an 88% jump in downloads in the US from the last month of September to the last month of October. Adobe's Firefly app lets people use a variety of models, and in September it added Google's Nano Banana to the list. At the time of Nano Banana's launch, Adobe told Business Insider that its advantage lies in having a variety of different models in one place so that users don't have to move between different platforms. Regardless, users appear to still be flocking to Gemini, and Adobe's stock price — down nearly 35% in the past year — reflects the challenges its business faces from Google, OpenAI, and a host of other AI competitors knocking on the door.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Tuesday, Microsoft stopped supporting Windows 10, the operating system it introduced 10 years earlier. The software company is enticing people to upgrade their PCs with a slate of artificial intelligence features it will test in Windows 11, the successor to Windows 10. Those who participate in both the Windows Insider Program and the Copilot Labs group for trying AI experiments will gain access to an updated Copilot assistant app in Windows 11 that can use desktop and web applications to complete certain tasks, such as resizing photos, with locally stored files. Anthropic, Google and OpenAI have all developed AI models known as computer-use agents that accept people's directives to perform actions in multiple steps that involve typing and clicking. Microsoft has brought this technology to corporate workers who build AI agents, and consumers with premium subscriptions can try a computer-use agent called Copilot Actions. Now the software company is planning a variant for Windows 11. If enabled, it will operate in a contained environment with its own desktop, Microsoft said. People can watch the software working step by step and take over at any point, although they're free to navigate away and do other things on their PCs as the work happens in the background. "You may see the agent make mistakes or encounter challenges with complex interfaces, which is why real-world testing of this experience is so critical to help us apply learnings to make this experience more capable and streamlined," Mehdi wrote in a blog post. It's the sort of thing that might help Microsoft get the attention of people who today own Apple's Mac computers or Chromebooks that run Google's Chrome OS. In July, the new operating system became more popular than Windows 10 for the first time, according to data from web analytics software maker Statcounter. Microsoft controlled 72% of operating system market share in September, the data showed. Microsoft wants to proceed carefully as it rolls out Copilot Actions. Those enrolled in the Windows Insider Program will be first to test an action in the Windows 11 File Explorer that draws on technology from Singaporean startup Manus. People can right-click on a file and click the "Create website with Manus" option. Until now, people could only engage with this Copilot Vision feature by talking aloud. The new widget will include buttons that activate Copilot Vision or spoken AI conversations with one click. Alternatively, people can summon the assistant by saying, "Hey Copilot."

As the U.S.-China rare earth dispute reignites fears of a trade war, tariffs are back in the spotlight for both investors and policymakers. Stocks have oscillated in recent days as traders make bets on whether President Donald Trump will back off his threats — following the "TACO" playbook, as some have called it. A federal judge yesterday blocked Trump from firing federal workers during the government shutdown — at least for now. San Francisco U.S. District Court Judge Susan Yvonne Illston's temporary restraining order blocks the White House from taking any action to follow through with the layoffs and from firing other federal employees protected by the unions that filed the lawsuit. The ruling comes days after the Trump administration began sending out reduction-in-force notifications to more than 4,000 federal employees. Russell Vought, the White House's budget director, said yesterday that he expects more than 10,000 total cuts. There's still no end in sight for the shutdown, which is now on its 16th day. The Senate yesterday rejected stopgap funding bills for a ninth time. United Airlines beat Wall Street's earnings expectations yesterday, but the carrier's stock slid in extended trading as investors focused on its weaker-than-expected revenue. United, which had a bumpy ride to start the year, forecast higher-than-expected earnings for the current quarter. We're also keeping an eye on Hewlett Packard Enterprise, whose shares tumbled more than 9% in today's premarket after the company gave a weak outlook for its 2026 fiscal year. On the software front, artificial intelligence startup Anthropic launched a smaller and cheaper AI model for all users, named Claude Haiku 4.5. Its competitor OpenAI, meanwhile, is facing criticism for its decision to allow content such as erotica on ChatGPT. CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning. While Tesla is the clear leader in the U.S. EV market, the company has given up market share amid rising competition and sliding brand value, CNBC's Lora Kolodny reports. The broader EV industry is also no longer benefitting from now-expired $7,500 tax credits that helped rev up consumer interest. With its quarterly earnings report due in next week, Wall Street is eager to see if Tesla — or its famously opinionated CEO Elon Musk — will report similar challenges as its competitors. With what feels like a new billion-dollar tech deal every day, it's hard to keep track of who's paying who for what. Here's the $1 trillion web of artificial intelligence deals, visualized. — CNBC's Jeff Cox, Dan Mangan, Liz Napolitano Leslie Josephs, Kif Leswing, Ashley Capoot, Lora Kolodny, Jonathan Vanian, Magdalena Petrova, Jordan Novet, Kevin Breuninger and Lillian Rizzo contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SHANGHAI — Chinese tech giant Alibaba is already recouping its investment on artificial intelligence in the company's e-commerce business, vice president Kaifu Zhang told reporters on Thursday. The Chinese tech giant has bet big that AI will generate returns despite market concerns that companies are spending too much on the technology with little to show for it. Alibaba last month announced it will increase its spending on AI and cloud infrastructure, after pledging in February it would spend 380 billion yuan ($53 billion) over the next three years on the tech. Zhang oversees e-commerce AI applications at Alibaba. Earlier in the day, he shared how the company has rolled out a range of AI tools, from making search results more personalized to improving the accuracy of virtual clothing try-ons. The presentation comes a day after Alibaba began presales for Singles Day, China's biggest shopping event of the year that's akin to Black Friday. Zhang said preliminary testing has showed consistent results from AI, including a 12% increase in returns on advertising spend. "It's very rare to see double-digit changes" in such tests, he said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. Zhang predicted that thanks to AI integration, there would be a "very significant" positive impact on Alibaba's gross merchandise volume during this year's Singles Day shopping period, which centers on Nov. 11. Despite lackluster Chinese consumer spending in the last few years, during the Singles Day period last year, research firm Syntun estimated 20.1% year-on-year growth in sales to 1.11 trillion yuan for Alibaba's Tmall, JD.com and PDD. The company on a late August earnings call cast AI and consumption as "two major historic opportunities" that require Alibaba to make investments of "historic scale." "Our first priority at this point is making these investments," CFO Toby Xu said at the time. "So for now, we may place relatively less emphasis on profit margins.

New York's Wall Street elites are signing massive checks to support Andrew Cuomo's mayoral race, while some of the rank-and-file are donating to Zohran Mamdani in hopes that someday their much smaller paychecks can land them an apartment without roommates. Business Insider's analysis of donation data and conversations with donors on Wall Street shed light on this divide ahead of Thursday night's first general election debate. Almost 80% of higher-earning, front-office workers, like investment bankers or hedge fund managers, donated to Cuomo and affiliated groups. The Mamdani camp won out among nearly every other job function, receiving direct donations from almost 90% of back-office donors like those in operations, human resources, tech, and research. Sixteen of its employees donated to both candidates for a total just over $10,000. The other fifteen, mostly software engineers, gave an average of just over $350 each to Mamdani. When America thinks of Wall Street, it pictures investment bankers decked out in collared shirts and Patagonia vests. Many workers in the financial industry aren't cutting big deals — they're making under $200K. Even for those making six figures in finance, rents are high. Wall Streeters showed up for Mamdani in slightly greater numbers, but with smaller checks. When factoring in PAC spending, the pro-Cuomo and anti-Mamdani dollar disparity is even larger: 95% of the more than $9 million the industry donated went to support Cuomo, who has his own affordability plan but has also stressed crime and subway safety during his campaign. Mamdani got less than 5% the donations that came from managers and investment professionals, compared to two thirds of donations given by all other roles. The wealth gap between front and back office is relative. The assistant's salary would go far in other cities, but in New York, back-office support workers told Business Insider tha their relative positions mean they relate more to Mamdani's middle-class base than to their bosses. They told us that's not about political parties — he is the Democratic nominee, and Cuomo, a Democrat, is running as an independent — it's all about cost of living. "The emphasis on affordability was especially appealing to me," said one donor, a lifelong New Yorker who once worked in a non-investment role on Wall Street and canvassed for Mamdani. "Even as someone working in finance, rent is crazy," said this donor, adding that she's seen coworkers and neighbors increasingly priced out and pushed to the suburbs. He proposes paying for this by increasing taxes on residents who make more than $1 million a year and raising the corporate tax rate statewide by 4.25% — which would require state approval. Wall Street bosses have warned that electing him would drive companies to leave the world's financial capital. Working on Wall Street doesn't change that at all." This includes hedge funds, like Citadel, whose CEO Ken Griffin wrote a $50,000 check to an anti-Mamdani PAC, or Third Point, whose CEO Dan Loeb donated more than $350,000 to Cuomo and related PACs. Loeb tweeted after Mamdani's primary win that it's "officially hot commie summer." Cuomo, "is an experienced leader that cares deeply about our city who has the relevant experience and skills necessary to lead and greatly improve NYC," he added. We also looked at investment banks, including JPMorgan Chase, whose chief Jamie Dimon said that Mamdani was a "Marxist" at an event earlier this summer, before saying on Tuesday he would help Mamdani if he were elected, and payments firms like the large credit card companies. It also includes real estate investors, like Stephen Ross, chairman of Hudson Yards developer Related Companies, who gave $50,000 to a pro-Cuomo PAC. Real estate brokers and services firms were excluded from the analysis. Looking at firms' donations themselves rather than their employees, 23 financial companies contributed more than $2 million to pro-Cuomo and anti-Mamdani PACs, and none to Mamdani. Paul Ryan, a 60-year-old retired investment banker and hedge fund executive who made waves as part of a small but vocal cohort of bankers who backed Bernie Sanders in 2016, described the divide in colorful terms. But younger people do; they have 40 more years of living, and are you going to live it in a Trump-dominated world?" The donors we spoke to said they don't talk politics at work very much and are left to pick up on hints of their coworkers' affiliations. They're far from alone in the city, though: A Quinnipiac University poll conducted from October 3 to 7 of 1,015 likely New York City voters found that Mamdani held a 46-33% lead over Cuomo. "I think it's always been kind of a fiction that where someone works is a key factor in how they vote, or what party they support, or what political candidates they support," Morris Pearl, a former managing director of BlackRock and the chair of the Patriotic Millionaires, a group of wealthy individuals who advocate for changes to the US tax system, said. Pearl sees folks falling into two categories: Those who may not want to pay more in taxes, and those who are "more aware that living in a city filled with people who can't afford their basic needs is not going to be good for even the rich people either." She added that many younger workers want their leaders to be more transparent and address the issues they care about, rather than protect the status quo.</p>

This as-told-to essay is part of Lonely at the Top, a series that examines the link between wealth and loneliness. It is based on a conversation with Jeremy Barker, founder and CEO of Murphy Door, which specializes in selling hidden doors and storage solutions. It has been edited for length and clarity. I would have been thrilled with my career, but the shockingly low pay wasn't what my dreams were built on — I couldn't even afford college. I knew something had to change, so I left the firehouse and set out on my own as an entrepreneur. The road to get here has been full of ups and downs. In my 20s, I made great money running a company that sold garages and sheds. Since I had too little financial education and too much interest in partying, the money I made didn't last long. I had to live out of my car for a year after the sale. Over the next decade, I tried to find a lucrative and fulfilling career. That was successful until the 2008 financial crisis. We had a sense of respect, appreciation, and guardianship for each other. On our days off, we would go hunting, camping, or hiking. We even celebrated holidays as a family. As the company grew, it needed more of my time. I started missing outings with colleagues on my days off so that I could work on the business. Before long, I started to feel like an outsider in the firehouse. I wasn't taking a wage from Murphy Door — I was still living on my $15.75 hourly wage as a firefighter. But by 2015, the company had broken $1 million in annual sales. My colleagues at the firehouse started teasing me more and more about how hard I was working. I wasn't spending as much time with them because I had different priorities — they wanted to hang out on days off, while I was always working on the business. I've never found a way to break through that. In 2016, my fire chief asked to speak with me. He pointed out that while firefighting was taking up most of my time, since I needed to be physically present on shift, it seemed my mind was always on Murphy Door and my family. When I went home that day, only my dog greeted me — my wife and daughter didn't even look up. Unfortunately, resigning didn't necessarily lead to more regular time with my family, since I just worked more on Murphy Door. These days, it's my kids' busy schedules with sports and activities that make it tricky to spend time together. Still, I can take my private plane home from a meeting in time to get to one of their sports games. When we go on vacations together, I unplug with intent, so I can spend quality time with my kids and wife. I also have a group of old friends, about three guys who are my ride or dies. We meet for coffee in a rundown diner, and we don't talk about money or business. We ask about kids and share old stories. It's what I miss about the firehouse. My wealth has had a huge impact — and not always a good one — on my relationships. I hate that I have to question whether people genuinely care about me or if it's all surface-level. I love helping others, but I don't want to always be the first person they call when they need money, especially if they haven't tried to help themselves first. I just wish I could teach that guy — who is smart and physically capable — to work hard. I take a lot of ribbing; they'll call me Mr. Millionaire, or ask for business or life advice. That's OK, but sometimes I need a mentor, too. Overall, I wish I had more reciprocal relationships in my life: people who would listen to me vent or debrief with me about a tough call as a firefighter.</p>

Even a veteran Silicon Valley investor can't make the numbers behind venture capital add up. Sequoia Capital partner and former PayPal exec, Roelof Botha, appeared on two podcasts over the past week to share a contrarian take on the VC industry — one shaped by more than two decades of investing. There's too much money," Botha said on a recent episode of the "All-In" podcast. Botha said that venture capital firms invest over $150 billion in companies each year. Yet, even under what he called "reasonable assumptions for return," the math still doesn't seem right to him. He reiterated his point this week on the "Uncapped with Jack Altman" podcast. "I don't think venture is an asset class," he said. He said that, over the last 20 to 30 years, there have only been an average of 20 companies a year that have ended up making exits of $1 billion or more. Investors — and startup founders — may be too often pursuing quantity over quality, he said. "I think we're spreading a lot of that talent thin right now." Venture capital has had a mostly rough year so far, driven by uncertainty in the economy and markets. Exciting IPOs are few and far between compared to the salad days of 2021. Sequoia Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.</p>

Welcome to the Jefferson-Washington-Lincoln Elementary School in Anytown, USA. Our hypothetical public school is like thousands of others throughout the US: full of teachers passionate about their jobs and kids from different backgrounds with diverse academic needs. Take Isabel, for whom English is a second language. She relies on the bilingual instruction in her classroom. Or Jack, who needs a little extra help understanding math and reading, and the one-on-one instruction he gets is helping him keep up. Or Sarah, whose parents work late and trust the after-school program to provide her a safe place to stay until they're off the job. And all three of them are taught by Ms. Smith, who relies on a federal student-loan forgiveness program for teachers and nonprofit workers like herself. Whether these theoretical people — and millions of real children and teachers across America — continue to benefit from those programs in the future is up in the air. During his campaign, President Donald Trump promised to eliminate the Education Department. All year, the Trump administration has been gutting the department; in February, the administration cut millions of dollars in research contracts, putting at risk crucial data collection that teachers and education leaders say helps them better understand how students are performing in core subjects. It would mean fewer resources for low-income students and those with disabilities, a lack of data collection on student outcomes, and risks to federal grants that millions of students rely on to go to college. "If students with disabilities and low-income students do not get the services and support they need and do not get access to educational opportunity, that undermines the health of our economy and our national security," says John King Jr., who was the education secretary for former President Barack Obama and is the chancellor of the State University of New York. Meanwhile, teachers, students, parents, and administrators are stuck waiting for the next shoe to drop. But with federal funding now on the line, he and his colleagues are constantly wondering which program, or job, will be next on the chopping block. It's a dilemma that Heather Stambaugh, a high school social studies teacher in rural Ohio, is all too familiar with: she tells me her district relies on federal funds to support programs for low-income families, and she's worried that if Trump continues his plans to dismantle the Education Department, the checks will stop coming. Trump has suggested outsourcing the department's responsibilities to other federal agencies, but some experts say that other agencies — already tasked with many of their own responsibilities — are not equipped to manage the Education Department's vast funding and student aid network. One of them, Title I, has provided grants for low-income school districts since 1965. Linda McMahon, Trump's education secretary, said that Title I funding would be immune from any department cuts, but there has already been budget chaos. In June, the department withheld nearly $7 billion in federal funding for schools due to claims that some programs did not align with the administration's political agenda, including migrant education that was supported by $375 million in Title I funds. The funds were released a month later, but it doesn't mean schools will be able to bounce right back, Halley Potter, the director of PK-12 education at The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank, says. Some school districts were already preparing to shut down programs and fire staff in anticipation of not receiving funding, she says, and even with the release of funds, staff can't be rehired on a dime. For example, public school systems in Alaska, California, and Washington reported laying off staff because of the funding holdups. "I think a lot of places are going to be as nimble as they can be, but you can't open an after-school program at the beginning of August with a week's notice necessarily," Potter says. Sosa said that in July, his district already saw "a small reduction in staffing," including teachers who helped kids catch up on math and reading. The Trump administration also said it would place guardrails to ensure public schools are using the funds in ways that don't violate executive orders, including orders designed to discourage "woke" or diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. This means that although the funding has been released, it could be withdrawn. Potter says this uncertainty could cause schools to make some tough decisions about their budget. For instance, a district could cover the pay for a teacher who focuses on teaching English as a second language "by shifting things around in the budget and stealing from some of the funding that's supposed to cover next year's summer programs," Potter tells me. The department announced on September 15 that it was repurposing funding from programs that it determined "are not in the best interest of students and families" toward American history programs and HBCUs. In response, a trio of Democratic senators said the move puts funding meant to train teachers at risk. Kira Severson, a first-grade teacher at a Title I school in Phoenix, said she and her students have been directly affected by funding uncertainty. "That was a form of my income over the summer," she said. She added that "for a lot of these kids, school is the only safe place for them and the only place where they can get a free meal." Another one of our hypothetical students at Jefferson-Washington-Lincoln Elementary, Jack, is struggling with his math and reading. Along with his yearly state assessments, he's in a district that was selected to take a nationwide test — commonly known as the Nation's Report Card — that compares achievement across all states, helping policymakers and teachers determine necessary interventions at the local and federal levels, so students like Jack have the best tools to help them keep up. Without the Education Department's research arm, tracking Jack's progress in math and reading will become a lot more difficult. Spellings tells me that without the grants, it's unclear how states and districts will get the data they need to best help their students succeed. Specifically, the cuts mean that fourth graders, who were supposed to take a science assessment in 2028 and 2032, won't be taking that first test, and the writing test for fourth, eighth, and 12th graders in 2032 was canceled altogether, stripping school districts of those results. Potter says the potential loss of valuable information has already created "a lot of instability" across public schools that have historically used that data to assess progress over time. She adds that some magnet schools use the data to apply for and receive federal grants, and it's unclear whether that grant process will continue after the cuts. For example, it might provide technology to classrooms and assess how students are learning using that technology to determine whether it helps them progress. Cuts to that research mean Jack may no longer be able to use the computer system that was helping him advance in math. Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications at the department, said in a statement that the department looks "forward to identifying additional strategies to make education programs more efficient and effective for students, families, and taxpayers." K-12 funding is just one bucket that the department facilitates — it's also responsible for trillions of dollars flowing through the country's higher education system. Proposed changes or cuts to the vast student-loan repayment system put our hypothetical teacher, Ms. Smith, at risk of higher monthly payments, with loan forgiveness on the line. The OBBB eliminated existing income-driven repayment plans and replaced them with two less generous options, meaning borrowers will face a harder time achieving debt relief. On top of that, staffing cuts at the Education Department mean borrowers seeking help with repayment or with their servicers are likelier to see their phone calls go unanswered. "The way that'll show up is just a lot of people who are frustrated and unable to get help with problems that they're having with their loan repayment, or potentially with their financial aid to go to school." Trump's spending law also places new borrowing caps for graduate and professional students, which will cut some borrowers off from pursuing a medical or law degree — or push them toward the riskier private student-loan market. In a district that's already short on money, Stambaugh says that should federal funds stop flowing, her school won't be able to pick up the slack, and students will suffer. Beth Akers, a senior fellow at the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute, says there is room for "some significant reform" of the agency's practices but that the Trump administration may be taking its push too far. We've also seen previous administrations fail to make the sort of normal-looking reforms that people would expect. So we're going to blow it up and rebuild," Akers tells me. But this aggressive approach, abruptly firing staff and cutting funding, probably isn't the way she would go about it. Kevin Huffman, a former commissioner for Tennessee's education department who worked for a Republican governor, says that while he's "sympathetic to the idea that we want less bureaucracy," that's not a reason to ax the federal agency. Eliminating the Education Department, he says, would run counter to Trump's goal of reducing waste and boosting efficiency. Additionally, it's not clear how the Education Department's responsibilities would be split up. And from a state education chief's perspective, regardless of political affiliation, Huffman says spreading out the Education Department's responsibilities would just make things a lot more complicated. "I could call the people I knew at the US Department of Education and get answers and figure out what we were supposed to be doing," Huffman says. "The idea of having to do that across three or four separate agencies with different processes sounds daunting, bureaucratic, and not particularly efficient." "This is going to be a really challenging school year, and I think districts, in terms of what they're trying to figure out in terms of staffing and budgeting and how they make up for lost funds, is pretty unprecedented," Potter says. Stambaugh just wants clarity on what the Trump administration actually plans to do so she and other teachers can best prepare to help their students. "We all might actually be kind of in that flight, fight, or freeze," she says.

A startup that's built AI agents to autonomously match job seekers with hiring companies has raised $20 million in funding. London-based Jack & Jill has developed two conversational AI agents for each side of the recruitment process. Jack then searches for suitable jobs across the internet, provides coaching, and conducts mock interviews. It scans job descriptions and has a briefing conversation with the in-house talent team to understand what the company is looking for in a candidate. Jill can then review applicants, source candidates from public platforms like LinkedIn, and conduct initial interviews. The two AI agents can also interact with each other and make introductions over email. The startup says it has more than 49,000 job seekers using its platform, and counts hundreds of companies, including Airtable, Airwallex, and TrueLayer, among its customers. Wilson said he thinks AI will be "very disruptive for a lot of roles." He added that there's still plenty of room for humans in the recruitment process, such as focusing on "quality conversations" and strategy. AI can instead handle work that's not "hugely value-additive" like scrolling through LinkedIn and reviewing CVs, he said. The startup has 12 employees, and Wilson told Business Insider that it uses AI in areas such as coding, AI-generated marketing videos, and reviewing user interactions to complete more work with fewer people. Investors pumped $2.8 billion into agentic AI startups globally in the first half of 2025, according to Dealroom data. The buzzy space has seen startups build AI agents for coding, customer support, cybersecurity, and many other areas. It was also backed by Dig Ventures, Entrepreneur First, Ada Ventures, Firedrop, Repeat.vc, Episode1, and Playfair, in addition to more than 50 angel investors from companies including Lovable, Anthropic, and ElevenLabs. Here's an exclusive look at the pitch deck that Jack & Jill used to raise its $20 million seed round.</p>
