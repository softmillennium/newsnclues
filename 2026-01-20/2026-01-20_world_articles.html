                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world has entered “an era of global water bankruptcy” with irreversible consequences, according to a new United Nations report. Regions across the world are afflicted by severe water problems: Kabul may be on course to be the first modern city to run out of water. Mexico City is sinking at a rate of around 20 inches a year as the vast aquifer beneath its streets is over-pumped. The global situation is so severe that terms like “water crisis” or “water stressed” fail to capture its magnitude, according to the report published Tuesday by the United Nations University and based on a study in the journal Water Resources. We can mitigate it,” said Kaveh Madani, director of the UN University's Institute for Water, Environment and Health, and the report's author. The concept of water bankruptcy works like this: Nature provides income in the form of rain and snow, but the world is spending more than it receives — extracting from its rivers, lakes, wetlands and underground aquifers at a much faster rate than they are replenished, putting us in debt. Climate change-fueled heat and drought are compounding the problem, reducing available water. The result is shrinking rivers and lakes, dried-up wetlands, declining aquifers, crumbling land and sinkholes, the creep of desertification, a dearth of snow and melting glaciers. Even in places where water systems are less strained, pollution is reducing the amount available for drinking. It brings human consequences: nearly 4 billion people face water scarcity for at least one month every year. Yet, instead of recognizing the problem and adjusting consumption, water is taken for granted and “credit lines keep increasing,” Madani said. He referred to cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Tehran, where expansion and development have been encouraged, despite limited water supplies. Some regions are affected more severely, the report noted. Parts of South Asia are experiencing chronic declines in water due to groundwater-dependent farming and ballooning urban populations. Madani pointed to the Colorado River, where water sharing agreements are based on an environmental situation that no longer exists. Drought has shrunk the river, but it's not a temporary crisis, he said, “it's a permanent new condition, and we have less water than before.” The findings are alarming, but recognizing water bankruptcy can help countries move from short term emergency thinking to long-term strategies to reduce irreversible damage, Madani said. The report calls for a series of actions, including transforming farming — by far the biggest global user of water — through shifting crops and more efficient irrigation; better water monitoring using AI and remote sensing; reducing pollution; and increasing protection for wetlands and groundwater. Water could also be a “bridge in a fragmented world,” as an issue able to transcend political differences, the report authors wrote. The report's call to action “rightly centres on long-term recovery as opposed to firefighting water crises,” wrote Richard Allen, a climate science professor at the University of Reading, who was not involved in the research. Limiting the climate change will also be vital to ensuring enough water for people and ecosystems, he told CNN. Jonathan Paul, associate professor in geoscience at Royal Holloway University, said the report “lays bare, in unambiguous terms, humankind's mistreatment of water.” But he said the concept of global water bankruptcy is “overstated,” even if many areas are expressing acute water stress. Madani wants the report to spur action. “By acknowledging the reality of water bankruptcy, we can finally make the hard choices that will protect people, economies, and ecosystems.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>California governor chastises Britain and other nations, saying they need to ‘have a backbone' Gavin Newsom, the California governor, scolded “pathetic” European leaders for kowtowing to Donald Trump. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, Mr Newsom said Britain, France and other nations needed to “have a backbone”, accusing them of “rolling over” for Mr Trump. At the suggestion that European leaders were engaged in what they considered diplomacy, Mr Newsom was dismissive. Mr Newsom did not say Europe had been eaten alive quite yet, but they will be “if they continue down this path”. The president has ramped up his rhetoric on Greenland, and before flying to Davos shared an AI image of himself holding an American flag in the territory alongside a sign which read: “US Territory Est 2026”. He again refused to rule out taking Greenland by force on Monday, even though an attack on the territory would amount to aggression against Denmark, a member of Nato. A small number of British and European troops arrived on Jan 15 in Greenland's capital Nuuk in what was described as a reconnaissance mission. Mr Newsom made his comments after arriving at Davos, which has been thrown into disarray by Mr Trump's insistence that the US take ownership of the territory. It's time to get serious and stop being complicit. Mr Newsom also took aim at the decision by Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Machado to hand her Nobel Peace Prize to Mr Trump. He said: “I can't take this complicity, people rolling over. I should have brought a bunch of knee pads for all the world leaders. I mean, handing out crowns, this is pathetic, the Nobel prizes that are being given away. “And I hope people understand how pathetic they look on the world stage. “He's been playing you for fools, and it's embarrassing”. Mr Newsom's comments followed further humiliation for Sir Keir Starmer after Mr Trump said that handing over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius was an “act of great stupidity”. Mr Trump said that Sir Keir was giving away the territory which includes the island of Diego Garcia, the site of a key US military base, “for no reason whatsoever”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One year into the second Trump administration, an actual US foreign policy remains just a nice idea. Instead, the world has been forced to adapt to the world according to Donald Trump: one increasingly shaped by his erratic shifts and unpredictable decisions, his fury at perceived slights and his growing desire to stamp his legacy in the model of an imperial leader from centuries past. Think of it as the mad king's court, where every day is a carnival. Trump texted the Norwegian prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, at the weekend to tell him that because he had not been awarded the Nobel peace prize “I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.” The world would not be secure “unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland”, he wrote. When the French president, Emmanuel Macron, sought to organise a G7 meeting and dinner to smooth over their differences, Trump leaked that conversation too. When informed that Macron may not join, Trump threatened to slap a 200% tariff on French wine and champagne. Trump was also pictured last week grinning broadly as the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado presented him with her Nobel peace prize medal. After considerable pressure, the award was handed over as tribute. “Does President Trump not realize he looks kind of silly taking that prize from her as she tries to basically suck up to him?” said Mark Warner, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate's select committee on intelligence. It has been, to paraphrase Lenin, the weeks when decades happen. World leaders may previously have felt that they could manage the Trump administration's frenetic focus by slowing down his demands on Ukraine, Nato spending or Gaza. But it now appears primed to ignore its allies and shake up the world order – perhaps mindful that with one year already passed in the White House, Trump only has three years left and faces painful midterm elections later this year. “Now what we have is America just acting willy-nilly. Facing resistance to his efforts to rewrite electoral laws and deploy the national guard and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers at home, Trump has turned towards the world stage as a salve. He has claimed to have “solved” six, and then seven – and then eight wars, more than any other president, despite the dubious nature of many of the “peace processes” concerned. His anger at being overlooked for the Nobel peace prize, which was famously given to his nemesis, Barack Obama, shortly after the Democratic president's election in 2009, has also driven a quest for global recognition that has played out in tragicomic terms. He brokered a shaky and incomplete peace in Gaza, largely by giving Israel carte blanche, but it is now unclear how to make good on his plan to disarm Hamas. He successfully pushed Nato allies to increase defence spending while bringing relations with European capitals to the breaking point over tariffs, his Ukraine policy and his claims that Europeans are stifling free speech and enabling mass migration. His advisers harangued Ukrainian leaders, he cosied up to foreign dictators and announced surprise tariffs that have unsettled world markets. All of that has been done virtually ad hoc. Strategy in Washington is not hammered out through policy memos or inter-agency meetings. Despite different priorities, those figures have found common cause on key decisions – in Venezuela, Rubio's focus on leftwing regimes fuelled by his Cuban heritage coincided with Miller's obsessive focus on combating immigration to the US and Vance's interest in countering Chinese influence in Latin America. In Greenland, Vance, an outspoken critic of Europe, has seen a chance to further undermine the transatlantic relationship and set European leaders on edge when he joined Rubio to receive the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland last week. But Trump's ultimate goal is to put his name in the history books. The only US foreign policy now is one of might makes right, and Trump and his allies have made clear that in their worldview geopolitics is a zero-sum game. In May last year, Trump accepted a UK plan to return the Chagos Islands, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean, to Mauritius – and Rubio praised the deal, saying Trump had told Keir Starmer it was a “monumental achievement” that they would maintain access to a US-UK base on Diego Garcia. “These are International Powers who only recognise STRENGTH, which is why the United States of America, under my leadership, is now, after only one year, respected like never before,” he wrote.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Judge rules homeland security can insist lawmakers provide week's notice of intention to inspect facilities The Trump administration won a legal victory on Monday that temporarily allows it to keep elected officials out of immigration detention camps, while it advanced two other court actions in support of its surge into Minnesota. A federal judge in Washington DC ruled that the homeland security department (DHS) can continue to insist that lawmakers provide a week's notice of their intention to inspect immigration facilities, even though she blocked an identical policy last month. And in a related development, the justice department said it was appealing an injunction issued on Friday curbing aggressive tactics by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal agencies in dealing with protesters. Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, backtracked on Sunday on her insistence that federal agents had not used chemical substances including pepper spray against crowds protesting ICE actions, and claimed instead they were necessary to “establish law and order”. The Washington DC ruling on congressional oversight of federal immigration facilities comes after three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota, Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison, said DHS officials illegally blocked them from performing authorized congressional oversight when they tried to inspect an ICE detention center near Minneapolis earlier this month. The Colorado congressman Joe Neguse and colleagues filed a lawsuit arguing that it violated district court judge Jia Cobb's December ruling blocking DHS from enforcing a seven-day notice period. “If plaintiffs wish to challenge the legality of a new agency action, plaintiffs may seek leave to amend their complaint or file a supplemental pleading,” she wrote, adding that she would consider another temporary restraining order. Neguse did not respond to Cobb's ruling, but in an earlier post on social media said no-notice inspections were essential. “The law is crystal-clear: the administration can't block members of Congress from conducting real-time oversight of immigration detention facilities,” he wrote. “It would render the supremacy of federal law an afterthought to local preferences,” they said, and an injunction blocking the operation “would constitute an unprecedented act of judicial overreach”, the newspaper reported.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recently unsealed federal court filing suggests that Kathy Ruemmler, a former White House counsel to President Barack Obama and now the top lawyer at Goldman Sachs, acted as a key legal adviser to Jeffrey Epstein during some of his most perilous moments, raising questions about her public account that their relationship was limited and informal. Ruemmler was among the many high-profile names who appeared in a trove of Epstein emails and text messages released last November. As CNN's KFile reported, she was one of the most frequently referenced, with more than 100 exchanges between her and the convicted sex offender over several years. Ruemmler's name also appeared repeatedly on Epstein's schedules for planned meetings between 2014 and 2019 while she worked at the law firm Latham and Watkins. Privilege would not typically apply, experts say, to correspondence between professional acquaintances discussing business — the kind of limited, informal relationship Ruemmler says she had with Epstein. In arguing why the contents of those emails should remain confidential, the estate's filing portrays Ruemmler as one of a small group of lawyers repeatedly consulted by Epstein as he faced mounting legal exposure and damaging press coverage in the years leading up to his 2019 arrest. According to the estate's descriptions of the emails, Ruemmler was involved in advising Epstein on a range of topics, including efforts to preserve his controversial 2008 plea deal, drafting and shaping proposed public statements, editing correspondence with a US senator, and even discussions related to victim settlements. Tony Fratto, a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs, where Ruemmler works as the general counsel for the bank, said in a statement, “It is irresponsible and wrong for CNN to draw conclusions about the content of communications from brief and generic descriptions of emails you haven't seen. She was one of many prominent lawyers he informally reached out to for advice.” On Monday night, The Wall Street Journal reported that a senior Goldman Sachs executive discussed preparing a contingency plan for Ruemmler to leave following reporting on her past ties to Epstein, a characterization the bank strongly denied. Notably, the email descriptions also assert that Ruemmler was among a group of attorneys who worked with Epstein in 2015 to push back on a planned “Good Morning America” interview with one of his most outspoken victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre. Epstein's estate claims that Ruemmler helped draft a legal letter sent to ABC News in April 2015 threatening legal action if the piece aired, which it never did. A ​CNN analysis​ found that Ruemmler is included in more than 300 emails in the privilege log, which shows thousands of entries between Epstein and his attorneys from as early as 2008 through July 2019. Far from a passive observer who was added to email chains among Epstein's lawyers, Ruemmler appears in the log as an active participant in many instances. In response to questions about her relationship with Epstein, Ruemmler told CNN last month she “did not represent him and was not compensated by him.” While the contents of the emails remain sealed, the log offers a window into how Epstein and his attorneys navigated some of his most perilous legal and media battles after his 2008 conviction and incarceration for soliciting prostitution from a minor. The 513-page privilege log was provided in a suit against against Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn, who served as Epstein's attorney and accountant. Latham and Watkins did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But according to experts CNN spoke with, Ruemmler's assertions that she was not his attorney do not matter when it comes to attorney-client privilege. It does not matter if there's not a formal representation document or an agreement,” said Ken Broun, an emeritus professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law. Ruemmler's assertions that she was never compensated by or represented Epstein also do not mean she wasn't providing him legal counsel or advice in some capacity. “You don't need to be compensated by someone to establish an attorney-client relationship, number one,” said Elise Maizel, an assistant professor of law at Michigan State University College of Law and an expert on attorney-client privilege. Maizel also said Ruemmler could be viewed as having an attorney-client relationship with Epstein even if she never signed a formal engagement letter or represented him as his counsel in a particular lawsuit. Such unpaid work by attorneys like Ruemmler, who made $22.5 million in 2024 as Goldman Sachs' chief legal officer, is often worth tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. The newly unsealed filing suggests that Ruemmler's involvement went far beyond casual and informal work. Rather than a distant professional acquaintance, the record portrays her as a﻿ trusted legal confidant repeatedly consulted at moments when Epstein's legal and reputational stakes were highest. Among the most consequential work described is a legal memorandum the estate says that Ruemmler sent Epstein in 2015 analyzing a federal lawsuit that threatened to unravel his controversial 2008 non-prosecution agreement that had shielded him from federal charges. Other entries place Ruemmler in discussions about correspondence with lawmakers as political scrutiny intensified. In early 2019, as then-Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska pressed the Justice Department to investigate how federal prosecutors handled Epstein's case, the log describes multiple emails in which Ruemmler provided legal advice on a proposed response. One entry shows Ruemmler sending Epstein an email with the subject line “Suggested edits”; the estate's description reads, “Attorney client communication regarding draft correspondence with Senator Ben Sasse.” The attachment is titled, “Letter to HONORABLE BEN SASSE.doc Edits 2-9-19.doc.” According to the log, no other attorneys were included in that exchange. One entry in the log indicates Epstein relied upon Ruemmler to take a first pass at drafting public statements responding to allegations against him. In an email sent on October 9, 2016, Epstein wrote to Indyke, his longtime lawyer, that he was “waiting for kathy's first pass” of a proposed statement addressing what the estate later described as inaccurate sex-abuse claims in the media. Just over 30 minutes later, according to the privilege log, Ruemmler was included as a recipient on a related email thread discussing the same draft outline, which suggest her direct involvement in reviewing or shaping the statement. The email logs also provide previously unreported details about a crucial incident that helped Epstein avoid public scrutiny of his sex crimes at a time when he was attempting to rehabilitate his reputation. In early 2015, ABC News was preparing to air a lengthy on-camera interview with Giuffre, who was among the first to publicly accuse Epstein of sex trafficking and abuse. When Epstein learned of the interview in April 2015, he quickly gathered his attorneys on an email chain. Among them was Ruemmler, who in the previous year had left her job in the Obama White House and was working as a high-dollar attorney at Latham and Watkins. The emails are sometimes described as “negotiations with media outlet to prevent false allegations from being aired” and “how to deal with media coverage of claims against Epstein.” One email between Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, in which Ruemmler is listed as an attorney, is described in the log as “Attorney client communication regarding Good Morning America Interview with REDACTED.” The request contained a detailed summary of Giuffre's allegations, including claims that Epstein sexually abused her beginning when she was a teenager, trafficked other underage girls, and arranged sexual encounters with powerful men. Among them, according to Giuffre, was then-British royal, Prince Andrew, who was stripped of his royal titles last year over his association with Epstein. The following day, April 24, 2015, Weinberg sent an official letter to ABC News on Epstein's behalf — a copy of which was released in November by House investigators. In the letter, Weinberg argued that Giuffre's allegations were uncorroborated, outdated, and contradicted by other evidence, and warned ABC News that airing the interview would be “grossly negligent or worse.” “If ABC has concerns about her credibility with respect to any allegation, it must decline to republish all of her allegations,” the letter from Weinberg read. Weinberg, who has in the past denied that Ruemmler represented Epstein, told CNN, “I regret that I cannot discuss any communications for which the Estate has claimed privilege.” Giuffre, who died by suicide last year, ﻿described in her posthumously published memoir feeling proud to have done the interview and devastated that it never aired. And I couldn't help but wonder, if a media giant like ABC could be shut down in its attempts to reveal the truth, was there any hope for survivors like me?” Years later, a leaked 2019 recording captured then-“Good Morning America” co-host Amy Robach expressing frustration that the segment was not broadcast.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's suggestion in November last year that Tokyo could intervene militarily in any attack on Taiwan triggered a sharp diplomatic backlash from China, which urged its citizens to avoid traveling to Japan. Attracted by a weak yen, Chinese tourists splashed out the equivalent of US$3.7 billion in the third quarter of last year. However, Japanese Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Yasushi Kaneko said it was a “significant achievement” that overall visitors numbers had topped 40 million people for the first time. “While the number of Chinese tourists in December decreased, we attracted a sufficient number of people from many other countries and regions to offset that,” he said, adding that there had been a “steep” increase in tourists from Europe, the US and Australia. “We also hope and want to make sure that Chinese visitors will return to us as soon as possible,” he added. The Japanese government has set an ambitious target of reaching 60 million tourists annually by 2030. However Japan's biggest travel agency JTB forecast that overall tourist numbers this year would be “slightly lower” compared with last year due to a decrease in demand from China and Hong Kong. Nevertheless, tourism income was expected to increase due to rising prices of items such as lodging and strong spending among visitors. Yemen's separatist leader has vowed to keep working for an independent state in the country's south, in his first social media post since he disappeared earlier this month after his group briefly seized swathes of territory. Aidarous al-Zubaidi's United Arab Emirates (UAE)-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) forces last month captured two Yemeni provinces in an offensive that was rolled back by Saudi strikes and Riyadh's allied forces on the ground. The Chinese Embassy in Manila yesterday said it has filed a diplomatic protest against a Philippine Coast Guard spokesman over a social media post that included cartoonish images of Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平). Philippine Coast Guard spokesman Jay Tarriela and an embassy official had been trading barbs since last week over issues concerning the disputed South China Sea. The crucial waterway, which Beijing claims historic rights to despite an international ruling that its assertion has no legal basis, has been the site of repeated clashes between Chinese and Philippine vessels. While protesters countered ICE agents, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz activated the state's National Guard to ‘support the rights of Minnesotans' to assemble                                        Hundreds of counterprotesters drowned out a far-right activist's attempt to hold a small rally in support of US President Donald Trump's latest immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Saturday, as the governor's office announced that National Guard troops were mobilized and ready to assist law enforcement, although not yet deployed to city streets. There have been protests every day since the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) ramped up immigration enforcement in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul by bringing in more than 2,000 federal officers. NASA on Saturday rolled out its towering Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion spacecraft as it began preparations for its first crewed mission to the Moon in more than 50 years.</p>

"The second strategic objective is to kill 50,000 Russians per month," he said. "Last month, 35,000 were killed; all these losses are verified on video. They view people as a resource, and shortages are already evident." Ukraine estimates that Russia's overall casualties during the full-scale war have surpassed 1,200,000. Despite the heavy losses, Russia has been able to make marginal advances in Ukraine's front line region as it is able to offset its casualties through fresh contract soldiers. The Ukrainian open-source mapping project DeepState reported that Russian forces occupied 4,336 square kilometers (1,674 square miles) of Ukrainian territory in 2025, accounting for less than 1% of the country In turn, Kyiv has faced increasingly serious manpower shortages, particularly among infantry units holding the front line. In a rare report, Fedorov said on Jan. 14 that two million Ukrainians are wanted for evading mobilization, and another 200,000 soldiers are absent without official leave (AWOL), as infantry units continue to struggle to refill heavy losses. As of Jan. 17, Ukraine's General Staff estimates that Russia has lost 1,225,590 troops in Ukraine since the start of the war on Feb. 24, 2022, which includes those injured, killed, and missing. The numbers are largely in line with estimates made by Western intelligence agencies. Chris York is news operations editor at the Kyiv Independent. Previously, back in Britain, he spent nearly a decade working for HuffPost UK. He holds an MA in Conflict, Development, and Security from the University of Leeds. At least one person in Kyiv has been injured, local authorities reported. Ukraine's Air Force has warned that Russian ballistic missiles are targeting multiple regions, including the capital. "Last month, 35,000 were killed; all these losses are verified on video. So a European army, while each country keeps its own sovereign forces, must be able to respond. It should be no smaller than 3 million," Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists. "Undoubtedly, I choose Ukraine in this case, rather than the economic forum, but everything can change at any moment," President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Zelensky said Ukrainian diplomats are reviewing the invitation but stressed it would be "difficult to imagine" sitting at the body alongside Russia and Belarus, who were also invited. The head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund is reportedly set to meet U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner to discuss Washington's peace plan for Ukraine. Moscow is currently studying the proposal, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters, according to state news agency TASS.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He also noted that, while the West has the right to talk among themselves "on the basis of their own rules," Moscow will conduct dialogue with its partners on the basis of equality and mutual respect. TASS has compiled the top Russian diplomat's key statements. Russia is ready to work with anyone willing to "negotiate honestly, on an equal footing, without blackmail or pressure": "And this is well known to all." Despite what Western detractors may say, Moscow's "notorious isolation" has not been realized. "Russia will consistently defend its interests without infringing on the legitimate rights of others, nor will it allow its own legitimate rights to be violated." Russia is ready to continue seeking a diplomatic settlement to the Ukrainian crisis and has always been open to doing so: "If you look at the history of this crisis, starting in 2014 and especially since 2022, you will see that Russia has shown a great deal of goodwill when it comes to concluding political agreements. However, each time, our Western neighbors, primarily European, did everything they could to block these agreements." The security guarantees Europe offers Ukraine are intended to preserve the Nazi regime in Kiev: "We must not forget this." Russia does not accept proposals for a settlement in Ukraine that aim to preserve the Nazi regime in Kiev: "Proposals for a settlement that are based on the task of preserving the Nazi regime in that part of Ukraine that will be so-called are, of course, absolutely unacceptable." The EU is again trying to come up with "some kind of coalition" against Russia, calling for the creation of a security system involving Ukraine. Europe and the Kiev regime led by Vladimir Zelensky are "hysterically" trying to shift Washington's position, which was agreed upon with Moscow in Anchorage. European leaders' goal of inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia "remains in their plans and intentions." NATO is "seriously preparing" for war with Russia. Many serious Western politicians now regret not paying attention to Russian President Vladimir Putin's speech at the 2007 Munich Security Conference: "They regret not listening, not hearing, and taking it as just another piece of rhetoric." Statements by European leaders about the need for dialogue with Russia now sound insincere. French President Emmanuel Macron has been rude and dismissive toward Russia, but Moscow is above such rhetoric: "Well, if you're going to be rude, then ignore Russia. We are, of course, above that and treat such statements not even with contempt, but with disdainful disregard."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MOSCOW, January 20. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he sees no European leaders willing to work toward a sustainable settlement in Ukraine. "This isn't about someone being allowed to play a role or not. The question is whether they want to. And if they do, can they actually play a role that will lead to lasting peace," Lavrov said in response to a question from a French journalist about whether Russia was prepared to let Europeans participate in the Ukrainian settlement. "I don't see anyone like that in Europe among those actively involved in the Ukrainian issue," he added at a news conference reviewing the results of Russian diplomacy in 2025. Lavrov noted that he was primarily referring to Berlin, Paris, Brussels, Helsinki, the Baltics, and London, which, according to him, "is increasingly becoming the voice of the European Union." "Maybe they have submitted a readmission request, I don't know. They formed this quartet: [British Prime Minister Keir] Starmer, [French President Emmanuel] Macron, [German Chancellor Friedrich] Merz, and, of course, [European Commission President] Ursula von der Leyen and other Brussels officials. I don't see them showing any interest in ending the conflict," the Russian foreign minister concluded.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Undoubtedly, I choose Ukraine in this case, rather than the economic forum, but everything can change at any moment," Zelensky told journalists. According to the president, he might consider attending Davos if there are prospects of reaching decisions about more air defense systems and energy assistance packages for Kyiv. The attack left nearly half of Kyiv's apartment buildings — around 6,000 — without heating and triggered widespread power outages. At least one person was killed, and three others were injured. Kyiv is also facing a lack of running water in several neighborhoods. "For now, I have a plan to help people with energy issues," Zelensky said. The Davos summit is expected to serve as a venue for ongoing talks between the Ukrainian and U.S. officials focusing on post-war security guarantees for Kyiv and economic cooperation. Earlier in the day, the Ukrainian delegation, which includes President's Office Head Kyrylo Budanov, National Security Council Secretary Rustem Umerov, and David Arakhamia, leader of Zelensky's parliamentary faction, arrived in Davos.

The Prime Minister's speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Tuesday follows an extraordinary threat by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on European allies and Britain until Washington is allowed to acquire Greenland for strategic purposes. As one example of middle powers working together, Mr. Carney said Canada stands firmly committed to the collective defence of Greenland under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. “On Arctic sovereignty, we stand firmly with Greenland and Denmark and fully support their unique right to determine Greenland's future,” the Prime Minister said. “Our commitment to Article Five is unwavering,” he said, referring to the collective defence chapter in the NATO treaty that states an armed attack against one or more members in Europe or North America is considered an attack against all. Speaking at Davos, Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand declined to say whether Canada will send troops to Greenland in support of the Danish territory. “Regarding future deployments and future exercises, those are decisions that the Minister of National Defense makes, together with the chief of defense staff.” It calls for the respect of state sovereignty, peaceful dispute resolution, free trade, human rights, and co-operation on challenges such as security and climate. Mr. Carney invoked Czech writer Václav Havel, a dissident who later entered political life, to frame his argument about how middle powers are propping up the lie that the rules-based order still works. “More recently, great powers began using economic integration as weapons. Just as Mr. Havel described Soviet-era shopkeepers placing signs with Communist slogans in their windows to avoid trouble, participating in rituals they knew to be false, Mr. Carney argued that middle powers have similarly gone along with the fiction of a rules-based order that no longer protects them. It is time for countries “to take their signs down,” the Prime Minister said. “Call the system what it is: a period of intensifying great power rivalry where the most powerful pursue their interests using economic integration as a weapon of coercion.” His sharpest words Tuesday were reserved for countries that only selectively criticize economic coercion. When middle powers criticize economic intimidation from one direction but stay silent when it comes from another, we are keeping the sign in the window.” On Tuesday, as he prepared to head to the World Economic Forum, Mr. Trump posted a photo of himself sitting in the Oval Office talking to European leaders that had been altered to show a map of the Western Hemisphere with American flags covering not only the United States but also Greenland, Canada, Cuba and Venezuela. Trump on Tuesday posted an AI-generated photo of him meeting in the Oval Office with European leaders and a map of the Western Hemisphere that shows American flags over Greenland, Canada, Cuba and Venezuela.Truthsocial.com/Supplied Mr. Carney, who last week struck a new strategic partnership with China's authoritarian leadership, championed in his Davos speech what he called “values-based realism” – a term borrowed from Finnish President Alexander Stubb – combining principled commitments to sovereignty and human rights with pragmatic engagement in a fragmented world. The Prime Minister said middle powers need to build new institutions between them, strengthen their domestic economies, diversify their trade internationally and work together in coalitions, not bilaterally, when dealing with great powers. “Rather than waiting for a great power to restore an order it is dismantling, create institutions and agreements that function as described,” he said.

During the winter, coughing becomes one of the most common reasons for clinic visits. Many people mistake a persistent cough for an unresolved cold, turning to over-the-counter medications or throat lozenges, only to see little to no improvement. Meanwhile, in some cases, symptoms may worsen.

In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), treating a cough begins with identifying the pattern and determining whether it is caused by cold or heat, or by external factors or internal imbalances. This approach helps address the root cause rather than simply alleviating symptoms.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. DANIEL W. DREZNER is Academic Dean and Distinguished Professor of International Politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and the author of the newsletter Drezner's World. For most Americans and Europeans alive today, a world of anarchy probably never felt quite real. Since 1945, the United States and its allies crafted and maintained an order that while neither fully liberal nor fully international, established rules that kept the peace among the great powers, promoted a world of relatively open trade, and facilitated international cooperation. Before that long great-power peace, however, anarchy was far from an abstraction in the developed world. With weak global rules and weaker enforcement mechanisms, most states had little choice but to fend for themselves, often resorting to military force. But there were still limits to what sovereign states might do in a conflict. Countries were only just beginning to project military power beyond their borders, and information, goods, and people traveled less rapidly. Even during periods of international disorder, states could do only so much to one another without risking their own demise. Although U.S. President Donald Trump did not single-handedly bring about the decline of the post-1945 order, he has, in his first year since returning to office, accelerated and even embraced its demise. Trump's appetite for territorial expansion eviscerates the most powerful post-1945 norm: that borders cannot be redrawn through the force of arms. And his disregard for domestic institutions has allowed him to run roughshod over any attempts at home to check those foreign expansionist dreams. It is closer to the more primitive anarchy of the political philosopher Thomas Hobbes—a world of “all against all,” where sovereign power cannot be challenged domestically or internationally. In this Hobbesian order, driven by a leader who rejects any constraints on his ability to act and who is emboldened by technology to move at a whirlwind pace, anything goes. Most realist scholars of international relations take anarchy to be the starting point of their theories, and the Trump administration itself says that its policies are informed by a realist understanding of the world. Without any authority enforcing the global rules of the game, countries can rely only on their own power and strategy to survive. Anarchy also functions as a powerful constraint, forcing states to act prudently and husband their resources. The risk of war can cause even great powers to think twice about taking aggressive actions so as to avoid triggering a balancing coalition. The realist political scientist Charles Glaser has argued that such a worldview is not necessarily pessimistic and that countries could engage in self-help through cooperation. Realists therefore believe that order and stability are possible in an anarchic world. Indeed, although realists themselves still debate what pursuing a realist foreign policy means, they agree that anarchy should not mean abandoning strategy or taking every opportunity to fight or meddle in other countries' affairs. For example, the political scientist Robert Gilpin argued that the hegemonic state provides international public goods such as monetary institutions or security alliances, creates and enforces rules (which usually benefit the hegemon), and facilitates economic exchange and cooperation. At first glance, this story seems to describe the current moment quite well. The costly, failed invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq stretched American military power almost to its breaking point. A rising China, meanwhile, is challenging the United States for global leadership, technological supremacy, and economic dominance. Indeed, many observers thought the Trump administration would refocus on China, including by pulling resources out of Europe and the Middle East. Although Trump did not inherit a peaceful international environment, he still had time to act: even with wars in Ukraine, Gaza, and Sudan raging on, no global war had erupted, and Washington had partners in Europe to help stop Russia, the closest thing to a revisionist great power, from conquering Ukraine following its full-scale invasion in 2022. In one year, however, Trump has undone most of those advantages, gutting or surrendering them despite their value to the United States in its competition for great-power dominance. Over the past year, Trump has halted efforts to preserve what is left of the U.S.-led order, picked unnecessary and increasingly dangerous fights with crucial allies, and undermined the very foundations of U.S. power. Trump's threats to the sovereignty of Greenland and Denmark—and with it, his evident willingness to blow up NATO—have needlessly antagonized European countries who are otherwise eager to allow Washington the kind of access most countries could only dream of. As Oona Hathaway and Scott Shapiro have argued in Foreign Affairs, Trump is creating a world in which “not only would the rules be unpredictable, they would depend entirely on the impulses of whoever happens to command the most coercive power at a given moment.” The world Trump is creating is not the anarchy that contemporary realists write about, in which states must make prudent choices about when and where to act, with whom and against whom to ally, and how and how much to impose their will on others. By seizing the tools of hegemony, Trump is acting aggressively in multiple regions at the same time, at a speed that no previous great power could contemplate. Over the course of just one week in January, the Trump administration executed a military mission in Caracas to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, issued threats to its NATO allies about seizing Greenland, and surged the deployment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to Minneapolis despite widespread protests. Maybe he will reaffirm the U.S. commitment to NATO—or invade Greenland. If unpredictability has any value as a geopolitical tactic, it must be used strategically and sparingly. Trump's mercurial impulses, on which he can act more quickly and easily than any leader in history, represent a new level of chaos. The new Trumpian anarchy is different in another important way: at no other point in history has a dominant power that was for centuries a consolidated (if never complete) democracy so quickly started to backslide and unwind its democratic institutions. The United Kingdom, for example, slid from its great-power status as it became more democratic in the nineteenth century, not less. He famously described anarchy as a war of “all against all,” in which life is “nasty, brutish, and short.” Less well known is his belief that for a commonwealth to survive in such a brutal world, a sovereign has to be able to exercise nearly unconstrained power at home. In the first year of his second term, Trump has tried to consolidate both international and domestic authority. At the international level, he has made it clear that he does not believe himself to be constrained by any form of international law or norm. In an interview with The New York Times, he declared his own morality to be the only constraint on his actions. “I don't need international law,” he told reporters. Shortly after his confirmation, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth fired the military's top lawyers, making it clear that he believes legal limitations on warfighting to be a hindrance to U.S. power. Trump has also taken steps to eliminate domestic constraints on his power. During his first term, Trump chafed against a number of domestic bulwarks against his impulses and policy preferences: Congress, the judiciary, and even the so-called adults in the room within his own administration. He has enacted a tariff regime of dubious constitutional provenance in an attempt to remake the global economy and rebuild the U.S. manufacturing sector. He has deployed federal officers and National Guard troops in cities in direct defiance of local leaders' wishes to accelerate his mass deportation campaign. He has weaponized the Department of Justice to pursue his political vendettas. In June, one of us (Saunders) argued in Foreign Affairs that the United States has the foreign policy of a personalist dictatorship. But rebuilding trust in U.S. institutions at the domestic level, much less the international level, will be a difficult and lengthy process. It has called its strategy “peace through strength” and declared a foreign policy of “flexible realism,” which its authors understand as being “realistic about what is possible and desirable to seek in its dealings with other nations.” Trump's supporters would argue that this approach has enhanced U.S. hegemony. His administration, however, is using them in ways no realist would advise. Trump's gutting of foreign aid and the infrastructure of U.S. scientific and technological dominance, his dangerous confrontation with stalwart European allies, and, most damaging of all, his use of the military and federal security forces to consolidate his domestic authority will, in the long run, undermine American power. Whether these actions succeed or not, they weaken the United States and make China relatively more attractive for smaller powers seeking security.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It would mean no food on the table for her family of five. Deviki leaves home for work, kicking up more dust on the way to her place of employment, a building site 3km away from her home. Delhi and several regions across North India are in the grip of a prolonged cold wave, with temperatures plunging to multi‑year lows. On Friday, the capital recorded a low of 2.9°C – its coldest morning in three years. This year, Delhi recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of above 500, making it the world's most polluted city. While authorities last month advised government and private offices to adopt work-from-home measures, daily-wage workers, vendors, construction laborers, and delivery staff have no such option. It is cold too, but I cannot help. I don't care about air pollution anymore,” she told RT. At the end of the day, Deviki says that her hair is covered with dust and her skin feels dry. But pausing for too long means the supervisor can dismiss her from work. “I feel my health deteriorating due to air pollution and continuous exposure to dust, what other option do I have?” Deviki asks as she continues her work in the cold. Experts warn that Delhi's air pollution is a serious health threat as winter conditions trap toxic smog over the city. In December 2025, the AQI often fell in the “very poor” to “severe” range (with readings above 500 at many monitoring stations), well beyond safe limits and considered a health hazard. Doctors say that prolonged exposure to these high AQI levels poses serious respiratory and cardiovascular risks, especially for people like Deviki who work outdoors and cannot avoid breathing Delhi's polluted air. Air quality in Delhi worsens considerably during winters, starting from October to February. In these months, the pollution reaches hazardous levels, with the prime pollutants particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) rising far beyond safe limits. The plan is a blend of technology‑driven solutions, with the introduction of more stringent regulations, and public participation to confront pollution, according to authorities. The Delhi government has also introduced a financial support scheme for construction workers affected by restrictions under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). During GRAP‑III and GRAP‑IV, when construction activities were halted to reduce pollution, the government announced compensation of 10,000 rupees ($110) per registered worker through a direct benefit transfer model. Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta has called pollution a “legacy problem” that cannot be fixed with a “magic wand” and said her government was taking all measures to curb it, exceeding the efforts of her predecessors. Our government has taken all the pollution‑related measures that previous governments did not take, like mitigation plans, stricter action on industrial pollution, activating enforcement agencies, and efforts to eliminate open burning,” she said. When Delhi's air becomes toxic, the city's better-off have the option to remain indoors, where many can log in from laptops, and schools move classes online. But outside the metro station in Panchseel Park, 36-year-old Rashmi Tinka has no such option. The air grows hazy as evening approaches, and this is when she expects more customers. Tinka is one of the millions of workers in Delhi's vast informal economy who keep the city running – selling food, hauling bricks, and picking up waste – mostly outdoors. Both Deviki and Tinka say that when emergency pollution measures are implemented by the authorities, they hardly feel any change as they have too keep working and stay outside. A report by Greenpeace India and the Workers' Collective for Climate Justice South Asia, titled ‘Laboring through the Climate Crisis,' released in May 2025, notes that Delhi alone is home to over 400,000 street vendors, about 200,000 waste pickers, around 500,000 domestic workers, and 500,000 rickshaw pullers. The report notes the workers often endure long hours outdoors without access to basic services like clean water, cooling spaces, sanitation, or shelter. According to the E‑Shram portal, a government platform where unorganized sector workers can register to gain better access to social security schemes, 3.6 million informal workers are registered in Delhi, with the largest share engaged in the construction sector. This means only a small fraction of informal worker are registered on government platforms like the e-Shram portal, which connects them to social security services. When the AQI entered “severe” levels for several days in November, authorities announced a familiar response: schools shut down or moved online, and government offices were asked to have 50% work from home. Traffic was staggered, construction sites were ordered to close, and advisories urged the elderly and those with respiratory issues to stay indoors. In the west part of Delhi's Seelampur, 24-year-old Mohammad Irfan, a waste picker, stood in a thin sweatshirt as he carried a big dust bin in his hand, collecting waste from scores of houses throughout the day. “Our worry is always that the work should not stop,” he states. “Even if my chest hurts, I need to keep working,” he said. Severe lung disease was found in 17%, 27%, and 10% of the aforementioned workers, respectively, as opposed to none in the control group. A survey of 590 informal workers across various neighborhoods in the capital conducted by Help Delhi Breathe and the Mahila Housing Trust found in 2024 that 94% believed air pollution harmed their health. Additionally, 91% reported feeling sick or uncomfortable when air quality worsened. However, 95% feared losing their jobs if they voiced concerns about air quality at work. Many were daily wage earners – construction workers, street vendors, waste pickers, and small-scale factory workers – who simply could not afford to stop working. “Informal workers are caught in a cruel paradox,” says Bijal Brahmbhatt, director of the Mahila Housing Trust, which supports women in informal settlements and has tracked the impact of pollution on their health and livelihoods. The Help Delhi Breathe study also indicates that workers near landfill sites face additional health issues beyond air pollution, such as contaminated water, toxic fumes from burning garbage, and handling toxic waste without protective gear. Health experts warn that outdoor workers face a higher risk of being affected due to ongoing exposure to toxic air. “People who work outdoors in Delhi – traffic police, construction workers, vendors, delivery personnel – are at the highest risk because they cannot avoid exposure,” says Dr. Randeep Guleria, a senior pulmonologist in New Delhi. “They breathe this polluted air for long hours every day, which is similar to being chronic smokers. Back at her construction site, Deviki hopes that the air quality improves and she can work more comfortably. By Sumitra Bhatti, a journalist based in India.</p>
