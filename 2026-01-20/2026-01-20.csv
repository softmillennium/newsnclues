            A recently unsealed federal court filing suggests that Kathy Ruemmler, a former White House counsel to President Barack Obama and now the top lawyer at Goldman Sachs, acted as a key legal adviser to Jeffrey Epstein during some of his most perilous moments, raising questions about her public account that their relationship was limited and informal.
    


            Ruemmler was among the many high-profile names who appeared in a trove of Epstein emails and text messages released last November. As CNN's KFile reported, she was one of the most frequently referenced, with more than 100 exchanges between her and the convicted sex offender over several years. Ruemmler's name also appeared repeatedly on Epstein's schedules for planned meetings between 2014 and 2019 while she worked at the law firm Latham and Watkins.
    


            The recent filing is part of a civil lawsuit brought by Epstein victims against the executors of his estate, which is seeking to shield thousands of emails from disclosure by asserting attorney-client privilege. Privilege would not typically apply, experts say, to correspondence between professional acquaintances discussing business — the kind of limited, informal relationship Ruemmler says she had with Epstein.
    


            In arguing why the contents of those emails should remain confidential, the estate's filing portrays Ruemmler as one of a small group of lawyers repeatedly consulted by Epstein as he faced mounting legal exposure and damaging press coverage in the years leading up to his 2019 arrest.
    


            According to the estate's descriptions of the emails, Ruemmler was involved in advising Epstein on a range of topics, including efforts to preserve his controversial 2008 plea deal, drafting and shaping proposed public statements, editing correspondence with a US senator, and even discussions related to victim settlements.
    


            Tony Fratto, a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs, where Ruemmler works as the general counsel for the bank, said in a statement, “It is irresponsible and wrong for CNN to draw conclusions about the content of communications from brief and generic descriptions of emails you haven't seen. Kathy was not involved in the privilege assertions or the descriptions in the log. As Kathy has told CNN before, she never represented Epstein and never advocated on his behalf to a third party. She was one of many prominent lawyers he informally reached out to for advice.”
    


            On Monday night, The Wall Street Journal reported that a senior Goldman Sachs executive discussed preparing a contingency plan for Ruemmler to leave following reporting on her past ties to Epstein, a characterization the bank strongly denied.
    


            Notably, the email descriptions also assert that Ruemmler was among a group of attorneys who worked with Epstein in 2015 to push back on a planned “Good Morning America” interview with one of his most outspoken victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre. Epstein's estate claims that Ruemmler helped draft a legal letter sent to ABC News in April 2015 threatening legal action if the piece aired, which it never did.
    


            A ​CNN analysis​ found that Ruemmler is included in more than 300 emails in the privilege log, which shows thousands of entries between Epstein and his attorneys from as early as 2008 through July 2019. The logs were provided as part of an ongoing civil suit by two alleged victims against the executors of Epstein's estate.
    


            While there are often a handful of people on those emails, including lawyers and sometimes a journalist and a public relations crisis professional, there are more than 150 emails between just Ruemmler and Epstein.
    


            Far from a passive observer who was added to email chains among Epstein's lawyers, Ruemmler appears in the log as an active participant in many instances. She is listed as the sender of at least 135 of those emails, according to the privilege log.
    


            The recently released log suggests that Ruemmler played a far bigger role in advising Epstein than previously known — adding critical details to the portrait that emerged from the trove of messages released by the House Oversight Committee in November. While those messages displayed a level of familiarity and at times friendly banter between Ruemmler and Epstein, the description of the privilege logs indicates something far more extensive — a relationship that on its face, and according to experts, appeared to be that of an attorney and a client.
    


            In response to questions about her relationship with Epstein, Ruemmler told CNN last month she “did not represent him and was not compensated by him.”
    


            “I was one of a number of lawyers Epstein informally reached out to for advice,” Ruemmler said in her statement to CNN, adding that she did not advocate on his behalf to “third parties” and “not the press, not a court, not a government official.”
    


            ﻿Ruemmler herself did not respond to additional requests for comment for this piece.
    


            Ruemmler has characterized her relationship with Epstein —who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges — as limited and professional. She said she only knew him as a “business referral source.” Epstein in turn once referred to Ruemmler as “my great defender.”



            Ruemmler has also repeatedly said she regrets ever knowing Epstein, and she told CNN last month she had “no knowledge of any new or ongoing unlawful activity on his part.”
    


            While the contents of the emails remain sealed, the log offers a window into how Epstein and his attorneys navigated some of his most perilous legal and media battles after his 2008 conviction and incarceration for soliciting prostitution from a minor.
    


            The 513-page privilege log was provided in a suit against against Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn, who served as Epstein's attorney and accountant. The suit alleges the two acted as co-conspirators in facilitating Epstein's sex-trafficking crimes, which the two have strenuously denied. A lawyer for the men told the New York Times they “emphatically reject the allegations of wrongdoing” in the lawsuit and called the claims “baseless and legally frivolous.”
    


            There's no indication that Ruemmler is part of the effort to shield the emails from the public by asserting attorney-client privilege. She has maintained that she was not Epstein's attorney.
    


            Her law firm at the time of the correspondence, Latham and Watkins, previously told CNN Epstein was never a client of the firm. 



            Latham and Watkins did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Ruemmler joined the firm in the summer of 2014 and left in 2020 to work at Goldman Sachs.
    


            But according to experts CNN spoke with, Ruemmler's assertions that she was not his attorney do not matter when it comes to attorney-client privilege. It is the client who asserts privilege.
    


            “Attorney client privilege is the privilege of the client with regard to any communication made to someone for the purposes of legal advice. It does not matter if there's not a formal representation document or an agreement,” said Ken Broun, an emeritus professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law.
    


            If, for example, Epstein reached out to Ruemmler for legal advice and she gave it, those communications could be considered privileged.
    


            “It's in the mind of the client that matters. But the client would have to have both a reasonable expectation that that person would provide legal advice to them and that the statement was being made in confidence,” Broun added.
    


            Ruemmler's assertions that she was never compensated by or represented Epstein also do not mean she wasn't providing him legal counsel or advice in some capacity.
    


            “You don't need to be compensated by someone to establish an attorney-client relationship, number one,” said Elise Maizel, an assistant professor of law at Michigan State University College of Law and an expert on attorney-client privilege. Maizel also said Ruemmler could be viewed as having an attorney-client relationship with Epstein even if she never signed a formal engagement letter or represented him as his counsel in a particular lawsuit.
    


            “That doesn't mean that there wasn't an attorney-client relationship established such that the privilege could apply,” Maizel said.
    


            Ruemmler's insistence that she was not compensated by Epstein places the extensive legal work described in the filings in the realm of pro bono representation. Such unpaid work by attorneys like Ruemmler, who made $22.5 million in 2024 as Goldman Sachs' chief legal officer, is often worth tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. That work is typically reserved for poor clients or public-interest matters, not for wealthy convicted sex offenders.
    


            The newly unsealed filing suggests that Ruemmler's involvement went far beyond casual and informal work. Rather than a distant professional acquaintance, the record portrays her as a﻿ trusted legal confidant repeatedly consulted at moments when Epstein's legal and reputational stakes were highest.
    


            Among the most consequential work described is a legal memorandum the estate says that Ruemmler sent Epstein in 2015 analyzing a federal lawsuit that threatened to unravel his controversial 2008 non-prosecution agreement that had shielded him from federal charges. Ruemmler sent the email to Epstein in May 2015, according to the log, with the subject line “CVRA Memorandum 04.16.15.pdf.” The log describes the entry as “providing memorandum containing legal advice.”
    


            Other entries place Ruemmler in discussions about correspondence with lawmakers as political scrutiny intensified.
    


            In early 2019, as then-Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska pressed the Justice Department to investigate how federal prosecutors handled Epstein's case, the log describes multiple emails in which Ruemmler provided legal advice on a proposed response.
    


            One entry shows Ruemmler sending Epstein an email with the subject line “Suggested edits”; the estate's description reads, “Attorney client communication regarding draft correspondence with Senator Ben Sasse.” The attachment is titled, “Letter to HONORABLE BEN SASSE.doc Edits 2-9-19.doc.”
    


            According to the log, no other attorneys were included in that exchange.
    


            One entry in the log indicates Epstein relied upon Ruemmler to take a first pass at drafting public statements responding to allegations against him.
    


            In an email sent on October 9, 2016, Epstein wrote to Indyke, his longtime lawyer, that he was “waiting for kathy's first pass” of a proposed statement addressing what the estate later described as inaccurate sex-abuse claims in the media.
    


            Just over 30 minutes later, according to the privilege log, Ruemmler was included as a recipient on a related email thread discussing the same draft outline, which suggest her direct involvement in reviewing or shaping the statement.
    


            The email logs also provide previously unreported details about a crucial incident that helped Epstein avoid public scrutiny of his sex crimes at a time when he was attempting to rehabilitate his reputation. In early 2015, ABC News was preparing to air a lengthy on-camera interview with Giuffre, who was among the first to publicly accuse Epstein of sex trafficking and abuse.
    


            When Epstein learned of the interview in April 2015, he quickly gathered his attorneys on an email chain. Among them was Ruemmler, who in the previous year had left her job in the Obama White House and was working as a high-dollar attorney at Latham and Watkins.
    


            The log says that in late April 2015, Ruemmler was across more than a dozen emails appearing to discuss the ABC News interview. The emails are sometimes described as “negotiations with media outlet to prevent false allegations from being aired” and “how to deal with media coverage of claims against Epstein.”
    


            One email between Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, in which Ruemmler is listed as an attorney, is described in the log as “Attorney client communication regarding Good Morning America Interview with REDACTED.”
    


            A copy of ABC's comment request to Epstein was included in the files released by the House Oversight Committee. The request contained a detailed summary of Giuffre's allegations, including claims that Epstein sexually abused her beginning when she was a teenager, trafficked other underage girls, and arranged sexual encounters with powerful men. Among them, according to Giuffre, was then-British royal, Prince Andrew, who was stripped of his royal titles last year over his association with Epstein.
    


            Ruemmler is listed as sending several emails to Epstein and his attorney, Martin Weinberg, on April 22 and 23, 2015.
    


            At least one email chain that Ruemmler sent Epstein and his counsel has the subject line “Privileged and Confidential,” ﻿suggesting that she made the decision to characterize the exchange as an attorney-client privileged conversation.
    


            She attached a document called “Letter to ABC (Draft 3)kr.doc,” seemingly adding her initials to the document's name. The April 23 email is described by the estate as “communication providing draft of a letter to the press seeking to correct the record.”
    


            The following day, April 24, 2015, Weinberg sent an official letter to ABC News on Epstein's behalf — a copy of which was released in November by House investigators.
    


            In the letter, Weinberg argued that Giuffre's allegations were uncorroborated, outdated, and contradicted by other evidence, and warned ABC News that airing the interview would be “grossly negligent or worse.”
    


            “If ABC has concerns about her credibility with respect to any allegation, it must decline to republish all of her allegations,” the letter from Weinberg read.
    


            Weinberg, who has in the past denied that Ruemmler represented Epstein, told CNN, “I regret that I cannot discuss any communications for which the Estate has claimed privilege.”
    


            The ABC News interview never aired.
    


            Giuffre, who died by suicide last year, ﻿described in her posthumously published memoir feeling proud to have done the interview and devastated that it never aired.
    


            “I'd been defeated once again by the people I was trying to speak out against. And I couldn't help but wonder, if a media giant like ABC could be shut down in its attempts to reveal the truth, was there any hope for survivors like me?”
    


            Years later, a leaked 2019 recording captured then-“Good Morning America” co-host Amy Robach expressing frustration that the segment was not broadcast.
    


            “We had everything,” Robach said.
    


            Robach declined to comment to CNN.
    


            A spokesperson for ABC News pointed CNN to a past statement on the incident: “At the time, not all of our reporting met our standards to air, but we have never stopped investigating the story.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","With Trump's backing, Rep. Julia Letlow launches a primary challenge against Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/20/politics/julia-letlow-bill-cassidy-louisiana-senate","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:23:47 GMT","


            Republican Rep. Julia Letlow has launched a run for US Senate in Louisiana, taking advantage of President Donald Trump's endorsement to wage a primary battle against incumbent GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy.
    


            “Today, I am announcing my candidacy for the United States Senate to ensure the nation we leave our children is safer and stronger. Louisiana deserves a conservative Senator who will not waver. I am honored to have President Trump's endorsement and trust,” Letlow posted on X on Tuesday morning.
    


            Letlow first announced her plans to run earlier in the day while speaking at a breakfast hosted by Business Report in Baton Rouge, a source familiar with the matter said.
    


            Letlow was elected to the House in a March 2021 special election to replace her husband, Luke Letlow, after he died from Covid-19 just weeks after being elected.
    


            Letlow's decision sets the stage for a hard-fought and potentially expensive primary battle for a safe Senate seat, as Republicans seek to hold onto their narrow congressional majorities in this fall's midterm elections. Letlow had been waiting for Trump to weigh in on the race and had suggested that she was only willing to run if he specifically backed her, a source familiar with the matter said.
    


            Trump was urged by Senate Majority Leader John Thune to back Cassidy. His push for Letlow is the latest reminder that he does not forgive or forget Republicans who break with him on personal terms — even if they largely support his agenda.
    


            Cassidy said he had spoken with Letlow by phone Tuesday morning about her bid.
    


            “She said she respected me and that I had done a good job. I will continue to do a good job when I win re-election. I am a conservative who wakes up every morning thinking about how to make Louisiana and the United States a better place to live,” he said in a statement.
    


            The senator was one of seven Republican senators who voted to convict Trump in his 2021 impeachment trial following the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol. At the time, Cassidy had just won a new six-year term and Trump's future in politics was unclear after he'd lost his bid for reelection.
    


            The Louisiana senator predicted shortly after the vote, which ultimately fell short, that Trump's influence within the GOP would recede. “I think his force wanes. The Republican Party is more than just one person,” he told ABC News.
    


            Cassidy, a 68-year-old doctor, chairs the Senate's Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. He voted to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Trump's Department of Health and Human Services secretary, despite voicing opposition to Kennedy's skepticism over vaccines. However, Cassidy's relationship with Kennedy hit a breaking point last year.
    


            Trump's decision to back a primary challenger against a GOP incumbent creates a new point of tension between Senate Republicans and the White House.
    


            Already in recent weeks, Trump has railed against a handful of senators who broke with Trump and backed advancing a measure to rein in his war powers in Venezuela. Among those targeted by the president was Maine Sen. Susan Collins, whose reelection this year is critical to the GOP's hopes of retaining its majority.
    


            And another Senate Republican from a competitive state, North Carolina's Thom Tillis, has opted against seeking reelection amid criticism from Trump.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Invisible companion leaves evidence trail around supergiant star Betelgeuse","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/20/science/betelgeuse-companion-star-siwarha-wake","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:30:59 GMT","


            Astronomers have long searched for clues that a hidden companion star sits out of view near the red supergiant star Betelgeuse. Now, they've uncovered a new piece of evidence: a trail like the wake behind a boat, cutting through Betelgeuse's upper atmosphere, likely forged by the unseen companion.
    


            Betelgeuse's reddish tint can be spotted gleaming from the Orion constellation, situated about 650 light-years away from Earth.
    


            The bright star is so large that more than 400 million suns could fit inside of it. Its relative proximity and luminosity have made it a favorite among astronomers who observe and study the giant star's evolution.
    


            Yet, despite being so well known, Betelgeuse has its share of secrets — one of the biggest being why it appears to vary in brightness over a six-year cycle, and if the unseen stellar companion, nicknamed “Betelbuddy,” is responsible for this variability.
    


            Hints about the possible companion star were shared in research published last year, in which scientists suggested formally naming the object Siwarha, or “her bracelet,” an Arabic name befitting the companion to Betelgeuse, which means “Hand of the Giant.” (“Elgeuse” is also the historic Arabic name of the Orion constellation.)
    


            Siwarha would likely be too small and faint to be seen given its proximity to Betelgeuse, which has expanded as it has burned through all the hydrogen at its core, bringing it near the end of its life.
    


Astronomers now say the moon is eating up molecules from Earth's atmosphere



            Now, observations taken over the last eight years have revealed the effects of Siwarha on Betelgeuse: a never-before-seen dense trail of gas spotted moving through the larger star's outer atmosphere, where Siwarha closely orbits.
    


            Siwarha's trail appeared just after the star crossed in front of Betelgeuse from Earth's perspective. Astronomers believe Siwarha completes one orbit around Betelgeuse every six years — hence the larger star's change in brightness every six years. The observations are included in a new study that has been accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal.
    


            “It's a bit like a boat moving through water. The companion star creates a ripple effect in Betelgeuse's atmosphere that we can actually see in the data,” said lead study author Andrea Dupree, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, in a statement.
    


            “For the first time, we're seeing direct signs of this wake, or trail of gas, confirming that Betelgeuse really does have a hidden companion shaping its appearance and behavior.”
    


            Betelgeuse is about 15 times the mass of our sun and 1,400 times bigger in diameter, Dupree said. Meanwhile, Siwarha is tiny and might be smaller than our sun.
    


            “If you placed Betelgeuse at the center of our solar system, the surface would extend to Jupiter and the hot atmosphere above it would extend at least 6 times further out,” Dupree said. “So the companion is really plowing through a dense atmosphere of the supergiant star.”
    


            Dupree's team has been tracking changes in Betelgeuse's light for years, using the Hubble Space Telescope as well as ground-based observatories like the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory and Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory.
    


            Patterns emerged in the observations, captured both close to the star and further away from it, that suggested a companion star was whirling through Betelgeuse's extended atmosphere. The team recorded shifts in the speed and direction of gases in the large star's outer atmosphere due to a disturbance.
    


            Hubble enabled the team to see how Betelgeuse's deep atmosphere, or chromosphere, reacted to Siwarha's motion, while the ground-based observations revealed changes in the extended atmosphere.
    


            “What we learn from these latest results is that Siwarha seems to ‘stir up' Betelgeuse's extended atmosphere as it orbits, leaving a wake that impacts what we see from Betelgeuse itself,” said study coauthor Morgan MacLeod, a postdoctoral fellow in theoretical astrophysics and member of the Institute for Theory and Computation at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
    


‘Cloud-9' is a newly discovered celestial object. It could help solve a cosmic mystery



            “This wake is evidence of Siwarha's presence and it's also a trace of how such a small companion is able to affect what we see of Betelgeuse, by modulating the gas and dust around it,” he added.
    


            The results add support to findings about Siwarha made by Steve Howell and his team in 2025. Howell is a senior research scientist at NASA Ames Research Center in California.
    


            His team's observations suggested that the detected size of Siwarha also included a larger region around it as it plowed through Betelgeuse's atmosphere.
    


            “The idea of some expanding plasma wake surrounding Siwarha would seem to agree with our finding of a larger, blobby source and not just a naked stellar photosphere,” Howell said. He was not involved in the new study.
    


            Tracking Betelgeuse's behavior and variations can help astronomers better understand other, faint and distant giant stars that are difficult to study, MacLeod said.
    


            But in recent years, Betelgeuse has thrown astronomers a few puzzling curveballs that have required serious detective work to solve.
    


            From late 2019 to the beginning of 2020, Betelgeuse dimmed so sharply that experts thought the star was on the brink of exploding in a supernova. Since the event, called the “Great Dimming,” teams of astronomers have determined that the star ejected a large dust cloud, which temporarily blocked some of its light from Earth's perspective.
    


            Additionally, the star has exhibited two regular variations in luminosity: the six-year period, as well as a cycle that lasts a little over a year.
    


            Data collected over years have shown that Betelgeuse's luminosity varies about every 416 days, growing fainter and then brighter. This pulsation, which occurs within Betelgeuse's core, was found to be typical of red supergiant stars.
    


            The longer 2,100-day period was thought to be due to dust clouds, large convection cells on the star, magnetic activity or an elusive companion star always out of the optical reach of telescopes.
    


            Within the last year, evidence from multiple research teams has pointed to the reason being the presence of Siwarha.
    


            “With this new direct evidence, Betelgeuse gives us a front-row seat to watch how a giant star changes over time,” Dupree said. “Finding the wake from its companion means we can now understand how stars like this evolve, shed material, and eventually explode as supernovae.”
    


            Other supergiant stars that also display similar patterns of long and short variability may also have invisible companions, Dupree added.
    


4 astronauts will soon take an unprecedented path to the moon. But why aren't they landing?



            Jared Goldberg, a research fellow at the Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Astrophysics, believes the new observations are an important piece of the puzzle in understanding what causes Betelgeuse's six-year variability. Goldberg previously authored research about the companion star, but was not involved in this study.
    


            If astronomers can conclude that periodic variability is due to the presence of a second star, “we can make direct connections to the physics behind formation and evolution of both stars and planets,” Goldberg said.
    


            The team is also working on hydrodynamic models to determine how the wake forms behind Siwarha and reconstruct how that effects Betelgeuse's brightness, MacLeod said.
    


            A hydrodynamic analysis would provide the vital information needed to interpret the new observations, such as what to expect from the motion of a solar-size companion moving through the outer atmosphere of a huge red supergiant, said Edward Guinan, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Villanova University in Pennsylvania. Guinan has studied Betelgeuse but was not involved in the new research.
    


            With Siwarha in such close proximity to Betelgeuse, what is the smaller star's fate?
    


            MacLeod believes Siwarha is being drawn increasingly closer to its massive companion due to gravitational forces, which could result in a merger within 9,000 years.
    


            “We think the stars might merge even before Betelgeuse goes supernova,” MacLeod said. “This would splash out some gas, spin up Betelgeuse and potentially affect the properties of the eventual supernova.”
    


            Based on astronomers' calculations, Siwarha is now on the far side of Betelgeuse relative to Earth's telescopes, but it is expected to emerge into view in 2027.

Denmark has sent additional troops to Greenland after US President Donald Trump threatened European countries with tariffs unless he is allowed to purchase the self-governing Arctic island.

Trump has long sought to acquire Greenland from Denmark, citing national security concerns and the need to deter the influence of Russia and China in the region. European NATO members have rallied in support of Copenhagen, which has rejected Trump's offer.

A new batch of Danish soldiers landed in Greenland on Monday. Major General Soren Andersen, the commander of Denmark's Joint Arctic Command in Greenland, told local media that at least 100 troops are stationed in the island's capital, Nuuk, with another 100 deployed to Kangerlussuaq.

A Danish military spokesperson told CNN there would be a “substantial increase” in the number of soldiers on Greenland. The deployment is part of the Arctic Endurance exercise launched in response to pressure from Trump.

Trump previously said he may have to assert control over Greenland “the hard way” if Copenhagen refuses to cooperate. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen rejected the threats in a recent interview with Sky News, saying, “We have red lines that can't be crossed.”

“You can't threaten your way to ownership of Greenland. I have no intention of escalating this situation,” Rasmussen said.

Trump said he would impose a new 10% tariff on several European states, including Denmark, Britain, France, and Germany, and would raise it to 25% if a deal on Greenland is not reached by June 1. In a recent post on Truth Social, the president said there are “no written documents” establishing Denmark's ownership of Greenland.

“I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States,” he added.

European politicians and experts have warned that a US attack on a fellow NATO member would effectively destroy the bloc.

Police in Nigeria's Kaduna State have denied reports that armed attackers abducted more than 160 worshippers from churches in the northwest of the region during Sunday services.

Kaduna State Police Commissioner Muhammad Rabiu described the reports on Monday as a “falsehood which is being peddled by conflict entrepreneurs who want to cause chaos.” He said security forces investigated the claims but found no evidence of an attack.

Dauda Madaki, chairman of the Kajuru Local Government Area where the alleged incident was reported, also dismissed the claims. “When he heard the rumor of the attack, we mobilized the police and other security forces to the area, Kurmin Wali, but found out that there was no attack,” he added.

However, a member of the clergy has said that armed gunmen attacked churches in the area and seized dozens of worshippers. Reverend Joseph Hayab, head of the Christian Association of Nigeria in the north of the country, told local media that attackers struck two churches.

“The figures what I got from the area is that 172 were said to have been abducted and nine managed to escape, with the remaining 163 people still with the abductors,” Hayab said.

According to several reports, gunmen armed struck two churches in the forest community of Kurmin Wali in Afogo ward at about 11:25am, forcing worshippers into the bush. A local outlet, Vanguard, reported that three churches were targeted, with attackers firing shots to frighten residents.

Nigeria has experienced repeated mass kidnappings in recent months, with armed gangs often taking large groups of people, especially from remote villages, schools, and places of worship. Despite a 2022 law banning ransom payments, kidnappers continue to demand payment for the release of their victims.

On January 3, armed groups raided Kasuwan-Daji village in Niger State, reportedly killing at least 30 people and abducting an unspecified number.

In November, gunmen abducted more than 300 children and staff from St. Mary's Catholic School in Niger State, one of the largest school kidnappings in years.

On a cold January morning in Mehrauli, in south Delhi, in a one-room shanty, 36-year-old Meneka Deviki coughs and her chest feels tight, but she cannot skip a day of work. It would mean no food on the table for her family of five.

The air is enveloped in a grey haze, and it carries a chill and a slight smell. Deviki leaves home for work, kicking up more dust on the way to her place of employment, a building site 3km away from her home. India's capital has a population of over 20 million and is experiencing a construction boom.  

Delhi and several regions across North India are in the grip of a prolonged cold wave, with temperatures plunging to multi‑year lows. On Friday, the capital recorded a low of 2.9°C – its coldest morning in three years. The cold, however, brings another issue: pollution. This year, Delhi recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of above 500, making it the world's most polluted city. 

The unorganized workforce that labors outdoors is impacted most harshly by the toxic winter air. While authorities last month advised government and private offices to adopt work-from-home measures, daily-wage workers, vendors, construction laborers, and delivery staff have no such option. For them, staying home means losing income.



Deviki starts work at the construction site at 8:20am. She rests for five minutes before beginning to carry material on her head to the building. “For the day, I have to deal with toxic air and the dust at the site. It is cold too, but I cannot help. I have to work. I don't care about air pollution anymore,” she told RT.

At the end of the day, Deviki says that her hair is covered with dust and her skin feels dry. “The cough gets worse at night. We are poor people, we need to earn during the day and eat in the evening,” she adds.

Sometimes during work, Deviki wants to rest. But pausing for too long means the supervisor can dismiss her from work.

“I feel my health deteriorating due to air pollution and continuous exposure to dust, what other option do I have?” Deviki asks as she continues her work in the cold.

Experts warn that Delhi's air pollution is a serious health threat as winter conditions trap toxic smog over the city. In December 2025, the AQI often fell in the “very poor” to “severe” range (with readings above 500 at many monitoring stations), well beyond safe limits and considered a health hazard.

Occasionally, improvements bring the AQI down to the “poor” range (around 234–279), but the overall trend shows persistently unhealthy air for much of the winter. 

Doctors say that prolonged exposure to these high AQI levels poses serious respiratory and cardiovascular risks, especially for people like Deviki who work outdoors and cannot avoid breathing Delhi's polluted air.

Air quality in Delhi worsens considerably during winters, starting from October to February. Experts say multiple factors are responsible for this, including stubble burning in the neighboring states, heavy traffic, industrial emissions, and weather conditions that trap the polluted air close to the ground.

In these months, the pollution reaches hazardous levels, with the prime pollutants particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) rising far beyond safe limits. 

The Delhi government launched the Air Pollution Mitigation Plan 2025 in January, hailing it as a seminal step in the city's efforts to clean its air. The plan is a blend of technology‑driven solutions, with the introduction of more stringent regulations, and public participation to confront pollution, according to authorities.

The Delhi government has also introduced a financial support scheme for construction workers affected by restrictions under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). During GRAP‑III and GRAP‑IV, when construction activities were halted to reduce pollution, the government announced compensation of 10,000 rupees ($110) per registered worker through a direct benefit transfer model.  

Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta has called pollution a “legacy problem” that cannot be fixed with a “magic wand” and said her government was taking all measures to curb it, exceeding the efforts of her predecessors. 

“The government is doing everything from anti‑dust drives and strict GRAP curbs to sewage interception and large‑scale cleaning drives. Our government has taken all the pollution‑related measures that previous governments did not take, like mitigation plans, stricter action on industrial pollution, activating enforcement agencies, and efforts to eliminate open burning,” she said.

When Delhi's air becomes toxic, the city's better-off have the option to remain indoors, where many can log in from laptops, and schools move classes online. But outside the metro station in Panchseel Park, 36-year-old Rashmi Tinka has no such option.

She leans over a makeshift cart of momos and boiled eggs, wrapped in a sari and an overcoat. Her cart is decorated with colorful lights. The air grows hazy as evening approaches, and this is when she expects more customers. She needs to stay there amid the cold.

“We are breathing smog to survive,” she says. ""My eyes burn all day. Sometimes I have a headache. Our work has no rest option,” she explains.

Tinka is one of the millions of workers in Delhi's vast informal economy who keep the city running – selling food, hauling bricks, and picking up waste – mostly outdoors.

Both Deviki and Tinka say that when emergency pollution measures are implemented by the authorities, they hardly feel any change as they have too keep working and stay outside.

A report by Greenpeace India and the Workers' Collective for Climate Justice South Asia, titled ‘Laboring through the Climate Crisis,' released in May 2025, notes that Delhi alone is home to over 400,000 street vendors, about 200,000 waste pickers, around 500,000 domestic workers, and 500,000 rickshaw pullers. The report notes the workers often endure long hours outdoors without access to basic services like clean water, cooling spaces, sanitation, or shelter.

Various studies put the percentage of Delhi's workforce employed in the informal sector at around 80%, with 82% of men and 76% of women working informally. According to the E‑Shram portal, a government platform where unorganized sector workers can register to gain better access to social security schemes, 3.6 million informal workers are registered in Delhi, with the largest share engaged in the construction sector. This means only a small fraction of informal worker are registered on government platforms like the e-Shram portal, which connects them to social security services. 



When the AQI entered “severe” levels for several days in November, authorities announced a familiar response: schools shut down or moved online, and government offices were asked to have 50% work from home. Traffic was staggered, construction sites were ordered to close, and advisories urged the elderly and those with respiratory issues to stay indoors. 

In the west part of Delhi's Seelampur, 24-year-old Mohammad Irfan, a waste picker, stood in a thin sweatshirt as he carried a big dust bin in his hand, collecting waste from scores of houses throughout the day. 

“Our worry is always that the work should not stop,” he states. “Even if my chest hurts, I need to keep working,” he said.

A 2023 study conducted by the Indian organization Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group and the international organization Clean Air Fund have looked into the effects of outdoor pollution on the lungs of waste pickers, sanitation workers, and security guards in the city of Delhi. 

It found that the prevalence of abnormal lung function had reached 75% among waste pickers, 86% in sanitation workers, and 86% in security guards, as opposed to 45% in the control group. Severe lung disease was found in 17%, 27%, and 10% of the aforementioned workers, respectively, as opposed to none in the control group.

A survey of 590 informal workers across various neighborhoods in the capital conducted by Help Delhi Breathe and the Mahila Housing Trust found in 2024 that 94% believed air pollution harmed their health. Additionally, 91% reported feeling sick or uncomfortable when air quality worsened. However, 95% feared losing their jobs if they voiced concerns about air quality at work. Many were daily wage earners – construction workers, street vendors, waste pickers, and small-scale factory workers – who simply could not afford to stop working.

“Informal workers are caught in a cruel paradox,” says Bijal Brahmbhatt, director of the Mahila Housing Trust, which supports women in informal settlements and has tracked the impact of pollution on their health and livelihoods.

The Help Delhi Breathe study also indicates that workers near landfill sites face additional health issues beyond air pollution, such as contaminated water, toxic fumes from burning garbage, and handling toxic waste without protective gear.

Health experts warn that outdoor workers face a higher risk of being affected due to ongoing exposure to toxic air. “People who work outdoors in Delhi – traffic police, construction workers, vendors, delivery personnel – are at the highest risk because they cannot avoid exposure,” says Dr. Randeep Guleria, a senior pulmonologist in New Delhi. 

“They breathe this polluted air for long hours every day, which is similar to being chronic smokers. Over time, it causes permanent damage to their lungs and increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes.”

Back at her construction site, Deviki hopes that the air quality improves and she can work more comfortably. “I hope that this cold is over, and the air is cleaner soon.”

MOSCOW, January 20. /TASS/. The EU is weighing counter-tariffs and other measures as Washington pressures Europe over Greenland; the United States has invited Russia and several other countries to join Trump's proposed ""Board of Peace"" to address global conflicts; and the IMF raised its global growth forecast to 3.3% for 2026 while lowering its outlook for Russia's economy. These stories topped Tuesday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

Europe is preparing countermeasures against the United States amid Washington's pressure campaign against it over Greenland. On January 19, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte met in Brussels with Denmark's defense minister and Greenland's foreign minister to discuss security measures in the Arctic and the North Atlantic. At the same time, US President Donald Trump once again stated that he would accept ""nothing less than ownership of Greenland,"" while the White House threatened a ""tariff ladder"" against a number of European countries. However, experts interviewed by Izvestia believe that any EU response is unlikely to be felt strongly in the United States. As the Europeans are divided, each country is expected to navigate the situation on its own.

Brussels is already preparing a counter-tariff scenario - one option under consideration is the introduction of duties totaling 93 bln euro, which could automatically take effect on February 6 after a six-month pause. However, the EU risks doing heavy damage to its own economy if it pulls the trigger with the move.

Member of the European Parliament Thierry Mariani believes that the European Union's retaliatory tariffs could significantly hurt Trump, especially ahead of the US midterm elections, but would also harm the bloc itself.

""Who seriously believes that the European Union will go toe to toe with Washington? Certainly not those who for years have methodically ‘strapped' Europe to the United States: energy dependence on American gas, strategic subordination to NATO, acceptance of the dollar and extraterritorial sanctions,"" the French politician told Izvestia.

At the same time, Europe is discussing an instrument that has never been used before — the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), which allows for restricting access to public tenders, investments, or banking activities, as well as limiting trade in services where the United States has an advantage, digital services being a key one.

""Greenland is not just a territory. It's a litmus test. And this test shows one thing: Europe is dependent, divided, and incapable of choosing between political survival and strategic subordination,"" Mariani said.

""This would be the largest territorial acquisition ever for the United States — larger than any previous one. This territory is larger than France, Germany, Italy, and the UK combined,"" military expert Andrey Klintsevich told Izvestia.

 

The ""Board of Peace"" on Gaza will not replace the United Nations, experts interviewed by Izvestia believe. What it will do, however, is place its participants in a position of dependence on the United States. At the same time, Washington is inviting leaders of various countries to join the council as in the future, it hopes to use the platform to address issues of war and peace not only in the Middle East, but also around Venezuela and Ukraine. Russia has also received an invitation to become a founding co-member and is considering it, the Kremlin reported.

It makes sense to invite Russia to the council, as Moscow has a running dialogue with all parties to the crisis, including Israel and Palestine, Middle East specialist Leonid Tsukanov told Izvestia. According to him, Russia's participation in the organization would be a big benefit for the United States, but not so much for Moscow. Russia maintains close dialogue not only with the Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank, but also with Hamas.

In addition, Russia has good relations with Iran's current authorities, which for obvious reasons did not receive an invitation from the Americans — Washington continues to portray Tehran as one of the main threats to international security, with a potential US strike on Iranian territory remaining a strong possibility.

Invitations to become founding co-members were also extended to countries like Hungary, Greece, Egypt, Kazakhstan, and Turkey. The heads of these nations are friendly towards Trump, who wants to create an international organization composed of leaders of countries with whom the head of the White House has personally established good relations, political scientist and lecturer at the Faculty of Economics of RUDN University Farhad Ibragimov told the newspaper

""Trump wants to create a new organization and then, by the end of his term, write himself into history as the person who shaped a new world order,"" he said.

Trump's desire to play a leading role in the new organization undermines the principle of equality among global players and places other actors de facto under the US thumb, Leonid Tsukanov agrees.

""This looks like going back to a state of unipolarity, which most players would prefer to move away from,"" the expert believes.

 

The global media was buzzing about a ""new world order"" after the Canadian prime minister announced the signing of landmark deals with China's leadership. Canada views the agreements as a way to stave off American tariff pressure, as Beijing promises more stable and mutually beneficial trade conditions within the framework of the World Trade Organization and United Nations norms, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes.

Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday called on China and Canada to promote the building of a new type of strategic partnership based on a sense of responsibility to history, the people, and the world. China and Canada signed a package of documents on cooperation in trade, energy, construction, culture, and public security.

China has been Canada's number two importer after the US for 17 years - volume Trump exploits via tariff threats. However, coordinated actions by trading partners could not only neutralize Trump's tariff weapon but also create major problems for the American economy, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes.

According to the newspaper, Russia's economy, due to minimal volumes of direct exports to the United States, is less exposed to direct American tariff pressure. However, secondary sanctions by the United States against buyers of Russian raw materials are still in play, and do have an impact.

For Russia, the most well-founded strategy appears to be one of ""hybrid development,"" which combines targeted imports of accessible foreign solutions for operational needs with the priority development of domestic competencies in strategically important segments. Full import substitution of advanced computing architectures in the short term is objectively unattainable. However, the creation of sustainable national competencies in niche areas — such as specialized processors or software ecosystems — is a realistic and economically justified task, experts at the Higher School of Economics posit. Amid growing fragmentation of global technological chains, sovereignty is defined by the ability to both participate in international processes and minimize strategic vulnerabilities, the experts noted.

 

Global economic growth will remain resilient at 3.3% in 2026, the same figure as in 2025, according to the January edition of the World Economic Outlook prepared by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) ahead of the World Economic Forum in Davos. The forecast for this year was raised by 0.2 percentage points from the 3.1% projected in October. For next year, IMF experts continue to expect growth of 3.2%. Experts interviewed by Vedomosti say global growth will be supported by technology investment and supportive policies but constrained by tighter fiscal and monetary stances and geopolitical uncertainty. Meanwhile, Russia's outlook was slightly downgraded, with the potential to improve with higher oil prices or geopolitical de-escalation.

Adverse factors related to changes in trade policy are being offset by favorable ones, such as increased investment in technology, including AI, the experts noted. Fiscal and monetary policies, as well as generally favorable financial conditions and the adaptability of the private sector, are expected to support the global economy.

Amid their improved outlook for the global economy, the experts lowered their expectations for Russia's GDP growth in 2026 to 0.8% (from 1% in the October forecast) and to 1% in 2027 (from 1.1%). This is below the expectations of the Russian government.

The overall direction of monetary and fiscal policies in the world's largest economies in 2026 will be more likely to restrain economic growth, Dmitry Kulikov, senior director of the regional ratings group at ACRA, told Vedomosti. Combined with heightened uncertainty in international relations, this could push global growth below its potential and below 2025 levels, he believes.

The IMF is regularly pessimistic in its assessment of the Russian economy, professor at New Economic School Oleg Shibanov believes. For example, in January 2023, the IMF projected a 2.2% contraction in Russia's GDP, whereas the actual decline was smaller at 1.4%. In this regard, the expert considers the expected 0.8-1% growth to be conservative. According to him, moderately conservative scenarios put Russia's economic growth at around or slightly above 1% in 2026, taking into account all factors, both local and global, Kulikov added.

""The difference in the GDP growth forecast from 1% to 0.8% can be considered a margin of error; the difference is negligible,"" Alexander Golovtsov, head of the analytical department at PSB Management Company, told Vedomosti as he offered a more optimistic outlook, pointing out that if global oil prices rise or if there is geopolitical de-escalation, Russia would benefit.

 

Supplies of Russian gas to European Union (EU) countries via the TurkStream gas pipeline from January 1 to January 18, 2026, increased by 10% compared with the same period last year, reaching 993 mln cubic meters, according to calculations by Vedomosti based on data from the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG). Experts told Vedomosti that elevated TurkStream flows reflect Europe's continued reliance on short-term market conditions, with Russian gas priced more attractively than spot alternatives.

The average daily volume of deliveries over this period amounted to 55.2 mln cubic meters per day. A higher level of supplies was recorded only in December of last year, when it reached 55.9 mln cubic meters per day. Since January 13, throughput has been running at 56.7 mln cubic meters per day. The historical daily maximum was recorded on December 11 of last year at 56.72 mln cubic meters.

In 2025, supplies of Russian gas to European Union countries via TurkStream increased by 8% compared with the previous year and reached a record level of 18 bln cubic meters, according to Vedomosti calculations based on ENTSOG data. In December, exports also reached a historic high, totaling 1.73 bln cubic meters, up 14% year-on-year.

The price of Russian gas, especially that sold under long-term contracts, is currently more attractive for European buyers than the cost of fuel on the spot market, Maria Belova, director of research at the consulting company Implementa, told Vedomosti. The cost of Russian gas is linked to spot prices but with a lag of one to seven months, according to analyst at Finam Financial Group Sergey Kaufman.

The significant increase in Russian gas throughput via TurkStream in January shows the European gas market's continued dependence on short-term market conditions, despite the EU's long-term policy of diversifying imports, Belova noted. According to Kaufman's forecast, in January and early February, supplies to the EU via TurkStream may remain at a high level of 53-55 mln cubic meters per day. This will be driven by the need to conserve underground gas storage reserves.

Increasingly unpopular at home, a president obsessed by his legacy has turned his scattergun on the world stage

One year into the second Trump administration, an actual US foreign policy remains just a nice idea. Instead, the world has been forced to adapt to the world according to Donald Trump: one increasingly shaped by his erratic shifts and unpredictable decisions, his fury at perceived slights and his growing desire to stamp his legacy in the model of an imperial leader from centuries past.

Think of it as the mad king's court, where every day is a carnival.

Consider the last few days. Trump texted the Norwegian prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, at the weekend to tell him that because he had not been awarded the Nobel peace prize “I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.” The world would not be secure “unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland”, he wrote.

The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, has said a US takeover of Greenland would mark the end of Nato, and the drama will continue to play out at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week. When the French president, Emmanuel Macron, sought to organise a G7 meeting and dinner to smooth over their differences, Trump leaked that conversation too.

At the same time, the US president invited Vladimir Putin to an ill-defined “board of peace” intended to oversee the transition to a lasting peace in Gaza, despite the Kremlin's continued invasion of Ukraine that has left millions of casualties and threatened Europe's security. Trump appears to be positioning the new group to undermine the UN, which despite its flaws has been a cornerstone of the post-second world war order that has prevented the outbreak of further global conflict. When informed that Macron may not join, Trump threatened to slap a 200% tariff on French wine and champagne.

Trump was also pictured last week grinning broadly as the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado presented him with her Nobel peace prize medal. After considerable pressure, the award was handed over as tribute. “Does President Trump not realize he looks kind of silly taking that prize from her as she tries to basically suck up to him?” said Mark Warner, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate's select committee on intelligence.

It has been, to paraphrase Lenin, the weeks when decades happen.

World leaders may previously have felt that they could manage the Trump administration's frenetic focus by slowing down his demands on Ukraine, Nato spending or Gaza. But it now appears primed to ignore its allies and shake up the world order – perhaps mindful that with one year already passed in the White House, Trump only has three years left and faces painful midterm elections later this year.

“What you see now is simply just everything could be justified in pure power terms, and that's very new for the United States … that's not really something we've done for the last 80 years,” said Max Bergmann, the director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia programme at the Stuart Center in Euro-Atlantic and Northern European Studies, part of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC.

“Now what we have is America just acting willy-nilly. We're acting like Russia,” he said. “And I think that that is what the world is sort of awoken to … That here is a 19th-century America that wants to operate along imperial lines, the way the world operated in the late 19th century.”

Facing resistance to his efforts to rewrite electoral laws and deploy the national guard and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers at home, Trump has turned towards the world stage as a salve.

He has claimed to have “solved” six, and then seven – and then eight wars, more than any other president, despite the dubious nature of many of the “peace processes” concerned. His anger at being overlooked for the Nobel peace prize, which was famously given to his nemesis, Barack Obama, shortly after the Democratic president's election in 2009, has also driven a quest for global recognition that has played out in tragicomic terms.

“For the president, the question of legacy is important, which is why we've seen so much foreign policy activity in this term, unlike the first,” said Kristine Berzina, the senior fellow for US defence and transatlantic security at the German Marshall Fund. “Efforts at peace, efforts at regime change and efforts at territorial acquisition are all part of a notion of legacy. And there isn't that much time.”

Trump had a busy year in foreign policy in 2025, capped in January this year by the capture and rendition of the Venezuelan strongman, Nicolás Maduro in a legally dubious raid that Trump presents as a signature foreign policy victory. He brokered a shaky and incomplete peace in Gaza, largely by giving Israel carte blanche, but it is now unclear how to make good on his plan to disarm Hamas. He bombed nuclear sites in Iran during Israel's brief war with Tehran, and targeted Houthi rebels in Yemen in a campaign seen as ineffective.

He successfully pushed Nato allies to increase defence spending while bringing relations with European capitals to the breaking point over tariffs, his Ukraine policy and his claims that Europeans are stifling free speech and enabling mass migration. His advisers harangued Ukrainian leaders, he cosied up to foreign dictators and announced surprise tariffs that have unsettled world markets.

All of that has been done virtually ad hoc. Strategy in Washington is not hammered out through policy memos or inter-agency meetings. Key foreign policy decisions have been increasingly mediated by a group of five, including Trump's vice-president, JD Vance; his secretary of state, Marco Rubio; his powerful deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller; his envoy Steve Witkoff and his chief of staff, Susie Wiles.

Despite different priorities, those figures have found common cause on key decisions – in Venezuela, Rubio's focus on leftwing regimes fuelled by his Cuban heritage coincided with Miller's obsessive focus on combating immigration to the US and Vance's interest in countering Chinese influence in Latin America.

In Greenland, Vance, an outspoken critic of Europe, has seen a chance to further undermine the transatlantic relationship and set European leaders on edge when he joined Rubio to receive the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland last week. But Trump's ultimate goal is to put his name in the history books.

“Greenland for the sake of territory, Greenland for the sake of how you transform a map, Greenland for a sake of legacy,” said Berzina. “Those are the primary objectives.”

In Trump's world there are winners and losers, bullies and the bullied. The only US foreign policy now is one of might makes right, and Trump and his allies have made clear that in their worldview geopolitics is a zero-sum game.

Given that conflict in the Arctic was likely in the future, his treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, mused: “Better now peace through strength, make it part of the United States, and there will not be a conflict because the United States right now, we are the hottest country in the world. We are the strongest country in the world. Europeans project weakness. US projects strength.”

In May last year, Trump accepted a UK plan to return the Chagos Islands, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean, to Mauritius – and Rubio praised the deal, saying Trump had told Keir Starmer it was a “monumental achievement” that they would maintain access to a US-UK base on Diego Garcia. A year later, Trump posted that it was an “act of GREAT STUPIDITY” and one of his many reasons for demanding the handover of Greenland.

In Trump's new world order, all agreements and alliances can find themselves hostage to the whims of the moment.

“These are International Powers who only recognise STRENGTH, which is why the United States of America, under my leadership, is now, after only one year, respected like never before,” he wrote.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Neighbouring states warned of chaos if IS prisoners were freed from camp they regard as hotbed of extremism

Kurdish-led forces in Syria have announced a withdrawal from a detention camp in north-east Syria housing tens of thousands of Islamic State-linked detainees, as government forces continued to advance in the region.

The fate of al-Hawl, which houses among others the most radical of foreign women suspected to have been members of IS, and their families, is of great concern to neighbouring states and the international community. These states have for years warned that the camp is a hotbed of extremism and chaos could result if a jailbreak were to occur.

A smaller number of female detainees are held at al-Roj camp, including Shamima Begum, who was stripped of UK citizenship, further to the north-east and still under Kurdish control.

“Our forces were compelled to withdraw from al-Hawl camp and redeploy in the vicinity of cities in northern Syria that are facing increasing risks and threats,” a spokesperson for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said, calling the withdrawal a “failure of the international community”.

The Syrian government said it would assume control of the camp, accusing the SDF of leaving it without guards, allowing detainees to escape. It similarly accused the Kurdish-led force of doing the same in a prison in Raqqa, where 120 prisoners escaped – a claim the SDF denied.

The withdrawal came as the Syrian government swept through northeast Syria, making unprecedented gains as the SDF lost vast swathes of its territory in just a few days. The SDF lost Raqqa and Deir el-Zour on Sunday, as tribal elements defected from the Kurdish-led force and pushed it to withdraw from the Arab-majority areas.

The rapid advance of Damascus's forces and partial collapse of the SDF almost overnight was stunning: the Kurdish-led group had controlled nearly a third of the country, with US support, since 2019. It was the biggest shift in frontlines since the fall of the former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.

A 14-point ceasefire agreement signed on Sunday by the Syrian president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, and the head of the SDF, Mazloum Abdi, collapsed the next day after a disastrous meeting in Damascus.

However, on Tuesday night, the Syrian presidency announced a four-day ceasefire with the SDF so that the 14-point agreement could be implemented. It said that if an agreement were reached, the Syrian government will allow-Kurdish majority cities such as al-Hasakah and Qamishli to the Kurdish authorities, and that security forces will be drawn from local residents.

It also said Abdi would nominate a candidate from the SDF to be the deputy defence minister, MPs for the national parliament, and lists of names to be employed in the Syrian public sector.

The announcement seemed to stave off immediate further fighting between the two sides, and reassured Kurdish officials that their rights would be respected.

Syrian government sources had previously accused Abdi of trying to stall in implementing the 14-point agreement, which would turn over most of the Kurdish-led authorities' institutions and governance to Damascus. Ilham Ahmed, a senior leader of the Kurdish-led authority, said Abdi requested a five-day grace period to implement the agreement, which was initially rejected by Damascus.

“They wanted a direct handing over of everything to Damascus. However, with or without this meeting they wanted to go to war … and now their plan is to massacre the Kurds,” Ahmed said on Tuesday.

After the meeting, Kurdish officials, Abdi included, called for a general mobilisation across Kurdish-majority areas and to resist Damascus's advance towards their territory. SDF media published pictures of people, young and old, holding assault rifles seemingly in preparation for a further assault.

Clashes between the two sides continued on Tuesday, with shelling reported in Kobani – a Kurdish-majority area on the Turkish border, and Syrian government forces entering al-Hasakah.

The areas lost to Damascus's forces thus far were Arab-majority areas, where many residents had longstanding resentments against the SDF. The SDF has seemingly dug into areas closer to the borders with Iraq and Turkey, which are populated mainly by Kurds.

If the four-day ceasefire fails and Damascus's forces advance into Kurdish-majority areas, fighting is likely to be deadlier than in previous days. There they have infrastructure, including heavy artillery, drones and underground tunnel networks.

The Kurdish population view the fight as existential, and have pointed to the mass killings when Syrian government forces entered Sweida province and the Syrian coast last year as an example of what could happen to them if Syrian government forces took over the area.

The Syrian government said on Tuesday that it would not enter Kurdish areas, saying in a statement that the army's goal was “to restore stability and protect government institutions”.

The SDF was for years the US's biggest partner in Syria and together they defeated the IS “caliphate” in 2019. It is the military wing of a Kurdish statelet, an autonomous area that had its own institutions and government. Among other things, it protected Kurdish rights, which for years had been repressed by al-Assad and his father.

When al-Assad fell, the SDF and Damascus came to the negotiating table, with the former seeking to retain its autonomy and the latter wanting to consolidate control over the country. Despite the signing of an agreement to integrate the SDF into Syria's army on 10 March, the two sides remained at odds and occasionally clashed.

At the weekend, the US urged the Syrian government to halt its advance at the dividing line of the Euphrates River, but government forces pushed on. It has since stayed silent as the government continued its campaign against the SDF.

Damascus's advance over the last week has helped it extend control over most of the country, and crucially, the country's largest oil and gasfields, as well as key dams.

US support has seemed to shift towards Damascus over the past year. The US envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, urged the SDF to fully integrate into the Syrian state and said the current moment was an “opportunity for the Kurds in Syria.”

“The original purpose of the SDF as the primary anti-ISIS force on the ground has largely expired, as Damascus is now both willing and positioned to take over security responsibilities, including control of ISIS detention facilities and camps.” Barrack said in a post on X on Thursday.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Palestinian refugee agency compound is demolished, while teargas is fired at UN vocational school in West Bank

Israeli crews have started bulldozing the Jerusalem headquarters of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in Jerusalem and fired teargas at a UN vocational school in Qalandia, in the West Bank.

Israel accuses the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (Unwra) of collaborating with Hamas – a charge the agency denies – and last year banned it from operating on its territory. The demolition marks Israel's latest step against Unrwa, which provides aid to millions of Palestinian refugees.

Roland Friedrich, Unrwa's director in the West Bank, said the agency had been informed that demolition crews accompanied by police arrived at its East Jerusalem headquarters in the early hours of the morning. The facility had been largely unused for nearly a year because of security threats and incitement, he said, but Israeli forces nonetheless entered the compound, confiscated equipment and expelled the private security guards hired to protect the site.

An Israeli flag was seen hoisted above the facility in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood, where some Israeli politicians arrived on the scene to celebrate the organisation's fate. Israel's national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, called it “a historic day”.

Israel defended the move to demolish the compound, with the foreign ministry saying: “Unrwa-Hamas had already ceased its operations at this site and no longer had any UN personnel or UN activity there.”

It added: “The compound does not enjoy any immunity and the seizure of this compound by Israeli authorities was carried out in accordance with both Israeli and international law.”

But Friedrich called it a violation of international law guaranteeing such facilities protection and said: “What we saw today is the culmination of two years of incitement and measures against Unrwa in East Jerusalem.”

Founded in 1949, Unrwa's mandate is to provide aid and services to 2.5 million Palestinian refugees in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as 3 million more refugees in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. The group has for years maintained infrastructure in refugee camps, run schools and provided healthcare.

A few months after the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023, Israeli settlers and rightwing activists protested by blocking the entrances of the Unrwa office in Jerusalem and calling for the body's closure, following accusations by the government of collaborating with Hamas in Gaza, and with its staff facing a systematic campaign of obstruction and harassment by the Israeli military and authorities.

In 2024, according to the Wall Street Journal, a US intelligence report assessed with “low confidence” that a handful of Unrwa staff had participated in the attack, but indicated that it could not independently confirm the assessment's veracity.

Nevertheless, Unrwa's operations were curtailed last year when Israel's Knesset passed legislation severing ties and banning it from functioning in what it defines as Israel – including East Jerusalem.

Unrwa has recorded 382 colleagues killed by Israeli forces in Gaza since the start of the conflict.

The acts of sabotage against Unrwa ultimately culminated in the demolition on Tuesday. Videos showed Israeli bulldozers destroying the compound and the facilities inside the agency's headquarters.

“This comes in the wake of other steps taken by Israeli authorities to erase the Palestine refugee identity,” Philippe Lazzarini, Unrwa's commissioner general, said in a statement on X. “This must be a wake-up call. What happens today to Unrwa will happen tomorrow to any other international organisation or diplomatic mission, whether in the Occupied Palestinian Territory or anywhere around the world.”

The latest action comes amid a long-running political and financial campaign against the agency. The US cut funding to Unrwa in 2018 under Donald Trump, restored it in 2021 under Joe Biden, and then paused contributions again in 2024.
 Israel's ban on Unrwa has coincided with broader efforts to tighten controls on humanitarian organisations operating in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. New legislation requires nongovernmental groups to dismiss staff accused of activities deemed to “delegitimise Israel” or support boycotts, and to submit detailed staff lists as a condition for continuing operations.

Israeli authorities warned dozens of organisations – including Médecins Sans Frontières and Care – that their licences would expire at the end of 2025. Aid groups have described the measures as arbitrary, warning that further restrictions will fall most heavily on a civilian population already facing an acute humanitarian crisis.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

US President Donald Trump's dismantling of US foreign aid, which started a year ago yesterday, has caused the preventable deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and would contribute to millions more, researchers say.

Humanitarian efforts to fight diseases such as HIV, malaria and tuberculosis in some of the world's poorest nations have been massively disrupted since Trump froze US humanitarian aid immediately after being sworn in for a second term on Jan. 20 last year.

The freeze was initially said to be temporary, but in a cost-cutting spree advised by the world's richest person, Elon Musk, Trump eliminated 83 percent of programs by the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which was then dismantled.

Other major Western donors including Britain, France and Germany then announced deep cuts to their own aid budgets, compounding funding shortfalls for already reeling humanitarian efforts.

Researchers have since been working to estimate the impact of the cuts by the US, which previously contributed more than 40 percent of all global aid.

Given how crucial the funding had become to so many sectors in developing nations, most numbers are rough estimates based on modeling research.

The Impact Counter Web site estimates the USAID cuts have so far caused more than 750,000 deaths — more than 500,000 of them children.

That works out to be 88 people every hour, according to the analysis by Brooke Nichols, an infectious disease mathematical modeler at Boston University, which has not been peer-reviewed.

Different research conducted by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) forecasts that more than 22 million people could die from preventable causes by 2030 due to the US and European aid cuts.

The research is to be published in The Lancet Global Health journal, principal investigator Davide Rasella said.

Other research by the US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation last month said that 16 million additional children under the age of five would die by 2045 if the aid cuts become permanent.

The US funding cuts are the most significant setback in the fight against HIV in decades, UNAIDS has said.

While the Trump administration has said it resumed critical HIV services under its PEPFAR program, many people in developing nations have lost access to life-saving HIV drugs such as antiretrovirals.

Impact Counter estimates that more than 170,000 people, including more than 16,000 infants, have died due to the disruptions in PEPFAR funding.

A survey released yesterday found that the cuts have seriously affected the services of 79 community HIV organizations across 47 nations.

Access to drugs that prevent HIV transmission called PrEP has been halved in 80 percent of the organizations, according to the survey by Coalition PLUS and other groups.

The aid cuts are also “causing widespread and profound damage” to healthcare infrastructure in many nations, it added.

More than 48,000 people have already died from tuberculosis due to the cuts, according to Impact Counter, which projected the toll would rise to more than 2.2 million by 2030.

More than 160,000 children have died from pneumonia, 150,000 from malnutrition and 125,000 from diarrhea as a result of the cuts, it said.

Impact Counter also estimated that more than 70,000 people — three-quarters of them children — have died from malaria.

However, the true death toll of the slashed aid might never be known.

After the dismantling of USAID, many of the systems that once tracked deaths and diseases in developing nations simply “no longer exist,” said Caterina Monti, a coauthor of the ISGlobal study.

Sarah Shaw, advocacy director of the charity MSI Reproductive Choices, said that USAID funding was “like an iceberg.”

Underneath the visible parts — such as money for drugs — the US provided key funding for transportation, warehouses, software, training and education.

Monti gave the example of a child in a remote area suffering from diarrhea. The child not only needs access to a medical center with a supply of drugs — they need clean drinking water, proper sanitation and to be informed about the condition in the first place.

“It's a very complex system — if you cut one piece, then the other pieces won't work,” Monti said.

Shaw said that over the past year, many charities were able to find supplies still lingering in warehouses.

“But now all of that is gone,” she said. “Last year we were running on fumes — this year there will be no fumes.”

Taiwan has not been invited to attend Honduran president-elect Nasry Asfura's inauguration, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said yesterday, in response to questions about whether Taiwan would send officials to attend.

Honduras severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 2023, ending an 82-year relationship, and later established ties with China.

However, during Honduras' presidential election last year, two candidates — including Asfura — announced their intention to restore diplomatic relations with Taiwan if they were elected.

Asked whether Taiwan has been in contact with Asfura or if the government would send officials to attend his inauguration this month, Department of Latin American and Caribbean Affairs Deputy Director-General Lu Chao-jui (盧朝睿) said Taiwan does not have formal diplomatic ties with Honduras, so it has not been invited yet.

“MOFA consistently upholds transparency and openness when seeking engagement, without preconditions, with other countries, including Honduras,” he said at the ministry's weekly press conference.

The ministry will give its utmost effort and fully pursue any opportunity that allows Taiwan to contribute more to the world, raise its global profile and expand its international space, he added.

In other news, Lu said Paraguayan Minister of Health Maria Teresa Baran is to visit Taiwan from Monday next week.

Since she took office as health minister in 2023, Baran has consistently voiced her support for Taiwan's participation in international organizations at several international venues, including at the WHO Executive Board, the World Health Assembly and the Pan American Health Organization, he said.

During her visit to Taiwan next week, Baran is to meet with Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍), as well as visit the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the Centers for Disease Control, National Taiwan University Hospital and other healthcare-related facilities, he said.

“Her visit will undoubtedly deepen healthcare exchanges and friendly ties between our two nations,” he added.

CWA forecaster Cheng Jie-ren (鄭傑仁) said the first tropical depression of this year is over waters east of the Philippines, about 1,867km southeast of Oluanpi (鵝鑾鼻), and could strengthen into Tropical Storm Nokaen by early today.
The system is moving slowly from northwest to north, and is expected to remain east of the Philippines with little chance of affecting Taiwan,

Air Force Command Headquarters said that while it had pinned down the location of the black box, it was still searching for the aircraft's sole pilot, air force Captain Hsin Po-yi (辛柏毅).
Without providing details, the air force said it had located the black box days after detecting some intermittent signals and would now engage a team of professionals to retrieve it.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 20 that he's not planning to travel to Davos for the annual World Economic Forum, opting to stay in Ukraine after Russia's recent overnight attack poised to further deepen the energy crisis.

""Undoubtedly, I choose Ukraine in this case, rather than the economic forum, but everything can change at any moment,"" Zelensky told journalists. 

According to the president, he might consider attending Davos if there are prospects of reaching decisions about more air defense systems and energy assistance packages for Kyiv.

Russian troops launched a new mass attack on Ukraine targeting the country's energy grid and substations serving nuclear power plants overnight on Jan. 20 amid freezing temperatures. The attack left nearly half of Kyiv's apartment buildings — around 6,000 — without heating and triggered widespread power outages. At least one person was killed, and three others were injured.

Kyiv is also facing a lack of running water in several neighborhoods.

""For now, I have a plan to help people with energy issues,"" Zelensky said.

The Davos summit is expected to serve as a venue for ongoing talks between the Ukrainian and U.S. officials focusing on post-war security guarantees for Kyiv and economic cooperation.

Earlier in the day, the Ukrainian delegation, which includes President's Office Head Kyrylo Budanov, National Security Council Secretary Rustem Umerov, and David Arakhamia, leader of Zelensky's parliamentary faction, arrived in Davos. They met with national security advisers from France, Germany, and the U.K., Umerov said.

""Ahead are further meetings with partners on security guarantees, economic development, and the recovery of Ukraine,"" he added.

Zelensky said that the final stage remains to finalize the draft documents between Ukraine and the U.S. on the prosperity plan and security guarantees for Kyiv.

He didn't rule out a meeting with Trump in Davos in the coming days. 

""Meetings with America should always end with concrete results to strengthen Ukraine or to move closer to ending the war. And if the documents are ready, we will meet,"" Zelensky said.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. 

A Russian mass attack overnight on Jan. 20 killed and injured civilians across two Ukrainian regions, targeted substations serving nuclear power plants, and triggered widespread outages of electricity, water, and heating, local authorities said.

Russian forces attacked Kyiv Oblast and the capital, Kyiv, as well as Zaporizhzhia, Rivne, Odesa, Kharkiv, Poltava, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts with drones and missiles overnight, targeting critical and civilian infrastructure.

Russia launched 18 ballistic missiles, 15 cruise missiles, as well as 339 drones, including about 250 Shahed-type drones, against Ukraine overnight, primarily targeting Kyiv, the Air Force said on Jan. 20. 

Ukrainian air defense downed 27 missiles and 315 drones, according to the report. A Zircon anti-ship missile, known to travel considerably quicker than most cruise missiles, was named as among the weapons used by Russia. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Telegram that during the recent attack, Russian forces used ""updated tactics"" against Ukraine, though he did not specify what they were.

A death was reported in Kyiv's surrounding region overnight. Kyiv Oblast Governor Mykola Kalashnyk said a 50-year-old man was killed northwest of the capital. One person was injured in Kyiv's Dniprovskyi district, according to Mayor Vitali Klitschko.  

Two women, aged 67 and 76, were also injured in the overnight attack in the central-eastern city of Dnipro, the regional military administration reported on Jan. 20. 

One of Russia's main targets overnight was Ukraine's energy infrastructure, including facilities that support nuclear plants, escalating a fall-and-winter campaign aimed at plunging the country into darkness.

Substations connected to Ukraine's nuclear power plants were targeted, but Moscow failed to disconnect the plants, Vitaliy Zaichenko, the CEO of Ukraine's state-grid operator Ukrenergo, told the Kyiv Independent.

""The Russians were not successful. We were successful,"" Zaichenko said, adding that the protection around the substations is good.

The substations connect two nuclear plants, one in the western part and the other in the south, to Ukraine's energy grid. The country's three operating nuclear power plants are its main source of electricity generation as the country battles an energy crisis in subzero conditions. 

Following the strike, Zelensky held an emergency meeting with Ukraine's energy and defense officials to assess the damage and coordinate the response. 

The president said the most difficult situation remained in Kyiv, parts of Kyiv Oblast, and Kharkiv, where large numbers of residential buildings were left without heating.

Zelensky added that at least part of the missiles used in the attack were produced in 2026, underlining the urgent need for stronger sanctions enforcement against Russia.

Zelensky also said that just one day before the attack, Ukraine had finally received vital air defense missiles, which significantly bolstered its ability to repel the strike.

""Every support package matters. Missiles for Patriots, for NASAMS, and other air defense systems are critically needed,"" Zelensky wrote on Telegram. 

Following the attack, power outages have been implemented across the country to stabilize the embattled grid.

The strike on energy infrastructure left consumers in Kyiv and the surrounding region, as well as in Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk, Sumy, Rivne, and Kharkiv oblasts, without power, the Energy Ministry said.

Ukraine's largest private energy company, DTEK, said that more than 335,000 people lost electricity in Kyiv. At around 10 a.m. local time, power had been restored to 162,000 homes, while about 173,000 remained without service.

In Kyiv, 5,635 buildings remain without heating, or about 46% of the city's housing stock. Twelve buildings have been without heating since Jan. 9, when Russia also attacked the capital, Oleksii Kuleba, deputy prime minister for the restoration of Ukraine, said.

At the Smartass gym in central Kyiv, Operations Director Valeriia Bedim told the Kyiv Independent that since December 2025, the gym has been operating with a regular power outage schedule, after massive Russian attacks this month the situation has significantly worsened.

""For the first time since 2018, we were forced to temporarily close one of the gyms because the heating had been turned off for several days, and the temperature in the space had dropped to 3 degrees Celsius (37.4 degrees Fahrenheit),"" Bedim said.

Bedim added that people still go to the gym despite the Russian attacks and severe frosts because it helps them stay mentally fit.

Andriy Myroniuk, a gym client, said that he actually goes more often when there is shelling.

""The worse the night was, the sooner you have to go there,"" Myroniuk said.

Forty crews from Ukrainian Railways, also known as Ukrzaliznytsia, and 20 crews from other regions of Ukraine are working around the clock with city services to speed recovery after the attack on Kyiv, Kuleba added. 

The right bank of Kyiv, the western part of the city, is receiving water at reduced pressure, while about 3,500 homes on the left bank remain completely without water, according to the deputy minister.

At 4 p.m. local time in Kyiv, 4,000 high-rise buildings remained without heating, while 1,600 had it restored. The restoration effort is complicated because most of the buildings are being reconnected for the second time after the Russian strike damaged critical infrastructure on Jan. 9, according to Klitschko. 

Russia has damaged or destroyed much of the country's other generation plants, including thermal and combined heat and power plants. So far, it has refrained from directly striking nuclear plants in its campaign to destroy Ukraine's energy system.

Workers continue repairing damage and reconnecting homes across Ukraine.

Ukraine's military intelligence warned over the weekend that Moscow would attempt to sever the country's nuclear power by destroying critical substations. If it succeeds, it could risk a nuclear disaster, experts previously told the Kyiv Independent.

While the mass attack did not cut off the nuclear plants, Russia did hit power plants in Kyiv city. As a result, around 60% of the city was without power on the morning of Jan. 20, said Zaichenko.

Local officials announced changes to metro service due to a ""difficult energy situation"" in the capital.

Russian forces also ""cynically"" struck civilian infrastructure in southern Odesa Oblast, targeting residential areas and energy facilities overnight, regional governor Oleh Kiper said on Jan. 20. 

In western Rivne Oblast, which also suffered from the overnight attack, regional governor Oleksandr Koval reported on Jan. 20 that more than 10,000 consumers are left without power after a Russian attack on critical infrastructure. 

In Vinnytsia Oblast, Russian forces struck an energy facility, but no one was injured, regional Governor Natalia Zabolotna said.

Energy facilities in the city of Kharkiv were also damaged in the Russian attack. According to Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov, Russia has intensified missile strikes on local energy infrastructure in recent days, often hitting the same targets repeatedly.

""No matter what protective measures are taken, there is damage. And the more damage there is, the more time it takes for energy workers to restore everything,"" Terekhov added.

Dnipro Mayor Borys Filatov said a large boiler house was damaged in the recent attack on the city, leaving ""hundreds of homes"" without heating.

The first explosions of the overnight attack were heard in Kyiv around 2 a.m., Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground reported. At around the same time, the Air Force warned that Russian ballistic missiles were targeting the capital.

The Air Force soon afterwards issued additional ballistic missile warnings for Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, and Vinnytsia oblasts. The military then said Russia had launched MiG-31 bombers, carriers of Kinzhal hypersonic missiles. 

The Air Force later reported that a second wave of Russian drones was later seen approaching the city around 5 a.m. local time. Missile were also reported approaching the city around 6:30 a.m.

Earlier in the evening, groups of Russian drones triggered aerial alerts in Kyiv and the surrounding region, as well as in several other Ukrainian oblasts. Drone swarms were also reported targeting the city of Odesa and the surrounding region around 6 a.m.

Earlier on Jan. 19, Zelensky warned that Russia was planning a large-scale attack against Ukraine. 

""In the coming days we must remain extremely vigilant. Russia has prepared for a strike — a massive strike — and is waiting for the moment to carry it out,"" the president said.

Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal said Russia's attack would target energy infrastructure, including potential strikes on facilities serving Ukraine's nuclear power stations.

Kyiv's left-bank districts, home to about 1.1 million people by pre-war estimates, have borne the brunt of recent strikes and, like the rest of the city, are enduring the most difficult winter of Russia's full-scale war as Russia intensifies its campaign against energy facilities. 

Zelensky declared a state of emergency in the energy sector on Jan. 14 amid the escalating campaign.

Ukraine aims to ""kill 50,000 Russians per month,"" the country's new defense minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, said during a meeting with the media.

Laying out his plan in his new role, Fedorov said he had two priorities, the first of which is ""management.""

""Management must be built around those capable of achieving defined goals. If people don't demonstrate measurable results, they can't remain in the system,"" said.

""The second strategic objective is to kill 50,000 Russians per month,"" he said.

""Last month, 35,000 were killed; all these losses are verified on video. If we reach 50,000, we will see what happens to the enemy. They view people as a resource, and shortages are already evident.""

Moscow and Kyiv rarely officially report their own losses. Ukraine estimates that Russia's overall casualties during the full-scale war have surpassed 1,200,000.

Despite the heavy losses, Russia has been able to make marginal advances in Ukraine's front line region as it is able to offset its casualties through fresh contract soldiers. The Ukrainian open-source mapping project DeepState reported that Russian forces occupied 4,336 square kilometers (1,674 square miles) of Ukrainian territory in 2025, accounting for less than 1% of the country

In turn, Kyiv has faced increasingly serious manpower shortages, particularly among infantry units holding the front line. 

In a rare report, Fedorov said on Jan. 14 that two million Ukrainians are wanted for evading mobilization, and another 200,000 soldiers are absent without official leave (AWOL), as infantry units continue to struggle to refill heavy losses.

As of Jan. 17, Ukraine's General Staff estimates that Russia has lost 1,225,590 troops in Ukraine since the start of the war on Feb. 24, 2022, which includes those injured, killed, and missing. 

The numbers are largely in line with estimates made by Western intelligence agencies.

The Ukrainian parliament on Jan. 14 appointed Fedorov as defense minister.

Fedorov had previously served as deputy prime minister and digital transformation minister before replacing Shmyhal. The latter had led the Defense Ministry for less than six months.Under Fedorov's leadership, the Digital Transformation Ministry spearheaded multiple projects, including drone production. 

He also played a key role in launching Brave1, a project that links his ministry with the Defense Ministry to advance military tech.

Canada will not be paying a reported US$1-billion membership fee to participate in Donald Trump's “Board of Peace” Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne said Tuesday in comments that suggest Ottawa is still weighing whether to join.

Mr. Champagne, speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, would not say whether the fact that Mr. Trump had invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to join the “Board of Peace” would affect Canada's position.

Prime Minister Mark Carney on Sunday said he had agreed in principle to accept a Trump invitation to sit on the board, but Mr. Champagne told reporters a final decision on Canada's membership has yet to be made.

“As you know, we're still early days in what's going to be the terms of reference of that board, how it's going to operate,” the finance minister said.

Carney accepts Trump's invitation to join ‘Board of Peace' on future of Gaza, official says

“The Prime Minister will have to make the final decision when all the facts are known and all the details have been hammered out,” he said.

The “Board of Peace,” first introduced alongside the Trump-brokered peace plan for Gaza, was authorized by the United Nations Security Council through 2027, with a mandate solely focused on the Gaza conflict.

But according to a copy of an invitation letter and draft charter for the board, the organization would be chaired for life by Mr. Trump and would start by addressing the Gaza conflict and then be expanded to deal with other conflicts.

The board's focus on resolving conflicts globally has raised concerns that it could undermine the UN.

Prime Minister Mark Carney delivers a speech calling on middle powers to band together during the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday.Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press

Prime Minister Mark Carney said Tuesday that middle powers must stop pretending the rules-based international order is still functioning and instead build coalitions to survive.

He urged countries to start condemning economic coercion, even when practised by a great power ally – a clear reference to the United States.

The Prime Minister's speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Tuesday follows an extraordinary threat by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on European allies and Britain until Washington is allowed to acquire Greenland for strategic purposes.

The future of Greenland and the division this has sown among Western allies is dominating talk in Davos. While Mr. Carney's remarks were aimed at discussing the fallout from Mr. Trump's disruptive and protectionist tenure as president, he only named the United States once in the speech when he cited “American hegemony.”

What are the EU's options to counter U.S. on Greenland?

As one example of middle powers working together, Mr. Carney said Canada stands firmly committed to the collective defence of Greenland under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

“On Arctic sovereignty, we stand firmly with Greenland and Denmark and fully support their unique right to determine Greenland's future,” the Prime Minister said.

“Our commitment to Article Five is unwavering,” he said, referring to the collective defence chapter in the NATO treaty that states an armed attack against one or more members in Europe or North America is considered an attack against all.

Speaking at Davos, Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand declined to say whether Canada will send troops to Greenland in support of the Danish territory. 

“We regularly participate in NATO exercises, and we participate in exercises that the Canadian Armed Forces itself leads,” she said. “Regarding future deployments and future exercises, those are decisions that the Minister of National Defense makes, together with the chief of defense staff.”

 

The Associated Press

The rules-based international order is the post-Second World War system of global governance built on international law, norms, treaties and institutions such as the United Nations and World Trade Organization. It calls for the respect of state sovereignty, peaceful dispute resolution, free trade, human rights, and co-operation on challenges such as security and climate.

Mr. Carney invoked Czech writer Václav Havel, a dissident who later entered political life, to frame his argument about how middle powers are propping up the lie that the rules-based order still works.

“The rules-based order is fading,” he said.

For decades, he said, America as a superpower delivered benefits for many middle powers, such as open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security and support for dispute resolution frameworks.

This is changing, the Prime Minister said, without mentioning the United States by name.

“More recently, great powers began using economic integration as weapons. Tariffs as leverage. Financial infrastructure as coercion. Supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited,” he said.

Just as Mr. Havel described Soviet-era shopkeepers placing signs with Communist slogans in their windows to avoid trouble, participating in rituals they knew to be false, Mr. Carney argued that middle powers have similarly gone along with the fiction of a rules-based order that no longer protects them.

It is time for countries “to take their signs down,” the Prime Minister said. 

“Stop invoking the rules-based international order as though it still functions as advertised,” Mr. Carney said. “Call the system what it is: a period of intensifying great power rivalry where the most powerful pursue their interests using economic integration as a weapon of coercion.”

His sharpest words Tuesday were reserved for countries that only selectively criticize economic coercion.

“Apply the same standards to allies and rivals. When middle powers criticize economic intimidation from one direction but stay silent when it comes from another, we are keeping the sign in the window.”

Asked by the moderator after his speech whether NATO member countries are also pretending the transatlantic partnership is intact when it isn't, Mr. Carney said Greenland will be a test of the alliance. “I think clearly NATO is experiencing a test right now,” he said, adding the response should be to bolster the security of Greenland and the Arctic. 

On Tuesday, as he prepared to head to the World Economic Forum, Mr. Trump posted a photo of himself sitting in the Oval Office talking to European leaders that had been altered to show a map of the Western Hemisphere with American flags covering not only the United States but also Greenland, Canada, Cuba and Venezuela.

Mr. Carney, who last week struck a new strategic partnership with China's authoritarian leadership, championed in his Davos speech what he called “values-based realism” – a term borrowed from Finnish President Alexander Stubb – combining principled commitments to sovereignty and human rights with pragmatic engagement in a fragmented world. 

Mr. Carney's central argument was that middle powers must combine their strength rather than compete for favour with great powers. 

“If you are not at the table, you are on the menu,” Mr. Carney warned. “When we only negotiate bilaterally with a hegemon, we negotiate from weakness. We accept what is offered. This is not sovereignty. It is the performance of sovereignty while accepting subordination.”

The Prime Minister said middle powers need to build new institutions between them, strengthen their domestic economies, diversify their trade internationally and work together in coalitions, not bilaterally, when dealing with great powers.

“Rather than waiting for a great power to restore an order it is dismantling, create institutions and agreements that function as described,” he said.

“This is not naive multilateralism. Nor is it relying on diminished institutions. It is building the coalitions that work, issue by issue, with partners who share enough common ground to act together,” he said.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen delivers an address at Davos on Tuesday. Ms. von der Leyen pushed back against Mr. Trump's threats of 10-per-cent tariffs on European allies.Markus Schreiber/The Associated Press

Earlier in the day, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the World Economic Forum that the economic coercion Mr. Trump is threatening to acquire Greenland is a mistake and warned the European Union's response would be “unflinching, united and proportional.”

Ms. von der Leyen pushed back against Mr. Trump's threats of 10-per-cent tariffs on European allies, as well as Britain, until he is allowed to annex Greenland – and his warning that levies would rise to 25 per cent in June.

Mr. Trump, who has said there is “no going back” on taking Greenland is due to arrive at the World Economic Forum Wednesday. 

He has justified his demand to acquire Greenland by saying the strategically located island is vulnerable to takeover by China or Russia and that neither Denmark nor Greenlanders have the power to stop this.

Ms. von der Leyen said the EU shares the U.S. concern about safeguarding Greenland and is prepared to ramp up spending and protective measures there.

She said the “sovereignty and integrity” of Danish territory “is non-negotiable” and Brussels is working on a “massive European investment surge” in Greenland. 

“We will work with Greenland and Denmark hand in hand to see how we can further support the local economy and infrastructure,” she said. “We will work with the U.S. and all partners on wider Arctic security.”

Senegal's football team are champions of Africa, but fans from the country are banned from going to the US for the World Cup. They aren't the only ones, with Donald Trump's hostility and FIFA ticket prices hitting hard.

As soaked Senegal fans celebrated winning the Africa Cup of Nations in a Moroccan rainstorm on Sunday, thoughts and talk would likely have soon turned to a World Cup opener against France less than six months away.

The June 16 clash against their former colonial rulers, who Senegal memorably beat in the opening match of the 2002 World Cup, is in the New Jersey Stadium which will host the World Cup final. While the 300,000 strong Senegalese diaspora in France should ensure some fans are backing the African champions, those who hold only Senegalese passports will not be allowed in the US.

Senegal, like fellow AFCON participants Ivory Coast, were added last December to the list of countries banned from traveling to the US under a policy enacted by the Trump administration. 

""I think it's too strong. They've gone too far. The team can't play without its supporters — and there are some really fervent supporters who accompany the team everywhere at all times,"" Singom Dadji Ngam, a Senegal fan and social media personality, told DW during AFCON. ""It only affects Senegalese who have just a Senegalese passport. But they are the ones who follow the team in all the qualifying matches.""

The US has said the travel ban, which is lighter than that imposed on some countries, is because of a high overstay rate of about 4% for Senegal and 8% for Ivory Coast on B1 or B2 visitor visas, the type that would be used for a World Cup trip. Trump cited ""screening and vetting deficiencies"" as justification for the ban.

Aside from the two African sides, fans from fellow qualifiers Haiti and Iran will not be able to travel to the US, as they are subject to even more severe travel restrictions. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, also blacklisted, could yet qualify through the playoffs. Exceptions from the ban have been made for players and coaching staff, but not fans. A visa suspension for immigrants, rather than tourists, from 75 countries was also announced by the Trump administration last week. Senegal, Ivory Coast, Haiti, DR Congo and Iran are all among them.

Colombia and tournament co-hosts Mexico have also been recent targets of Trump's ire, while Denmark's reluctance to hand over Greenland to the US president may also make them a target should they qualify through the playoffs in March. Denmark's group games will be played in co-host Mexico, in any case, but knockout matches could fall in the US.

Tournament organizers FIFA, whose President Gianni Infantino has grown particularly close to Trump, have offered little in the way of assistance, stressing only that a match ticket ""does not guarantee admission to a host country"" in a recently-released statement. Nevertheless, the organizations claims it has received 500 million ticket applications from ""all 211 FIFA Member Associations"", presumably including those who are banned from traveling.

But for those who have spent time, money and effort following their national team, geopolitics should not be the determining factor in whether they can follow their team.

One Senegal fan told DW he believes his country should boycott the tournament. ""It's something that needs to be done. I think that people should retain their dignity because if these competitions are successful it's thanks to all those who take part in them, who give gas to them, who talk about them on social networks, who share them, who come to the matches to support their team,"" he said.

""If we're not accepted as supporters, our teams shouldn't go and neither should we as supporters. We should boycott and the others who support us in this should boycott with us. We are the strength of these competitions. Without spectators, there's no one. Without spectators, there is no sport, there is no entertainment.""

The cost of tickets is also a significant hurdle for fans from around the globe. Aside from a handful of tickets (less than 2% of the total allocation) belatedly offered to a small section of fans at low prices, prices are five times higher than the previous World Cup in Qatar in 2022.

Football Supporters Europe, a nonprofit members' association of supporters, said excluding the tiny selection of reduced tickets, fans faced paying an average of just under €7,000 ($8,000) to get tickets for all of their team's matches from the first game to the final. That's roughly five times more than they would have paid to do so at the last tournament in Qatar.

""Football is a popular sport and it should be accessible to everyone. Paying for super-expensive tickets to watch a match isn't something everyone can afford,"" one Ivory Coast fan told DW in Morocco. ""Disparities like this are not right. We're really not happy because what Trump has done is disgraceful. It's killing football.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Why Germany probably won't get political at 2026 World Cup","https://www.dw.com/en/why-germany-probably-wont-get-political-at-2026-world-cup/a-75504617","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 03:26:30 GMT","

After their very public protest at the last World Cup in Qatar, Germany's football team looks unlikely to do the same in the United States in 2026. 

The German national team's sporting director, Rudi Völler, stressed in a  weekly sports talk show recently, that while no gag order would be imposed on anyone, ""it cannot be that it's being talked about, practically on a matchday like with this disaster in Qatar.""

Völler was referring to the One Love armband debate in Qatar, which Germany – and several other nations – dropped at the last minute after FIFA threatened sanctions. Germany then protested ahead of the Japan game by posing for the team photo with their mouths covered.

Germany were met with a lot of criticism for their gesture in Qatar, but Jürgen Mittag, a professor of sports politics at the German Sport University Cologne, believes had they made the quarterfinals things might have been different.

""But as it was, they were met with a great deal of ridicule because they were symbolically strong but sportingly weak,"" Mittag told DW.

The hope is that in the United States of America, Canada and Mexico Germany will perform better on the field, but what does that mean for their stance off it?

Michael Mutz, a professor of social sciences in sports at the Justus-Liebig University Giessen, doubts that any political statement will be made.

""I can't imagine that the DFB (German Football Association) will actively pursue a political agenda against the host country again after the negative experiences in Qatar,"" Mutz told DW. 

""The DFB is exposing itself to accusations of double standards because it criticized the situation in Qatar so harshly and will now presumably remain silent about the US, but the association will have to accept that.""

Mittag believes Germany's postion is weakened by the current state of the European Union. The bloc is now further challenged by Donald Trump's new round of tariffs on six member states as well as the UK and Norway who sent troops or officials to Greenland — which Trump is intent on acquiring — for security purposes. 

""European democracy is also suffering a little... it is becoming increasingly fragmented and is therefore somewhat less capable of acting in foreign policy. This applies to the big picture as a whole, as well as to the internal sphere of football and other sports-related matters,"" Mittag explained before the tariffs, set to start on February 1, were announced.

""Germany has been very proactive in sports diplomacy in recent years, but has also found that although it plays a prominent role, it doesn't receive much support,"" Mittag added.

Mittag cites the example of Germany's stance on Russia and Belarus's return to the Olympics. Germany petitioned hard against this and tried to forge a strong alliance, but only received minimal support. Mittag believes this defeat has hurt them, and forced them to reconsider their approach.

""That's when Germany realized that it needs to pursue a different strategy. It doesn't want to give up its position, but placing too much emphasis on moral, value-based issue is strategically clumsy. So, in the end, it does not lead to success and then you even have to put up with scorn or schadenfreude when you perform poorly in sporting terms,"" Mittag explained.

Andreas Rettig, an outspoken sports executive who used to work at St. Pauli, was appointed as the new DFB's CEO in 2023 and may be the perfect person to forge new alliances and better position Germany in committees. Even he has come up against challenges though. Rettig's attempt to initiate a dialogue on critical issues ahead of the 2024 Euros was not met with much enthusiasm by regional associations.

""There has been a realpolitik shift in sports diplomacy, it's somewhat less value-based, somewhat more realistic and acting pragmatically in order to perhaps achieve more success than in the past,"" Mittag added.

The January protests against the Trump administration's clampdown on illegal immigration – including a decision by the US justice department not to launch a criminal civil rights investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on January 7 – have increased tensions in many places.

Given that Germany's viewership dipped for the World Cup in Qatar, it wouldn't be a surprise to see another drop this summer, particularly given the difficult kickoff times for European viewers.

""I believe that we will not see the same viewing figures as in previous World Cups,"" Mittag said.

""I would actually assume that broadcasting and media behavior will also reflect the fact that a lot of people in the summer of 2026 will say, 'I'm aware of this World Cup, but I'm not going to watch it all. I'm not as enthusiastic as in previous years, and in a small way, I'm expressing my criticism.'""

 What is clear is that the moment Germany touch down in the United States, players and staff will have to answer questions about playing a tournament in the current political and social climate. The strength of their answers will depend on many factors, but perhaps most of all on how well they play on the field.

""The decisive factor for identification with the national team is not so much the political situation as the fact that the DFB team is perceived as a likeable, approachable, and successful team,"" Mutz explained.

""Certainly, there is also a growing awareness in society that we are living in times of crisis and that political opinions are highly polarized. Especially in these times, the national football team could be an important anchor point for identification and the experience of belonging and community—across all social groups and political camps. However, football's ability to bring different people together is weakened when the national team is perceived as too political.""

The sun has ejected the largest solar radiation storm in over 20 years. The phenomenon caused auroras to light up the skies in some parts of the world. 

An intense geomagnetic storm triggered the possibility of northern lights being sighted across Canada and the northern half of the United States on Monday night, along with parts of Europe, including Germany, Switzerlandand Ukraine.

The solar storm — which is the largest in over two decades — is the outcome of a mass eruption of charged particles that left the sun on Sunday and are forecasted to arrive Monday and Tuesday, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

A geomagnetic storm is a major disturbance in Earth's magnetic field due to a solar storm. Monday night's storm was ""very rare,"" NOAA said.

The geostorm acquired G4 conditions at 7:38 p.m. GMT (1938 GMT) on Monday, putting it in the second-highest category, the agency added.

Spaceweather, an astronomy platform, reported that the ejection cloud covered the distance from the sun to the Earth in nearly 25 hours. Usually, a similar cloud would take three to four days to make the journey.

Shawn Dahl, a service coordinator at NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, said that the last solar radiation storm of this magnitude hit the Earth in 2003.

Solar radiation storms can risk affecting objects in space and satellite operations. The phenomenon could also cause issues with voltage.

On Monday Night, the northern lights —  also known as aurora borealis —  graced the skies in several parts of Germany, the German Weather Service (DWD) said.

The storm's strength led to the hues of Auroras being visible as far south as the Alps.

Meanwhile, in the US, the NOAA said those in northern and central states of the continental US ""can look for the aurora if at night and should weather conditions permit.""

The green, red and purple hues of the rare lights could also be visible as far south as Alabama to northern California, the agency added.

They toasted with warm red wine in plastic cups, passed around a stale conference room inside the US trade headquarters last May.

After four days locked in negotiations, British and American officials had finally secured the first trade deal of Donald Trump's second term.

They marked what at the time felt like the first of many breakthroughs with wine, tired smiles and a few leftover slices of pizza.

In reality, it was to be the high point of 2025 for the two governments.

Since then, the special relationship that the two world powers have always enjoyed has been tested in ways not seen before, strained by rows over free speech, and an unprecedented threat to annex Greenland.

Britain is teetering on the edge of irrelevance, as Mr Trump repeats that the US is the “hottest” country in the world, Britain appears to be rapidly cooling.

“The special relationship is intact, but it lacks depth between Starmer and Trump, and we are in danger of losing our relevance,” a senior British figure involved in the trade discussions said.

Despite the whirlwind year, complete with the much too late sacking of an ambassador, tariff wars and a state visit, Sir Keir Starmer has managed to hang on, for now, to the special relationship.

On his first day back in the Oval Office, Mr Trump sat behind the resolute desk facing a wall of reporters and declared that the United States needed Greenland for national security.

It was somewhat of a throwaway comment and the threat was lost in the deluge of news-worthy executive orders he was signing on Jan 20.

Yet, a year later, the demand has resurfaced – and it is pushing the US and UK's special relationship to its limit. Mr Trump has repeatedly said he would either like to buy the territory, or take it by force.

Mr Trump ratcheted pressure on the UK further on Tuesday morning, calling the deal to hand back the Chagos islands ‘an act of stupidity', and cited it as a reason why America should take control of Greenland.

Sir Keir's decision to side firmly with Denmark, along with other Nato allies, over Greenland irked the president.

A source close to Mr Trump said that “Britain has to step up”.

“Trump will wonder why it is not stepping up to get a deal done [on Greenland],” they added.

Sir Keir has spent most of Mr Trump's first term trying to convince him that the alliance, and European security, was more than just transactional.

Adopting a strong but friendly approach, the Prime Minister led the Coalition of the Willing in persuading the president that Volodymyr Zelensky was serious about peace.

The war in Ukraine became a sticking point between Washington and London. Almost immediately upon returning to office, Mr Trump upended US policy, blaming Mr Zelensky for the conflict and calling him “a dictator without elections”.

Diplomats in Washington and officials in London privately talked of the uphill battle to sway the president's mind.

“The special relationship has frayed, but the president likes Starmer,” a confidant of Mr Trump's said.

“When he comes in [to the White House] they spend private time together. He talks to people about Starmer all the time. He talks about him looking the part.”

The source added: “Trump thought Boris [Johnson] was trying to outsmart him with his language, and that doesn't play well with him.”

Yet for all of Mr Trump's dismissals of Europe, the capture of a sanctioned oil tanker on Jan 7 was a reminder that the special relationship could not be disregarded.

British forces helped the US seize a sanctioned oil tanker heading to a Russian port, fleeing Venezuela following the stunning capture of the country's leader, Nicolás Maduro.

UK spy planes and ships supported the US Coast Guard and special forces to take control of the Russian-flagged Marinera vessel, which was in Icelandic waters.

The operation would not have been achieved without UK assistance.

As one British official put it, “when the US came calling asking to help seize a tanker, they weren't moaning about free speech”.

Crouched low in front of the cameras, Sir Keir reached down to retrieve the freshly-inked paper containing the terms of the UK-US trade deal.

It had been signed moments earlier at the G7 in Canada, but as Mr Trump opened the leather-bound folder containing the final terms, they fluttered to the floor.

Sir Keir scrambled around on the concrete for the sheets.

Trade tensions flared almost immediately in 2025 when the president reinstated the full 25 per cent tariff on British steel imports and increased levies on aluminium coming into the US to 25 per cent.

It was a nightmare scenario for Britain's steel sector, which was already facing existential headwinds.

The UK sells around 200,000 tons of steel each year to the US, worth over £400m.

Britain was no longer guaranteeing preferential treatment and was being treated like any other country staring down the barrel of Mr Trump's wrath.

And so, Sir Keir found himself at the White House making Britain's case for a favourable trade deal ahead of the president's “liberation day” announcement.

The Prime Minister stepped into the Oval Office armed with a letter from the King, tucked neatly into his jacket pocket.

In the other was the framework for a trade agreement.

The timing could not have been better. The president desperately needed to sign and seal his first agreement before he entered negotiations with Beijing in June.

His tariff strategy, after all, was aimed at reducing global reliance on China.

Diplomats were locked in a boardroom at the United States Trade Representative's office, next door to the White House, for four days.

Jamieson Greer, the president's trade envoy, was firm. Working as a trade lawyer before joining the administration, the deal became his Super Bowl, the opportunity he had long dreamed of, balancing global trade and decoupling the world from Beijing.

“Their guys were tough. Jamieson was a tough negotiator but consistent,” a source close to the negotiations said.

On May 8, the two sides signed a limited Economic Prosperity Deal, the first during Mr Trump's return to office. The US agreed to remove its 25 per cent tariffs on UK exports, and levies on cars were slashed to 10 per cent for up to 100,000 vehicles annually.

Yet, for all the smiles, there was friction beneath the surface.

Mr Greer had stood firm, and Britain failed to secure the immediate lifting of all tariffs on steel.

By year's end, resentments festered. The UK's Scotch whisky industry remained hit by US duties with no resolution. Meanwhile, the issue of American chlorinated chicken and the insistence that Britain open up its supermarkets to US meat remained.

“There is a certain amount of frustration in the air between the US and UK felt by both sides on the trade issue,” Duncan Edwards OBE, the chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, explained.

“There is a lot of frustration and ambiguity. I think the UK and US would say both are hard to work with at the moment. Both sides are frustrated. Meanwhile, the tariffs are staying.”

The transatlantic culture wars burst into the open in February when JD Vance, the vice-president, delivered a blistering speech at the Munich Security Conference.

To a stunned hall, Mr Vance declared that free speech in Britain was “in retreat” while questioning if Europe still shared America's values.

The venue, full of European officials, was shocked into silence.

Mr Vance's diatribe was the prologue for an unprecedented scenario: an American administration linking free speech conditions to its trading and diplomatic relationship with Europe.

In March, the rift came to the fore in Britain. The US state department publicly expressed “concern about freedom of expression in the UK” as it monitored the case of Livia Tossici-Bolt, a British anti-abortion campaigner on trial for breaching a clinic buffer zone.

At the time, a source familiar with the trade negotiations warned that there would be “no free trade without free speech”.

British officials maintain that the issue was not raised during trade negotiations.

Seemingly appalled by the case of Ms Tossici-Bolt, Mr Trump took the unusual step of dispatching officials from the United States to Britain on a secret free speech fact-finding mission.

Led by Samuel Samson, a senior adviser in the state department, they met with anti-censorship campaigners, including those protesting Ofcom's new powers to police social media posts under the Online Safety Act.

The law gives Ofcom, the technology regulator, sweeping powers to issue huge fines to companies of up to £18m or 10 per cent of a company's global revenue, whichever is greater, for failing to protect users from illegal content and harmful material.

By spring, according to insiders, the British Embassy in Washington wrote to London, warning that free speech was becoming a “sleeper issue” with the administration.

But the warnings were not heeded. The Prime Minister, insiders say, had become distracted by swelling rebellions among backbenchers who were reportedly plotting to oust him.

“Sir Keir's priority now is how to deal with backbenchers, not the US administration,” a British official with knowledge of the discussions said.

And the Prime Minister's Cabinet cannot seem to agree on how to approach Mr Trump either.

“Yvette Cooper seems keener than David Lammy in demonstrating more independence from Mr Trump in foreign policy,” the British official said.

Meanwhile, Elon Musk, the owner of X and an on-again-off-again ally of the president, has used his platform to bash Sir Keir's Government over the issue of censorship.

No single case cut through more than that of Lucy Connolly, the wife of a conservative councillor who was jailed for 31 months in October after pleading guilty to a charge of inciting racial hatred over a social media post about the Stockport killer.

Her case was raised with Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state.

She claimed to have been blocked from entering the United States by the British Government, despite an invitation from the state department. She had meant to be making the trip with Nigel Farage, the Reform leader, who instead came alone.

The free speech dispute had become a question of shared values by the two governments.

Number 10 had been used to White House criticism, on issues like defence spending and trade, not civil liberties.

Diplomats insist it is only a war waged by those eager to raise their profile in the president's administration, and that free speech issues have never been raised in high level discussions.

The headache spilled over into 2026 when US officials said UK government staff faced being banned from America if they went ahead with threats to block X over its AI service Grok creating naked images of women and children.

“The Westminster establishment and the US have had a shift in values that has been ongoing for years, a source close to the administration said. “Obviously, the special relationship would cease if the UK banned US tech giants.”

Since the Online Safety Act came into effect last year, Ofcom has written to several American firms ordering them to conform to the act in letters seen by The Telegraph.

It has caused outrage from US lawmakers and legal experts, who say the overreach is a threat by the UK to silence American companies and citizens.

The Digital Service Tax (DST), a two per cent levy on big tech revenues, also irked figures in Washington, who saw it as a free speech tax designed to punish American tech companies.

Officials later pulled the landmark tech deal amid concerns the Online Safety Act would stifle American artificial intelligence companies.

“The perception is that Britain is way out there on attempting to police what is said online, and it's caused real concern,” a source with knowledge of the decision to suspend the deal said.

Washington is concerned that Britain has a China problem.

Beijing's plans to build a super-embassy in London became something of a flashpoint.

Despite widespread concern among security experts and MPs, Sir Keir's Government edges towards approving China's 870,000 sq ft “mega-embassy” complex.

American politicians, from Congress and the state department, openly urged Britain to block the project. When The Telegraph published unredacted plans revealing a secret room, the White House said it was “deeply concerned”.

A senior Trump administration official raised fears that China could exploit the UK's critical infrastructure.

Britain's attempt to balance security concerns with diplomatic outreach to China, while also complying with American demands to reduce reliance on Chinese products, has not gone unnoticed.

American diplomats have been raising concerns about Sir Keir's China policy privately.

When the China spy case against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry collapsed, tongues were set wagging within the walls of the White House and Congress.

But nothing set tongues wagging more fervently than Lord Mandelson's appointment as ambassador to the US. Shortly before his arrival, a dossier detailing alleged links to China was reportedly handed to the FBI.

Two senior members of Mr Trump's cabinet expressed concerns about the Labour peer's relationship with China before he was appointed.

Asked during his state visit if he sympathised with Lord Mandelson over the nature of his sacking on Sept 11, Mr Trump replied: “I don't know him.”

Mr Trump's previous friendship with Epstein has cast a long-shadow over his second term.

There is no suggestion that Lord Mandelson or Mr Trump were involved in any criminal behaviour.

Perhaps the biggest flashpoint in US-UK relations of the year came not between Sir Keir's Government and the White House, but Britain's state broadcaster.

In a bombshell expose, The Telegraph revealed that the BBC's flagship investigative programme, Panorama, had spliced together parts of an address given by Mr Trump on Jan 6 2021.

The clip implied Mr Trump had implored supporters to attack the US Capitol building. In fact, the edit omitted his calls for people to march “peacefully”.

When the broadcaster refused to pay damages, Mr Trump told The Telegraph that he would launch legal action for up to $5bn (£3.7bn). Tim Davie, the director-general, and Deborah Turness, the chief executive of BBC News, both resigned.

Legal experts doubt Mr Trump can win his defamation case lodged in a Florida court.

But the revelations were a headache for Sir Keir. The US president had been personally aggrieved by Britain's flagship broadcaster.

It was a trip that pulled out all the diplomatic stops; a military procession and a sprawling state banquet attended by MPs and businesspeople.

Mr Trump's state visit to the UK was a masterclass in handling the president, an Anglophile and royal superfan.

During the state banquet, Mr Trump described his second state visit to the UK as “truly one of the highest honours of my life”.

In a lavish tribute to King and country, he said the word “special” does not “begin to do it justice” to the relationship between America and Britain, whose bonds are “priceless and eternal”.

Private talks with the monarch in the wings of Windsor Castle had proved to be “very important” in swaying his hawkish position on Ukraine.

A source involved in organising the visit said: “They [the royals] are a part of the fabric, why would we not use them?”

Another close to the president described the impact of the trip on Mr Trump personally.

“You can't say enough how much he loves the royals,” they said.

“The King talks to him like an adult, and he loves it. He loves Charles. During the state visit, even with the bad weather, he wanted to stay for three more hours. Expect more of that.”

Mr Trump's royal obsession provided a crucial safety net for the special relationship.

But with the threat of annexation looming and Nato in turmoil, is there enough rope in the special relationship left to give?

During the winter, coughing becomes one of the most common reasons for clinic visits. Many people mistake a persistent cough for an unresolved cold, turning to over-the-counter medications or throat lozenges, only to see little to no improvement. Meanwhile, in some cases, symptoms may worsen.

In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), treating a cough begins with identifying the pattern and determining whether it is caused by cold or heat, or by external factors or internal imbalances.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

DANIEL W. DREZNER is Academic Dean and Distinguished Professor of International Politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and the author of the newsletter Drezner's World.

 The Unconstrained Presidency and the End of American Primacy

 Daniel W. Drezner and Elizabeth N. Saunders

For most Americans and Europeans alive today, a world of anarchy probably never felt quite real. Since 1945, the United States and its allies crafted and maintained an order that while neither fully liberal nor fully international, established rules that kept the peace among the great powers, promoted a world of relatively open trade, and facilitated international cooperation. In the decades that followed, the world became more stable and prosperous.

Before that long great-power peace, however, anarchy was far from an abstraction in the developed world. The first half of the twentieth century alone featured two world wars, a global depression, and a deadly pandemic. With weak global rules and weaker enforcement mechanisms, most states had little choice but to fend for themselves, often resorting to military force. But there were still limits to what sovereign states might do in a conflict. Countries were only just beginning to project military power beyond their borders, and information, goods, and people traveled less rapidly. Even during periods of international disorder, states could do only so much to one another without risking their own demise.

Today, the most powerful country is leading the world into a different kind of anarchy. Although U.S. President Donald Trump did not single-handedly bring about the decline of the post-1945 order, he has, in his first year since returning to office, accelerated and even embraced its demise. Trump's appetite for territorial expansion eviscerates the most powerful post-1945 norm: that borders cannot be redrawn through the force of arms. And his disregard for domestic institutions has allowed him to run roughshod over any attempts at home to check those foreign expansionist dreams.

The anarchy that is emerging under Trump, in other words, is more chaotic. It is closer to the more primitive anarchy of the political philosopher Thomas Hobbes—a world of “all against all,” where sovereign power cannot be challenged domestically or internationally. In this Hobbesian order, driven by a leader who rejects any constraints on his ability to act and who is emboldened by technology to move at a whirlwind pace, anything goes. Order may well eventually emerge from this anarchy, but that order is unlikely to be led by—or to benefit—the United States.

Let's start with what anarchy is—and what it is not. Most realist scholars of international relations take anarchy to be the starting point of their theories, and the Trump administration itself says that its policies are informed by a realist understanding of the world. Realists define anarchy simply as the absence of authority in the international system. Without any authority enforcing the global rules of the game, countries can rely only on their own power and strategy to survive. As the political scientist Kenneth Waltz put it, the international system is one of self-help. In a world of anarchy, war is a normal part of international relations.

But anarchy does not mean chaos. Realists contend that the absence of a central authority does not necessarily mean constant disruptions to the international system. Anarchy also functions as a powerful constraint, forcing states to act prudently and husband their resources. The risk of war can cause even great powers to think twice about taking aggressive actions so as to avoid triggering a balancing coalition. The realist political scientist Charles Glaser has argued that such a worldview is not necessarily pessimistic and that countries could engage in self-help through cooperation.

Realists therefore believe that order and stability are possible in an anarchic world. Indeed, although realists themselves still debate what pursuing a realist foreign policy means, they agree that anarchy should not mean abandoning strategy or taking every opportunity to fight or meddle in other countries' affairs.



One of the most prominent theories of the way order emerges from anarchy is “hegemonic stability theory,” or the idea that the international system is more stable when one country dominates. For example, the political scientist Robert Gilpin argued that the hegemonic state provides international public goods such as monetary institutions or security alliances, creates and enforces rules (which usually benefit the hegemon), and facilitates economic exchange and cooperation. Such hegemonic orders, Gilpin argued, emerge from global wars and were destined to eventually fall as the old hegemon overexpanded and new powers rose and challenged for global dominance.

At first glance, this story seems to describe the current moment quite well. One could argue that the United States reached the point of what the historian Paul Kennedy famously called “imperial overstretch” long before Trump. The costly, failed invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq stretched American military power almost to its breaking point. A rising China, meanwhile, is challenging the United States for global leadership, technological supremacy, and economic dominance. In this view, Washington's best bet is to conserve its resources, maintain its network of allies and partners, and prepare itself for the potential clash with its challenger.

Indeed, many observers thought the Trump administration would refocus on China, including by pulling resources out of Europe and the Middle East. Although Trump did not inherit a peaceful international environment, he still had time to act: even with wars in Ukraine, Gaza, and Sudan raging on, no global war had erupted, and Washington had partners in Europe to help stop Russia, the closest thing to a revisionist great power, from conquering Ukraine following its full-scale invasion in 2022. The United States still had a powerful network of allies, a competent and extensive diplomatic apparatus, and the strongest scientific research base in the world.

In one year, however, Trump has undone most of those advantages, gutting or surrendering them despite their value to the United States in its competition for great-power dominance. In their place, he has embraced extraction, corruption, and transactional arrangements he can revise at will.

Over the past year, Trump has halted efforts to preserve what is left of the U.S.-led order, picked unnecessary and increasingly dangerous fights with crucial allies, and undermined the very foundations of U.S. power. Russia's war in Ukraine, in which Trump seems to have little interest, and the competition with China, on which the Trump administration's latest National Security Strategy is largely silent, represent the most serious threats to the U.S.-led liberal order. Yet the U.S. military is swarming the Caribbean and moving a carrier from the South China Sea to the Mediterranean after protests in Iran. Trump's threats to the sovereignty of Greenland and Denmark—and with it, his evident willingness to blow up NATO—have needlessly antagonized European countries who are otherwise eager to allow Washington the kind of access most countries could only dream of.

The result is a declining hegemon that is not trying to maintain its position but rather is becoming a revisionist power. The United States is injecting aggression into the system, seemingly for its own sake, while reducing the capabilities that helped create and maintain the order from which it benefited. As Oona Hathaway and Scott Shapiro have argued in Foreign Affairs, Trump is creating a world in which “not only would the rules be unpredictable, they would depend entirely on the impulses of whoever happens to command the most coercive power at a given moment.”

The world Trump is creating is not the anarchy that contemporary realists write about, in which states must make prudent choices about when and where to act, with whom and against whom to ally, and how and how much to impose their will on others. In that world, order remains possible. Trump, by contrast, makes critical decisions with little to no process at seemingly random times—unprompted by emergencies. By seizing the tools of hegemony, Trump is acting aggressively in multiple regions at the same time, at a speed that no previous great power could contemplate. Over the course of just one week in January, the Trump administration executed a military mission in Caracas to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, issued threats to its NATO allies about seizing Greenland, and surged the deployment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to Minneapolis despite widespread protests.

No other hegemon in history has had the power projection capabilities the United States still possesses or the communicative speed and reach made possible by the digital age. In the next month, it is just as possible that Trump will decide to bomb Iran again—or to cut a deal with Iran's clerics to win oil concessions. Maybe he will reaffirm the U.S. commitment to NATO—or invade Greenland. If unpredictability has any value as a geopolitical tactic, it must be used strategically and sparingly. Trump's mercurial impulses, on which he can act more quickly and easily than any leader in history, represent a new level of chaos.

The new Trumpian anarchy is different in another important way: at no other point in history has a dominant power that was for centuries a consolidated (if never complete) democracy so quickly started to backslide and unwind its democratic institutions. The United Kingdom, for example, slid from its great-power status as it became more democratic in the nineteenth century, not less. Today, the United States is ripping up the old international rules and attempting to tear down its domestic institutional constraints and foundations of power in the span of one dizzying year.

In this way, Trump's world view is closer to Hobbes's understanding of anarchy than that of the realists. Although most realists think of Hobbes as part of their intellectual tradition, his vision of order extended deeper into the domestic realm than most realists care to go. He famously described anarchy as a war of “all against all,” in which life is “nasty, brutish, and short.” Less well known is his belief that for a commonwealth to survive in such a brutal world, a sovereign has to be able to exercise nearly unconstrained power at home. Hobbes disdained any separation of powers or any domestic agglomeration of power outside the sovereign himself.

In the first year of his second term, Trump has tried to consolidate both international and domestic authority. At the international level, he has made it clear that he does not believe himself to be constrained by any form of international law or norm. In an interview with The New York Times, he declared his own morality to be the only constraint on his actions. “I don't need international law,” he told reporters. His administration has acted accordingly. Shortly after his confirmation, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth fired the military's top lawyers, making it clear that he believes legal limitations on warfighting to be a hindrance to U.S. power. Hegseth now stands accused of violating international law after the United States' strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and the operation to remove Maduro in Venezuela.

Trump has also taken steps to eliminate domestic constraints on his power. During his first term, Trump chafed against a number of domestic bulwarks against his impulses and policy preferences: Congress, the judiciary, and even the so-called adults in the room within his own administration. In his second term, however, Trump has ignored, bypassed, or bulldozed over any legal or institutional restraints. With little in the way of opposition from Congress or the Supreme Court, he has declared ten different states of emergency during his first year in office on matters as varied as energy, immigration, and the International Criminal Court, actions that enhance the power of the executive. He has enacted a tariff regime of dubious constitutional provenance in an attempt to remake the global economy and rebuild the U.S. manufacturing sector. He has deployed federal officers and National Guard troops in cities in direct defiance of local leaders' wishes to accelerate his mass deportation campaign. He has fired and attempted to fire executive branch officials previously believed to be independent from presidential prerogative. He has weaponized the Department of Justice to pursue his political vendettas. And he has assaulted the foundations of national power, slashing funding for scientific research and diplomatic expertise.

In June, one of us (Saunders) argued in Foreign Affairs that the United States has the foreign policy of a personalist dictatorship. Today, both domestically and internationally, the president of the United States acts with few constraints. The residents of the United States now find themselves subject to the same Hobbesian anarchy that Trump has unleashed on the rest of the world. Judges, juries, and citizens are pushing back and may ultimately deny Trump the consolidated autocracy he appears to seek. But rebuilding trust in U.S. institutions at the domestic level, much less the international level, will be a difficult and lengthy process.

The political scientist Alexander Wendt once argued that “anarchy is what states make of it.” The Trump administration has seized the vast powers granted to the president of the still dominant United States to make a version of anarchy that is Hobbesian all the way down. It has called its strategy “peace through strength” and declared a foreign policy of “flexible realism,” which its authors understand as being “realistic about what is possible and desirable to seek in its dealings with other nations.”

Trump's supporters would argue that this approach has enhanced U.S. hegemony. Indeed, with his manic actions around the world, Trump has highlighted all the advantages the United States has accrued over the course of the American century. His administration, however, is using them in ways no realist would advise.

The foundations of American power are rooted in the rule of law at home and credible commitment abroad, the very things that Trump has attempted to dismantle. Trump's gutting of foreign aid and the infrastructure of U.S. scientific and technological dominance, his dangerous confrontation with stalwart European allies, and, most damaging of all, his use of the military and federal security forces to consolidate his domestic authority will, in the long run, undermine American power. Estranged allies are already reaching out to China and one another to hedge against an erratic United States. Whether these actions succeed or not, they weaken the United States and make China relatively more attractive for smaller powers seeking security. In Trump's zero-sum global order, it is the United States that will eventually pay the price.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

This article is adapted from the CEPA report “War Without End: Russia's Shadow Warfare

 NATO Must Escalate to De-escalate 

 Samuel Greene and Christopher Walker

Russia is prosecuting a war that knows no borders. Ukraine is the open front, but the objective is larger: to defeat a coalition of adversaries, including all of Europe and the Russian opposition figures that have taken refuge there. As a result, Moscow is carrying out repeated attacks on both people and infrastructure within NATO's borders. What might once have been described as “hybrid operations” or “active measures” across Europe have become nakedly kinetic, aimed not to persuade but to destroy critical systems and the continent's willingness to fight. Welcome to shadow warfare: a concerted campaign of physical assaults designed to degrade an adversary without provoking military reprisals.

The list of Russian shadow attacks grows longer each month. Moscow's drone fleets have shut down busy airports in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, and Norway and forced these countries to scramble their jets. Downed Russian drones have damaged property in Poland. Russian-linked ships have dragged their anchors across the Baltic Sea, disrupting vital energy and telecommunications links. Explosive devices planted by Russian operatives have disrupted European railways and logistics depots. Senior European defense-industry leaders have only narrowly escaped assassination attempts. Several Russian exiles have been less fortunate.

With each new act of shadow warfare, the risk of escalation grows. If the West wants to prevent all-out war with Russia, it must therefore begin imposing meaningful consequences. This will require a clearer consultation mechanism within NATO, more cooperation between allies to identify attacks, and a clearer menu of responses, including intelligence and cyber operations that disrupt Russian networks, hair-trigger economic and political penalties, and limited but overt military measures when attacks endanger lives or critical systems.

Moscow already understands itself to be at war with the West, not just over Ukraine but also over the survival of the Putin regime. The Kremlin sees all Western measures—including support for Kyiv, the imposition of sanctions, and the provision of safe harbor to the Russian exiled opposition—as an integrated challenge to its own power. Given that Russian President Vladimir Putin sees the stakes of this conflict as existential, Moscow does not compartmentalize its invasion of Ukraine from covert strikes on Europe and attacks on Russian dissidents abroad. In the Kremlin's view, these are three fronts in the same war.

Russia pursues shadow aggression because it fears all-out warfare against a more powerful adversary. Moscow knows that when kinetic attacks are carried out below the threshold of what European policymakers and publics usually consider to be war, it can exploit Western inertia and confusion. Western powers struggle to detect an attack, determine its source, and gauge its importance. As a result, their responses almost always come late. These delays weaken deterrence by severing the causal link between actions and consequences.

Europe's responses are also weak—limited to rhetoric, sanctions, and visa restrictions that do little to scare off Russia. Even as NATO tracks Russian attacks and attempts to coordinate responses, the alliance and its members often default to treating these incidents not as matters of collective or national defense but as problems best taken up by traditional law enforcement agencies. For example, European governments have generally treated sabotage of undersea communications and energy cables in the Baltic and North Seas as a maritime safety or criminal issue, delaying NATO consultation even when vessel behavior, timing, and targeting patterns strongly suggest hostile state action. Similarly, the Europeans have handled cases of arson, infrastructure disruption, and surveillance linked to Russian proxy networks across Europe primarily with arrests and prosecutions, foiling specific plots but leaving Moscow's broader campaign unaddressed at the alliance level. Treating coordinated campaigns of shadow aggression as isolated crimes has thus weakened deterrence by signaling European caution rather than determination.



There is, of course, a reason why the continent has kept to ambiguous responses. It wants to communicate that Europe is not, in fact, at war, and thus avoid escalation. But it still feeds the Kremlin's narrative of victimhood, which in turn fuels its aggression. Each new sanction or public condemnation confirms Moscow's perception of being under permanent siege. Russian authorities perpetuate the idea that the country has no choice but to invest in the aggressive capacity of its security services, which are ultimately responsible for executing shadow warfare.

Moreover, each ambiguous response on the part of the West raises Moscow's tolerance for risk, increasing the chance of escalation. Without consistent, harsh responses from its adversaries, the Kremlin sees an open field, limited only by its own imagination and resources. Little wonder, then, that Russia is intensifying its shadow war activities. According to research by the International Institute for Strategic Studies and the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Russian shadow war incidents in Europe increased nearly threefold between 2023 and 2024, after a fourfold increase the preceding year.

The dangers of this situation are clear. Eventually, Moscow will miscalculate. Russian drones might inadvertently down a passenger plane, much as a Russian missile did over Ukraine in 2014. A cyberattack could cause a critical health-care or heating system to collapse. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, would die not in Ukraine but in a NATO member state. The pressure for Europe to respond with force would then be enormous. A shadow war designed to avoid open conflict could end up triggering one.

Traditional Western approaches to countering shadow warfare are clearly not up to the task. The standard playbook emphasizes resilience building through redundancy, crisis management, and damage mitigation; intelligence sharing with allies; sanctions against the adversary; and disruptions of espionage and organized crime networks that provide financing, logistics, recruitment, and deniability. But that approach remains grounded in a deterrence logic that misunderstands the system it is trying to deter. Western policymakers must accept a hard truth: retaliation through legalistic measures does not work. Neither does focusing on strengthening defenses.

Instead, Moscow must be made to fear that its mistakes will prove far more costly. Europe needs to ensure that Russia believes that continued shadow warfare will cause it to lose the war, both in Ukraine and with Europe more broadly, and potentially prompt the regime's collapse. That requires clear thresholds for what kinds of actions will trigger alliance consultation and responses, credible countermeasures, and a readiness to act swiftly and predictably.

The NATO alliance should first agree to clear thresholds for Article 4 proceedings, which any member can initiate if it believes that “the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened.” Consultations should be the norm in response to shadow aggression rather than the exception. Since NATO's founding, in 1949, Article 4 has been invoked only nine times and only twice in response to Russian shadow warfare—when Russian warplanes and military drones invaded Estonian and Polish airspace last September. Such consultations should become the norm even when Russia operates through arms-length proxies and deniable networks.



European states must then work through both NATO and the European Commission to set up responses that are sufficient not just to dissuade or disrupt further attacks but also to degrade Russia's capabilities. These should include automatic cyber and intelligence operations against Russian military and security services involved in sabotage and proxy activity. They should also include expanded maritime and air interdiction of vessels and aircraft linked to covert Russian operations and the rapid imposition of economic and logistical penalties that directly constrain Moscow's warfighting capacity rather than symbolic sanctions.

When shadow attacks endanger lives or inflict major damage on critical infrastructure (such as undersea cables, energy facilities, civilian telecommunications networks, or transportation hubs), NATO's menu of options must also include proportionate military responses, including cyberattacks or kinetic strikes against Russian assets. For example, a confirmed Russian-linked sabotage operation against a major undersea cable could trigger a coordinated cyber retaliation to disable Russian command-and-control, logistics, or maritime surveillance systems; NATO can also seize Russian-linked vessels or equipment. Strategic ambiguity is important here, so that Moscow is unable to harden itself against retaliation, but the scale and seriousness of potential European responses must be legible to the Russian leadership in order to shift its risk calculations and restore deterrence.

An effective strategic response also necessitates that NATO allies build on the alliance's progress in intelligence sharing, in order to ensure that shadow warfare attacks are swiftly detected and their source determined. From there, each member's national security apparatuses—that is, militaries and intelligence services, not law enforcement agencies—should coordinate a response. Ensuring such coordination is all the more urgent now that Washington appears more ambivalent toward European security concerns. This month, the Trump administration announced plans to withdraw from the NATO-affiliated European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats—a move that weakens shared situational awareness at precisely the moment Russia is intensifying its shadow aggression.

In the years to come, Europe's success vis-à-vis Russia will not be measured by how forcefully it condemns shadow attacks, or even by how effectively it punishes them, but by how consistently it deters them. The task, then, is to make plain to the Kremlin that any act of shadow warfare will be met not with mild rebuke, as in the past, but with a strong response. Moscow must understand that there are escalating costs to its aggression.

Live Updates


• The Justice Department plans to subpoena Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison related to an investigation of possible obstruction of federal officers during recent protests, two sources said. The governor and Minneapolis' mayor, also Democrats, are expected to get subpoenas, too, as the Trump administration's turbocharged, coast-to-coast immigration enforcement crackdown targets the state.
    


• DOJ appealed a judge's ruling that federal agents in Minnesota can't arrest or use pepper spray on peaceful protesters or stop people in their cars without cause.
    


• DOJ launched a separate investigation after demonstrators interrupted Sunday service at a church where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent reportedly preaches.
    


• Critics are denouncing DOJ's handling of the fatal shooting this month of protester Renee Good in Minneapolis. While the FBI briefly opened a civil rights investigation into the ICE agent who shot Good, the probe pivoted to investigating Good and those around her, including her widow.
    


            A group of Minnesota doctors are holding a news conference today to condemn ICE for creating violence and intimidation in healthcare settings, leading to disruptions in their ability to treat patients.
    


            Notable medical leaders who are expected to be present include Lisa Mattson, president of the Minnesota Medical Association; Erin Stevens of the Minnesota Chapter of American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; and Janna Gewirtz O'Brien, president-elect of the Minnesota Chapter of American Academy of Pediatrics.
    


            The news conference will begin at 11:30 a.m. local time. Minnesota Sens. Alice Mann and Matt Klein, both Democrats, are also expected to join the physicians.
    


            CNN's Erin Burnett spoke with Bishop Robert Hirschfeld of the Episcopal Church of New Hampshire about preparing for a “new era of martyrdom” following a wave of clashes across the US involving ICE.
    


            A video of Bishop Hirschfield speaking at a vigil honoring Renee Nicole Good earlier this month by an ICE officer, went viral.
    


            In his remarks, he urged his clergy to “get their wills written” and “have their affairs in order,” suggesting they may need to stand between the powers of the world and the most vulnerable with their bodies following the killing of Good.
    


            The bishop also addressed how the history of the church had a “sacrificial spirit” and how the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. embodied that aspect of the church.
    


            The Justice Department is planning to subpoena Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison in a criminal investigation of several state and local officials, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
    


            The planned subpoenas are related to an investigation into possible obstruction of federal officers in the state during recent protests, the sources said.
    


            CNN has previously reported Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey are also expected to receive federal criminal subpoenas from the US Attorney's Office in the state.
    


            The planned subpoenas are a significant escalation between the federal government and elected officials in Minnesota during an increase of immigration enforcement and following the shooting death of Minneapolis resident Renee Good by an ICE officer.
    


            A spokesperson for Ellison didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
    


            Walz and Frey have criticized the Justice Department's approach in their state.
    


This post has been updated with additional information from sources.



Correction: An earlier version of this post gave the wrong title for Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison.



            Tensions remain high after anti-ICE protesters interrupted a church service in St. Paul, Minnesota over the weekend chanting “ICE out” and Renee Good's name — the woman who was fatally shot by an ICE agent nearly two weeks ago.
    


Here's what else you should know today:



            The Department of Justice asked a federal judge Monday to reject a bid by Minnesota leaders to block President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown and to allow the surge of immigration agents in the state to move forward, after a lawsuit was brought by Minnesota and the Twin Cities claiming the move was unconstitutional.
    


                    “Minnesota wants a veto over federal law enforcement,” the new filing by the Trump administration said, describing the lawsuit brought by state and local officials as an “absurdity” that “would render the supremacy of federal law an afterthought to local preferences.”
                





            Officials in Minnesota filed the lawsuit last week in an effort to curb the administration's ongoing crackdown in their state, equating the surge of federal immigration agents to the state to “a federal invasion” and citing violations of the 10th Amendment. The suit was filed shortly after Illinois and the city of Chicago also sued the Trump administration, alleging the Department of Homeland Security has terrorized residents in “organized bombardment.”
    


            Trump and his administration have said the Constitution gives the federal government broad authority to enforce national immigration laws as the government sees fit.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","What cardiologists want you to know about MAHA's push to eat more fat","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/20/health/heart-disease-maha-dietary-guidelines-wellness","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:00:59 GMT","


            Heart disease is the No. 1 killer of American women and men — and has been for over 100 years. In fact, cardiovascular diseases are the top cause of adult deaths everywhere, responsible for 1 in 3 deaths worldwide.
    


            Cardiologists say physical inactivity, smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes are all to blame — as is an unhealthy diet full of refined grains, added sugars and the artery-clogging saturated fats found in red and processed meats and full-fat dairy.
    


            The recently released 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans restrict refined grains, added sugars and ultraprocessed foods (known as UPFs) — a move applauded by medical organizations.
    


            However, the revised food pyramid — which flips prior pyramids on their heads  — also puts red meat and other foods full of protein and saturated fat in a starring role in the top tier, alongside fresh vegetables and fruits known to protect health.
    


            Leading cardiologists tell CNN this is upside-down thinking.
    


            “Promoting saturated fat and increasing the amount of protein goes against all nutrition and cardiology science,” said Dr. Kim Williams, chair of the department of medicine at the University of Louisville in Kentucky.
    


            “We've been researching this for decades, and we definitively know saturated fat — such as butter fat, beef tallow, red and processed meat — are all closely associated with more deaths from cardiovascular disease,” said Williams, a past president of the American College of Cardiology. “This does not fall in line with President Trump's executive order 14303, which mandates that all federal policies use the best scientific evidence available.”
    


            That executive order, signed by Trump on May 23, 2025, called for a return to “a gold standard for science” to ensure “that Federal decisions are informed by the most credible, reliable, and impartial scientific evidence available.”
    


            Yet it's exactly the impartial, verified and credible science that the new guidelines ignore, according to cardiologists. In fact, randomized controlled clinical trials — the current gold standard of research — have found replacing saturated fats with vegetable and seed oils reduced cardiovascular disease by some 30%, similar to the benefits of statin medications.
    


            “There's no question that when we remove saturated fat from the diet and add in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats from fish, seed and plant sources, we save lives by improving cardiovascular health,” said Dr. Monica Aggarwal, an adjunct clinical associate professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Florida in Gainesville.
    


            “People are going to look at the new pyramid and think ‘Oh, I can eat as much steak as I like.' Social media is already full of headlines like: ‘Beef is back on top,' or ‘Butter is back,' or ‘Beef tallow is the way to go,” Aggarwal said. “Yet there is no debate that the saturated fat in those foods is linked to heart disease.”
    


            In a January 8 press conference on the new guidelines, federal officials spoke of their disdain for past nutritional guidance.
    


            “For decades, we've been fed a corrupt food pyramid that has had a myopic focus on demonizing natural, healthy saturated fats, telling you not to eat eggs and steak and ignoring a giant blind spot — refined carbohydrates, added sugars and ultraprocessed food,” US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said at the briefing.
    


            The new dietary guidelines call for less than 10% of total daily calories to come from saturated fats, not terribly far from AHA recommendations to keep unhealthy fats to less than 6%.
    


            However, 10% or less is an impossible goal, experts say, if the major emphasis of the Make America Healthy Again movement is on eating more proteins with saturated fats.
    


            The Nutrition Source, an online resource from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, recently put the new dietary guidelines, which recommend three servings of dairy a day, to the test.
    


            If all three of those dairy servings were full fat: whole milk with about 5 grams of saturated fat and nearly a cup of full-fat Greek yogurt with a single ounce of cheddar cheese — each of which have 6 grams of saturated fat — that's a total of 17 grams.
    


What's the healthiest cheese? The best options, according to experts



            According to the Harvard calculations, for a person on a 2,000-calorie a day diet with a limit of 22 grams of saturated fat, that leaves only 5 grams for the rest of the day. Add a single tablespoon of butter (7 grams) or beef tallow (6 grams), and the person has surpassed their daily 10% limit of saturated fat.
    


            Add a standard burger patty cooked at home (over 13 grams), or a 7×7 Steakburger from Steak 'n Shake (66 grams of saturated fat and 7 grams of trans fats) and a large order of their “RFK'd” beef tallow french fries (24 grams of saturated fat and 2.5 grams of trans fats), and levels of dangerous fats zoom.
    


            CNN reached out to Biglari Holdings, which owns Steak 'n Shake, for comment but did not receive a response before publication.
    


            The trans fats found in the Steak 'n Shake foods are considered the worst type of saturated fat, experts say. This type of fat is banned in the United States except in tiny amounts due to its strong connection to heart attacks and stroke. Made from an industrial process in which hydrogen is added to liquid vegetable oils to make those oils more solid, trans fats are cheap to make and increase the shelf life of foods.
    


            Natural sources of trans fats are found in meat, milk, butter and cheese from ruminant animals — cows, sheep, goats — and are considered by some in the MAHA movement to be healthy.
    


            Cardiologists disagree. Natural trans fats found in foods from ruminant animals, and to a lesser degree in pork and poultry, are “actively pro-inflammatory” and lead to atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries, Williams said.
    


            “Beef tallow contains ruminant trans fats in levels far above what's considered safe. When paired with high saturated fat, as in deep-fried foods or fatty burgers, the combined risk is substantial,” he said.
    


            Warnings about the dangers of saturated fat aren't new. The American Heart Association  recommended a switch from disease-causing saturated fat to healthy options in 1961, acting on data-based recommendations from its nutrition committee, first established in 1954.
    


            Updates over the years to the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association's guidelines have reiterated that advice, citing hundreds of gold-standard studies on the role of fats in heart disease.
    


            “It's never been no- or low-fat,” said preventive cardiologist Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.
    


            “All types of fat can play a role in a healthy diet, but the emphasis is on polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats,” Freeman said. “That's what the Mediterranean diet and other plant-predominant diets have shown.”
    


            Studies have found the award-winning Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk of diabetes, dementia, memory loss, depression and breast cancer. Research has also linked the diet to stronger bones, lower cholesterol, a healthier heart and longer life.
    


            The Mediterranean diet's pyramid focuses on fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, seeds, some fish and heart-healthy olive oil, with an emphasis on meals with family and friends and daily exercise. Red meat and sweets are extremely limited, designed to be served only on special occasions.
    


            FDA Commissioner Makary also focused on the need for more protein in the American diet, especially for children.
    


            “The old guidelines had such a low protein recommendation that we are increasing that by 50% to 100% — kids need protein,” Makary said. “The old protein guidelines were to prevent starvation and withering away. These new protein guidelines are designed for American kids to thrive, and they're based on science, not on dogma.”
    


            However, most Americans today, including children, eat much more protein than they typically need, experts say.

            “Except for the very sick or old, protein deficiency almost does not exist in the United States,” Freeman said. “We also know that protein excess taxes the kidneys and is linked to certain cancers.
    


            “If you look at what MAHA stands for, it's exactly opposite what Trump is doing with this guidance. It doesn't add up,” he said. “We need our politicians to focus on changing unhealthy behaviors, not promoting them. Increasing the saturated fat that often comes bundled with the proteins the new pyramid recommends is in nobody's best interest.”

            In an ongoing struggle over the future of Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix says it is now prepared to pay all cash for Warner Bros. and HBO, rather than a mix of cash and stock.
    


            Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery, WBD for short, announced the amended plan on Tuesday morning, about six weeks after originally striking the mega-deal that would reshape the entertainment industry.
    


            The companies hope that the new all cash-offer will help fend off Paramount's hostile takeover bid for all of WBD.
    


            Netflix is offering $27.75 per WBD share for the company's movie studio and streaming assets, which are due to be split off into a new publicly traded company called Warner Bros. later this year.
    


            CNN and other channels owned by WBD will become part of a separate company called Discovery Global.
    


            Netflix had previously offered $23.25 per share in cash and the rest in Netflix stock, enabling Paramount to argue that its all-cash offer was superior.
    


            Netflix on Tuesday said the transaction will be financed “through a combination of cash on hand, available credit facilities and committed financing.”
    


            This “simplifies the transaction structure, provides greater certainty of value for WBD stockholders, and accelerates the path to a WBD stockholder vote,” the companies said in a press release.
    


            WBD CEO David Zaslav said Tuesday that once the company clears its review by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, WBD will schedule a special shareholder meeting to vote on the deal. He expects that would happen in the spring.
    


            Paramount has been anticipating the all-cash revision and has been moving forward with its plan to buy up shares for $30 each. Earlier this month Paramount CEO David Ellison also threatened a proxy fight, vowing to nominate a Paramount-friendly slate of board members to take over the WBD board.
    


            WBD has rebuffed Paramount and argued that the Netflix deal plus the formation of Discovery Global leaves investors in a better position.
    


            Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., chair of the WBD board of directors, said Tuesday morning, “By transitioning to all-cash consideration, we can now deliver the incredible value of our combination with Netflix at even greater levels of certainty, while providing our stockholders the opportunity to participate in management's strategic plans to realize the value of Discovery Global's iconic brands and global reach.”
    


            Paramount, on the other hand, has argued that the channels have little to no equity value.
    


            Earlier this month Paramount filed a lawsuit in Delaware to pursue more information about the valuation “so that,” Ellison said, “WBD shareholders have what they need to be able to make an informed decision as to whether to tender their shares into our offer.”
    


            The court rejected Paramount's effort to expedite the case, however.
    


            Netflix is slated to report quarterly earnings after the market close on Tuesday.

DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) — There were grave warnings from European leaders and expletives from California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday as leaders at the World Economic Forum grappled with the Greenland crisis and heightened concerns over global trade.

The gathering in Davos, Switzerland, comes as U.S. President Donald Trump continues to push for the seizure of Greenland and the imposition of related trade tariffs.

French President Emmanuel Macron, wearing aviator sunglasses because of an eye infection, warned of a “new colonial approach” that would undermine decades of collaboration.

Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister and former central banker, urged countries below the top tier of global power to continue multilateral cooperation with a new, “dense web of connections.” 

And in the forum's entrance hall, Newsom was the most blunt, telling European leaders: “It's time to get serious and stop being complicit. It's time to stand tall and firm – have a backbone.”

Here's a look at what attendees said:

“I can't take this complicity. People rolling over. I should've brought a bunch of knee pads for all the world leaders,” the California governor and prominent Democrat said. “I hope people understand how pathetic they look on the world stage. I mean, at least from an American perspective, it's embarrassing.” He added: “Diplomacy with Donald Trump? He's a T-Rex. You mate with him or he devours you. One or the other ... Wake up! Where the hell has everybody been? Stop with this (expletive) diplomacy of sort of niceties and somehow we're all going to figure it out, saying one thing privately and another publicly. Have some spine, some goddamn (expletive).”




Before expressing his concern, the French president began his address with a joke: “It's a time of peace, stability and predictability.” 

Warning major powers against the temptation of modern colonial adventures, he added: “It's a shift towards a world without rules. Where international law is trampled underfoot and where the only law that seems to matter is that of the strongest, and imperial ambitions are resurfacing.” Then he took aim at the Trump administration, denouncing “competition from the United States of America, through trade agreements that undermine our export interests, demand maximum concessions, and openly aim to weaken and subordinate Europe, combined with an endless accumulation of new tariffs that are fundamentally unacceptable, even more so when they are used as leverage against territorial sovereignty.”

“Great powers can afford for now to go it alone. They have the market size, the military capacity, and the leverage to dictate terms. Middle powers do not,” the Canadian prime minister said. 

“In a world of great power rivalry, the countries in between have a choice: compete with each other for favor or to combine to create a third path with impact,” he said. “(We) argue the middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu.”

Carney strongly opposed U.S. aspirations to expand its Arctic territory. “We stand firmly with Greenland and Denmark and fully support their unique right to determine Greenland's future.” 

With President Trump not due to address the elite global gathering until Wednesday, it fell to his treasury secretary to take up his defense in Switzerland.

“I think our relations have never been closer,” Scott Bessent said, playing down the rift among Western countries over Greenland. ”Calm down the hysteria. Take a deep breath.”

He added: “We are in the middle of President Trump's policies. And of course, Europe is an ally, the U.S.-NATO membership is unquestioned. We are partners in trying to stop this tragic war between Russia and Ukraine, but that does not mean that we cannot have disagreements on the future of Greenland.”

Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said that with Trump's Greenland provocations, “so many red lines have been crossed” in Europe.

“Being a happy vassal is one thing. Being a miserable slave is something else. If you back down now you're going to lose your dignity,” he said during a Davos panel discussion on redefining Europe's place in the world.

De Wever said that he and Belgium's King Philippe will meet with Trump on Wednesday when they will plan to press for a return to the old military alliance between Brussels and Washington.

“We either stand together or we will stand divided, and if we are divided, there is the end of an era, of 80 years of Atlanticism, really drawing to a close,” he said.

The former mayor of Antwerp, quoting the Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci, said that in a time of great transformation that it is up to U.S. president if the alliance holds. “It's up to him (Trump) to decide if he wants to be a monster - yes or no.”

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said a diplomatic “downward spiral” in the West would only embolden its adversaries.

“The proposed additional tariffs are a mistake, especially between long-standing allies. The European Union and the United States have agreed to a trade deal last July. And in politics, as in business, a deal is a deal,” the EU's top official said. 

The Commission president said Europe was obliged to respond to international pressure. 

“My point is: if this change is permanent, then Europe must change permanently too. It is time to seize this opportunity and build a new independent Europe,” von der Leyen said. “We consider the people of the United States not just our allies, but our friends. And plunging us into a downward spiral would only aid the very adversaries we are both so committed to keeping out of the strategic landscape.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — A stunning military intervention in Venezuela. Telling the New York Giants which coach to hire. Threats against Iran, Denmark, Greenland and Colombia. Posing with someone else's Nobel Peace Prize. Dangling the potential of deploying U.S. troops in Minneapolis. Flipping off a critic. Announcing an aggressive round of tariffs. Threatening political enemies. 

For President Donald Trump, this blizzard was just the first half of January.

If a president's most valuable currency is time, Trump operates as if he has an almost limitless supply, ever willing to share no matter the day, the hour or the circumstance.

He's rewritten the role of the presidency in a divided country, commanding constant attention with little regard for consequences. For all his talk about strength, his approach leans more toward virality than virility with social media as his primary accelerant. 

“The president exists loudly,” said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. “The president will play with fire. I haven't seen him yet play with live hand grenades, but I've seen him come damn close. That's just the way he is, and it's not going to change.”

At least Trump thanks you in the process. 

During his second term, the Republican president has signed off of his social media post with the catchphrase “thank you for your attention to this matter” 242 times, according to data compiled by Roll Call Factba.se. For good measure, he often uses all capital letters and a few exclamation points. 

He has spent decades seeking attention, first in the New York tabloids and later as a reality television star. Attention, positive or negative, is its own reward. In the attention economy, Trump is what Wall Street might call a market maker.

The gambits often have a tenuous relationship with truth and sometimes involve misogyny or racism. They can step on the administration's other priorities and don't always bend political realities in Trump's favor (see affordability concerns and the Epstein files ). 

But they're hard to ignore. 

“He's saying hello to you in the morning, and he says good night to you at the end of the day,” Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said. “You're never not going to hear from him.”

In his second term, he observed even fewer constraints on where to assert his presence, with a fondness for sports. During September alone, Trump attended three major sporting events around New York City. His visit to the U.S. Open final forced long security lines and delayed the start of the match. The crowd — dominated by New York's elite — booed him, but that didn't matter. He was still on the stadium's big screen and all over social media. 

That's where some of the biggest changes during Trump's second term have unfolded. 

During his first administration, many Silicon Valley leaders were cold — or outright hostile — to Trump. He was banned from platforms including Twitter and Facebook after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.

The leaders of those companies are now openly allied with Trump or at least friendly with him. Twitter is now named X and owned by Elon Musk, who led the Department of Government Efficiency during the first months of the second term and has returned to the president's orbit after a brief falling-out. Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg were among the technology executives who attended Trump's inauguration last year. 

Trump, who's not known to use a computer, this time has his own social media platform, where his team relies on fresh artificial intelligence technology to quickly produce memes and videos that keep the president at the forefront of the online conversation. Those posts often veer into crude territory, such as one in October that showed him wearing a crown, flying a plane, dumping excrement on his opponents.

“The social media we're talking about in Trump's second term is not the social media of Trump's first term,” said Nolan Higdon, a lecturer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where he focuses on critical media literacy. 

For now, there are few brakes on Trump's impulses. 

House Speaker Mike Johnson brushed off the excrement post as “satire.” Vice President JD Vance, a devout Catholic, has defended Trump's posts, including one depicting him as the pope. In an interview with Vanity Fair, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles described Trump, who doesn't drink, as possessing an “alcoholic's personality,” meaning he “operates (with) a view that there's nothing he can't do.”

Indeed, his approach has been remarkably successful in achieving the disruption he seeks to impose in the U.S. and abroad. He uses social media as a weapon, warning of aid that will be cut off to states that resist him. His posts regarding Greenland and Denmark sparked a genuine diplomatic crisis and raised questions about the long-term sustainability of NATO. 

The two nagging exceptions revolve around Epstein and affordability.

After telling his supporters to “not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein,” he eventually gave in to congressional pressure and signed a bill that earned overwhelming support on Capitol Hill calling for the files to be made public. The Justice Department has already missed deadlines for the release, and Democrats including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois have said the flurry of news this month has amounted to a distraction from the Epstein issue.

Trump has similarly struggled to convince the public that he understands and is responding to their concerns about high prices. After calling affordability challenges a “Democratic hoax,” he has tried to take action, including delivering a prime-time address last month. But that speech and more recent efforts, including the mortgage rate push, were quickly drowned by the deluge of more jarring news.

Indeed, a Michigan visit last week to talk about affordability may ultimately be best remembered for images of Trump delivering an obscene gesture at someone who was yelling at him from afar. 

That underscores Trump's central challenge heading into an election year that will test his grip on power. While his hard-line approach may delight supporters, it does less to convince a broader swath of Americans that he's an effective president.

Approval of Trump's handling of most issues is low, but health care stands out as a particular weakness for him. Only about 3 in 10 U.S. adults approved of the way he was handling health care, according to a December AP-NORC poll. That was slightly lower than his overall approval. He's also slipped on immigration since the start of his second term, when this stood out as a relative strength. According to a January AP-NORC poll, about 4 in 10 U.S. adults approve of his performance on immigration, down from about half of Americans toward the beginning of his first term.

Meanwhile, Democrats are taking stronger steps toward winning American attention spans. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, hosts a podcast and taunts Trump by mocking him on social media. 

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani is perhaps the most successful Democrat to translate a digital media machine into political success. Over the course of about a year, the 34-year-old went from a relatively unknown state lawmaker to the leader of the nation's largest city by introducing himself to voters with videos that showed him in unscripted environments, like the course of the New York City marathon.

“They're learning not to impose an old framework on a new paradigm,” said Basil Smikle, a former executive director of the New York State Democratic Party and a professor at Columbia University. 

The long-term question is whether Trump has fundamentally changed the presidency. Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary under then-President George W. Bush, said Trump “is the definition of unique” and predicted that the next president — regardless of party — will communicate differently.

“Whoever succeeds him,” Fleischer said, “the velocity of the presidency will slow down.”

PARIS (AP) — Here, verbatim, are text messages that U.S. President Donald Trump received from French President Emmanuel Macron and the head of NATO, Mark Rutte, and which he published on Tuesday:

“From président Macron to President Trump My friend, We are totally in line on Syria We can do great things on Iran I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland Let us try to build great things: 1) i can set up a g7 meeting after Davos in Paris on thursday afternoon. I can invite the ukrainians, the danish, the syrians and the russians in the margins 2) let us have a dinner together in Paris together on thursday before you go back to the us Emmanuel” 

“Mr. President, dear Donald — what you accomplished in Syria today is incredible. I will use my media engagements in Davos to highlight your work there, in Gaza, and in Ukraine. I am committed to finding a way forward on Greenland. Can't wait to see you. Yours, Mark” 

—-

Trump also exchanged messages on Sunday with Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, as follows. The message from Støre was co-signed by Finnish President Alexander Stubb. 

“Dear Mr President, dear Donald - on the contact across the Atlantic - on Greenland, Gaza, Ukraine — and your tariff announcement yesterday. You know our position on these issues. But we believe we all should work to take this down and de-escalate - so much is happening around us where we need to stand together. We are proposing a call with you later today — with both of us or separately — give us a hint of what you prefer! Best — Alex and Jonas” 

“Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a “right of ownership” anyway? There are no written documents, it's only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you! President DJT”

As the official celebrations of the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence culminate on July 4, a well-financed, privately funded initiative will kick off to try to connect hundreds of millions of Americans with efforts to solve local problems. 

The “Be The People” campaign aspires to change the perception that the U.S. is hopelessly divided and that individuals have little power to overcome problems like poverty, addiction, violence and stalled economic mobility. It also wants to move people take action to solve those problems. 

Brian Hooks, chairman and CEO of the nonprofit network Stand Together, said the 250th anniversary is a unique moment “to show people that they matter, that they have a part to play, and that the future is unwritten, but it depends on each one of us stepping up to play our part.”

Funded by a mix of 50 philanthropic foundations and individual donors, Be The People builds on research that indicates many people want to contribute to their communities but don't know how. The initiative is targeting more than $200 million for its first year's budget. 

Founding members range from nonprofits — including GivingTuesday, Goodwill Industries, Habitat for Humanity and More Perfect, businesses like Ron Howard's Imagine Entertainment and the National Basketball Association, to funders like the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. 




Hooks said this is a 10-year commitment toward trying to achieve what would be a profound shift in behavior and culture. He referenced a 2024 Pew Research Center survey that found most Americans in 2023 and 2024 did not believe that the U.S. could solve its most important problems, saying it was a “red alert” for the country. 

Hooks said the initiative envisions actions far beyond volunteering or service that people could do in their free time. He pointed to a role for businesses and schools and said the initiative would launch a major data collection effort to track whether people are actually more engaged and whether problems are actually getting solved. 

Stand Together, which was founded by the billionaire Charles Koch, works across a broad range of issues and communities in the U.S. and has carved out a role for itself as a convener that can bring coalitions together across ideological lines. 

“Be The People,” will not incorporate as a new nonprofit, but act more like a banner for groups to organize under and use to connect to resources. As an example, at the Atlanta Hawks game on Monday, Martin Luther King III and his wife, Arndrea Waters King, linked a program they launched last year, Realize the Dream, which aims to increase acts of service, to the new campaign. 

“Our vision is that ‘Be The People' helps lift up what is already happening in communities across the country and reminds people that service and shared responsibility are defining parts of the American story,” the Kings said in a written statement. 

Asha Curran, the CEO of the nonprofit GivingTuesday, said small actions can build on each other like exercising a muscle. 

“Our experience with GivingTuesday is that when people volunteer together, when people work together on something to do with positive social impact, they find it harder and harder to demonize each other,” said Asha Curran, its CEO. 

The initiative comes against a backdrop of deep polarization, economic inequality and the degradation of democratic norms and institutions in the U.S. 

Hahrie Han, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University, has studied civic engagement and said people need more opportunities to authentically participate as problem solvers when connecting with local organizations.

“They're more likely to be invited into things where people are asked to let professional staff do most of the problem solving and they show up and give their time or their money,” she said.

The result is that people feel less committed and don't see their participation as helping to achieve their interests or goals. 

A growing number of private foundations have started funding issues related to the health of U.S. democracy, said Kristin Goss, a professor who directs the Center for the Study of Philanthropy and Voluntarism at Duke University. While foundations cannot participate in elections, Goss said they can influence policy or public opinion in other ways. 

“Funders are getting more concerned about of the health of American democracy, the future of the democratic experiment and pluralism and inclusion,” Goss said. 

Another group of funders, including the Freedom Together Foundation, launched a project last year to recognize people and groups who stand up for their communities, which they called a “civic bravery” award. In a November report, they issued a similar call for funders to invest in helping individuals organize together in response to a rise in authoritarianism.

Hooks and the other leaders of “Be The People” have also convened major communications teams to help tell these stories, which they think are lost in the current information ecosystem.

“What we're doing is we're helping to lift up the story of Americans that is unfolding at the local level, but is not breaking through,” Hooks said. “So we're holding up a mirror and a microphone to Americans to reveal to each other who we truly are.”

MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A statement of confidence as much as style, Naomi Osaka walked onto one of the biggest stages in tennis wearing a wide-brim hat, a veil and holding a white parasol in a bold opening act at the Australian Open.

Aware that such an iconic walk-on could backfire if she lost her first-round match, Osaka did everything she needed Tuesday to bring down the curtain on Day 3 at Rod Laver Arena with a 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 victory over Antonia Ruzic.

The hat and umbrella were adorned with symbolic butterflies, a nod to one of the memorable moments of Osaka's last title run at Melbourne Park in 2021 rather than a reflection of the usual first-round jitters at a major tournament.

“When I was playing today, I just told myself, like, ‘Keep your head on the path. If she beats you, then that's unfortunate. But, hey, at least you're trending,'” on social media, she said.

Osaka has won four Grand Slam singles titles, including two at the U.S. Open and two in Australia in 2019 and 2021. 

She next plays Sorana Cirstea, who beat Eva Lys 3-6, 6-4, 6-3. After reaching the U.S. Open semifinals last year — her best result at a Grand Slam event in four years — Osaka is growing in confidence. 

Born in Japan but growing up in America, Osaka was inspired by Venus and Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, the tennis stars she described as the “G.O.A.T's of style.”

“I think it all comes down to personality, too,” she said. 




The dress she wore in her first-round match, in shades of blue and green, was also a tribute to her daughter, Shai, and her fascination with jellyfish.

“So, the inspiration was obviously the jellyfish, then butterflies, which kind of ties back to the butterfly moment I had here a long time ago, in 2021,” Osaka said, recalling the images of one landing on her during a third-round match.

It took months of planning. And it all tied in with the remodelled player tunnel at Rod Laver Arena that reflects Australian themes such as beaches and the coast.

“Honestly it came together quite beautifully because I didn't know what to expect when I arrived here,” Osaka said. “Then it just felt like everywhere I looked the theme was water. Obviously the walkout was like you see oceans and waves. I thought that it was really beautiful. Really amazing coincidence.”

LONDON (AP) — A startled British government on Tuesday defended its decision to hand sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, after U.S. President Donald Trump attacked the plan, which his administration had previously supported.

Trump said that relinquishing the remote Indian Ocean archipelago, home to a strategically important American naval and bomber base, was an act of stupidity that shows why he needs to take over Greenland.

“Shockingly, our ‘brilliant' NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,” he said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. “There is no doubt that China and Russia have noticed this act of total weakness.”

“The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired,” Trump said.

The blast from Trump was a rebuff to efforts by Prime Minister Keir Starmer to calm tensions over Greenland and patch up a frayed trans-Atlantic relationship. Starmer on Monday called Trump's statements about taking over Greenland “completely wrong,” but called for the rift to be “resolved through calm discussion.”

The British government said Tuesday that despite the president's post, it believes the U.S. still supports the Chagos deal. 




Cabinet Minister Pat McFadden said that a flurry of social media posts from Trump “criticizing a number of world leaders” showed the president “is frustrated right now” as European allies push back on his desire for Greenland.

“I don't really believe this is about Chagos. I think it's about Greenland,” McFadden said.

The United Kingdom and Mauritius signed a deal in May to give Mauritius sovereignty over the Chagos Islands after two centuries under British control, though the U.K. will pay Mauritius at least 120 million pounds ($160 million) a year to lease back the island of Diego Garcia, where the U.S. base is located, for at least 99 years.

The U.S. government welcomed the agreement at the time, saying it “secures the long-term, stable, and effective operation of the joint U.S.-U.K. military facility at Diego Garcia.”

In recent years, the United Nations and its top court have urged Britain to return the islands to Mauritius, and the British government says it's acting to protect the security of the base from international legal challenge.

A government spokesperson said that “the U.K. will never compromise on our national security,” and “this deal secures the operations of the joint U.S.-U.K. base on Diego Garcia for generations, with robust provisions for keeping its unique capabilities intact and our adversaries out.”

But the deal has met strong opposition from British opposition parties, which say that giving up the islands puts them at risk of interference by China and Russia.

Islanders who were displaced from the islands to make way for the U.S. base say they weren't consulted and worry the deal will make it harder for them to go home.




Legislation to approve the agreement has been passed by the House of Commons, but faced strong opposition in Parliament's upper chamber, the House of Lords, which approved it, while also passing a “motion of regret” lamenting the legislation. It's due back in the Commons on Tuesday for further debate.

Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch criticized Starmer's Labour Party government over the agreement.

Badenoch said in an X post that Trump is right and that Starmer's “plan to give away the Chagos Islands is a terrible policy that weakens UK security and hands away our sovereign territory. And to top it off, makes us and our NATO allies weaker in the face of our enemies.”

Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, an ally of the president said: “Thank goodness Trump has vetoed the surrender of the Chagos islands.”

The U.S. has described the Diego Garcia base, which is home to about 2,500 mostly American personnel, as “an all but indispensable platform” for security operations in the Middle East, South Asia and East Africa.

The Chagos Islands have been under British control since 1814, when they were ceded by France. Britain split the islands away from Mauritius, a former British colony, in 1965, and evicted as many as 2,000 people from the islands so the U.S. military could build the Diego Garcia base.

An estimated 10,000 displaced Chagossians and their descendants now live primarily in Britain, Mauritius and the Seychelles. Some have fought unsuccessfully in U.K. courts for many years for the right to go home.

The U.K.-Mauritius deal calls for a resettlement fund to be created for displaced islanders to help them move back to the islands — apart from Diego Garcia.

Indiana Hoosiers quarterback Fernando Mendoza had God in his heart and faith on his mind as he helped the team to its first college football national championship on Monday night.

Mendoza may have needed some divine intervention against the Miami Hurricanes as he was bruised and battered throughout the night. He helped the Hoosiers extend their lead when he ran the ball into the end zone on 4th down about midway through the fourth. He leaped from the 2-yard line and did a full-body stretch to get the ball across the goal line.

Through it all, he gave ""glory to God"" in his postgame interview with ESPN's Holly Rowe.

Furthermore, Mendoza had the outstanding performance in front of two pastors from the campus of Indiana University. Father Patrick Hyde and Father Ben Keller of Saint Paul Church were among the thousands of Hoosiers fans in attendance.

Brendan Banfield is facing life in prison for his alleged role in the 2023 murders of his wife, Christine Banfield, and Joseph Ryan in Virginia.

WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT

The first week of testimony in the Virginia trial of Brendan Banfield centered on an extramarital affair he was having with the family's nanny, allegedly prompting the ex-IRS agent to kill his wife and a stranger as part of an elaborate scheme.

Banfield is charged with aggravated murder in the February 2023 killings of his wife, Christine Banfield, and Joseph Ryan inside their home in Herndon, Virginia, an affluent suburb of Washington, D.C. Prosecutors allege he orchestrated the killings to cover up his relationship with the family's au pair, Juliana Peres Magalhães. Banfield has pleaded not guilty.

""They're calling it 'The Au Pair Affair'—it's like something out of a TV movie. From the defense standpoint, the primary goal is to frame her as the mastermind by attacking her credibility. As the star witness, the jury's decision rests on whether they believe her,"" Kelly Hyman, a criminal defense attorney, told Fox News Digital.

VIRGINIA NANNY'S JAILHOUSE LETTERS REVEAL CONFLICTING LOYALTIES IN LOVE TRIANGLE MURDER TRIAL

Magalhães, who admitted her role in the killings under a plea agreement, told jurors she was involved in a sexual relationship with Banfield and said the two plotted to kill Christine and make Ryan's death appear to be the result of a consensual encounter gone wrong.

She testified that Banfield controlled the planning, created an online profile using his wife's credentials, and ultimately stabbed Christine after shooting Ryan.

Under her plea deal, Magalhães faces a significantly reduced sentence in exchange for her cooperation.

""It's a ‘Tale of Two Cities': the prosecution paints her as a 22-year-old victim, while the defense flips the script to show an instigator acting out of self-preservation,"" Hyman said. ""By attributing key decisions to her and introducing prior inconsistent statements, the defense will aim to create reasonable doubt. If they can show she has an ulterior motive or a personal gain from the plea deal, they can argue the prosecution hasn't proven the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.""

With Magalhães' testimony now complete, the trial is expected to shift this week to additional forensic evidence and law-enforcement witnesses.

A key dispute last week involved who controlled the FetLife account used to communicate with Ryan. Prosecutors pointed to digital evidence and Magalhães' testimony to argue Banfield was the mastermind behind the keyboard.

The defense countered that multiple people had access to devices inside the home and questioned whether the evidence conclusively identifies Banfield as the account's operator.

Prosecutors also discussed what they described as the ""neatness"" of the crime scene, focusing on details such as Christine's eyeglasses, which appeared carefully placed despite the violence of the attack. The commonwealth argued these details support a narrative that the scene was staged to mislead investigators.

The defense has yet to present its case. The trial is scheduled to resume Tuesday at 10 a.m.

The United States Marshals Service arrested a fugitive in Washington state last week after authorities said he was discovered hiding beneath a child's bed.

U.S. Marshals tracked down and arrested Keantray Davon Bryant-Muellner on Friday in Spokane, Wash. Authorities said he was wanted on an outstanding warrant for violating probation tied to a 2024 arrest that included firearm and assault charges.

Members of the U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force surrounded and sealed off a residence near the 3000 block of South Regal Street at approximately 5:30 p.m., the U.S. Marshals Service said.

Officers then removed a glass sliding door to gain entry after repeated law enforcement commands. Two uninvolved adults rushed out of the home, authorities said.

During a methodical search, law enforcement discovered Bryant-Muellner attempting to conceal himself beneath a child's bed, according to the U.S. Marshals Service. He surrendered without incident, officials said.

Forensic scientist and Jacksonville State University Professor Joseph Scott Morgan told Fox News Digital that McKee used fake information to ""disguise"" himself.

The ex-husband of the Ohio dentist's wife, charged in the couple's murders, had a fake address and nonexistent phone number on file with his former employer, leading a forensic scientist to believe that he was trying to ""disguise himself"" before the alleged killings.

Michael David McKee, 39, was arrested on Jan. 10 after allegedly murdering a couple in Columbus, Ohio, according to court records. Police officers responded to a house located in Columbus' Weinland Park neighborhood around 10 a.m. Dec. 30 and found Spencer Tepe, 37, and Monique Tepe, 39, both dead with gunshot wounds. McKee was Monique's ex-husband.

McKee faces upgraded charges of premeditated aggravated murder in Ohio in relation to the Tepes' deaths.

Divorce records obtained by Fox News Digital show the couple got married on Aug. 22, 2015, and were separated by March 2016. According to the divorce filing made by Monique, she said the two were ""incompatible,"" leading to the separation after seven months of marriage. The two did not have any children during their short marriage.

According to WSYX, Las Vegas attorney Dan Laird, who filed a lawsuit against McKee, said an address on file with his previous employer, Las Vegas Surgical Associates LLP, turned out to be a fake address.

""Interestingly, the address that was given to us by the surgery group that he worked for turned out to be a fake address,"" Laird said. ""It was an address that doesn't exist.""

The address provided by Las Vegas Surgical Associates was also non-existent, and the phone number associated with his state medical board profile led Laird to a fax machine.

Laird said he attempted to reach McKee through former co-workers, which included another individual named in the lawsuit, Dr. Peter Caravella.

""He said he has no idea where Dr. Michael McKee is now,"" Laird said, recalling his conversation with Caravella. ""He just disappeared.""

Laird said the process server he used attempted to locate and serve McKee nine times, all of which failed.

A Nevada judge in October granted a declaration of due diligence, which allowed McKee to be served through a newspaper notice.

Forensic scientist and Jacksonville State University Professor Joseph Scott Morgan told Fox News Digital McKee may have been trying to ""disguise"" himself.

""Well, for me, from an investigative standpoint, it would seem to imply that there was maybe intent to disguise themselves,"" Morgan said.

Morgan added that this level of deception would make sense for someone trying to throw people off, like investigators or a potential lawsuit.

The Islamic State claimed responsibility on Monday for a suicide blast at a Chinese restaurant in Afghanistan that killed more than half a dozen people.

Abdul Mateen Qani, a spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry, told The New York Times the attack was carried out by one person linked to ISIS-Khorasan, commonly known as ISIS-K, one of the terrorist group's most lethal branches.

ISIS-K has claimed it targets Chinese citizens as retaliation for Beijing's treatment of Uyghurs, a Muslim minority group, and has also denounced the Afghan government's relationship with China, according to the Times.

Kabul police command spokesman Khalid Zadran said on X that seven people were killed in the explosion, including six Afghans and one Chinese national. Several others were injured.

Zadran said the blast occurred around 3 p.m. local time at a Chinese noodle restaurant in Kabul's Shahr-e-Naw neighborhood that was jointly run by Abdul Majeed, a Chinese Muslim from Xinjiang province, his wife, and an Afghan named Abdul Jabbar Mahmoud.

""The explosion occurred near the kitchen. The nature of the explosion is still unknown, investigations are ongoing,"" he added.

China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday that one Chinese national was killed and five others were wounded in the attack.

""China strongly condemns and firmly opposes any form of terrorism, supports Afghanistan and regional countries in jointly fighting all forms of terrorist and violent activities,"" he said.

""Given the current security situation in Afghanistan, the Ministry once again advises Chinese nationals not to travel to Afghanistan in the near future and asks Chinese nationals and companies already in Afghanistan to take extra precautions, step up security and depart high-risk regions as soon as possible.""

Republican National Committee Chair Joe Gruters tells Fox News Digital that President Donald Trump will be the GOP's ‘secret weapon' in the midterm elections.

Republican National Committee Chair Joe Gruters says that President Donald Trump is the GOP's ""secret weapon"" that will help the GOP ""defy history"" in November's midterm elections, when the party in power traditionally loses House and Senate seats. But one year into his second tour of duty in the White House, public opinion surveys suggest many Americans are souring on the president and his agenda.

The president's approval rating stands at 45% in the latest Wall Street Journal poll, at 41% in Reuters/Ipsos, and an average of all the most recent national polls compiled by Real Clear Politics puts Trump's approval at 42%, with 55% giving him a thumbs down on the job he's doing.

Trump started his second term in positive territory, but his approval ratings sank below water last March and have slowly edged deeper into negative territory in the ensuing months.

""Support among Republicans has remained in place, but the opposition has become even more calcified,"" veteran Republican pollster Daron Shaw told Fox News Digital, as he pointed to Democrats.

Shaw, who helps run the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson, said that ""the approval numbers amongst Independents, I think, are what probably troubles the White House and Republican operatives across the country.""

""It's true that Independents don't turn out in particularly high levels in midterm elections, but they do vote and that's where erosion in support of the president can cost Republicans seats not only in the House but also in some close Senate races,"" he warned.

SURVEY SAYS: ISSUE THAT HELPED TRUMP AND REPUBLICANS IN 2024 HURT THEM NOW

Deep concerns over inflation boosted Trump and Republicans to sweeping victories at the ballot box in 2024, as they won back the White House and Senate and kept their House majority.

But Democrats say their decisive victories in November's 2025 elections, and their overperformances in special elections and other ballot box showdowns last year, were fueled by their laser focus on affordability amid persistent inflation.

Trump's approval ratings on the economy are, on average, slightly lower than his overall approval ratings.

The cost of living has been a key issue at the ballot box the past couple of years. And an overwhelming majority questioned in a Fox News national poll conducted last month expressed concern about high prices.

But Republicans highlight the series of tax cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump's signature domestic policy achievement so far during his second term, as they argue that the GOP will flip the script on affordability this year.

""From an affordability standpoint, I think we win hands down based on the policies this president has pushed,"" Gruters argued.

RNC BETS ON ‘SECRET WEAPON' TO HELP GOP ‘DEFY HISTORY' IN MIDTERMS

Democrats disagree.

""As working families struggle to afford groceries, utilities, and health care, and worry about finding a job, Trump is busy meddling in foreign countries and palling around with executives, failing to address Americans' top concerns on the economy,"" Democratic National Committee Rapid Response Director Kendall Witmer argued in a statement.

The president's numbers on the issue of illegal immigration, another issue that helped lift him to a re-election victory, have eroded over the past year. The issue is once again front-and-center, following this month's fatal shooting of a Minnesota woman and mother of three by an ICE agent as she protested the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts.

With the midterm election cycle quickly heating up, Shaw noted that ""this is a markedly better issue environment for the Democrats than they saw in 2022 or 2024.""

The presidential approval rating, along with the generic ballot, is a closely watched polling indicator ahead of the midterm elections.

And Trump's most recent two-term presidential predecessors saw their parties take a shellacking in the midterms during their second terms.

Then-President George W. Bush's approval rating was more than 15 points into negative territory by Election Day 2006, while former President Barack Obama hovered 10–12 points below water in the months leading up to the 2014 midterms.

Longtime Republican pollster and strategist Tony Fabrizio, chief pollster for Trump's 2016 and 2024 presidential campaigns, told Fox News Digital that ""if you look back historically to midterms at this point in a president's second term, we are in equal or better shape.""

And pointing to Republicans who are raising alarms ahead of the midterms, Fabrizio said ""many of these folks are the same bedwetters who said the President couldn't win in 2024."" 

But the GOP is now dealing with a low propensity midterms issue that it didn't have to worry about before Trump upended the political order: MAGA voters who don't always go to the polls when Trump's name isn't on the ballot.

Gruters noted that Trump's made stops in recent weeks in three key midterm election battlegrounds and said that the president's ""going to barnstorm the country with our candidates.""

""We got to make sure we turn our voters out, and we got to make sure that we have people energized. And there's nobody that can energize our base more than President Trump,"" the RNC chair said.

Shaw, who served as a strategist and pollster for Bush in his 2000 and 2004 campaigns, said that nowadays ""the turnout question now is really a Republican question more than a Democratic one.""

That's a reversal from the pre-Trump era, when Democrats were considered low propensity voters.

""There is very little question Democrats are going to turn out to oppose Trump and the Republicans,"" Shaw said. ""Are Republicans going to show up and vote?""

French President Emmanuel Macron texted President Donald Trump that he does “not understand” what the U.S. leader's goal in Greenland is, ahead of Trump's visit to speak in front of European leaders in Davos, Switzerland. 

The text, posted by Trump to Truth Social, detailed Macron's understanding of some of his recent geopolitical objectives. 

“My friend, We are totally in line on Syria. We can do great things on Iran. I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland,” Macron said in the posted message. “Let us try to build great things.”

“I can set up a G7 meeting after Davos in Paris on Thursday afternoon. I can invite the Ukrainians, the Danish, the Syrians, and the Russians, in the margins,” Macron added. “Let us have dinner together in Paris together on Thursday before you go back to the U.S.”

Macron's message comes as Trump heads to the World Economic Forum this week for the first time since 2020. Greenland is expected to be among the most discussed topics at Davos, as tensions have boiled over Trump's intentions to obtain the Arctic island for the U.S. and subsequent European objections against him doing so. It also comes on the heels of Trump's announcement last week of imposing 10% tariffs on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland after representatives from those countries “journeyed to Greenland for purposes unknown.”

The tariffs are to be “due and payable until such times as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” according to Trump's Truth Social post from Jan. 17.

It is believed that Trump will bring the largest delegation in U.S. history, according to the World Economic Forum. 

CONGRESS URGED TO STOP ‘MADNESS' OF TRUMP'S GREENLAND OBSESSION

Representatives from Denmark were invited to the WEF but opted not to attend due to the controversy surrounding Greenland, according to WEF.

“Any decisions on attendance are a matter for the government concerned. We can confirm that the Danish government will not be represented in Davos this week,” a Davos spokesperson said in a statement.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen committed to an “unflinching, united, and proportional” response to President Donald Trump's threats to increase tariffs on the European Union in response to its lack of support over Greenland, though she stressed she preferred a cooperative approach.

Von der Leyen embraced a “A Spirit of Dialogue,” the World Economic Forum's theme for this year's summit in Davos, Switzerland, during her speech Tuesday. She announced her economic vision for the EU, focusing on “European independence.”

She also acknowledged the geopolitical tensions between the United States and the EU regarding Greenland, specifically Trump's announcement that 10% tariffs would go into effect Feb. 1 for eight European countries.

She said that if Trump continued with the proposed tariffs, then the EU would respond with an “unflinching, united, and proportional” response. Yet, even with her firm tone, she would rather focus on cooperation than retaliation.

“Arctic security can only be achieved together,” von der Leyen said. “This is why the proposed additional tariffs are a mistake, especially between long-standing allies. The EU and U.S. have agreed to a trade deal last July. And in politics as in business, a deal is a deal. And when friends shake hands, it must mean something.”

“Plunging us into a dangerous downward spiral would only aid the very adversaries we are both so committed to keeping out of our strategic landscape,” she said.

At the beginning of her speech, von der Leyen focused on the changing world and the need for Europe to be independent. She acknowledged the world has changed a lot since the first World Economic Forum in 1971, but the core tenet of that meeting, the importance of dialogue, “has remained,” she said. She recognized the effects that “geopolitical shocks” can have, but she also inferred they could be a blessing.

“Geopolitical shocks can and must serve as an opportunity for Europe,” von der Leyen said. “And in my view, the seismic change we are going through today is an opportunity, in fact, a necessity, to build a new form of European independence. And this need is neither new nor a reaction to recent events; it has been a structural imperative for far longer.”

“So when I used this term, ‘European independence' around a year ago, I was surprised at the skeptical reactions,” she said. “But less than one year on, there is now a real consensus around this. The sheer speed and almost unthinkable scale of the change have driven this, but the underlying imperative is still the same.”

Von der Leyen said the continent must recognize that the old order is no more and that Europe must implement change. She then called for a new Europe, announced a new trade deal, and teased a future major economic partnership.

“Of course, nostalgia is part of our human story, but nostalgia will not bring back the old order,” von der Leyen said. “And playing for time and hoping for things to revert soon will not fix the structural dependencies we have. So my point is, if this change is permanent, then Europe must change permanently too. It is time to seize this opportunity and build a new, independent Europe. And ladies and gentlemen, this new Europe is already emerging.”

She announced a new trade agreement with Latin America and the EU, a “market worth over 20% of global GDP.”

“It was a breakthrough after 25 years of negotiations,” von der Leyen said. “And with it, the European Union and Latin America have created the largest free trade zone in the world, a market worth over 20% of global GDP, 31 countries with over 700 million consumers aligned with the Paris Agreement.”

“So this agreement sends a powerful message to the world that we're choosing fair trade over tariffs, partnership over isolation, sustainability over exploitation, and that we are serious about derisking our economies and diversifying our supply chains,” she added.

She also mentioned her plans to visit India. She said she was negotiating an agreement with the country, which she called “the mother of all deals.” It is not finished yet, but expressed optimism that it would be soon. She categorized it as proof that Europe was serious about its economic independence and 21st-century goals.

CONGRESS URGED TO STOP ‘MADNESS' OF TRUMP'S GREENLAND OBSESSION

“And right after Davos, I will travel to India,” von der Leyen said. “There's still work to do, but we are on the cusp of a historic trade agreement. Indeed, some call it the mother of all deals, one that would create a market of 2 billion people, accounting for almost a quarter of global GDP, and crucially, that would provide a first-move advantage for Europe, with one of the world's fastest-growing and most dynamic continents. Europe wants to do business with the gross centers of today and the economic powerhouses of this century, from Latin America to Indo-Pacific, and far beyond.”

“Europe will always choose the world, and the world is ready to choose Europe,” she boasted.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

I'm reporting from Davos, Switzerland, where thousands of business leaders and politicians have arrived at the World Economic Forum to shake hands, talk shop, and maybe even eke out a few ski runs.

Some executives I've spoken to this week had some big concerns about AI, but none of them had anything to do with a potential bubble.

Raj Sharma, EY's global managing partner of growth and innovation, said there's not enough talk about AI security — specifically, the management of AI agents and their lifecycle.

""It has access to your data. It has no name, so there is no identity or anything associated with that,"" Sharma said.

Compare that to humans, where every computer system and piece of data they touch is often tracked.

""We have to build industrial-level security for AI agents in that particular area. To me, that's still a gap that somebody needs to work on,"" Sharma said. ""Everybody's talking a good game. But if you look under the covers, it's still not mature.""

""That keeps me up at night,"" Sharma added.

He's not alone. Tim Walsh, the CEO of KPMG US, told me the biggest issue he talks to CEOs about regularly is cyber risk, specifically related to AI.

AI agents are the latest twist in executives' ongoing concerns over cybersecurity, and it's proving to be an incredibly challenging problem. Somewhat ironically, the only way to fight the threat is with … more AI.

In some cases, the risk has gotten so big that it's shifting timelines on companies' AI plans.

""It's not that they're not moving forward, but they are taking a moment to make sure that their environment is secure, and perhaps even leaving data on-prem a little bit longer so they're confident that got their data security in place,"" Walsh told me.

Walsh said another ""real concern"" is the threat of quantum computing from a security perspective.

While he acknowledged we're still a few years out from the tech being fully developed, its power is incredible.

""Quantum breaks everything,"" Walsh said. ""I mean, all encryption.""

That's led companies to look at their systems and reencrypting things, no easy task.

""We're spending quite a bit of time as well, helping companies think through: What does that look like? How do you structure it? How long will it take?"" Walsh said.

It was not long ago that building a sophisticated app required a team of experienced programmers hovering over their keyboards. Now, AI has made it possible for a novice with no coding knowledge to whip up high-quality apps from scratch.

Emergent, founded out of Y Combinator's startup class of 2024 by twin brothers Mukund Jha and Madhav Jha, is one of the fastest-growing so-called ""vibe coding"" platforms, already boasting 5 million users and seeing annual recurring revenue soar from $100,000  to $50 million in just seven months.

The company recently raised $70 million in Series B funding from Khosla Ventures and SoftBank Vision Fund 2, with participation from Prosus, Lightspeed, Together, and Y Combinator. The valuation was not disclosed.

""Emergent is growing at a pace we rarely see because it is tapping into a segment that has never been served,"" Vinod Khosla, founder of Khosla Ventures, said in a statement. ""When barriers to software creation fall this quickly, behavior changes across industries, not just within the technology sector. Emergent is early in shaping how software gets created and monetized over the next decade, not just the next product cycle, and its users are quick to share their success.""

In a sign of how quickly the hottest AI companies are raising funding in this bull market, it was only three months ago that Emergent raised $23 million in Series A funding.

""There's this huge gap in the market where people are looking for an alternative that can build fast, cheap, and high-quality software, Mukund Jha, Emergent's CEO, said in an interview. ""Because the product is really resonating with users, we are seeing this explosive growth.""

A standard individual subscription is $17 a month, while a Pro account goes for $167 a month.

Jha says 80% of users have never seen a line of code before. Most are small business owners, such as a factory owner in Mexico who built a system to manage his plant.

""They were able to create this whole setup on their own and have 500 factory workers using it on a daily basis,"" Jha said. ""We also had a microbiologist build a whole new audiobook experience where she can import voices from ElevenLabs and create a completely new listening experience to the audiobooks.""

Vibe coding is a crowded space for startups, and Emergent faces competition from Lovable, a Swedish vibe coding app that raised $330 million in Series B funding at a $6.6 billion valuation in December. There is also Replit, which is reportedly raising funding at a $9 billion valuation.

Asked about his competitors, Jha said: ""A lot of the other platforms, they're great for prototyping, they're great for demos, but when it comes to really managing the entire lifecycle of software development, they fall short. That's a gap we are trying to fill in the market right now.""

Dangling a free Cybertruck in front of an employee is one way to get results.

Elon Musk made the unusual offer when xAI's engineers were setting up new GPU racks, according to then-technical staff member Sulaiman Ghori.

""Elon's like, 'OK, you can get a Cybertruck tonight if you can get a training run on these GPUs in 24 hours,'"" Ghori said on ""Relentless.""

The engineer — whom Ghori only referred to by their first name, Tyler — won the bet. Now, Ghori said he sees Tyler's Cybertruck outside his lunch window.

It's yet another example of Musk's drive for efficiency in execution. Employees at his companies are known to accept lower salaries but higher stock grants, betting their compensation on the company's performance. That's partly because of Musk's track record of growing startups into highly valued companies.

Four days after the podcast was published, Ghori revealed that he left xAI. ""Nothing but love to my former team and coworkers!"" he wrote on X.

Some famous faces popped in to question the timing of his exit. ""Is it because of the podcast?"" MrBeast replied, adding a popcorn emoji.

Musk has been known to make bets with his employees. Almost two decades ago, he reportedly wagered against early SpaceX employee Steve Davis. Davis put up $20; Musk put up the possibility of a SpaceX frozen yogurt machine. Davis won, and employees on the Hawthorne campus enjoyed their free fro-yo.

It helps that Musk's companies tend to have a flat org structure, giving Musk one-on-one contact with many of his employees. In the interview, Ghori said that there were three levels at xAI: individual contributors, cofounders, and Musk himself.

""No one tells me 'no,'"" Ghori said. He explained that, if he has a good idea, he can pursue it that same day and show it to Musk or the relevant customer.

There are also few deadlines, Ghori said, because projects are pitched and completed quickly.

""We don't have due dates,"" he said. ""It's always yesterday.""

The fast-paced, individualistic culture may take some getting used to. Ghori came to xAI after years as a startup founder. There was little guidance.

""Nobody told me what to do,"" Ghori said. ""My first day, they just gave me a laptop and a badge.""

Ghori had no team and wasn't assigned a desk. He sought out cofounder Greg Yang, who had been instrumental in his hiring. He soon started working on the Ask Grok feature in X.

As for the free Cybertruck, it's not Musk's first time promising to give one away. In March, he offered a Cybertruck to anyone who could find out who was behind a social media campaign from Democratic senators.

Sen. Cory Booker responded: ""It was me. Keep your truck.""

A favorite tool of President Donald Trump has been costing Americans, according to new study.

The brunt of US tariffs — 96% — have been paid by US buyers, research from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank, found, while about 4% of the tariff burden was paid by foreign exporters.

""American importers and consumers bear nearly all the cost,"" the researchers said of the tariffs.

The study, published Monday, said that the $200 billion increase in customs revenue that the US government raised in 2025 was a ""tax paid almost entirely by Americans.""

The research contradicts Trump's messaging that tariff costs would not be paid by Americans, but by other countries and overseas exporters. The president's aggressive tariff policy launched last year placed additional duties on dozens of trade partners, including China, India, and the European Union.

The Kiel Institute study examined more than 25 million shipment records, worth nearly $4 trillion, between January 2024 and November 2025. The researchers found that there was a ""near-complete pass-through"" of the tariffs.

""US import prices rise nearly one-for-one with tariffs, while trade volumes contract,"" the study said.

The findings echo other research that has found Americans are paying for tariffs, including from Harvard Business School and The Budget Lab at Yale. Analysts at Deutsche Bank and Bank of America also said last year that Americans were the ones paying for the tariffs.

The Kiel study said American importers and wholesalers are first hit by the tariff cost, followed by manufacturers and retailers, all of which must choose whether to absorb the tariff or pass it on to their customers. American consumers are then hit by increased prices, both on imported goods or American-made products that use foreign inputs. There's been more limited availability of goods in the US, the researchers found.

Trump has continued to use tariffs, saying on Saturday that he would impose additional tariffs on Denmark and other European countries unless they agree to a deal that would transfer Greenland to the US.

Many of Trump's tariff policies could also be undone. The Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on the legality of a host of Trump's tariffs that were instituted under an emergency national security law. Trump has said the US would be ""screwed"" if the tariffs are overturned.

Gig workers turn to apps like Uber and DoorDash to make money by offering rides and making deliveries.

Some independent contractors have come up with another way to make money using the apps: Selling access to those apps to other people, according to a new survey.

Forty-five percent of gig workers surveyed by TransUnion said that they had either rented or sold access to a gig work account on a gig work platform, the company said in a report released last week.

Gig work apps such as Uber, DoorDash, and Walmart's Spark have told Business Insider that they don't allow users to share their accounts with other people. It can pose a safety risk to the apps and the people who rely on them, since the apps vet workers when they sign up.

Twenty-five percent of the gig workers surveyed said they had rented out their account, while 20% said they had sold an account. Meanwhile, 45% said they had never done either.

The survey, which was conducted in August, asked 1,012 adults who were either current gig workers, had recently quit gig work, or were about to start doing gig work.

On Facebook, Telegram, and other social media platforms, users can find ads offering to sell or rent accounts for gig work apps. Many also offer third-party programs, called ""bots"" by gig workers, which claim to give users an edge in claiming deliveries.

At Walmart, some Spark delivery drivers have shown up at stores or customers' homes using names that don't appear to match who they actually are, Business Insider reported in 2023. Walmart has since taken additional steps to verify who its delivery workers are, such as asking them to stop by a store and show their ID.

Thiry said prospective gig workers might buy or rent accounts for several reasons, such as not having a long enough driving history or being unable to pass a background check.

In some parts of the US, there are also waitlists of people trying to work for some apps.

Sharing accounts with other people violates the terms of service for major gig work apps.

Uber says on its support site that it has ""zero tolerance for confirmed complaints of this nature,"" for example. A company spokesperson said that users who share their accounts risk ""losing access to the Uber platform permanently."" Last year, Uber required all its drivers and delivery workers to reverify their identities.

A DoorDash spokesperson also confirmed that the company removes workers from its app for sharing accounts. In 2024, DoorDash said it began requiring more frequent identity verification for some delivery workers to crack down on account sharing.

TransUnion, which provides identity verification services for apps and websites, asked gig workers about renting or selling accounts after seeing an uptick in suspicious activity, Colleen Thiry, director of TransUnion's gig economy business, told Business Insider.

""Our data was showing some signals of workers selling their accounts,"" Thiry said, such as accounts that were long associated with Android smartphones suddenly showing up on an iPhone.

TransUnion and the platforms follow up in such cases to verify the user's identity, Thiry said. In some cases, there's an innocent explanation: perhaps a gig worker logged into their account for the first time on a new phone.

There are other types of suspicious activity in gig work, TransUnion's survey found. Forty-three percent of gig workers surveyed said they have experienced tip-baiting, in which a customer offers a high tip only to cut it after the gig worker agrees to complete the order or trip.

That practice can be demotivating for gig workers, TransUnion's analysis of the survey said.

Fraud poses risks to the companies behind gig-work apps since both workers and customers need security, TransUnion's Thiry said.

""Both sides of that transaction need to feel safe and secure,"" Thiry said.

Netflix is breaking open its piggy bank to keep Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison from crashing its Warner Bros. deal.

The streaming giant just sweetened its offer for the Warner Bros. studio and HBO by offering all-cash, matching a key feature of Paramount's hostile bid. Warner Bros.' board of directors has approved the all-cash bid, and the companies said they expect Warner shareholders to vote on the transaction by April.

""Our revised all-cash agreement will enable an expedited timeline to a stockholder vote and provide greater financial certainty,"" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in a statement announcing the news.

""Today's revised merger agreement brings us even closer to combining two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world,"" David Zaslav, president and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, said in a statement on Tuesday.

While Netflix isn't raising its bid from $27.75 per share, converting $4.50 per share in stock to cash takes away a variable for Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders. Netflix shares are down 13% since the Warner Bros. deal was made public and have fallen 28% since late October.

""All cash removes any uncertainty around share price movements and makes Netflix's bid more comparable to Paramount's,"" said Joe Bonner, a media analyst at Argus Research. Bonner added that ""the sooner the shareholder approval vote happens, the better; the less time for Paramount to create more mischief.""

Paramount believes its all-cash offer of $30 per share for all of WBD is superior to Netflix's winning bid for WBD's key assets, which include its studio, HBO, and HBO Max, but not its TV networks. Ellison has made eight bids for WBD, all of which have been rejected. Paramount is now suing WBD while fighting for spots on its board.

A key remaining point of difference between the two bids hinges on the perceived value of WBD's networks. Paramount is looking to buy them, while Netflix is not.

If WBD's cable channels, such as CNN, TNT, and HGTV, are valued at less than $2.25 per share, or about $5.9 billion, then Paramount's proposal appears, at first glance, to be more appealing than Netflix's. However, WBD has said that it must knock off $1.79 per share from Paramount's bid to account for costs it would incur by changing course, like a $2.8 billion breakup fee to Netflix. That would mean WBD's cable networks only need to be worth $0.46 per share for Netflix's bid to be financially superior in the board's eyes.

Paramount has argued that the WBD cable networks it wants to buy are worth $0 per share, or only as much as the debt they're expected to carry. Ellison and company acknowledged ""the theoretical possibility"" that those TV assets could be worth $0.50 per share.

Most media analysts have a rosier view of WBD's cable business, valuing its channels anywhere from the low single digits to $3.51 per share. Even a glass-half-empty view based on the valuation of new cable company Versant would put WBD's networks at $1.20 per share as of last week, a Business Insider analysis found.

Netflix's updated all-cash offer helps solidify WBD's decision to choose it, after accounting for the added costs from Paramount's bid.

Unless WBD shareholders band against its board of directors, Paramount may face pressure to sweeten its offer by raising its bid.

For years, Amazon was cast as Walmart's great disruptor. Now, it's borrowing from the retail giant it once sought to upend.

The company is rolling out Walmart-inspired ideas, including ""Supercenter"" warehouses, a new distribution layer known internally as the ""1DC"" network, and microfulfillment centers within Whole Foods stores, according to internal documents obtained by Business Insider.

The shift reflects a hard lesson: mastery of e-commerce does not translate into dominance in groceries, particularly perishable items that drive frequent shopping. Walmart's dense network of stores and distribution centers, designed to move everyday goods quickly and cheaply, has proved difficult to replicate.

Nearly a decade after paying $13.7 billion for Whole Foods, Amazon still trails Walmart in everyday grocery shopping, and is now reshaping its retail infrastructure to compete head-on with Walmart's Supercenter model.

Earlier this month, plans emerged for a roughly 225,000-square-foot Amazon megastore near Chicago. Bigger than a typical Walmart Supercenter, the new concept is designed to let customers buy ""fresh groceries, household essentials, and general merchandise — all in one trip,"" according to Amazon.

Michael Levin and Josh Lowitz, cofounders of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, called the move ""mind-blowing"" and said ""it reveals a degree of Walmart jealousy that we didn't expect.""

There's a lot to be jealous about. With roughly 90% of the US population estimated to live within 10 miles of a Walmart store, the company's 5,000-plus locations give it a powerful edge in selling fresh food and other perishables, along with many other everyday staples.

According to research firm Numerator, Walmart accounted for about 21% of the US grocery market, both online and in-store, as of September. Amazon and Whole Foods, meanwhile, each held roughly 1.6% of the market.

Meanwhile, Walmart is leveraging its Supercenters to deliver online orders faster, challenging Amazon at its own game.

That's fueled a surge in Walmart shares, valuing the company close to $1 trillion. The stock is up almost 150% over 5 years, far outpacing Amazon's roughly 53% gain (although Amazon is still worth more).

Amazon does well with non-perishable goods and everyday essentials such as toothpaste and paper towels. Overall, it offers millions of products for same-day delivery.

But when it comes to more delicate food items, such as pears, meat, and cheese, the company knows it has more work to do.

A company spokesperson said Amazon serves more than 150 million US grocery customers, offers nearly 3 million grocery and household items, and provides same-day delivery in more than 9,000 cities and towns.

Grocery is an ""ever-growing"" part of its fast-delivery business, the spokesperson added, while noting that in 2025, Amazon added perishable groceries to its Same-Day Delivery service, now available in 2,300 locations, allowing customers to shop without trade-offs between speed, selection, and savings.

One element of this fresh Amazon effort is a new type of same-day delivery warehouse internally called an ""SSD Supercenter."" SSD refers to sub-same-day deliveries, typically within four hours. Unlike traditional SSD warehouses that tend to be smaller, these facilities are designed to be larger to close the selection gap, specifically with ""Walmart"" in groceries, the document said.

Internal planning documents show Amazon intended to launch at least five such sites last year. Amazon wanted to test whether customers would ""step-change their shopping habituation and engagement"" once the Supercenter warehouses went live, one of the documents stated. Amazon planned to add products not currently sold on its site to the new warehouse and take a more hands-on approach to inventory sourcing, with in-stock targets above 95%, according to the document.

Sub-same-day grocery delivery is still a tiny part of Amazon's business. At the end of September, it had 30 million eligible customers for this service, according to one of the internal documents obtained by Business Insider. Only 1.6 million of them, or roughly 5%, shopped through the service.

Amazon's Supercenter warehouses are part of a broader push to expand same-day grocery delivery. Internal forecasts called for at least 34 US same-day grocery sites in 2025. Amazon already operates over 80 same-day facilities nationwide, though not all handle groceries, according to Marc Wulfraat, president of logistics consultancy MWPVL.

Amazon is also planning to take the model overseas. Under an initiative known as Project Taylor, the company plans to expand sub-same-day grocery delivery across Europe. It also plans to pilot sub-two-hour ""ultrafast"" deliveries in London in 2026, one of the documents showed.

Less visible, but just as important, is a new upstream distribution layer called ""1DC.""

These facilities store the most frequently purchased products and replenish fulfillment centers as demand emerges. That can shift weeks' worth of inventory out of space-constrained fulfillment centers and into distribution sites optimized for palletized storage and rapid transfer.

One internal document described the change as a move from a ""push"" system, in which inventory is positioned based on forecasts, to a ""pull"" system that allows fulfillment centers to draw inventory from distribution centers as needed.

Amazon began rolling out the 1DC concept last year through new buildings and retrofits. By the end of 2025, the company planned to operate a dozen of these centers, capable of moving at least 20 million units a week, according to one of the documents. As of October 2025, the facilities only handled non-perishables, including shelf-stable food items, but not frozen or chilled products, the document stated.

The 1DC idea emerged after Amazon introduced one-day delivery in 2018, one of the documents stated. Longer delivery windows once allowed the company to rely on a single layer of warehouses that could ship inventory from any fulfillment center to any customer. But faster delivery promises made that model ""untenable,"" forcing Amazon toward a structure long used by traditional retailers, the document added.

MWPVL's Wulfraat said Walmart pioneered the distribution-center model that stores inventory for replenishing retail locations, while Amazon built its business around fulfillment centers that ship directly to consumers. Amazon also operates a cross-dock network to resupply its fulfillment centers, he said, and the 1DC sites represent a newer, more targeted layer of that system focused on high-velocity items.

Amazon's spokesperson told Business Insider that 1DC is part of a broader initiative the company previously announced to regionalize its delivery operations and reduce shipping costs.

Perhaps the clearest signal of Amazon's shift is its rethinking of Whole Foods. Once positioned mainly as a premium grocer, the chain is increasingly treated as logistics infrastructure.

Amazon has begun installing micro-fulfillment centers in the back of select stores, effectively turning them into local hubs for online orders.

One upgraded Whole Foods site in suburban Philadelphia, announced last year, now fulfills Amazon orders from the back of the store. The model lets shoppers buy Whole Foods-specific items while also ordering products available only on Amazon, reducing the need to shop at other retailers.

Amazon expects this store to serve roughly 100,000 e-commerce units a week by consolidating deliveries from nearby stores, and forecasts online order adoption to grow to 10% by the end of 2026, according to one of the documents.

This approach also mirrors Walmart's strategy of using its stores to fulfill online orders. Walmart said last year that it can offer same-day delivery to 93% of US households through its store-fulfilled network, with about 35% of those orders arriving within three hours.

The success of Amazon's new approach depends on one of the hardest problems in logistics: perishables.

Internal plans show Amazon aiming to expand its perishables distribution capacity from 2.6 billion units in 2025 to 3.3 billion units by the end of 2026. The increase would come from new distribution centers and tighter operational standards across the existing network.

The push is central to Amazon's same-day delivery strategy and its broader grocery ambitions. Company documents stress that delivering high-quality perishables quickly and reliably is essential to scaling the business.

The goal is expansive. One document calls for making perishables available to ""100% of Prime customers"" as quickly as possible.

There's far more to Davos fashion than the iconic blue beanie and a sea of suits.

Business Insider is on the ground at the annual World Economic Forum this week, and we'll be keeping an eye on the status symbols we spot among the mountain fashion.

From designer parkas to the iconic Goyard bag, here's what attendees are wearing to stay warm and stylish.

Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of eMed Population Health, was spotted at the event wearing a satin suit from Gabriela Hearst. The three-piece set, in its winter-white shade, featured a delicate floral print.

She wore the ensemble with ballet flats and chunky black glasses. 

Iuliia Bazhan, a model and the founder of Evoautism, attended in a full Chanel getup.

She wore a jacket and miniskirt from the fashion house's Coco Neige collection, a floor-length coat, and white boots with thick chain detailing.

One attendee, photographed by Business Insider, accessorized his navy jacket with a multicolored scarf, sunglasses with orange-tinted lenses, and blue leather gloves.

He also wore a thick gold ring and a giant watch.

One woman was seen in Davos wearing a bright-pink suit with a white mock-neck top. On its own, the outfit was chic and feminine — especially when paired with her Louis Vuitton tote bag.

However, she didn't accessorize with heels or jewelry. Instead, she wore tan snow boots and brown leather gloves.

Of course, they're doing so fashionably. One person wore dark-wash jeans with white socks, red sneakers, and a puffy coat that combined both colors with others across its statement print.

They also wore a thick red scarf and a lilac beanie.

Sarah Backhouse, an executive director at executive networking company World Fifty Group, matched the fur collar of her Frankie Shop coat with a cozy fur hat.

She accessorized the ensemble with Saint Laurent sunglasses and a Maison Goyard bag.

Wealth manager Andrew Gan gave his suit a Davos upgrade with a fur-lined coat and sunglasses as he headed to the Philippines House to moderate.

Nidhi Sinja, the head of marketing and communications for BCG North America, opted to carry a notebook in her quilted weatherproof Tory Burch bag.

She coordinated the look with a North Face coat and L.L. Bean boots, both in cream hues that matched her white purse.

Wendy Diamond is the founder and CEO of Women's Entrepreneurship Day Organization. She's also an investor and board advisor for numerous companies.

She wore a green satin suit, a statement charm necklace, and thick black boots. She told Business Insider that green is her ""happy color,"" and that she likes to wear bright colors when ""the world is so dark.""

When the CEO of Philip Morris International US travels, even for long trips, she takes a carry-on. Her trick: Pick a color for the week and coordinate outfits around that, with travel-well fabrics. For Davos this week, the color is black.

Jonathan Nowak Delgado, a senior advisor at nonprofit ViaTalenta Foundation, per his business card, has a strategy to stand out at Davos: wear a mix of bold colors.

His outfit included a statement orange scarf, which his mother made for him.

One attendee photographed by Business Insider was seen wearing a tweed suit beneath a gray fuzzy coat and a thin, floral scarf.

In addition to the fabric layers, she wore black platform boots, white sunglasses, Chanel earrings, and a pink Prada handbag.

Jolie Hunt, the CEO of communications agency Hunt & Gather, has worn some of the event's most statement-making looks.

On Monday, she donned a printed minidress from Balmain with sheer tights, paired it with Larroudé x Libertine pumps adorned with lips, and carried an Hermès Birkin bag.

The looming U.S. Supreme Court ruling on President Donald Trump's tariffs could affect Trump's threats to levy new tariffs on NATO members over the issue of Greenland's sovereignty, trade attorneys told CNBC.

The targeted tariff threats Trump made over the weekend would likely rest on the same legal authority as the tariffs he imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, the attorneys said. The legality of that strategy will be decided by the Supreme Court, with a ruling expected as early as this week.

""Although the president hasn't specified if these tariffs would be IEEPA-based, the U.S. Supreme Court decision on IEEPA would likely affect the outcome of the threatened Greenland tariffs,"" said Michael Lowell, partner and chair of the Global Regulatory Enforcement Group at Reed Smith.

""Similar to the Brazil tariffs; if the Supreme Court rules IEEPA doesn't give the president tariff power, then these tariffs being threatened on NATO members would be illegal,"" Lowell said.

Trump announced Saturday that if a deal is not reached allowing Washington to acquire Greenland, the eight European countries would face increasing tariffs, starting at 10% on Feb. 1 and rising to 25% on June 1. 

The court's latest batch of decisions issued Tuesday morning did not include the tariffs case.

If the court overturns the tariffs, ""it may still be necessary for companies that import from those countries to bring suit to enforce,"" Lowell said. But ""that would be a quick lawsuit since the law would be clear by the ruling.""

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said it's ""very unlikely"" that the Supreme Court will overturn Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs. Even if the administration loses, Trump officials have said new tariffs will go into effect immediately.

One of the other strategies the administration may turn to is Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Trade attorneys say the president could use the recently completed Section 232 investigation on critical minerals to levy tariffs. Greenland is a mineral-rich island that is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark.

In a Jan. 14 proclamation, Trump invoked Section 232 authority to direct the negotiation of agreements with foreign nations to ""ensure the United States has adequate critical mineral supplies and to mitigate the supply chain vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.""

If negotiations do not work, the proclamation says, ""it may be appropriate to impose import restrictions, such as tariffs, if satisfactory agreements are not reached in a timely manner.""

While recent Section 232 actions from Trump included the immediate imposition of tariffs on products, in the latest Section 232 policy on critical minerals the language says that the executive branch of the government reserves the right of the president to impose tariffs.

""Regardless of the IEEPA outcome, Section 232 remains a powerful and unaffected tool that the administration will likely continue to deploy for additional tariffs. Importantly, we note that these tariffs do not stack on top of IEEPA tariffs,"" TD Cowen analysts wrote in a recent note to clients.

French President Emmanuel Macron has hit out at ""bullies"" as he called for U.S. tariffs on European countries to be abolished.

Macron made the comments in a strongly-worded address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday,  which followed U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to put 200% levies on French wines, as punishment for resisting U.S. attempts to annex Greenland.

Without mentioning Trump by name, Macron said: ""We need more growth. We need more stability in this world, but we do prefer respect to bullies."" He added: ""We do prefer rule of law to brutality.""

The French president also confirmed one possible response was using the Anti-Coercion Instrument or ACI.

The ACI could see the EU restrict U.S. suppliers' access to the EU market, excluding them from participation in public tenders in the bloc, as well as putting export and import restrictions on goods and services and putting potential limits on foreign direct investment in the region.

He called the possibility of being forced to use ACI against the U.S. ""crazy.""

""The crazy thing is that we can be put in a situation to use the anti-coercion mechanism for the very first time,"" if the U.S. imposes additional tariffs on Europe, Macron said.

He called for the ""dismantling"" of tariffs, adding: ""It doesn't make sense to have tariffs and be divided, and even to be threatened now with additional tariffs.""

He called Trump's levies an ""endless accumulation of new tariffs that are fundamentally unacceptable, even more so when they are used as a leverage against territorial sovereignty.""

Macron called for ""more cooperation"" among European nations. ""Without collective governance, cooperation gives way to relentless competition,"" he said.

""Competition from the United States of America, through trade agreements that undermine our export interests, demand maximum concessions and openly aim to weaken and subordinate Europe,"" Macron said.

Tensions are high at Davos after Trump announced the 200% tariff on French wines, in addition to threatening to escalate tariffs imposed on eight European countries if they don't accept his move to acquire Greenland.

Macron said France had decided to send soldiers to Greenland ""without threatening anyone, but just supporting an ally in another European country, Denmark.""

Last week, France joined Operation Arctic Endurance by sending 15 soldiers to the self-governing Danish territory, joining personnel from Germany and Norway.

Trump is due to speak at Davos on Wednesday. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday that the president's stance was showing the world that ""the U.S. is back.""

Billionaire investor Ray Dalio warned Tuesday that President Donald Trump's aggressive political direction could spark a new phase of global financial conflict, as foreign governments and investors reconsider their appetite for U.S. assets amid rising unease and economic tensions.

""On the other side of trade deficits and trade wars, there are capital and capital wars,"" Dalio told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""If you take the conflicts, you can't ignore the possibility of the capital wars. In other words, maybe there's not the same inclination to buy at U.S. debt and so on.""

The founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world's largest hedge funds, is concerned that countries holding large amounts of U.S. dollars and Treasurys may become less willing to finance U.S. deficits if trust erodes. At the same time, the U.S. continues to issue large volumes of debt, creating a problematic situation if confidence weakens on either side, Dalio said.

""We know that both the holders of U.S. dollars are denominated ... and those who need it, the United States, are worried about each other. Right? So if you have other countries who are holding it, and they're worried about each other, and we're producing a lot of it, that's a big issue,"" he said.

Treasury prices tumbled Tuesday as investors weighed renewed tariff threats from Washington that revived fears of a trade war with Europe and spurred a flight away from U.S. assets. The president has intensified his rhetoric on Greenland, threatening to impose new tariffs on countries opposing the sale of the Danish territory to the United States. 

Dalio said history offers multiple examples of similar episodes in which economic conflict escalated beyond trade into capital flows and currency disputes.

""When you have conflicts, international geopolitical conflicts, even allies do not want to hold each other's debt. They prefer to go to a hard currency. This is logical and it's factual, and it's repeated throughout the world history,"" he said.

Dalio reiterated the importance of diversification, arguing that investors should not rely too heavily on any single asset class or country. He highlighted gold as a key hedge in periods of financial stress, recommending it make up between 5% and 15% of a typical portfolio.

""It does very well when other assets don't do well,"" Dalio said. ""It is an effective diversifier.""

Spot gold rose to an all-time high of $4,689.39 on Tuesday as investors flocked to safe-haven assets on intensifying tensions.

In this article

After a year marked by AI-driven layoffs, influential leaders and top executives are now warning that we can expect to see a huge ramp up in anxiety around the technology in 2026.

Kristalina Georgieva, managing director at the International Monetary Fund, said Tuesday that AI is ""a major factor for economic growth,"" in a conversation with CNBC's Karen Tso and Steve Sedgwick at the World Economic Forum's flagship conference in Davos, Switzerland. 

""We see potential to up of 0.8% boost to growth over the next years, but it is hitting the labor market like a tsunami, and most countries and most businesses are not prepared for it,"" Georgieva explained. 

""What do they [countries and companies] have to do? They need to think about the new skills that are already necessary and how they're going to have these new skills,"" she added. 

AI was seen as a significant contributing factor to nearly 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. in 2025, according to December data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Major firms were citing AI as part of the reason for laying off workers. 

Amazon announced 15,000 jobs cuts last year, while Salesforce's CEO Marc Benioff said 4,000 customer support workers had been let go because AI was already doing 50% of the work at the company. 

Other companies that cited AI in restructuring were tech consultancy firm Accenture and airline group Lufthansa. 

Worker sentiment around AI is shifting as AI layoffs continue to dominate headlines. In fact, employee concerns about job loss due to AI have skyrocketed from 28% in 2024 to 40% in 2026, according to preliminary findings from consultancy firm Mercer's Global Talent Trends 2026 report, which surveyed 12,000 people worldwide. 

Mercer's research shows that 62% of employees feel leaders underestimate AI's emotional and psychological impact. 

""Anxiety about AI will go from a low hum to a loud roar this year,"" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday. ""This will be reflected in lawsuits over everything from copyright to privacy, data centre location and protection of young people from chatbots encouraging self-harm or worse."" 

The note cited a Stanford study in November, which referenced a 16% relative decline in employment for graduates in roles exposed to AI, as opposed to jobs for experienced employees remaining stable since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. 

""Anxiety around job displacement will also become far greater,"" the analysts added, but noted that the Stanford study was ""inconclusive and noisy.""

Companies attributing much of the blame for job cuts to AI should be taken ""with a grain of salt,"" as ""AI redundancy washing will be a significant feature of 2026,"" according to the Deutsche Bank analysts.

Indeed, some studies show that the impact of AI on the labor market has so far been muted. AI hasn't yet caused widespread job losses, Yale University's Budget Lab said in a report in October. The lab analyzed U.S. labor market data from 2022 to 2025 and found that the share of workers in different jobs hadn't shifted massively since ChatGPT's debut. 

Sander van't Noordende, the CEO of Randstad, the world's largest staffing firm, told CNBC in Davos on Tuesday that the role of AI in job cuts is being overstated. 

""I would argue that those 50,000 job losses are not driven by AI, but are just driven by the general uncertainty in the market. It's too early to link those to AI,"" Noordende said. 

He added that ""2026 is the year of the great adaptation,"" where individuals and team leaders need to start thinking about how to integrate AI and lock in productivity gains. 

""I see AI as a big opportunity for our industry to do a better job for talent. Reaching out to talent. Connecting with talent, evaluating talent, onboarding talents. Lots of those activities can be done by AI,"" he said. 

Mercer's report additionally found that an overwhelming 97% of investors said funding decisions would be negatively impacted by firms that fail to systematically upskill workers on AI and bring them forward into the future. 

Over three-quarters of investors said they're more likely to invest in companies that provide AI education to employees. 

""We've gone from a couple of years ago, even last year, everyone was AI-washing annual reports, if you stuck AI in, you got an immediate bump,"" Ravin Jesuthasan, a future of work expert and senior partner at Mercer, told CNBC. 

""Now you've got the opposite phenomenon where people are sort of running for the hills...I think what you're seeing next is investors saying... 'How are you combining your workforces with AI? How are you bringing your workforces along?'"" 

Jesuthasan stressed that investors are saying they're going to ""actively invest or disinvest in companies that aren't getting to the optimal combinations of humans and machines,"" because they see upskilling as critical to ""sustaining the economic performance of the organization.""

Greenlanders are ""bewildered"" by President Donald Trump's ""devastating"" bid to annex the Arctic island, its business minister has told CNBC, as the issue turns into a geopolitical firestorm.

Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday ahead of Trump addressing the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Naaja Nathanielsen, minister for business and mineral resources, described the international attention as ""quite devastating"" for many of the roughly 57,000 Greenlanders.

Asked how people in Greenland have been feeling amid Trump's pursuit of the island, Nathanielsen said: ""People are worried, people are afraid, people are bewildered.""

""[We have] always considered ourselves as an ally of the U.S. and have tried to accommodate the needs from the U.S. over the years and done so happily,"" Nathanielsen said via video call. 

""To all of a sudden find ourselves in the midst of a storm that's about acquiring us like a product or a property, it's really difficult for us — not to mention the threats of military action and an actual occupation of our country.""

Her comments come as the U.S. president stepped up his efforts to acquire the self-governing Danish territory, which he has claimed is ""imperative"" for U.S. national security. On Monday, he answered ""no comment"" when asked by NBC if he'd use military force to seize it.

""There can be no going back,"" Trump said of his plans in a social media post on Tuesday. 

The U.S. president on Saturday pledged to impose a rising wave of tariffs on eight European countries from Feb. 1 for opposing the U.S. acquiring Greenland.

European political leaders have sought to push back and are expected to hold talks over how to respond in the coming days. French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday described Trump's tariff threats as ""fundamentally unacceptable,"" while British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the move ""completely wrong.""

Nathanielsen told CNBC she had been ""really moved by the strong show of solidarity"" from European political leaders. ""You cannot go along with a scheme where you have to accept that an ally occupies another ally,"" she said.

Protests have taken place in Greenland's capital, Nuuk, and Denmark's Copenhagen in recent days, with people marching with red and white Greenlandic flags.

Opinion polls have shown that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose U.S. control, while a strong majority support independence from Denmark.

Nathanielsen said: ""We have always known that our position in the world geographically causes some tensions. We're used to this. We used to be a colony of Denmark. So, we're not we're not unfamiliar with complexity and controversy and conflict — but we have always found our ways to adapt to the situation and work with it. 

""And right now, I think we're facing a threat we have never seen before. So, I am absolutely certain that were we to become occupied, that would mean the destruction of our culture. And I find that quite devastating."" 

Nathanielsen said the island's lawmakers would seek more clarity on how it can accommodate the U.S. ""without being swallowed up"" by it.

 ""The threat of occupation is devastating to us. It is absolutely not something that we would be able to work with at all,"" Nathanielsen said.

""So, we do not want to be bought. We have made that quite clear. Of course, we don't want to be occupied — what country in the world would want that? But we do want dialogue. We do want collaboration. And we do want to lower the temperature,"" she added.

In 2009, Greenland was granted greater autonomy over its domestic affairs through the Self-Government Act, which also gave the island the right to hold an independence referendum. Denmark remains responsible for its foreign, defense and security policies. 

Most Greenlandic political parties support independence but disagree over when and how to reach it. The independence movement has become a balancing act between the island's ultimate goal of self-determination and the need for Denmark's financial support for essential services, such as health and education. 

Speaking to CNBC earlier this month, Aaja Chemnitz, an MP representing Greenland in the Danish Parliament, said Greenlanders wanted to ""make sure that we're not dehumanized, which I think we have been in this whole situation.""

""The people are resilient. And I think it's important to remember that, of course, you can't buy a country, but you can also not buy a population,"" Chemnitz told CNBC on Jan. 8.

In this article

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs are starting to be reflected in the price of some items, as sellers weigh how to absorb the shock of the added costs.

Amazon and many of its third-party merchants pre-purchased inventory to try to get ahead of the tariffs and keep prices low for customers, but most of that supply ran out last fall, Jassy said in a Tuesday interview with CNBC's Becky Quick at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 

""So you start to see some of the tariffs creep into some of the prices, some of the items, and you see some sellers are deciding that they're passing on those higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, some are deciding that they'll absorb it to drive demand and some are doing something in between,"" Jassy said. ""I think you're starting to see more of that impact."" 

The comments are a notable shift from last year, when Jassy said Amazon hadn't seen ""prices appreciably go up"" a few months after Trump announced wide-ranging tariffs. 

Last April, Jassy also predicted that some sellers may be forced to pass the added cost of the tariffs on to consumers because some businesses ""don't have 50% extra margin that you can play with."" 

Amazon sellers previously told CNBC they were considering or had already raised the price of some items due to higher import costs in the wake of the tariffs. 

A major retail trade association warned last August that the trade war would loom over companies' inventory ordering plans this Spring, which could lead to higher prices, fewer products on the shelves and job losses.  

Amazon is trying to ""keep prices as low as possible"" for consumers, but in some cases, price hikes may be unavoidable, Jassy said Tuesday.

""At a certain point, because retail is, as you know, a mid-single digit operating margin business, if people's costs go up by 10%, there aren't a lot of places to absorb it,"" Jassy said. 

""You don't have endless options,"" he added.

Consumers remain ""pretty resilient"" and are still spending amid the tariffs, Jassy said. But they have impacted some shoppers' purchasing habits, with Amazon observing some people trading down to lower priced items and bargain hunting, while others are holding off from buying higher-priced discretionary products, he said.

In this article

Netflix has adjusted its offer for Warner Bros. Discovery's studio and streaming assets to an all-cash bid, according to an SEC filing Tuesday. 

Netflix now plans to pay $27.75 per WBD share entirely in cash to acquire WBD's streaming platform HBO Max and the Warner Bros. film studio. The two companies initially reached a deal in December, composed of a combination of cash and stock at an equity value of $72 billion. 

""The WBD Board continues to support and unanimously recommend our transaction, and we are confident that it will deliver the best outcome for stockholders, consumers, creators and the broader entertainment community,"" said Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, said in a release on Tuesday. 

""Our revised all-cash agreement will enable an expedited timeline to a stockholder vote and provide greater financial certainty at $27.75 per share in cash, plus the value from the planned separation of Discovery Global,"" Sarandos said in the release.

CNBC's David Faber and other media outlets reported last week that Netflix was likely to make the adjustment as Paramount Skydance continues to build up pressure in its hostile takeover attempt for the entirety of WBD, which also includes cable TV networks such as CNN and TNT. 

With the offer amendment, the timeline for shareholder approval could shift to as early as late February or early March, Faber reported last week, citing sources familiar with the matter. Previously, shareholders were expected to vote on the deal in the spring or early summer.

WBD's board unanimously accepted the amended Netflix offer, according to Tuesday's filing. The board has twice recommended that shareholders reject Paramount's hostile bid in favor of the Netflix transaction. 

Paramount recently sued for information in its hostile pursuit of WBD and has also launched a proxy fight, informing WBD shareholders that it intends to nominate directors for election to the Warner Bros. Discovery board at the company's annual 2026 meeting. 

On Tuesday WBD also filed a preliminary proxy statement seeking shareholder approval for its deal with Netflix. If the deal were to be approved, WBD's cable TV networks would be spun off into a new, publicly traded entity known as Discovery Global. 

If the deal were to be approved, the separation is expected to be completed in six to nine months, prior to the closing of the transaction between Netflix and WBD. 

Netflix reports earnings after the bell Tuesday, and investors will be looking for further updates on the sale process.

President Donald Trump is showing the world ""the U.S. is back,"" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC, as tensions rise over the president's bid to acquire Greenland.

Asked about the president's agenda at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where Trump is set to make an address on Wednesday, Bessent said: ""The U.S. is back, and this is what U.S. leadership looks like.""

Tensions are high at the meeting after Trump raised the stakes on his intention to acquire the self-governing Danish territory, which has rattled the NATO military alliance. Overnight, he announced 200% tariffs on French wines and Champagne, and said the U.K. was showing ""total weakness"" by handing sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius.

Meanwhile, Denmark sent more troops to Greenland for a military exercise.

Bessent said U.S. control of Greenland was ""important,"" adding: ""That will stop any kind of a kinetic war, so why not pre-empt the problem before it starts?""

Bessent told CNBC that European countries should contribute their ""fair share"" towards defense. ""While the Europeans were building schools, having healthcare, we have been defending the world,"" he said.

Trump has repeatedly said taking control of Greenland is vital for U.S. national security, frequently citing concerns about Russia and China's Arctic influence. 

Bessant criticized European leadership, suggesting that they would create a ""working group"" to retaliate against Trump's threat of ""escalating tariffs.""  

""My guess is their next move will be to form a working group, the dreaded European working group,"" Bessant said.

He also criticized Europe's approach to the war in Ukraine. ""They are still buying Russian energy, they're still buying refined products from India made from Russian oil, so four years in, the Europeans are still financing the war against themselves,"" Bessant said. 

Europe remains the biggest buyer of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG), per December figures, while the continent buys 6% of the country's crude oil. EU sanctions against products made from Russian oil are set to come into effect on Wednesday. 

The cost of drugs in the U.S. was also on Bessent's agenda and he described European countries as ""free riding"" on the price of medications. 

In December, nine of the largest pharmaceutical companies signed deals to lower their prices in the U.S. with the aim of matching those overseas. ""The idea here is equalisation over time, the U.S. consumer and our health services will pay less and the Europeans have to pay more, they've been free riding.""

Bessent said he held a meeting with the G7 as well as Mexico, India, South Korea and Australia last week to ""avoid this chokehold that China has on minerals."" Minerals are used in a vast range of industries and products, from EVs to defense, and China controlled more than two-thirds of rare earth mine production in 2024.

Energy costs will be key to deciding which country wins the AI race, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has said.

As countries race to build AI infrastructure to capitalize on the technology's promise of huge efficiency gains, Nadella told the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Tuesday that ""GDP growth in any place will be directly correlated"" to the cost of energy in using AI.

He pointed to a new global commodity in ""tokens"" — basic units of processing that are bought by users of AI models, allowing them to run tasks. 

""The job of every economy and every firm in the economy is to translate these tokens into economic growth, then if you have a cheaper commodity, it's better.""

Hyperscalers like Microsoft have been spending billions on building out data centers to power AI.

Microsoft said at the start of 2025 that it expected to spend $80 billion on the construction of AI data centers. A total of 50% of the tech giant's spending is outside of the U.S., Nadella said. 

""I would say we will quickly lose even the social permission to actually take something like energy, which is a scarce resource, and use it to generate these tokens, if these tokens are not improving health outcomes, education outcomes, public sector efficiency, private sector competitiveness across all sectors,"" Nadella said.

Europe has some of the highest energy costs in the world, which rose after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the subsequent sanctions. 

""It's not just the production side,"" Nadella said. ""If you think about the TCO [total cost of ownership] it's like, are you a cheap producer of energy? Can you build the data centers? What's the cost curve of the silicon in the system?""

Turning to Europe, Nadella said the region needs to have more of a global outlook to be successful in the age of AI.

""European competitiveness is about the competitiveness of their output globally, not just in Europe,"" he said. ""I think sometimes when you come to Europe, there's a lot of conversation about just Europe.""

The European economy has thrived in the past 300 years because the continent was able to produce things the world needed, said Nadella, adding that to do that again the continent has to invest in having energy and tokens needed to power AI in the region.

""Whenever we come to Europe, everyone's talking about sovereignty,"" he said. ""Guess what, Europe actually should be much more concerned about access to their industrial companies, their financial services companies...as opposed to just thinking that somehow, by protecting Europe, you're going to be competitive.

""You are only going to be competitive if the products coming out of Europe are globally competitive,"" he said. ""That's, I think, what needs to change.""

In this article

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said Tuesday that ""there has to be some regulation"" of artificial intelligence, pointing to several documented cases of suicide linked to the technology.

""This year, you really saw something pretty horrific, which is these AI models became suicide coaches,"" Benioff told CNBC's Sarah Eisen Tuesday at the World Economic Forum's flagship conference in Davos, Switzerland.

Benioff's call for regulation echoed a similar call he made about social media years ago at Davos.

In 2018, Benioff said social media should be treated like a health issue, and said the platforms should be regulated like cigarettes, ""They're addictive, they're not good for you.""

""Bad things were happening all over the world because social media was fully unregulated,"" he said Tuesday, ""and now you're kind of seeing that play out again with artificial intelligence.""

If you are having suicidal thoughts or are in distress, contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselor.

Ripple's CEO predicted Binance would re-enter the U.S., as the cryptocurrency exchange's co-CEO said it would adopt a ""wait-and-see"" approach.

Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, exited the U.S. in 2023 as part of a deal in which then CEO, Changpeng Zhao, pleaded guilty to criminal charges over the failure to prevent money laundering on the exchange, as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice.

Zhao was pardoned by U.S President Donald Trump in October. A Bloomberg report in December said the company was mulling re-entering the U.S. market.

In an interview with CNBC in Davos on Tuesday, Binance's co-CEO, Richard Teng, said it was taking a ""wait and see"" approach to re-entering the U.S., which he called ""a very important marketplace.""

Shortly afterwards, in a separate interview with CNBC, Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of blockchain company Ripple, predicted it would happen.

""It's a very large market, and ... not that many years ago, they were a material player,"" he said of Binance.

""I think they'll come back because they're a capitalistic, innovative company that wants to solve ... larger markets and continue to grow,"" Garlinghouse added.

Garlinghouse said Binance's re-entry would increase competition and bring more people into the market.

""I think it will actually have the positive impact of bringing more people into the market, in part because it'll reduce pricing,"" Garlinghouse said. ""Today their [Binance] pricing is lower on a global basis than what we see here in the U.S.""

The U.S. passed the GENIUS Act last year to regulate stablecoins and is debating approving the Clarity Act, a framework for regulating cryptocurrencies.

The Clarity Act faced opposition from some crypto industry participants. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong posted last week on X that his company ""can't support the bill as written.""

However, Teng and Garlinghouse backed it. 

""I would say that any regulation will be better than no regulation,"" Teng, who is a former regulator, said during his CNBC interview.

""Once you have clarity, you can then start working around those rules, right? And in the first instance, most regulations will not be perfect, but it is then going through a round of enhancements,"" Teng said. 

Garlinghouse said he was ""surprised"" at Armstrong's ""vehemence"" in coming out against the Clarity Act. 

""I mean, basically the rest of the industry, including exchanges that compete with Coinbase, were still supporting it,"" Garlinghouse said.

""My understanding is everyone's kind of still at the table. I'm hopeful we find the how to break that impasse ... If we want the industry to continue to grow ... we need things like the Genius Act, we need things like the Clarity Act.""

                            Here's why ETH price is failing to rise alongside active addresses | Credit: Hameem Sarwar                        


Key Takeaways

Ethereum (ETH) has presented a startling divergence between on-chain utility and market valuation.

Over the last few days, network activity on the blockchain has been heating up. Yet Ethereum's price still stalls below $3,500, currently hovering around $3,200 at this writing.

That gap is the story right now. So, why is ETH struggling to keep pace with the rise in active addresses, and what could this imply for the price? Let's find out.

Activity is exploding first. Etherscan-based trackers show daily transactions spiking to record levels in mid-January, with prints around 2.8 million per day.

At the same time, based on Santiment data, daily active addresses exceeded 849,00 on Jan. 20, signaling broad participation.

Even more interesting, Glassnode-cited reporting says the “new user” cohort is growing fast.

First-time interacting addresses reportedly climbed from roughly 4 million to 8 million over about 30 days. That looks like onboarding, not just leveraging churn.

Typically, the rise in these metrics should be bullish for Ethereum's price. Unfortunately, that is not the case as ETH has been consolidating around the same area over the past week.

Regulatory noise is one anchor. Coinbase pulled support for the Senate's draft CLARITY Act on Jan. 14, 2026. That move slowed the “regulatory clarity” trade. It also made institutions hesitate.

Staking is the next anchor. Staked ETH has hit record levels near 36 million ETH, or about 30% of supply. That sounds bullish. It reduces the liquid supply.

However, it also changes who holds the bag. Stakers chase yield. They often sell less. But they also buy less aggressively on breakouts. That can flatten upside bursts.

Then comes the leverage ceiling. Liquidation data shows a heavy pocket of short liquidations sitting just above $3,400.

That creates a magnet and a battlefield at once. Bears defend the zone because a clean break can trigger a squeeze. Bulls hesitate because they know the fight will be violent.

Put it together, and ETH's current price action starts to make sense. Usage surges. Fresh wallets arrive. Yet macro and positioning keep price pinned.

That is why the next move could be sharp. If spot demand stays real and ETH clears $3,400 to $3,500, the squeeze dynamics can flip fast.

However, if it fails again, the market may keep valuing Ethereum's price like a range trade, even while the chain runs at full speed.

While ETH can still trend higher over the long run, this short-term signal argues against a clean breakout. The number of addresses holding ≥10,000 ETH has been falling for three straight months.

That matters because this cohort usually represents whales, treasuries, significant funds, and long-duration allocators.

When this metric declines, it often means one of two things is happening. First, big holders may be reducing exposure. They distribute into strength.

They also trim during uncertainty. That behavior adds supply at key levels and makes it harder for the price to punch through resistance, such as the $3,500 region.

Second, even if they are not selling outright, they may be breaking up holdings across wallets. That still lowers the “whale count,” and it can weaken the market's perception of conviction.

Either way, the signal can affect price through liquidity. So, if whale presence continues to shrink, Ethereum's price can become more sensitive to sell-offs.

From a technical perspective, Ethereum's price failed to break above the $3,438 resistance on the daily chart.

That rejection matters because it shows sellers still control the supply zone, and buyers have not forced a clean trend expansion yet.

Momentum has also cooled fast. The Money Flow Index (MFI) has dropped sharply, which signals weaker inflows and fading demand.

When the MFI falls like this after a rejection, ETH often drifts toward support because buyers stop stepping in with the same urgency.

Price structure adds to the risk. Notably, ETH's price has slipped below the 20-day EMA (blue), a move that usually signals a shift from “buy-the-dip” to “sell-the-rally”.

In other words, the 20 EMA is no longer providing support. It becomes a ceiling until price reclaims it.

If this setup holds, Ethereum's price risks breaking the support near $3,100. If that level gives way, the next move could cut below the $3,000 psychological mark, especially if volume rises on down candles.

Still, the bearish case is not set in stone. If buying pressure returns and ETH reclaims the 20 EMA, it could quickly reset momentum.

A break above $3,438 would invalidate the immediate downside threat and signal that demand is strong enough to absorb sellers.

In that bullish scenario, ETH could rally toward $3,942. If momentum accelerates and the breakout sticks, the next extension zone comes into view near $4,300.

Copy link

A version of this article appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on January 20. Sign up here.

GM, Tim here,

Ethereum transactions are soaring — but scams seem to be driving the surge.

On January 16, daily transactions hit an all-time high of more than 2.8 million, according to data from BitInfoCharts. The same day, new Ethereum addresses created in the past 30 days topped 12.6 million, the highest rolling 30-day total ever, according to Etherscan. 

The record-breaking transaction bump, however, was mostly caused by a mass address poisoning attack, according to research by Andrey Sergeenkov, an independent journalist. Blockchain security experts reviewed the research.

“Mass address poisoning attacks are a persistent issue, and it's getting worse,” Gonçalo Magalhães, head of security at Immunefi, a crypto bug bounty and security platform, told me. 

Address poisoning attacks are a type of crypto scam where attackers send tiny amounts of crypto from a lookalike address to a victim's wallet. 

The goal is to trick the victim into mistakenly sending funds to that address believing it's legitimate. It relies on clunky user interfaces, a lack of warnings, and carelessness on the part of the victim. 

Such attacks are like spam phishing emails — low cost and low success rate, but if just one or two of the thousands of people targeted fall for them then it's worth it for the attacker.

The losses inflicted by address poisoning attacks can be enormous. Last month, a crypto user lost $50 million after falling victim to one, according to Scam Sniffer, a crypto security platform. 

“Over the past seven days alone, we've been detecting more than one million address poisoning preparations per day on Ethereum, underscoring the scale at which these campaigns are currently operating,” Michael Pearl, a vice president at crypto security firm Cyvers, told me.

Ethereum's December Fusaka upgrade has helped reduce the cost of transactions, scaling the blockchain to more users and opening up new use cases.

But it's a double-edged sword. 

The increased bandwidth also means mass address poisoning attacks have become much cheaper for scammers to pull off. 

Additionally, Magalhães said, recent Ethereum user experience upgrades, such as those enabling account abstraction, have made it easier for users to inadvertently sign a transaction they don't fully understand.

So, what can be done to combat such attacks? Stop Ethereum users falling for them.

Just as services like Google's Gmail scan email attachments for viruses and warn users of attacks, crypto wallets also need to provide warnings to stop users falling for address poisoning. 

“Wallets need to clearly convey intent and surface risk,” Magalhães said. “We also need more adoption of naming systems like ENS, because human-readable identifiers make lookalike address attacks harder.”

Some wallets already include features to help users avoid address poisoning. 

Rabby, for example, warns users if they've never interacted with an address before when sending funds, assesses potential transactions for suspicious activity, and flags phishing-related transfers in a user's transaction history.

But until more wallets adopt these features, crypto users will have to remain extra vigilant.

Investing

Bitcoin dominance holds steady around 59%, creating room for selective altcoin moves without forcing defensive positioning. 

The Altcoin Season Index has climbed from 37 to above 50 in early January, still short of the 75 threshold needed for a confirmed altseason.

XRP processed 1.45M transactions on January 13, a 180-day high, while ETF inflows exceeded $1.3B, yet the price remained stuck near $2.10

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is holding its ground while activity shifts toward networks showing real usage. XRP's (CRYPTO: XRP) ledger just hit a 180-day transaction high, Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) is quietly outperforming on throughput and returns near $145, and capital appears to be rotating to altcoins rather than rushing.

This setup has reopened the altcoin season debate, though the signals look more selective than past blow-off cycles. Instead of broad speculation, the market is rewarding function, speed, and settlement demand. Whether these early moves sustain or fade like past January surges depends on whether activity holds and Bitcoin dominance breaks down.

XRP Ledger activity quietly strengthened while price stays range-bound. On January 13, the network processed 1.45 million transactions in a single day, marking the highest daily count in six months. The spike followed a steady upward trend that began in late 2025, coinciding with new payment corridors through Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity platform and stablecoin integrations like RLUSD.

This gap between activity and price often appears early in crypto rotation cycles. When networks process more value without speculative excess, repricing tends to lag. Analysts tracking filtered payment data note mid-sized transfers are rising, pointing to operational demand rather than short-term noise.

XRP's advantage lies in consistency rather than speed. Its efficiency in cross-border settlement keeps it relevant for institutional use cases that don't depend on headline momentum. Within the broader altcoin season 2026 framework, this pattern frames XRP as infrastructure being accumulated—not an asset being chased late. ETF inflows exceeding $1.3 billion support the accumulation thesis.

Solana pulled ahead as capital prioritizes speed and throughput over macro narratives. A price near $145 masks stronger relative performance, as network activity continues to expand while Bitcoin and Ethereum stall. Daily transactions remain elevated, driven by DeFi flows, trading activity, and applications requiring fast settlement without cost friction.

What stands out is how closely price strength tracks usage. High transaction counts, rising DEX volumes, and stablecoin movement suggest Solana is absorbing real flow, not short-lived speculation. Recent infrastructure upgrades improved reliability, helping developers stay active even as Ethereum traffic fragments across Layer 2s.

This operational consistency explains why rotation capital keeps favoring Solana during risk-on windows. While XRP vs. Solana debates often focus on price, Solana's edge right now comes from throughput translating directly into market demand. As long as activity holds, selective alt strength remains supported rather than stretched.

Bitcoin dominance near 59% has shifted the market's tone. Instead of pulling liquidity away from everything else, Bitcoin is holding its share while letting select altcoins breathe. That balance has historically allowed focused rallies to develop without forcing traders into defensive positioning.

Past cycles show flat Bitcoin dominance levels often precede crypto rotation into assets with real usage—not broad speculation. Capital spreads outward in controlled moves, rewarding networks showing growth rather than chasing narratives. The current setup mirrors those periods, with strength appearing in specific large caps instead of across the board.

From a structural perspective, stable Bitcoin dominance suggests crypto rotation rather than panic or euphoria. Bitcoin remains the anchor, but it's no longer crowding out opportunities. If this balance holds, altcoins can continue advancing on fundamentals rather than momentum alone. For altcoin season 2026 to fully confirm, dominance would need to break below 57% and sustain lower levels.

Altcoin rallies rarely begin on charts. They start on-chain, where rising activity shows up before prices move.

During 2017 and again in 2021, transaction spikes across major networks appeared weeks before prices reacted. XRP's payment volumes and early high-throughput chains showed steady growth while prices drifted sideways. About three weeks later, capital rotated out of Bitcoin once dominance cooled. Liquidity followed usage, not technical patterns, and altcoins repriced sharply as conviction formed.

That sequence tends to repeat. Bitcoin stabilizes, on-chain activity builds, then markets respond once data holds long enough to feel credible. Current conditions echo that structure. XRP activity sits near long-term highs, while Solana continues to lead in throughput and daily transactions. Payment velocity, whale transfers, and DEX volumes are rising first—with prices lagging behind.

This delay matters for altcoin season 2026 timing. It reflects how capital moves cautiously, waiting for confirmation rather than chasing noise. When catalysts arrive—whether upgrades, regulatory clarity, or ETF expansion—prices often catch up quickly. If activity fades, momentum stalls, and history suggests patience rewards those watching usage, not intraday swings.

Markets are flashing mixed signals on altcoin season 2026. XRP's on-chain activity is elevated, Solana continues showing relative strength with gains, and the Altcoin Season Index climbed from 37 in late December to above 50 in early January. At the same time, Bitcoin dominance remains steady rather than breaking down, keeping the broader market in a holding pattern.

Calling altcoin season 2026 confirmed still feels premature. What the data shows looks more like early crypto rotation than full participation. Capital is moving selectively into XRP and Solana with clear usage trends, while leverage stays muted and open interest continues to cool. That behavior fits the early phase of a cycle, not the euphoric middle.

For confirmation, three conditions need to align to enable January's probe to develop into something larger: Bitcoin dominance breaking below 57%, the Altcoin Index sustaining above 75, and total altcoin market capitalization expanding consistently. Until those triggers fire, this phase resembles a cautious probe rather than a broad breakout.

The crypto market faced a sharp selloff overnight as renewed trade conflict fears between the United States and the European Union shook global risk sentiment. Bitcoin and major altcoins reversed recent gains, with traders reacting to fresh tariff headlines and the possibility of escalating economic retaliation on both sides of the Atlantic. While crypto is often viewed as a separate market, this move once again showed how quickly digital assets can behave like high-beta risk trades when macro uncertainty spikes.

According to analyst Darkfost, the liquidation impact was immediate and aggressive. More than $800 million worth of leveraged positions were wiped out in a matter of hours, including roughly $768 million in long liquidations. The scale of long closures suggests that traders were positioned for continuation to the upside, but were caught offside as prices rolled over sharply.

What stood out most was where the damage occurred. Darkfost noted that Hyperliquid recorded the largest share of forced liquidations, with $241 million, while Bybit followed closely with $220 million. The wave of liquidations appears partly tied to the announcement of new tariffs targeting Europe, which triggered an equally fast response from EU policymakers, reigniting the broader “trade war” narrative across markets.

CME Opens the Door to Fresh Volatility

Darkfost warns that the timing of this selloff matters as much as the liquidation size. As soon as CME trading opened, Bitcoin saw a sharp downside move, suggesting that institutional flows and macro-linked positioning played a direct role in the shakeout. In past risk-off episodes, the CME open has often acted like a volatility trigger, especially when markets are already fragile, and leverage is elevated across major exchanges.

This is why the next few hours are critical. The same type of move could easily repeat at the opening of the US markets, where liquidity conditions and headline sensitivity tend to amplify reactions. If sellers press again, the market could see another cascade of forced closures, particularly in high-beta altcoins that remain vulnerable after the overnight wipeout.

The message is straightforward: stay cautious and avoid overexposure to leverage while the macro backdrop remains unstable. Liquidations can create sharp bounces, but they can also reset momentum quickly if fear spreads across risk assets.

Darkfost adds that attention should remain on incoming political updates. The market is now trading the narrative, not just the chart. Further statements could arrive at any moment, and as history has shown, Trump often delivers market-moving headlines right in the middle of the weekend.

Bitcoin Holds Fragile Rebound As Crypto Tests Macro Nerves

Bitcoin is trading near $93,100 after a sharp rejection from the $96,000–$97,000 supply zone. The chart shows BTC still struggling below key moving averages, with momentum capped by the declining blue trendline overhead. This reinforces the idea that the latest upside attempt was more of a rebound than a clean trend reversal.

Structurally, price is forming higher lows after the violent breakdown from the $110,000 area. However, the rebound remains vulnerable as long as BTC stays trapped beneath resistance and fails to reclaim the mid-$90,000s with conviction. The recent candles also highlight hesitation, with wicks suggesting aggressive selling into strength.

The red long-term moving average is rising near the low-$90,000s, acting as a potential dynamic support zone. If Bitcoin holds above that level, it keeps the recovery structure intact and prevents a deeper reset toward prior liquidity pockets.

This matters for the broader crypto market. When BTC remains range-bound under resistance, altcoins usually struggle to sustain rallies and become more sensitive to liquidation-driven volatility. Risk appetite can return quickly, but it requires Bitcoin to break above resistance and hold. Until then, crypto remains in a fragile stabilization phase, not a confirmed bullish continuation.

Oops, something went wrong

Key Takeaways

NYSE is building a regulated blockchain infrastructure.

Crypto executives are bullish on the move.

While some traders believe tokenization could benefit established blockchains such as Ethereum and XRP, the NYSE has not identified any public network for settlement.

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) said it is developing a blockchain-based platform for trading and on-chain settlement of tokenized securities, a move that has fueled speculation among traders about potential spillover effects for assets such as Ethereum and XRP.

The initiative, announced by NYSE parent Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), would support continuous trading, faster settlement, and tokenized funding mechanisms.

While NYSE has not endorsed the use of any public blockchain or cryptocurrency, bullish comments from exchange executives and figures in the crypto industry have amplified speculation online.

According to ICE, the new digital platform is designed to support the trading and on-chain settlement of tokenized securities that are legally equivalent to traditionally issued shares.

The exchange said the system would enable 24/7 trading, near-instant settlement, fractional share trading, orders denominated in dollar amounts, and stablecoin-based funding.

Subject to regulatory approval, the platform would power a new NYSE trading venue supporting fungible tokenized shares that are interchangeable with conventional securities, as well as natively issued digital securities.

Tokenized shareholders would retain the same economic and governance rights as traditional shareholders, including dividends and voting.

NYSE executives have described the platform as part of a long-term effort to modernize market infrastructure rather than a pivot toward crypto trading.

“For more than two centuries, the NYSE has transformed the way markets operate,” Lynn Martin, president of NYSE Group, said in a statement.

Bullish reactions from crypto industry executives have also contributed to trader interest.

Former Binance chief executive Changpeng Zhao said in a post on X that the move was “bullish for crypto, and crypto exchanges.”

Ripple executive Reece Merrick described the NYSE plan as “big,” while Galaxy Digital head of research Alex Thorn called the initiative an “important step.”

Some traders have speculated that broader institutional adoption of tokenization could increase demand for blockchain networks that already support tokenized real-world assets, including Ethereum and XRP.

Following the announcement, users on X debated which blockchain might ultimately be used, with some pointing to Ethereum based on its existing infrastructure and experience supporting tokenized assets.

“It's got to be Ethereum, obviously,” said one X user.

Others expressed skepticism, arguing that the platform could rely on a proprietary or lesser-known blockchain rather than a public network.

“In all honesty…. it'll be some chain nobody has heard of, or they'll make their own chain,” one X user wrote.

NYSE has not identified any public blockchain for settlement, and market structure experts note that regulated U.S. equity markets are likely to rely on permissioned digital infrastructure.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","NYSE Unveils Blockchain Platform For 24/7 Stock Trading","https://bitcoinist.com/nyse-unveils-blockchain-platform-24-7-stock-trading/","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 06:00:31 GMT","

On Monday, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) unveiled its latest plan to develop a tokenized securities platform, utilizing blockchain technology to facilitate 24/7 stock trading, now seeking regulatory approval.

According to Monday's announcement, the proposed digital platform will offer a tokenized trading experience that includes around-the-clock operations, instant settlements, dollar-sized orders, and stablecoin (dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies) funding options. 

By integrating the NYSE's “advanced Pillar matching engine” with blockchain-based post-trade systems, the firm disclosed that the new platform will support multiple chains for settlement and custody, streamlining the trading process significantly.

Once regulatory approvals are secured, this platform will reportedly create a new venue at the NYSE for trading tokenized shares. These shares will not only be fungible with traditional securities but will also comprise tokens that are issued natively as digital assets. 

Interestingly, tokenized shareholders will retain their rights, including eligibility for dividends and participation in company governance, much like traditional shareholders. The trading venue aims to align with established market structure principles and will provide non-discriminatory access to all qualified broker-dealers.

The launch of this tokenized securities platform is part of the Intercontinental Exchange's (ICE) broader digital strategy, which includes preparing its clearing infrastructure for continuous trading and potentially integrating tokenized collateral. 

ICE is collaborating with major financial institutions like BNY Mellon and Citigroup to facilitate tokenized deposits across its clearinghouses. This effort will help clearing members manage funds and fulfill margin requirements outside of regular banking hours.

Lynn Martin, President of NYSE Group, emphasized the significance and innovation surrounding this development, stating: 

For more than two centuries, the NYSE has transformed the way markets operate. We are leading the industry toward fully on-chain solutions grounded in unmatched protections and high regulatory standards.

The company's President further stated that the New York Stock Exchange aims to combine trust with “state-of-the-art technology,” effectively reinventing market infrastructure to meet the evolving demands of a digital future.

Michael Blaugrund, Vice President of Strategic Initiatives at the Intercontinental Exchange, echoed Martin's sentiment, noting: 

Since its founding, ICE has propelled markets from analog to digital. Supporting tokenized securities is a pivotal step in our strategy to operate on-chain market infrastructure for trading, settlement, custody, and capital formation in the new era of global finance.

In parallel to these developments, the NYSE's main competitor, Nasdaq, along with the CME Group, has intensified efforts to provide institutional investors with a regulated mechanism to measure cryptocurrency markets. 

They recently reintroduced the Nasdaq Crypto Index, renamed as the Nasdaq-CME Crypto Index (NCI), designed to support products such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and structured funds. This move aims to establish clearer rules and governance for index-based cryptocurrency exposure.

On-chain trading platform Magic Eden, previously known as the largest Solana NFT marketplace, said it will begin directing 15% of all platform revenue into the ME token ecosystem, starting on Feb. 1.

“The goal is simple. When Magic Eden wins, the ecosystem wins too,” the project wrote in an X post on Monday, Jan. 19. The team said the revenue allocation will be split evenly between token buybacks and monthly USDC payouts to ME stakers. Buybacks are often implemented by projects to boost the token price, as buybacks imply that circulating token supply is reduced.

Despite the news, ME is trading about 6.5% lower over the past 24 hours, and remains over 95% down since its launch in December 2024, according to CoinGecko data.

Magic Eden clarified that USDC rewards will be distributed “based on staking power,” which depends on both how much ME is staked and how long it is locked. Stakers must claim their rewards within 90 days, per the announcement.

In a separate X post on Monday, Magic Eden CEO Jack Lu said the marketplace generated about $24 million in revenue in 2025, despite a prolonged downturn in the NFT market. At a 15% allocation rate, that would translate to roughly $3.6 million flowing into the ME ecosystem each year, if revenue holds at similar levels.

If half of that were set aside for USDC rewards, a total of roughly $1.8 million could be available as rewards for stakers, though individual payouts will vary

Lu says the change better ties the token to Magic Eden's broader push into entertainment, arguing that the market is entering a “speculation supercycle — where finance merges with entertainment.”

The former NFT marketplace announced its pivot into broader crypto trading, specifically memecoins, in April of last year when it acquired on-chain trading platform Slingshot. The same month, fellow leading NFT marketplace OpenSea made a similar move, launching Solana token trading.

The NFT sector may be experiencing stagnation, but it is certainly not dead.

The NFT sector may be experiencing stagnation, but it is certainly not dead. This view was expressed by Yat Siu, co-founder of Animoca Brands, in an interview with CoinDesk. 

According to him, wealthy investors continue to shape a vibrant and sustainable digital art market. The expert likened the community to clubs of painting, rare car, or watch enthusiasts.

“I am a big collector myself and share similar views with my colleagues in this field. […] For instance, a Picasso collector will feel a connection with everyone else who buys the artist's paintings; you are kind of part of that club. The same goes for Ferrari, Lamborghini, or Rolex watches. It's just the digital version,” said Siu.

He acknowledged that his personal NFT portfolio “has dropped by about 80%,” but considers these assets long-term and significant, rather than speculative. 

Siu noted that the monthly trading volume of non-fungible tokens is currently around $300 million. Major investors like Adam Weitsman, who buys expensive NFTs such as Bored Apes and Otherdeed virtual land plots, now play a key role in the sector.

“Remember, five years ago this was a market with zero capitalization. So everything is relative and depends on the perspective. And, of course, the beauty is that all data is visible on the blockchain,” emphasized the Animoca Brands co-founder. 

Many considered the cancellation of the flagship NFT Paris event as one of the final nails in the sector's coffin. However, Siu attributed this not to market issues, but to changes in the regulatory climate and security problems in France. 

Previously crypto-friendly, the country has tightened its policy on digital assets. Simultaneously, over the past year, there has been a series of kidnappings related to the industry within its jurisdiction.

“NFT Paris fell victim not only due to the inability to find sponsors. Many people, including myself, tried to avoid Paris a bit precisely because of security issues,” noted the expert.

The peak of the non-fungible token frenzy occurred in 2021-2022. At its height, the sector's capitalization exceeded $17 billion, but by the time of writing, it had fallen to $3 billion. 

During that period, NFT sales volume exceeded $23 billion. As of January 2026, the figure stands at $123 million, indicating a drop of more than 18,000%. 

The floor price of the most popular collections has plummeted by tens of percent. At its peak, CryptoPunks were priced at 113.9 ETH, but by the time of writing, they had fallen to 28.3 ETH. 

The Bored Ape Yacht Club price plummeted by more than 95% — from 128 ETH to 5.9 ETH. Similarly, the floor price of the third-largest collection by capitalization, Pudgy Penguins, dropped by 80% — from 25.2 ETH to 4.9 ETH. 

Amid the extensive and prolonged correction, many crypto exchanges, including Bybit and Kraken, as well as larger companies like GameStop, closed their NFT trading platforms.

They were joined by the British auction giant Christie's. The organization continues to sell digital art, but within the broader category of 20th and 21st-century art.

NFT marketplaces have reoriented their business. For example, OpenSea now positions itself as a multichain aggregator for trading a wide range of cryptocurrencies. 

Recently, Magic Eden's head Jack Lu announced a change in the company's development vector. According to him, the platform will focus on the segment where “finance merges with entertainment.”

Currently, the only successful NFT segment is Telegram gifts. From April 2025 to January 2026, the capitalization of this direction grew from 6.3 million TON to 92.1 million TON. 

Back in July, Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko called meme coins and NFTs “digital junk.”

CryptoToys recently unveiled its Digital Toy Exchange, revolutionizing the digital collectibles landscape by enabling direct trades among collectors. This platform not only facilitates primary sales but opens up a dynamic secondary market where users can freely exchange, buy, and sell items, both common and rare, thus enriching the collector's experience.

The Exchange operates on a peer-to-peer basis, housed within the ecosystem of the Rarible Protocol and driven by the Abstract blockchain. This strategic choice allows the platform to leverage the sophisticated infrastructure of established NFT marketplaces, offering a user-friendly and flexible trading environment, which blends a traditional shop model with interactive user-to-user trading.

The inception of this marketplace aligns with the broader vision of CryptoToys, which promotes its digital items as interactive, character-driven ‘toys'. This expansion is designed not merely as a feature but as a core component of the broader strategy to deepen user engagement through interactive narrative experiences and activities like set completion, thus adding value and liquidity to user collections.

Opting for the Abstract blockchain, managed by Igloo Inc. — known for projects like Pudgy Penguins — emphasizes its user-friendly approach suited for consumer applications in the digital realm. For CryptoToys, this alignment offers a blockchain environment that supports robust user engagement, critical for building and maintaining a vibrant community of collectors.

Rarible Protocol serves as a key technological pillar for the Digital Toy Exchange, recognized for its efficacy in managing various aspects of NFT trading platforms. It provides a seamless trading experience through integrated features such as real-time listings, transaction functionalities, comprehensive sales records, and wallet integrations. CryptoToys leverages these capabilities to offer a sophisticated yet approachable trading platform, avoiding the complexities of building these systems in-house.

We have fined two companies a total of £225,000 for sending millions of unsolicited marketing messages in breach of the law. 

Allay Claims Ltd, based in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, has been fined £120,000 for sending more than 4 million unlawful marketing text messages between February 2023 and February 2024. The messages promoted PPI tax refund services and were sent without valid consent or compliance with the rules on the ‘soft opt-in' exemption. 

ZMLUK Limited (formerly Zuru Media Ltd), based in Bristol, has been fined £105,000 for sending over 67 million marketing emails between January and July 2023 without valid consent. The emails promoted a range of products and services using data sourced from third parties, where people were not given clear and informed choices about receiving marketing. 

Andy Curry, Head of Investigations at the ICO, said: 

“Unwanted marketing messages are more than just an irritation – they're an intrusion that can cause real distress. 

“The law here is clear: businesses must only send marketing messages to people who have freely and knowingly consented to receiving them. Relying on vague or third-party consent, or sending marketing messages under the guise of service updates, isn't enough. 

“We want to thank every member of the public who reported these messages. Public reporting plays a crucial role in our work, and where we see organisations causing harm through unlawful marketing, we will not hesitate to step in.” 

Allay Claims Ltd sent 4,046,947 SMS messages promoting PPI tax refund services. We found that the texts were clearly promotional in tone, encouraging people to make further claims and directing them to external landing pages. These messages were not service updates, as Allay later claimed, but direct marketing communications designed to prompt action.  

During the investigation period, more than 46,000 complaints about these messages were submitted through the mobile reporting service 7726, and a further rise in complaints continued even after Allay was aware of our concerns. The investigation showed that Allay had failed to offer a simple way for customers to refuse marketing when collecting their details. As a result, we concluded that the company could not rely on the soft opt‑in exemption as it claimed, and had breached Regulation 22 of PECR. 

ZMLUK Limited sent 67,772,285 emails between January and July 2023 using data sourced primarily from a third‑party website. Individuals signing up to this website were presented with a long list of 361 “partner” companies, without any mechanism to choose which organisations could contact them. We found that this meant individuals could not give informed, specific consent, rendering the consent invalid.  

Examples of the messages complained about included promotional emails urging recipients to “earn and save up to £50,000” on solar and storage products and to take action on energy‑saving opportunities. Although ZMLUK was sending the emails on behalf of Zuru Jersey Ltd, the company was responsible for ensuring compliance with PECR as the sender. The investigation also revealed that ZMLUK relied heavily on third‑party data without carrying out sufficient due diligence checks to understand how consent was obtained. We have concluded that ZMLUK did not have valid consent for the emails it sent, and that the company had failed to take reasonable steps to prevent unlawful marketing activity. 

Under Regulation 22 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR), organisations cannot send marketing messages by email or text without consent, unless they meet the strict conditions of the ‘soft opt-in' exemption. Consent must be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous. 

The ‘soft opt-in' exemption only applies if: 

Generic or bundled third‑party consent (e.g., “selected partners” or long lists without true choice) does not meet these standards. Pre‑ticked boxes and buried privacy‑policy notices do not constitute valid consent or a simple opt‑out. 

If you get nuisance text messages: 

If you get nuisance emails: 

Businesses should consult the our direct marketing guidance to ensure compliance with the law.

Hassan, a Cryptonews.com journalist with 6+ years of experience in Web3 journalism, brings deep knowledge across Crypto, Web3 Gaming, NFTs, and Play-to-Earn sectors. His work has appeared in...

Trove Markets has come under intense scrutiny after confirming it will retain roughly $9.4 million from a token sale that was originally marketed around a planned integration with Hyperliquid, despite pivoting its perps DEX to Solana just days before its token launch.

This led its newly launched TROVE token to collapse by more than 95% minutes after trading began.

TROVE launched with an expected market capitalization of about $20 million, but within ten minutes of going live, the token plunged to around $0.0008, cutting its valuation to under $2 million, as shown by  DEXScreener data. 

At the time of writing, TROVE is trading near $0.000703, with a market cap of roughly $703,000. 

The sudden drop followed growing frustration from contributors who said the project had changed direction too late in the fundraising process.

Trove had raised more than $11.5 million through a public token sale tied to building a perpetual decentralized exchange using Hyperliquid's infrastructure. 

Just days before the token generation event, however, the team announced it would pivot to Solana instead. 

That shift immediately raised questions about whether funds collected for the Hyperliquid build should be returned. 

Instead, Trove said it would retain $9,397,403 to continue development on Solana, describing the move as the only viable way to keep the product alive.

One of Trove's builders, known as Unwise, attributed the abrupt pivot to the withdrawal of a key liquidity partner, who had previously supported the Hyperliquid path with a position of roughly 500,000 HYPE tokens. 

We're pivoting Trove to Solana.After recent sentiment around Trove, the liquidity partner that had been supporting our Hyperliquid path chose to unwind their 500k $HYPE position. That was their decision and we fully respect it.This changes our constraints: we're no longer…

With that support gone, the team said it no longer made sense to continue building on Hyperliquid rails and opted to rebuild the perps exchange on Solana from scratch. 

Trove said the decision fundamentally changed its constraints and forced a reset rather than pushing forward with what it described as an uncertain setup.

Trove acknowledged on X that its handling of the ICO and subsequent decisions caused confusion, frustration, and a breakdown of trust. 

https://t.co/sc8b59sjYE

Trove said it had already refunded about $2.44 million as part of cleaning up participation and protecting distribution integrity, with an additional $100,000 slated to be refunded automatically to ICO participants. 

The remaining funds, it said, have been spent or earmarked for developer salaries, frontend and backend infrastructure, a chief technology officer, advisory services, marketing, and operating costs.

Despite those explanations, critics have continued to question the handling of the raise. 

On X, some users accused the project of breaking fundraising expectations, arguing that money raised to build on Hyperliquid should not be repurposed after a last-minute pivot. 

refund the people now!!!you raised to money to build on hyperliquid! Give back the money and raise on solana if you think that's what your community really wants

Others went further, calling for refunds, threatening legal action, or alleging the situation could result in lawsuits. 

Additional on-chain analysis added to the controversy with data shared by Bubblemap showed that a single entity appeared to control about 12% of the TROVE supply, spread across dozens of fresh wallets funded through the same exchange and clustered in tight time windows. 

2/ $TROVE launched earlier today and quickly dropped -90%• The presale was at $20M FDV• It now trades around $2M FDV https://t.co/HHABuaSnz7 pic.twitter.com/2FhDwew2IX

Bubblemap said it had found no evidence directly linking those wallets to the Trove team but noted that the pattern raised open questions about presale behavior.

The turmoil follows an already chaotic ICO process earlier in January. 

Trove initially announced the sale had crossed $11.5 million, far above its $2.5 million target, and promised pro-rata refunds. It then briefly announced a five-day extension, only to reverse that decision hours later, citing a mistake.

										In contrast, other BRICS nations trail significantly. Brazil and South Africa are still in planning or early pilot stages, while Russia shows growth from a smaller base
																													

The recent report that India, as BRICS chair this year, may propose a mBridge-like system using Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) to settle cross-border trade bypassing the dollar, leads to the question regarding preparedness of the countries on this front. The latest data of CBDCs from various central banks show that China and India are far ahead of other BRICS peers in CBDC innovation and adoption.

China remains the global leader in scale crossing CBDC transactions worth $980 billion by 2024, on the back of the mBridge system that enabled real-time, cross-border payments and foreign exchange settlements among participating central banks such as those from China, Hong-Kong, UAE, Saudi Arabia and Thailand. Meanwhile, India has already built the world's second-largest CBDC pilot, crossing $111.8 million in transaction value by March 2025, driven largely by domestic retail usage.

In contrast, other BRICS nations trail significantly. Brazil and South Africa are still in planning or early pilot stages, while Russia shows growth from a smaller base. Although, its e-ruble transactions rose by 226 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y), in absolute numbers, it only rose from 17,500 in 2023 to 57,000 in 2024. Any BRICS-level CBDC bridge would, at least initially, rest on Chinese scale and Indian participation depth.

CBDCs are digital versions of sovereign currency issued by central banks, combining the safety of cash with the efficiency of electronic payments. Compared with traditional bank transfers or private digital wallets, CBDCs can lower transaction costs, improve settlement speed and enhance transparency. However, they also raise concerns around privacy, cybersecurity and the role of banks in a fully digital monetary system.

Against this backdrop, India's CBDC strategy stands out. While China's ‘digital yuan' has largely been propelled by wholesale and institutional use cases, India's ‘e₹' pilot has been driven mainly by retail demand, leveraging the country's large digital payments ecosystem. This distinction matters, as retail-led adoption creates a broader user base and daily transaction familiarity, which is crucial for scaling cross-border use later. The value of India's e₹ transactions has grown over 4 times y-o-y, from $26 million in 2024 to $112 million in 2025.

Overall, CBDC transactions, both domestic and cross-border, are rising across all countries of the world, despite the US, under Trump, deciding to stop all work around CBDC. While only 35 countries were considering CBDC as a mode of transaction in 2020, that number has jumped to 137 in 2025, signalling a potentially transformative shift in how trade and payments could be settled.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced on January 19 that it is preparing a proposal to promote interoperability among central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) within the BRICS bloc.

The Indian government is expected to place CBDC connectivity among BRICS member states on the agenda of the BRICS Leaders' Summit in 2026, when India will serve as chair. The initiative aims to link national digital currencies to improve the speed, efficiency, and cost of cross-border payments.

The proposal builds on commitments outlined in the 2025 Rio de Janeiro Declaration, which emphasized enhancing interoperability between payment systems across BRICS countries. If implemented, the framework could significantly reduce transaction costs and settlement times for cross-border trade, strengthening financial integration within the bloc.

According to the RBI, connecting India's digital rupee with other BRICS CBDCs would facilitate smoother payments in trade finance and tourism, enabling near-instant settlement and lowering operational costs for businesses and consumers.

While Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa have all launched CBDC pilot programs, none have yet achieved full-scale retail adoption. Market participants are closely watching whether CBDCs can eventually offer convenience comparable to major cryptocurrencies and altcoins.

India introduced the digital rupee in December 2022 and has reportedly reached around 7 million users. The central bank is expanding adoption through features such as offline payments and the use of CBDCs for government subsidy disbursements.

The RBI has also encouraged fintech innovation by allowing private companies to develop CBDC-compatible wallets using crypto wallet technology, further strengthening the digital currency ecosystem.

Geopolitical tensions form part of the backdrop to the proposal. The United States has expressed concern over initiatives that bypass dollar-based settlement systems, and former President Donald Trump previously criticized BRICS as “anti-American,” warning of potential tariff measures.

Indian officials maintain that de-dollarization is not the primary objective, but analysts note that interoperable BRICS CBDCs could nonetheless reduce reliance on the US dollar by providing an alternative cross-border settlement mechanism.

Amid shifting global monetary dynamics, investor interest in Bitcoin (BTC) as a diversification and hedge asset remains strong.

However, major hurdles remain. Differences in payment infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, and technical standards across BRICS nations complicate the creation of a unified CBDC system. Trade imbalances also pose challenges, as seen previously when Russia accumulated large amounts of rupees with limited usability in bilateral trade with India.

To address these issues, policymakers are reportedly exploring mechanisms such as central bank currency swap agreements and periodic settlement models on a weekly or monthly basis.

While CBDC development accelerates, the RBI continues to take a cautious view of privately issued stablecoins. Deputy Governor T. Rabi Sankar has warned that stablecoins may pose risks to financial stability, reiterating the central bank's position that CBDCs offer a safer, more controlled alternative.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","Will the BRICS CBDC Network Squeeze Out India's Private Crypto Market?","https://www.bitget.com/news/detail/12560605160608","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 00:18:15 GMT","

India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has proposed linking the central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) of BRICS nations, including India's own e-rupee, China's digital yuan, and others. The goal is to make cross-border payments for trade and tourism easier, moving away from the need to use the US dollar. 

The proposal could be officially discussed at the 2026 BRICS summit, which India is scheduled to host later this year.

A key reason for linking these digital currencies is to avoid using the US dollar for international payments. Many developing countries see this as a risk to their economic and political stability, especially during global conflicts. In fact, countries in Asia and beyond are increasingly putting more effort into “de-dollarization.”

Another reason why BRICS CBDC linkage matters is the faster and cheaper transactions. If BRICS countries can settle trades directly using their digital currencies, the system could make payments much quicker, cut the costs of exchanging money, and avoid the slow, multi-step process of using US dollars, which adds fees and wait times.

Additionally, India insists the plan is about making payments easier and working together, not about replacing the dollar. However, the US is concerned about actions that avoid using its currency. Past US comments have labeled BRICS projects as “anti-American,” a stance that could lead to increased trade or political tensions.

India has always been careful about private cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, XRP, and Ether. The central bank (RBI) often pointed out the dangers crypto poses to the economy, including financial instability and money leaving the country.

Because of this cautious stance, India's crypto market has grown more slowly than others, as it faces challenges like high taxes, unclear rules, and the RBI's general skepticism.

However, there is an important difference with BRICS digital currencies. CBDCs are built under full regulatory control, while private cryptos operate in a regulatory gray area. For Indian leaders, this means state digital currencies are seen as a policy instrument and not as an alternative to decentralized cryptocurrencies.

If the BRICS digital currency system works and makes international trade cheaper and faster, big businesses and governments might become more open to using digital money and blockchain. Still, this doesn't automatically mean they'll embrace cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Plus, the Indian central bank's cautious stance means that any new rules for private crypto will likely be introduced slowly and carefully.

A U.S. bank charter has always been a public-private compact: If you want access to the nation's financial infrastructure, you accept rigorous supervision in return. That compact hasn't changed. What has evolved is the range of firms and technologies now performing core functions of the financial system. Payments, custody, settlement and reserve management increasingly rely on digital infrastructure, including blockchain-based systems. 

The question is not whether crypto banking exists but whether we bring this activity inside the supervised perimeter of U.S. prudential oversight, or leave it to operate outside our regulatory regime.

Last month, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency conditionally approved five national trust bank charter applications from digital asset firms — First National Digital Currency Bank (Circle), Ripple, BitGo, Fidelity Digital Assets and Paxos — under the same charter standards applied to all applicants. The OCC had previously granted a national trust bank charter to Anchorage Digital in 2021, and I applaud Comptroller Gould for prioritizing these digital asset-first institutions.

This process should also be welcome news for policymakers and banking professionals. It reflects the principle Comptroller Gould emphasized recently at the Blockchain Association's Policy Summit: Chartering new banks — including those engaged in digital asset activities — is core to a healthy, competitive U.S. banking system. He said the OCC has seen a notable uptick in charter applications this year and that the federal banking system must adapt to ""new ways of conducting the very old business of banking"" or risk stagnation and irrelevance. Comptroller Gould recognizes that this is an opportunity for the U.S. banking industry to recover from the sharp decline in new federal bank charter applications following the 2008 financial crisis, a contraction that has reduced competition, concentrated market power and ultimately harmed consumers.

Yet some large banks are pushing back, arguing that allowing digital asset firms into the chartered system could heighten systemic risk or amount to regulatory favoritism. Their tired perspective retreads arguments Wall Street banks deploy whenever they face new competition, framing competitive concerns as threats to financial stability.

A central misconception in this debate is conflating national trust bank charters with full-service commercial banking. National trust charters are limited-purpose, authorizing some of these institutions to provide services such as custody, settlement, trade execution and stablecoin issuance. The charters do not allow deposit-taking and lending activities that have led to bank failures and taxpayer funded bailouts.

This distinction has practical significance. These charters granted by the OCC do not permit the risky practice of credit intermediation. They bring significant activities under direct prudential supervision — from governance and capital to custody controls and cybersecurity — without the balance-sheet risk associated with traditional banks. 

Stablecoin yield has continued to be a flashpoint as bank groups look for a blanket ban on crypto exchanges and other nonbanks offering yield-like rewards for holding crypto. 

A modern chartering framework should be activity-based and technology-neutral. Custody is custody. Payments are payments, which includes ""payments stablecoins"" that are permitted to be issued by national banks under the recently passed and bipartisan GENIUS Act. Whether these functions are executed on legacy rails or distributed ledgers should not determine access to prudential oversight.

Critics who argue that digital asset charters somehow tilt the regulatory playing field overlook two truths. First, these approvals aren't special treatment — they follow standard procedures and conditions under 12 C.F.R. Part 5, not expedited or exceptional pathways. Second, excluding digital asset activity from supervision does not reduce risk; rather, it drives risk outside the U.S. regulatory perimeter, where regulators have less visibility and fewer tools to protect consumers and economic stability.

Some argue that allowing crypto firms into chartered banking threatens stability. But competition has historically been central to U.S. banking policy, enhancing resilience and consumer choice. New chartered institutions expand services, introduce efficiencies and press incumbents to improve. In that sense, supervision and competition are mutually reinforcing.

Blocking entrants because they use innovative technology is not risk management — it is protectionism, pure and simple. That approach cedes regulatory ground to offshore actors and leaves American consumers with fewer options under U.S. supervision.

As stablecoin adoption grows and federal agencies implement the GENIUS Act, we must recognize that digital asset services are already part of the financial ecosystem. The choice before us is simple: Bring meaningful financial activity inside the regulated system under supervision, or leave it outside regulators' sight lines.

By supervising firms willing to meet prudential standards, we protect consumers, reinforce market integrity, and ensure the U.S. banking system remains dynamic and competitive. Supervision, not exclusion, is how we safeguard stability and advance innovation.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday morning that banks should focus on the sweeping deregulation the administration has enacted as the industry pushes back on President Trump's proposed 10% credit card interest rate cap.

Cryptocurrency has traditionally been an investment product more than a way to make purchases, but fintechs are betting there's a future for digital assets at the point of sale.

Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan Gould said Friday afternoon that regulators should scale back what he characterized as costly and ineffective bank-prepared resolution plans and shifting resolution responsibility onto bank regulators.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","AEG taps Twilio for consumer engagement technology","https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2026/01/20/aeg-taps-twilio-for-consumer-engagement-technology/","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:28:57 GMT","

AEG has signed a new technology partnership with customer engagement platform Twilio that will see Twilio deploy across AEG's Crypto.com Arena, L.A. Kings and AXS ticketing platform. Terms were not disclosed, other than the two sides calling it a multiyear deal.

Twilio -- which counts the Suns, Chelsea FC, Fox Sports Network and Volleyball World among its more than 390,000 customers -- had previously worked with AEG by powering the AXS mobile app's SMS service and multifactor authentication. That work will now expand to Crypto.com Arena and the Kings using Twilio's consumer data platform and Twilio gaining select marketing rights.

“Through that good-natured [AXS] relationship, we looked at other areas that might be of interest,” AEG Global Partnerships President & COO Nick Baker told SBJ. “Now, we're expanding to tell that story that has happened -- and will continue to happen -- as we [integrate Twilio] into other areas of AEG's business.”

Twilio becomes one of 11 founding partners of Crypto.com Arena, a designation which includes static/digital signage and activation space at the venue (the other 10 are American Express, Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, Crypto.com, Delta Air Lines, Boldyn, Spectrum, Toyota, UCLA Health, Yaamava' Resort & Casino). Twilio will also receive signage/event-hosting rights at L.A. Live; advertising in the AXS app; business-to-business-focused testimonial content; and, in a component of the deal previously reported by SBJ, sponsorship of the Kings' away helmet.

Twilio CMO Chris Koehler noted that the AEG deal is Twilio's second formal partnership in sports -- a deeper relationship than customer-vendor, including sponsorship elements -- joining a pact with Chelsea struck last year.

“We think there's a massive opportunity to continue to partner with sports and entertainment companies,” Koehler said. “The fan experience today -- before the game, at the experience, and afterwards as well -- we can help all of these brands create great experiences. We're not done yet.”

Baker said the potential impact of Twilio's consumer data platform on Crypto.com Arena/the Kings' premium sales business is particularly exciting. “We've got over 160 suites at Crypto.com Arena, we've got 5,000-plus premium seats, we've got several different club areas -- it's a different experience for each consumer who goes just to the premium level,” he said. “What Twilio's going to do is help us bifurcate all of that and make sure we're messaging to different types of premium seating.”

The partnership was negotiated without outside agencies. Leading the talks were Baker and AEG Global Partnerships VP Kala Polman-Tuin from the AEG side, and Koehler and Twilio VP/Americas Field Marketing Julie Poutre from Twilio.","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","cryptocurrency"

The hidden threat eating away at museum treasures

Extremophile molds are invading art museums and devouring their collections. Stigma and climate change have fueled their spread

By Elizabeth Anne Brown edited by Kate Wong

Maja Lindholm Kvamm, curator and collections manager at the Roskilde Museum in Denmark, cleans objects in a storage facility that has been sealed off since 2014 because of a mold outbreak.

Ty Stange

Last summer I polled the great art houses of Europe with a seemingly straightforward question: Had they had any recent experiences with mold in their collections?

Mold is a perennial scourge in museums that can disfigure and destroy art and artifacts. To keep this microbial foe in check, institutions follow protocols designed to deter the familiar fungi that thrive in humid settings. But it seems a new front has opened in this long-standing battle. I'd recently heard rumblings that curators in my then home base of Denmark have been wrestling with perplexing infestations that seem to defy the normal rules of engagement. I wondered how pervasive the problem might be.

My survey did not make me popular. Some museums responded quickly—too quickly, perhaps, to have checked with their curators. Ten minutes after receiving my inquiry, the press office at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence assured me unequivocally that there was no mold at the Uffizi. The museum declined to connect me with the curatorial team or restoration department. Many institutions—the Louvre, the British Museum, the Musée d'Orsay—didn't respond to my calls and e-mails at all. I eventually came to suspect the Vatican Museum had blocked my number.

Frustrating though it was, this is the reception I expected. Asking a curator if their museum has problems with mold is like asking if they have a sexually transmitted disease. It's contagious, it's taboo, and it carries the inevitable implication someone has done something naughty.

Consequently, mold is spoken of in whispers in the museum world. Curators fear that even rumors of an infestation can hurt their institution's funding and blacklist them from traveling exhibitions. When an infestation does occur, it's generally kept secret. The contract conservation teams that museums hire to remediate invasive mold often must vow confidentiality before they're even allowed to see the damage. But a handful of researchers, from in-house conservators to university mycologists, are beginning to compare notes about the fungal infestations they've tackled in museum storage depots, monastery archives, crypts and cathedrals. A disquieting revelation has emerged from these discussions: there's a class of molds that flourish in low humidity, long believed to be a sanctuary from decay. By trying so hard to protect artifacts, we've accidentally created the “perfect conditions for [these molds] to grow,” says Flavia Pinzari, a mycologist at the Council of National Research of Italy. “All the rules for conservation never considered these species.”

These molds—called xerophiles—can survive in dry, hostile environments such as volcano calderas and scorching deserts, and to the chagrin of curators across the world, they seem to have developed a taste for cultural heritage. They devour the organic material that abounds in museums—from fabric canvases and wood furniture to tapestries. They can also eke out a living on marble statues and stained-glass windows by eating micronutrients in the dust that accumulates on their surfaces. And global warming seems to be helping them spread.

Most frustrating for curators, these xerophilic molds are undetectable by conventional means. But now, armed with new methods, several research teams are solving art history cold cases and explaining mysterious new infestations.

Rust-colored stains have been present on Leonardo da Vinci's most famous self-portrait, drawn in red chalk on paper, since at least the 1950s. Researchers have determined that the culprit is the xerophilic fungus Aspergillus halophilicus.

The xerophiles' body count is rising: bruiselike stains on Leonardo da Vinci's most famous self-portrait, housed in Turin. Brown blotches on the walls of King Tut's burial chamber in Luxor. Pockmarks on the face of a saint in an 11th-century fresco in Kyiv. It's not enough to find and identify the mold. Investigators are racing to determine the limits of xerophilic life and figure out which pieces of our cultural heritage are at the highest risk of infestation before the ravenous microbes set in.

Scandinavian museums have been some of the first to confront the effect of climate change on molds. Whereas certain parts of the planet are growing drier as temperatures rise, the Nordic countries are among those that are becoming wetter. Higher temperatures allow the air to hold more moisture, and extreme rainfall events called cloudbursts are occurring more frequently. Sea-bound Denmark, for example, which is already rainy, could receive more than 50 percent more winter rainfall by the end of this century.

In decades past local museums in Denmark could get away with storing their treasures in drafty basements, sheds and even barns—practices that are typical for small museums around the globe when funding is limited and they don't have the luxury of purpose-built facilities. But rising humidity and increasing floods led to runaway mold infestations at several Danish institutions in the 2000s. In response, Danish museums invested tens of millions of dollars to develop centralized, climate-controlled storage facilities.

It's a pattern that's playing out in many parts of the world. As the climate becomes more erratic, museums are tightening the temperature and humidity controls for their collections to prevent mold growth. But paradoxically, these efforts may be creating the perfect niche for a different kind of mold.

In 2012 Danish museum conservator Camilla Jul Bastholm was patrolling one such climate-controlled facility—a newly retrofitted warehouse about an hour outside Copenhagen—when she spotted subtle white shimmers on a variety of items, including hats and cloaks. “It was tricky to see with the naked eye,” Bastholm says of the discoloration—“a whitish, brittle layer on the surface of the artifacts.”

Conventional wisdom would have suggested that these shimmering patches were pesticide blooms, an unfortunate legacy from past generations of conservators who sprayed their collections with pesticides such as DDT to keep insects and molds at bay. These chemicals absorbed into artifacts only to bubble up to the surface later in the form of white blotches. But Bastholm had seen these little white dots before. She was working in another repository as a contract conservator, the kind of consultant museums hire after a flood or leak. After eight hours in that facility, a colleague had “reacted like she had the beginning of the flu—her eyes running; she had a migraine.” To Bastholm, that sounded like exposure to a fungus, not a chemical.

A close examination revealed that about half of the objects in the Roskilde Museum's facility bore these worrisome white marks. Two museum employees developed the same flulike symptoms Bastholm had observed before. The staff were convinced they had a mold outbreak. Yet the building's envelope was intact, with no evidence of leaks.

Hats from Denmark's Roskilde Museum that have been stored in a climate-controlled warehouse outside Copenhagen exhibit shimmery, whitish patches from xerophilic molds.

Twice, museum leadership called in outside technicians to test for mold, a process that involves rubbing samples of potentially contaminated material onto a fungal growth medium—a gelatinous goo packed with nutrients and moisture to jump-start mold growth in a petri dish. The dishes bloomed black, yellow, brown and green with common molds, but nothing matched the enigmatic white marks.

When Bastholm became the Roskilde Museum's lead conservator in 2014, she ordered the facility—with its tens of thousands of historical objects—closed to all but essential traffic while she tried to solve the mystery. Three years later Bastholm got her first break. A Dutch mycologist who specializes in molds that affect food production suggested she cook up a very unusual fungal medium: a petri dish environment that would kill most fungi. When she cultured the samples on this inhospitable medium, with far too little water available to sustain most molds, her petri dishes suddenly looked like snow globes, covered with shimmering white flakes. Genetic analysis revealed they were four related species of xerophilic molds in a group known as Aspergillus section restricti.

Around the same time Bastholm discovered the xerophile outbreak in Denmark in 2012, Flavia Pinzari, then a biologist at the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage in Rome, was investigating a fungal mystery of her own. Pinzari had been monitoring mold infestations at libraries and archives in Rome, Genoa and Modena over the previous decade. Staff reported feeling ill, and small white dots peppered ancient manuscripts and book bindings at six institutions—among them the Bibliotheca Angelica in Rome, Europe's oldest public library and one of the world's great collections of rare and ancient books. She wondered whether a classic conservation technique could be inviting a stealthy class of fungi into the collections.

In the 1600s the Bibliotheca Angelica was run by Augustinian friars, an order of religious scholars that the pope charged with determining which texts would become libri prohibiti—forbidden books destined for the Catholic Church's bonfires of heretical material.

Texts on astrology, alchemy, science and unorthodox religious thinking passed through the Augustinians' hands. “The Augustinians studied them and censored them, but they did not destroy them,” Umberto D'Angelo, former director of the Bibliotheca Angelica, said in a press release. “Fortunately for us, they are all still here.” Today the Bibliotheca's holdings include exquisite 11th-century illuminated manuscripts, one of the earliest copies of Dante's Divine Comedy—and all those precious libri prohibiti.

The infestations Pinzari observed were unusual because they were happening in institutions with, as far as she could tell, adequate climate control. The only factor connecting the six infestations was the institutions' use of mobile shelving systems called compactus units, refrigerator-size shelf blocks that slide on rails. Compactus units have been a fixture of museum and library storage since the 1950s because they save space and have an airtight seal, protecting their contents from invasive dust and mold spores.

Pinzari couldn't get any of the white molds to grow on any fungal media. But she did have access to a high-powered microscope. Peering through the viewfinder, she saw fibrous tendrils with a riot of hairs—the signatures of Aspergillus section restricti.

In 1993 Japanese microbiologist Hideo Arai used special fungal growth media to identify the mold that has caused extensive staining on the walls of King Tut's burial chamber. The brown blotches are the result of an Aspergillus penicilloides infestation.

How the mold might find a home in the compactus shelves was a mystery at the time. But in the decade since, Pinzari and other researchers have started to learn how these xerophilic species thrive where other molds can't. They seem to remodel their environment, turning desert into oasis one tiny inhospitable patch at a time.

Take Aspergillus halophilicus, one of the species behind both the Danish infestation and the Italian library outbreaks. Once a spore of A. halophilicus lands, Pinzari says, it sends out exploratory tendrils called hyphae that twist through cracks and crevices to search for nutrients. “It's looking for water,” Pinzari explains, but if none is forthcoming, it'll settle for salt crystals.

Salt crystals are extraordinarily effective at absorbing moisture from the air. That's why the contents of your saltshaker will turn into a solid block unless you put rice in it. A. halophilicus can collect salt from the environment and re-excrete it in the form of a salt-rich exopolymer—a kind of briny jelly that covers its hyphae. Researchers hypothesize that the exopolymer prevents the mold's tissues from drying out and helps the mold maintain a layer of humid air in its immediate vicinity.

Pinzari believes that by trying so hard to control conditions inside compactus shelves, collection managers have accidentally handed the reins over to xerophilic fungi. With no airflow to disrupt their tiny artificial atmospheres, the molds have been able to reshape their surroundings to suit their needs. Ironically, artifacts might have been better off in those drafty Danish barns.

From a conservator's perspective, there's lots to worry about in a xerophile's remodeling plans. Sometimes xerophilic or xerotolerant fungi eat a museum artifact directly—munching on the egg-based tempera in a fresco, the cotton canvas of a painting or even the salty flesh of mummies.

Other times the spores land on something the mold can't directly consume, such as metal, glass, rubber, plastic or limestone. But some of the restricti species are “capable of living on almost nothing,” Pinzari says, surviving off the nutrients in motes of dust. In these cases, damage to artifacts is collateral, resulting from the mold's remodeling activities and digestive processes and from the dying off of the hyphae.

That's what researchers think happened at St. Sophia's Cathedral, a 1,000-year-old holy site in Kyiv that has been described as the soul of all Ukraine. In 2010 brown blotches began to pockmark the cathedral's precious 11th-century frescos, starting with the altar to the martyr St. Sophia. “It's very painful because people love this cathedral very much,” says Marina Fomina, a microbiologist at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.

In 2025 Camilla Jul Bastholm received messages from institutions around the world that have experienced mold infestations they expect might be xerophilic but haven't necessarily been made public.

The saint's breakout came as a surprise on two counts. Not only has the cathedral been climate-controlled since the 1950s, but its wall paintings are buon frescos, meaning they were made of mineral compounds that contain no organic materials for mold to live on.

Fomina reached out to Pinzari after reading about her skirmishes with xerophiles in the Italian libraries. On Pinzari's advice, Fomina tried to culture mold from the frescos on special fungal growth media. Nothing grew. The Ukrainian team was so alarmed about the damage that it arranged for costly molecular genetic analysis of samples from the paintings, which confirmed the presence of A. halophilicus.

To understand what was happening to the frescos, the managers of the cathedral gave Fomina permission to cut out some mold spots from a section of the fresco that had been restored in the 1950s. Under the microscope, she saw the unmistakable shape of A. halophilicus—it can resemble a tangle of spaghetti with fine, downy hairs—tunneling between layers of plaster, causing the surface of the fresco to crumble and flake. But curiously, these hyphae appeared to be covered with tiny crystals, like rock candy.

It seems that when A. halophilicus is surrounded by calcium, as in the chalky plaster, it secretes organic acids that turn calcium ions—which appear to be harmful to the mold—into benign crystals of calcium malate. The dark spots themselves were another by-product of this protective mechanism. The higher the concentration of the calcium minerals, the darker the mold's pigments become, Fomina explains.

Xerophilic fungi aren't entirely new to museums and cultural heritage sites. Italian archivists in the mid-1900s described outbreaks identical to the ones Pinzari observed, and orange stains that have been present on da Vinci's most famous self-portrait since at least the 1950s have since been conclusively attributed to A. halophilicus. But it wasn't until decades later that researchers began routinely using growth media with low levels of water available for microbial processes to coax out xerophilic fungi. One of the first to adopt these low-water activity media to test for elusive fungi on cultural items was Japanese microbiologist Hideo Arai, who used them to isolate mold on hemp-paper paintings in Byōdo-in Temple in Uji, Japan, in 1984. Later, in 1993, Arai used these specialized media to identify Aspergillus penicilloides as the culprit behind an infestation on the walls of King Tut's burial chamber. The dark blotches from the mold had vexed researchers since soon after archaeologist Howard Carter opened the tomb in 1922.

Yet despite such high-profile cases, experts still believed that true xerophilic infestations were rare, a notion that persisted because the tools to detect them were so hard to obtain. Even today, decades after Arai's pioneering work, access to these low-water activity media is extremely limited. “You can't buy them industrially—nobody produces them,” Bastholm says. “If you want to detect these xerophilic fungi, you have to collaborate with research laboratories.”

Curators from the Roskilde Museum inspect objects in the museum's storage facility for mold.

What's more, some species are so persnickety that even low-water activity media won't do the trick consistently. Fomina and her colleagues still haven't been able to cultivate samples in the lab from the St. Sophia infestation, despite more than 10 years of trying. They keep at it because until scientists discover what makes a xerophile feel at home in a petri dish, there won't be tests that museums can use to catch them without resorting to genetic testing that many institutions can't afford.

Fomina and Pinzari suspect that part of the reason A. halophilicus is so hard to culture is that it may already be dead by the time conservators notice the infestation. Often found together with other xerophilic species, A. halophilicus seems to work as a pioneer: it arrives in an inhospitable environment and does its extraordinary DIY, and then other, less industrious molds swoop in to take advantage of the better growing conditions—potentially using dead A. halophilicus tissues as a resource to jump-start their own growth.

That's how xerophilic fungi seem to have flown under the radar for so long. When a moldy artifact is swabbed on conventional, high-water activity media, only garden-variety fungi grow. Museums assume they've done something wrong with the storage—that humidity had risen higher than they realized, or a leak went undetected—and keep the matter under wraps, for fear of looking careless. The xerophilic molds elude detection and continue to wreak havoc. The problem “is much more diffuse than we might think,” Pinzari asserts.

Once a museum identifies a mold infestation, it faces the difficult question of how to stop it. Through the 1970s conservators deployed biocides, chemicals—including antibiotics and formaldehyde—that wipe out microbes indiscriminately. That's what experts used in 1963 when green algae threatened the 17,000-year-old depictions of aurochs, horses and deer found in France's famed Lascaux Cave. But just as broad-spectrum antibiotics can wreak havoc on the human gut by eliminating good bacteria along with the bad, biocides can open the door to even more harmful microbes by clearing out the competition.

Scientists think decades of treatment with biocides in Lascaux led to the proliferation of a fungus called Fusarium solani that covered the cave like snow in a matter of days. The biocides are also thought to have allowed antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria and fungi to grow unchecked in the cave, as well as pigmented fungi that left permanent dark stains on the Ice Age images. In Europe, the use of biocides is now tightly restricted.

One of the only options for large-scale infestations—for example, in libraries and archives—is fumigation. But some of the substances used in fumigation leave residues that can eventually degrade the material, says Katherina Derksen, a painting conservator and microbiologist at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. Some of these chemicals can also pose a risk to human health.

When a mold's takeover of an artifact must be stopped, there's gamma radiation—pelting it with electromagnetic energy from radioactive decay to kill fungi and spores. But this technique penetrates deeply and can extensively damage materials. In some cases, “you lose both microbes and the object you're trying to save,” says Katja Sterflinger, a geomicrobiologist and heritage scientist at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna.

That leaves conservators with only a basic tool kit for containing a fungal outbreak: quarantine infested objects, vacuum off the worst of the mold, and treat affected items with ethanol when possible. That's what they ultimately had to do at the Roskilde Museum, the Danish institution where Bastholm found the xerophiles.

In 2023, nine years after Bastholm closed off the Roskilde Museum's storage facility, the museum's governing board decided it was time to reclaim the place. “We've been afraid of it,” says Isabella No'omi Fuglø, the museum's chief of collections. In 2025, after two years of strategizing, a small group of conservators finally suited up in protective gear and headed into the mold-ridden warehouse.

One day last fall I donned a mask and protective clothing to tour the storage facility, then several weeks into its rehabilitation. My guide was curator and collections manager Maja Lindholm Kvamm. Kitted out in a white cloth jumpsuit and respirator, with an industrial-grade vacuum in tow, she looked like a Ghostbuster in an astronaut helmet.

Over the course of the summer Kvamm and a team of about 15 people, including student assistants from a local conservator's school, had handled more than 100,000 objects—from oyster shells to paintings and carriages—inspecting them for mold and scraping off the dirt and dust of the ages.

Kvamm says they were relieved to find the museum's archaeological treasures—among them stone age relics and Viking artifacts discovered by hobbyist metal detectorists—were largely spared from contamination, although the same couldn't be said for the boxes containing them. But other items were beyond saving or too fragile to clean with conventional means. “A big part of the cleaning process is figuring out what the object can handle—even just being touched,” Fuglø says.

A team of 15 conservators and assistants examined and cleaned some 100,000 objects from the Roskilde Museum's collections last summer.

As I wandered aisles stacked high with boxes of paintings, antique furniture and the occasional Viking age skeleton, I found several parcels wrapped in plastic and labeled “SKIM!!!”—short for skimelsvamp, “mold” in Danish. Inside one was fish skin so riddled with mold “it was basically alive,” Kvamm recalls. It falls to Kvamm to determine what mold-damaged objects are worth the effort to stabilize and restore, she explains. “Is the story [behind the object] interesting enough? Do we know where it's from? Do we have similar objects?”

Disposing of a mold-eaten object in a museum's collection is a bureaucratic nightmare. “You have to ask other museums if they might be interested,” Kvamm explains. “You have to [try] to track down the person who donated the item and ask them if they want to have it back.” Once those hurdles are cleared, she anticipates a multimonth dialogue with the Ministry of Culture before she will finally be allowed to do away with her gross fish skin.

For moldy items in the Roskilde Museum collection that are deemed salvageable, Kvamm makes several passes with her vacuum hose interspersed with gentle scrubbing with a brush. She then caps off those efforts with a judicious spritz of ethanol.

But even the objects that have no signs of mold receive the tender ministrations of Kvamm and her team. They delicately wipe off motes of dust to make it harder for mold to take up residence again. “We don't have anything else we can do now but clean it and then just keep checking on it,” Fuglø admits.

To figure out better ways to prevent and treat xerophilic mold infestations, scientists need a better understanding of the molds' basic biology—namely, the conditions under which they falter and thrive. To that end, Sterflinger and her team in Vienna are busy trying to determine just how little water xerophilic molds can survive on. Yet even if researchers do identify a moisture level that's safe from xerophilic molds, Sterflinger says it's untenable to bring overall humidity levels in storage facilities down much lower than they already are: climate control is expensive and a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which museums are under pressure to curb.

Instead they'll have to determine which materials are most vulnerable to xerophilic and xerotolerant molds, Derksen says. That way collection managers can decide which items need more stringent and energy-intensive storage conditions. Future storage facilities could designate a small space with the tightest climate control for more sensitive objects, she says.

Derksen is conducting mold censuses in “healthy” museums without infestations so they can develop surveillance techniques that will detect surges in particular mold species before they've reached a level visible to the human eye.

The researchers agree we need to learn all we can from the organisms found in the artificially extreme environments of museums. The lessons aren't just relevant to art conservation. These weird species—some of which are new to science—are likely to pop up in other places that people are trying to keep unnaturally sterile.

Xerophilic fungi have infested food-production facilities from Belgian chocolate factories to meat-curing operations in Italy. In 2024 an infestation of Aspergillus flavus—a xerophilic mold species involved in some museum outbreaks—was discovered in Denmark's biggest hospital, sickening pediatric cancer patients and contributing to several deaths, including that of an 11-year-old boy. Xerophilic molds can colonize human tissue in immunocompromised people—doctors found colonies of Aspergillus fumigatus, another mold involved in museum infestations, in one Danish woman's brain, chest and lungs after she had been treated for leukemia in the contaminated wards. Other scientists hope to put the xerophiles' remodeling powers to good use, deploying them to break down pollutants and sequester harmful metals.

The museum mold hunters are thankful for the institutions taking them into their confidence. Letting go of the shame is the only way we can learn about these molds, Pinzari says. Bastholm says that in 2025, she received a flood of messages from institutions around the world that have experienced mold infestations they suspect might be xerophilic but haven't necessarily been made public—from across Europe, the U.S., Pakistan, Israel and Asia. Still the stigma remains strong. None agreed to be interviewed on the record for this article.

Why consciousness is the hardest problem in science

Will brain science deliver answers about consciousness or hit another wall?

By Allison Parshall edited by Seth Fletcher

DTAN Studio

This article includes a companion guide to competing theories of consciousness. Check out that graphic here.

Until half a billion years ago, life on Earth was slow. The seas were home to single-celled microbes and largely stationary soft-bodied creatures. But at the dawn of the Cambrian era, some 540 million years ago, everything exploded. Bodies diversified in all directions, and many organisms developed appendages that let them move quickly around their environment. These ecosystems became competitive places full of predators and prey. And our branch of the tree of life evolved an incredible structure to navigate it all: the brain.

We don't know whether this was the moment when consciousness first arose on Earth. But it might have been when living creatures began to really need something like it to combine a barrage of sensory information into one unified experience that could guide their actions. It's because of this ability to experience that, eventually, we began to feel pain and pleasure. Eventually, we became guided not just by base needs but by curiosity, emotions and introspection. Over time we became aware of ourselves.

This last step is what we have to thank for most of art, science and philosophy—and the millennia-long quest to understand consciousness itself. This state of awareness of ourselves and our environment comes with many mysteries. Why does being awake and alive, being yourself, feel like anything at all, and where does this singular sense of awareness come from in the brain? These questions may have objective answers, but because they are about private, subjective experiences that can't be directly measured, they exist at the very boundaries of what the scientific method can reveal.

Still, in the past 30 years neuroscientists scouring the brain for the so-called neural correlates of consciousness have learned a lot. Their search has revealed constellations of brain networks whose connections help to explain what happens when we lose consciousness. We now have troves of data and working theories, some with mind-bending implications. We have tools to help us detect consciousness in people with brain injuries. But we still don't have easy answers—researchers can't even agree on what consciousness is, let alone how best to reveal its secrets. The past few years have seen accusations of pseudoscience, results that challenge leading theories, and the uneasy feeling of a field at a crossroads.

Yet the stakes for understanding consciousness have never been higher. We've built talking machines able to imitate consciousness so well that we can't always tell the difference. Sometimes these artificial-intelligence models claim outright to be sentient. Faced with an existential unknown, the public is turning to the field of consciousness science for answers. “The tension, you know, it's palpable,” says Marcello Massimini, a neurophysiologist at the University of Milan. “We're going to be looking back at this period.”

Consciousness is all you really know. It's the voice you hear in your head, your emotions, your awareness of the world and your body all rolled into one unified experience. “Everything comes down to it, everything,” says cognitive neuroscientist Athena Demertzi of the University of Liège in Belgium. “It's the translation of the world that we have.” Philosophers and scientists alike struggle to define consciousness without appealing back to what it feels like to experience—what philosophers call “definition by pointing.” But they're pointing to a real phenomenon. It's your consciousness that goes wonky when you take hallucinogens, even as your body and environment stay the same. When you go under general anesthesia, it appears to go out like a light. When you dream, some strange form of consciousness persists, even if it's disconnected from the outside world.

Some scientists have used these different states of consciousness to chop up conscious experience into at least three pieces: wakefulness, internal awareness and connectedness. In a “normal” state of consciousness, you have all three. You're awake with your eyes open, a state that is sustained by signals from your brain stem. You're internally aware, forming thoughts and mental imagery. And you're connected to the outside world, with your brain receiving and processing information from the five senses.

Jen Christiansen; Source: “Near-Death Experience as a Probe to Explore (Disconnected) Consciousness,” by Charlotte Martial et al., in Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Vol. 24; March 2020 (primary framework reference)

How the brain gives rise to these strange experiences is a question that has haunted neuroscience for as long as the field has existed. Massimini was driven wild by the mystery in medical school, when he held a brain in his hands for the first time. “This is an object with boundaries, with a given weight, a little bit like tofu. It's not particularly elegant,” he says, but “inside this object that you can hold in your hand, there is a universe.” Many philosophical traditions have dealt with this apparent disconnect by saying the mind—or the soul—is not made of the same physical stuff as our bodies, a position called dualism. Science has instead flourished by assuming the opposite and siding with a theory called materialism, which presumes that everything we observe somehow arises from physical matter, including consciousness.

Perhaps knowing they weren't up to the job of explaining how this happens, neuroscientists shied away from the enigmas of consciousness until the 1990s. “You had to be retired or religious or a philosopher to be able to talk about it,” says neuroscientist Christof Koch, a member of the Scientific American board of advisers and chief scientist at the Tiny Blue Dot Foundation, a research nonprofit focusing on perception science. In 1990 Koch and Nobel laureate Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of DNA, directly challenged this taboo. They published a paper that laid out an ambitious plan to study the neurobiology of consciousness and launched the field as we know it today.

Their plan came at a good time. That same year neuroscientists invented a new way to observe the working brain called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using brain scanners, they track changes in blood flow to reveal which brain regions are active at a given time, producing colorful images of the brain in action. Koch, who studied vision, thought that by measuring people's brain responses as they looked at special optical illusions, scientists could figure out which parts of the brain are activated when something is consciously perceived. Some of the illusions used can be perceived in one of two ways; one example is Rubin's vase, which can be seen either as a vase or as two faces in profile. The image never changes, so the brain is always receiving the same information, but people's conscious experience of it can easily switch back and forth. Another visual test, called binocular rivalry, has a similar effect: each eye is shown a different image, and people perceive either one or the other but never a mix of the two. If neuroscientists could scan people's brains as their conscious perception switched, they could find parts of the brain that were associated with that change: the neural correlates of consciousness.

Koch bet big, literally. In 1998, at a consciousness-science conference in Germany, he bet philosopher David Chalmers a case of wine that researchers would discover a “clear” pattern of brain activation underlying consciousness within 25 years. Chalmers took the bet, thinking 25 years “might be a bit optimistic,” he says.

It was extremely optimistic. These early neural-correlate studies of vision, which dominated the field in the 1990s, suggested places that may be less correlated with visual awareness: the regions where input from our eyes first enters the brain. These low-level sensory-processing areas contain a lot of information that our conscious selves aren't privy to. These areas appear to continue receiving sensory information when we're under anesthesia as well. As that information travels “up” the wrinkly outer layer of the brain, called the cortex, it enters areas that pick out and process higher-level details—such as the faces in an image—and conscious awareness builds.

So consciousness seems to happen in some region outside these early visual-processing areas—but there is no consensus on where.

Today there are dozens of competing theories of how the brain generates consciousness. They have different starting points, different goals and even different definitions of consciousness. The most popular is global neuronal workspace theory (GNWT), which envisions consciousness as a kind of stage. When something enters your conscious awareness—an itch, say, or the buzz of your refrigerator—it's thrust onto the stage and spotlighted in a process called ignition. Things on the stage, or in the “global workspace,” get broadcast to the rest of the brain, where they're able to guide action, direct attention, and more.

Higher-order theories conceive of consciousness as a high-level representation of what is going on in other parts of the brain. For you to be conscious of a refrigerator's buzzing, your brain cannot just represent the buzz by activating its auditory parts (which are located near the temples). The buzz must also have a corresponding “meta-representation” in the frontal parts of the brain that are responsible for higher-order thinking—such as the thought “I am hearing the refrigerator buzzing.”

Reentry and predictive processing theories (PPTs), on the other hand, propose that consciousness emerges from our brain's balancing of two processes: perception and prediction. If you have ever seen something that wasn't there simply because you expected to see it, you know how much our brain's predictions can govern what we actually perceive. Neuroscientist Anil Seth of the University of Sussex in England, who favors PPTs, describes conscious perception as a “controlled hallucination,” with the brain's best guess of what's going on around you mapping onto what you consciously perceive.

There's a chasm between our everyday experiences and what science can explain.

Then there's integrated information theory (IIT), a mathematical and philosophical theory that stands out from the rest because it doesn't start with the brain. Instead it starts with consciousness itself and the observations we can make about its properties, then asks what kind of system could allow something with these properties to exist. IIT takes consciousness to be differentiated—there are a lot of things you could be experiencing right now but aren't, making your consciousness rich in information. And it is also unified, or integrated—all your diverse experiences are bundled into one single stream of consciousness. Mathematically, these two features together make the system very complex. And from this complexity comes consciousness.

Most eye-catching of all, IIT implies that consciousness could be present outside of living systems, a kind of panpsychism. This idea, plus the theory's relative lack of grounding in the brain and coverage in the media, would make IIT a flashpan of controversy. But first it would inspire one of the most important insights we have into how consciousness works.

In the early 2000s, while studying in the U.S., Massimini began performing experiments with a device for probing the brain that did two things at once: deliver painless magnetic pulses to the brain and detect brain waves, both from outside the scalp, techniques called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG), respectively. Once back in Italy, he managed to secure a grant to buy a TMS-EEG machine for his university despite a “desperate” research-funding situation in the country.

A few years later he and a colleague “did something crazy,” he says. They loaded the machine into a truck and drove more than nine hours to Liège. “We didn't say anything to anybody. This is a machine belonging to the university after all.” But the opportunity was too good to pass up. A neurologist in Liège named Steven Laureys had founded the Coma Science Group for treating and learning from patients with disorders of consciousness, and Massimini believed his new device could be used to measure someone's level of consciousness from their brain activity.

Researchers had tried to measure the difference between conscious and unconscious brains with other brain-imaging techniques before, without much success. But adding TMS let scientists stimulate the outer layers of the cortex, causing neurons in a specific area to fire. Then EEG measured brain waves to reveal how that stimulation spread. “It's like knocking on the brain directly,” Massimini says, “to probe the internal structure.”

You can also think of TMS like dropping a rock in a pond. In a conscious brain (whether awake or dreaming), the disturbance ripples outward as neurons cause neighbors in their networks to fire. But unlike waves in water, each of those ripples of neuron activity begets more ripples, spreading in a complex and far-reaching way throughout the brain's networks. In dreamless sleep, this doesn't happen, Massimini had previously found. TMS stimulates the brain, and the neurons fire, but the wave of activity isn't picked up by neighboring neurons. If there are ripples, they don't spread far. The complexity seen during wakefulness is gone.

In Liège, Massimini and his colleagues tested the technique on people with various disorders of consciousness—patients who were in vegetative states, or were in minimally conscious states, or were outwardly unresponsive but internally aware. They found that people whose brains exhibited a more complex response were more likely to be conscious. This relation could be represented as a single number, called the perturbational complexity index, or PCI.

PCI is a very crude measure of consciousness, but it can estimate someone's place on the spectrum of consciousness quite reliably. And it suggests that complexity is an important part of a conscious brain. In an awake or dreaming brain, diverse networks of neurons are in constant back-and-forth communication with one another. In this way, conscious brain activity is both differentiated (or rich in information) and integrated (forming one unified whole)—principles that Massimini borrowed from IIT, the theory that doesn't begin with the brain. These interactions build up complexity, or what IIT theorists call a “cause-effect structure,” so that when you stimulate one part of a conscious brain, other parts respond.

But during dreamless sleep or when someone is under anesthesia, all that communication goes away. “Everything collapses,” Massimini says. “The cathedral falls apart.” Slow brain waves travel across the cortex as neurons cycle rhythmically between two electric states. In the “silent periods” between the waves, neurons enter what's called a down state, in which they can't respond to electric signals from their neighbors. This state is why there's silence when you stimulate an unconscious brain with TMS: “No feedback, no unity, no complexity,” he says.

Of course, this loss of complexity during sleep and anesthesia is transient; disorders of consciousness can be permanent. “Why can I reverse sleep in a few seconds, and I can reverse anesthesia in the course of minutes, but I might not ever be able to reverse this pathological state?” asks George Mashour, an anesthesiologist and neuroscientist studying consciousness at the University of Michigan Medical School. Massimini hopes that we can eventually learn how to jump-start consciousness—rebuild the cathedral—for people who are in vegetative or minimally conscious states.

“It feels like there's been a hard-won legitimacy to the study of consciousness over the past 30 years.” —Anil Seth, University of Sussex

Yet understanding brain-network complexity does not solve the mystery of consciousness. These findings can help explain how a brain can reach the state of consciousness but not what happens once it's gotten there, Mashour points out. Changes in someone's PCI value can't explain, for example, why The Dress looks blue and black one moment and white and gold the next. It can't explain how a toothache feels different from a headache, how someone without functioning circulation can have a near-death experience, or how the psychedelic drug 5-MeO-DMT makes time seem to stop and obliterates your sense of self.

There's a chasm between our everyday experiences and what science can explain. “No one really has a theory that closes the explanatory gap,” says Tim Bayne, a philosopher at Monash University in Melbourne. “But that's a problem on us, not the brain.”

At a June 2023 conference in New York City, Koch gave Chalmers his case of wine and conceded that he had lost their bet. “It's clear that things are not clear,” Chalmers said.

That weekend the evidence looked particularly murky. The results of a massive research project pitting IIT against GNWT had recently been shared. The project, led by a group called the Cogitate Consortium, involved three different measuring techniques used in eight different institutions around the world. Researchers developed predictions from each theory about what should happen in the brain when an image is consciously perceived versus when it's not. Testing those predictions could challenge or even falsify either theory.

Both theories came away bruised. IIT holds that consciousness arises mostly from sustained activity in the back of the brain. This “hot zone” sits at the intersection of many sensory networks of neurons. GNWT, in contrast, predicts that a stimulus (such as an image) rises to the level of consciousness only when there is an “ignition” to the workspace in frontal parts of the brain such as the prefrontal cortex, which is known for planning and decision-making. GNWT also predicts that this ignition signal will appear as two discrete spikes of activity—one when an image is first presented and one when it's removed—whereas IIT predicts sustained activity as long as a person is looking at an image.

The results were extremely mixed. Although there was sustained activity in the back of the brain associated with conscious perception, networks in the region weren't synchronized in the way that IIT predicts. And although there was a signal in the prefrontal cortex when images were first presented, there was not a second signal when they were removed, contrary to GNWT's predictions.

Then, a few months later, the field erupted. An open letter calling IIT pseudoscience was published online in September 2023, signed by 124 researchers in or adjacent to the field. The argument focused less on the theory than on its coverage in the media, which the letter's authors saw as credulous. The authors also took issue with the panpsychist implications of IIT, highlighting descriptions of it as unscientific and “magicalist.” “These bold claims threaten to delegitimize the scientific study of consciousness,” many of the authors wrote in a follow-up article.

The prospect that the field could lose its legitimacy hung over the fight. One side feared IIT's reputation would drag consciousness science even further toward the fringes, and the other worried that publicly tarring one theory with a “pseudoscience” label would lead to the downfall of the entire field. “My greatest fear is that we get another ‘consciousness winter' wherein just talking about consciousness is considered pseudoscientific bunk,” wrote Erik Hoel, a consciousness researcher at Tufts University who has published extensively on IIT's limitations, in a post defending the theory.

The debate, which took place largely in online posts and in the media, was finally hashed out in the pages of Nature Neuroscience last March. Since then, the scientists involved have seemed to be trying to put the ugly chapter behind them. But now there is a sense that the field has arrived at an “uneasy stasis,” Seth and his colleagues wrote recently in the journal Frontiers in Science.

“It feels like there's been a hard-won legitimacy to the study of consciousness over the past 30 years,” Seth says. And there are important results to show for it. We now know that large parts of the brain—for example, the cerebellum, a structure near the brain stem that contains a majority of the brain's neurons—is apparently not involved in consciousness. We've learned about specific brain regions that are associated with specific pieces of conscious experience, such as our sense of self. We're also getting hints that ancient structures deep in our brain, such as the thalamus, may be more involved than neuroscientists had previously thought.

Comparing consciousness among species could reveal why it exists in the first place.

But underneath it all lurk countless unknowns. “There's still disagreement about how to define [consciousness], whether it exists or not, whether a science of consciousness is really possible or not, whether we'll be able to say anything about consciousness in unusual situations like [artificial intelligence],” Seth says. It stands in contrast, perhaps unfairly, to other scientific journeys of discovery, such as the mapping of our genetic code in the Human Genome Project or of the cosmos with the help of the James Webb Space Telescope, he adds.

“It's a wonderful moment but also kind of sobering,” Bayne says. Building bigger and bigger particle colliders is a pretty good tactic for revealing the stuff of the subatomic world. But for revealing the stuff of consciousness, there's no sure bet. “If Bill Gates gave me $100 billion tomorrow and said, ‘Okay, find out about consciousness,'” he says, “I wouldn't know what to do with that money.”

Artificial intelligence may soon force our hand. In 2022, when a Google engineer publicly claimed the AI model called LaMDA he had been developing appeared to be conscious, Google countered that there was “no evidence that LaMDA was sentient (and lots of evidence against it).” This struck Chalmers as odd: What evidence could the company have been talking about? “No one can say for sure they've demonstrated these systems are not conscious,” he says. “We don't have that kind of proof.”

As these machines get better at imitating human dialogue—sometimes even claiming outright to be conscious—ethicists, AI companies and the concerned public are increasingly looking to consciousness research for answers. “Suddenly those philosophical questions have become very practical questions,” Chalmers says.

These questions are bigger and older than AI. Where does consciousness exist in the world around us, and how can we prove it? Scientists and philosophers are increasingly studying animals, human fetuses, brain organoids and AI to figure out what common principles could underlie consciousness.

Researchers have often studied consciousness by focusing exclusively on humans, because the only consciousness we can ever truly be sure exists is our own. For everyone else, we must rely on behavioral cues and trust they are not a “philosophical zombie,” with all the outward signs of consciousness but without any of the internal experience. We extend this assumption to fellow humans every day. Sometime in the 20th century, though, scientists stopped doing so for animals. “When I started my graduate studies in the 1990s, ‘chimpanzees aren't conscious' was the default position for a lot of philosophers,” says Kristin Andrews, a philosopher studying animal minds at the City University of New York Graduate Center.

Yet we find consciousness only where we presume to look for it. It's a spotlight effect, Andrews explains, and since then, our spotlight has slowly widened. First, in the 1990s, consciousness scientists broadened it to do research on lab monkeys that couldn't be done on humans. By the time a group of scientists signed the Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness, in 2012, there was more acceptance of the idea that all mammals and some birds are probably sentient.

Now the frontier rests with fish, crustaceans and insects. Studies suggest that fish can recognize themselves in a mirror, bumblebees can play and crabs can weigh decisions based on conflicting priorities. The 2024 New York Declaration on Animal Consciousness, which Andrews co-authored, states that there is at least a “realistic possibility” of consciousness in all vertebrates and some invertebrates, such as insects, certain mollusks and crustaceans. “We can't just assume that all these animals are not conscious,” says Chalmers, who signed the declaration.

Comparing consciousness among species could reveal why it exists in the first place. “People have focused a lot on where consciousness is in the brain and perhaps less so on what it's for,” Seth says. He theorizes that consciousness is intrinsically linked to life. Living beings can do only one thing at a time, and to choose what to do, they must bring a lot of relevant information together into one stream.

Even if that is right, it doesn't mean carbon-based life is the only arena where consciousness can happen. “Just as we can build things that fly without flapping their wings, maybe there are other ways of being conscious that don't require being alive,” Seth says. “We should really take that possibility seriously.”

The AI large language models (LLMs) that underpin chatbots such as ChatGPT and Claude can certainly imitate consciousness well, although today they are most likely the zombies that Chalmers and other philosophers once imagined. Even most AI enthusiasts will tell you that all an LLM does is predict which word comes next in a sentence; it doesn't “know” anything. But—to be strictly philosophical about it—can we really prove LLMs aren't conscious if we haven't yet agreed on how consciousness works?

Some researchers think theories rooted in the human brain, such as GNWT, could still provide clues. If the brain is like a biological computer—a dominant assumption of cognitive neuroscience—then maybe researchers can compare how LLMs process information and test for indicators of consciousness. GNWT, which was itself inspired by an early type of AI model, says information is consciously experienced once it's broadcast across the entire system. Does an LLM do something similar?

Not everyone buys the brain-computer circuitry analogy. Brains do a lot more than run algorithms that process information, Seth says. They have electric fields, and they interact with chemical signals. They are made of thousands of types of living cells that consume energy. “It's a massive assumption that none of these things matter,” he says. “And that assumption has gone largely unexamined because of the power of the metaphor that the brain is a computer.”

IIT proponents such as Massimini and Koch also think the underlying physical “stuff” of a system matters—and that mere simulations, including LLMs, can't yield consciousness. “It's like [how] simulating a storm will not get you wet,” Massimini says, “or simulating a black hole will not bend space and time.”

In consciousness science, everything comes back to the measurement problem. You can try to find markers of different states of consciousness—for instance, by scanning a person's brain while they are awake versus in slow-wave sleep, which is typically dreamless and therefore unconscious. This experimental setup assumes the subject is in fact not dreaming. But that assumption could be wrong: sometimes people do report dreams when woken from slow-wave sleep. Were they wrong? Do you trust them? How can you confirm that your assumptions about consciousness are correct when your only ground truth is someone else's word—which is not really a ground truth at all?

When we are faced with this seemingly intractable problem, it's tempting to reach for an escape valve: Maybe none of it is real. Maybe consciousness is so illusory because it is an illusion, a beautiful cathedral that exists only in our heads. This skeptical position was often put forward by the late philosopher Daniel Dennett, and it's a legitimate question. But it doesn't allow us to opt out of treating brain injuries, understanding drugs such as anesthetics and psychedelics, and grappling with our treatment of animals and the intelligent machines we're birthing. Consciousness is real to us, and therefore it is real in every way that counts.

All of science rests on inferences about things we cannot see. We can't see a black hole, Koch points out, but we can spend decades building up theories and creating instruments that let us infer their existence. Consciousness may be a more challenging case, but researchers don't plan to stop trying. With the right tools, “the sense of mystery about how material processes could give rise to conscious experiences would start to go away,” Seth says.

“I don't know what will happen afterward—if it will still be impressive or not,” University of Liège's Demertzi says. “But, you know, sometimes nature is so beautiful that even when it's analyzed, you're in awe.”

As the U.S. marks a year of measles outbreaks, is the disease back for good?

The U.S. has held its measles-free status for more than 25 years. Experts say unrelenting outbreaks in the past year may change that

It has been a full year since one of the worst measles outbreaks in recent U.S. history began ripping through West Texas. The highly infectious disease has continued to burn across multiple U.S. states, Mexico and Canada since Texas reported an outbreak in children in January 2025. The U.S. had been virtually free of the disease for more than a quarter-century thanks to highly effective and safe vaccines, but now experts say we're on track to losing that status if officials determine measles has spread continuously for a year.

“The U.S. is in the throes of the deadliest measles outbreak it has seen in decades,” says Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. “Losing measles elimination status is an official acknowledgement that the country is on the wrong path.”

For measles, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) formally declares a country has “eliminated” the disease when cases can no longer be linked to one another—there is zero continued transmission—for 12 months or more. Last November the Americas officially lost their elimination status when PAHO's review of epidemiological data revealed that Canada was no longer measles free for a year.

“Loss of measles elimination status does not carry formal sanctions, but it is a significant public health signal,” PAHO's spokesperson wrote in an e-mail to Scientific American. “Elimination is recoverable. The Americas have faced setbacks before—including temporary loss of status in Venezuela (2018) and Brazil (2019)—and successfully regained elimination through intensified vaccination, strengthened surveillance, and rapid outbreak response.”

PAHO said its group that reviews the measles elimination status of the U.S. and Mexico is expected to reconvene after the one-year mark of the initial outbreak in West Texas. The organization will hold its meeting on April 13 in order to give countries enough time to provide documentation and data, its spokesperson added. Epidemiologist Walter Orenstein, who is on a committee for the Task Force for Global Health, which independently reviews elimination of diseases, expects that the U.S. will soon follow Canada.

“It's certainly looking like we have lost our status, but we have to look at the data,” he says, adding that the Task Force for Global Health's committee hasn't been called at this stage to look at the current situation.

The U.S. has retained its measles elimination status ever since locking down the virus's spread in 2000.

“Elimination itself is a really huge public health achievement—but with measles especially because the virus is so infectious,” says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan.

Measles requires very high levels of population immunity to squelch transmission; at least 95 percent of people in a community must have immunity from prior infection or vaccination. And national vaccination efforts played a central role in raising those population immunity levels in the U.S., says Orenstein, a professor emeritus at Emory University, who has worked on measles elimination for decades. The recommended two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is 97 percent effective at preventing disease, generally for life. “This intervention can stop and break the chains of transmission,” he says.

Before the MMR vaccine became available in 1963, the U.S. saw, on average, four million cases, 48,000 hospitalizations and 400 to 500 deaths per year from measles. Most people know measles for its itchy rash, but it can cause high fevers, ear infections, severe dehydration, pneumonia and chronic brain inflammation, or encephalitis, Orenstein says.

Such severe measles cases—largely unseen in U.S. hospitals for decades—came roaring back during recent outbreaks.

The first major outbreak was reported on January 20, 2025, in an undervaccinated community in Gaines County in West Texas. From there, “cases increased exponentially,” says Katherine Wells, a public health director of the city of Lubbock, Tex., which is about 70 miles from Gaines County. “We saw 99 individuals requiring hospitalization, meaning that either their oxygen levels dropped too low, they developed pneumonia or they were so dehydrated they had to put on IV fluids,” Wells says. “Two young children lost their lives because of measles, and that's unprecedented. Since we've had the measles elimination status, we have not seen any deaths.”

In 2025 the CDC recorded outbreaks in 24 states and confirmed 2,144 cases—the highest total since 1991. A large majority of infections were in children, with 69 percent occurring in those aged 19 and younger. Among those cases, one adult and two children died; all three were unvaccinated.

State officials declared the end of West Texas's outbreak in August 2025, but outbreaks in other states continue to surge on; in recent months, reported infections in South Carolina have ballooned to 434, while Arizona has reported 223 cases, and Utah has documented 201 cases. It remains to be seen if these outbreaks stem from the initial epicenter in West Texas.

“If [health officials] make that connection, then there will be transmission for a full year, and we'll definitely lose measles elimination status,” Wells says.

Previously, measles cases have sporadically popped up in people who traveled to countries where the disease was more prevalent, but those small outbreaks were rapidly contained and never lasted longer than a year. A major reason measles has become so entrenched now is because of declining national vaccination rates and growing antivaccine messaging driven by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Rasmussen says. In response to Scientific American, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services maintained that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles. But the secretary had repeatedly downplayed its safety to the media during the outbreak.

“When the outbreak happened in Texas, it took Kennedy quite a while to even say that the vaccine is the only way to prevent measles,” Rasmussen says. “He has gone out of his way to encourage alternative treatments that are unproven to work like vitamin A, cod liver oil and steroids.”

Wells says that local public health staff and health care workers tried to mobilize quickly to offer care and vaccines to kids and community members but that the Trump administration's budget cuts, layoffs and restructuring of U.S. health agencies interrupted support for their response efforts. “Some of the federal partners that we typically have in a public health outbreak weren't necessarily available to us,” she says.

News outlets have recently reported that U.S. federal officials are trying to maintain that the country is still measles-free by building a case to prove that ongoing infections, such as in outbreaks in Utah, Arizona and South Carolina, are not linked to West Texas cases. Health officials perform epidemiological investigations to trace infections back to common sources, as well as genomic tests to compare viruses isolated from different outbreaks. But these types of public health investigations are meant to help stop transmission and offer support to vulnerable groups with low vaccination rates—not to preserve a public health stamp, Nuzzo says.

“It is important to understand whether these cases are linked because that may help inform efforts to control the spread of measles,” Nuzzo says, “but we should not be looking for this information as though we're attempting to wheedle our way out of an embarrassing political situation.”

Responding to SciAm, the HHS spokesperson did not comment on the news reports and wrote in an e-mail on January 15 that the U.S. had not met the threshold for losing elimination status.

Measles' resurgence in the U.S. ultimately means cases will become commonplace—and communities will likely face regular, sometimes deadly, outbreaks. Those outbreaks are also incredibly expensive. An analysis last October estimated that the average health care cost per measles case in the U.S. was $43,000—far more expensive than vaccination, Nuzzo says. She, Rasmussen and Orenstein fear that other historical, vaccine-preventable diseases, such as polio, could also come raging back.

Even if it's proven that the current outbreaks are not related to those that began in January 2025, Wells says it may only be a matter of time before measles is no longer considered eliminated in the U.S.

“We'll lose the status at some point unless we change the trajectory of uptake of vaccines in our communities,” she says. “The elimination status is just a technicality. The real concern is that we're seeing measles transmission in communities, and we have an effective way to prevent that from happening.”

Why did Jeffrey Epstein cultivate famous scientists?

The Epstein files revive questions of whether the disgraced financier sought to merely cultivate famous scientists, or to shape science itself

By Dan Vergano edited by Clara Moskowitz

Last December, the U.S. Department of Justice released its first batch of files on disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Among the thousands of images was one video clip, the only one in the lot. It showed four seconds of the noted psychologist and writer Steven Pinker of Harvard University riding with Epstein on his now infamous private plane.

It wasn't a great flight even in 2002, years before Epstein's first criminal conviction, Pinker says of the trip, which was heading to a TED Talk. “I immediately disliked Epstein and thought he was a dilettante and a smartass,” he says.

Epstein, who died in federal prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, spent a lot of time talking to scientists. When more records are released from a reported stash of 5.2 million, now a month overdue, questions about what the “Epstein files” say about science and scientists are sure to arise. Already, e-mails dropped by a congressional committee and files released by the DOJ—thousands of notes, lists, videos and investigation records—have once again raised the question of why so many prominent scholars were involved with Epstein.

The financier widely courted pundits, politicians and billionaires, as the DOJ files confirm with photographs of everyone from Mick Jagger to Bill Clinton to Donald Trump appearing with him. (None are charged with wrongdoing in connection to the photos.) A piano virtuoso, mysteriously wealthy and famously ingratiating, Epstein courted scientists for years, leading to investigations at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, the results of which were made public in 2020. Last year's e-mail releases revealed that astronomer Lawrence Krauss and linguist Noam Chomsky both associated with him long after his crimes became public knowledge. Last November Harvard launched a new investigation to look at connections between Epstein and economist Lawrence Summers, former president of the university.

Money is one easy answer for why scientists were interested in Epstein. “Scientists need patronage; they need support,” says Bruce Lewenstein, a science communications expert at Cornell University. Wealthy patrons have funded scientists for centuries; they have paid for telescopes to investigate the atmospheres of alien worlds, brain mapping institutes, malaria prevention experiments, and much else. “That's not good or bad; that's what it is. And that has been true for 400 years,” Lewenstein says. Unlike many donors, Epstein usually wasn't asking for his name on a building, and he donated money to everything from dance troupes to the Council on Foreign Relations, according to a 2019 Miami Herald report.

Before his 2008 conviction for soliciting minors for prostitution, Epstein donated more than $9 million to Harvard, including a $6.5-million gift to Harvard's Program for Evolutionary Dynamics (PED), led by mathematician Martin Nowak. (Epstein continued to visit that program after his conviction—he did so more than 40 times in 2018 alone—and kept an office there.) He was also a Visiting Fellow at the university in the 2005–2006 academic year, after making a $200,000 gift to its psychology department. Following his conviction, donors he introduced to Harvard scientists gave $9.5 million to the school.

Then there were Epstein's donations to M.I.T.: he donated $525,000 to the MIT Media Lab and $225,000 to mechanical engineering professor Seth Lloyd. Both gifts came after his 2008 conviction and were handled outside normal channels, according to a university report. Epstein claimed to also have arranged another $7 million in donations from billionaires Bill Gates and Leon Black to the school (Gates denied this, and the university report says there's no evidence of an effort to “launder” Epstein's money in the donations).

“The only generalization is that scientists, like the universities they work for, together with artists and others in nonprofit ventures that depend on philanthropy, routinely cozy up to wealthy people willing to slosh money around,” Pinker says. “Very few of these donors are heinous psychopaths, and he exploited their gullibility.”

According to Pinker, his pre-TED Talk flight with Epstein came at the behest of his literary agent, John Brockman, whose Edge Foundation also threw salons for Epstein that BuzzFeed News described as an “exclusive intellectual boys club.” (Brockman and his organization did not respond to a request for comment, and no reports of wrongdoing attended the events.) Epstein funded that foundation, which threw parties for billionaires and made contacts with people such as Pinker for him. Those contacts paid off: despite his dislike for Epstein, Pinker unwittingly contributed to the financier's legal defense. Pinker wrote a 2007 opinion on the semantics of the wording of a prostitution law as a favor for Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz, who was Epstein's lawyer and had once taught a course with Pinker. Pinker has said he didn't know the opinion was for Epstein's defense.

“I was doing a professional courtesy to a colleague—it's routine,” Pinker says. “If I knew at the time what we know now, I would not have agreed.”

So, legal opinions aside, what did Epstein want from science? The simplest explanation is that Epstein collected prominent people. His financial networking relied on creating an aura of wealth and influence to entice investors. He was a “people collector” who traded information and favors, said Barry Levine, one of his biographers, in a 2025 BBC report. Scientists might have just been one of many influential groups he cultivated at a time that was “a cultural high-water mark for scientists as celebrities,” says Declan Fahy, an associate professor of science communication at Dublin City University in Ireland and author of The New Celebrity Scientists. Scientists wrote best-selling books, appeared in Vanity Fair and Vogue and gave viral TED Talks that were elevated online. “They moved into the power elite,” Fahy says, and so made sense for Epstein to cultivate.

According to Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend and majordomo, who was convicted in 2021 of sex trafficking, conspiracy and transportation of a minor for illegal sexual activity, Epstein was particularly fascinated by brain science. In a July 2025 interview Maxwell told the DOJ that connections she had made through her father, Robert Maxwell, founder of scientific publisher Pergamon Press, led to her introducing Epstein to the Santa Fe Institute, a home to many high-profile scientists. (Epstein donated $25,000 to the institute in 2010.) “Epstein would have dinners at the house that I was tasked to organize and the scientists were a very major component of that,” she said, according to the DOJ transcript.

The scientist and writer Evgeny Morozov attributed Epstein's scientific connections to Brockman—the literary agent who, according to Pinker, talked the psychologist onto Epstein's plane—in a 2019 article in the New Republic. Himself a former Brockman client, Morozov recounted the agent's attempts to connect him to Epstein and his “billionaires' dinners,” whose attendees often were TED Talk speakers—invitations that Morozov declined.

The Edge Foundation was ubiquitous in science writing circles from 1998 to 2018, annually publishing books on scientific topics. It was also connected to the physicist Lawrence Krauss, a former member of Scientific American's board of advisers, who was removed following sexual misconduct allegations in 2018. Released e-mail records show that Krauss asked Epstein for advice on handling those charges. Krauss has denied the misconduct allegations against him; none of the communications cited allege wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. (In 2014 Epstein was even invited to two Scientific American editorial meetings, which he did not attend.) Public records suggest the Edge Foundation received $638,000 from Epstein from 2001 to 2015, making him its major funder.

One disturbing explanation for Epstein's support of science comes from his interest in genetic determinism. This idea, which dates to the eugenics era, is still fashionable in some wealthy circles and can be seen in companies now offering designer baby services for embryos of would-be parents. In 2019 the New York Times reported that Epstein had ambitions of founding a “baby ranch” to raise children of women he impregnated (not unlike “secret compound” plans reportedly shared by SpaceX and Tesla chief Elon Musk).

“Given this stance, it is particularly disturbing that he focused his largesse on research on the genetic basis of human behavior,” wrote Naomi Oreskes, a historian of science, in Scientific American in 2020. “Scientists might claim that Epstein's money in no way caused them to lower their standards, but we have broad evidence that the interests of funders often influence the work done.” (Regarding Epstein, Oreskes now adds, “The continued press attention reminds us that—rightly or wrongly—we are judged by the company we keep, and some money is tainted.”)

Perhaps the only direct evidence of Epstein's scientific ambitions comes from a proposal he made in 2005 to be a Visiting Fellow at Harvard. “I wish to study the reasons behind group behavior, such as ‘social prosthetic systems,'” he wrote in an application proposing magnetic resonance imaging studies on human volunteers. “That is, other people can act as ‘prosthetics' insofar as they augment our cognitive abilities and help us to regulate our emotions—and thereby essentially serve as extensions of ourselves,” he added, with a scientific gloss neatly encapsulating his view of humanity's role in his life. Harvard approved him twice for the fellowship, though a 2020 investigation later noted his utter lack of qualifications.

One last question is why anyone is surprised that celebrity scientists fell into Epstein's orbit—as opposed to, say, rock stars or politicians doing so—in a culture driven by the worship of wealth and celebrity.

“A bit of this is [because] we have created an idealized picture of scientists that doesn't match reality,” Lewenstein says. Scientists themselves like being seen as experts with their status on a pedestal, he adds. “They are very reluctant to acknowledge the social forces that shape their science,” Lewenstein says.

In other words, money talks in science. For decades, pharmaceutical-industry-funded research, for example, has more often reported favorable results in medicine. And money can control what science projects don't get done; social media companies such as Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) have shut out researchers from examining their data—a vast, barely regulated experiment on billions of people linked to worse mental health in children. At the National Institutes of Health right now, in a very different era for science than one of celebrity, Trump administration political appointees are approving or disapproving allocations of the agency's $48-billion budget for investigations judged as worthy by actual scientists, overturning the post–World War II standards for funding research.

Most of the scientists supported by Epstein weren't overtly political and supported a once-uncontroversial view of science as an engine of progress, Fahy says. Things are different now, “where public debate around science in the U.S.—particularly around climate and vaccination—has become sharper, divisive, intensely political,” he adds.

All that leaves Pinker unsure why his four seconds on the plane in 2002 was the only video in the Epstein files to be initially released by the Trump administration. One reason might be to generate news stories such as this one about scientists, he says. “The more that journalists write about other people in photos, the less attention Trump's entanglement gets,” Pinker says.

Your guide to 29 wildly different theories of consciousness

The many, many ways researchers hope to solve the toughest mystery in science

Theorists have proposed many explanations for consciousness. They are startlingly diverse, with different goals, starting points and even definitions of consciousness. To compare them, researchers surveyed articles suggesting a theoretical model for consciousness that were published between 2007 and 2017 in English or Italian.

Some of these theories have many publications to their name, such as global workspace theories, higher-order theories and integrated information theory, three of the field's leading models. But having more publications does not mean a theory is supported by stronger evidence—this analysis didn't weigh the strength of study results. Instead the number of articles most likely reflects the amount of interest each type of theory garnered. This may explain why quantum theories of consciousness, which are fascinating but not yet grounded in much evidence, have been proposed so many times. Predictive processing theories, which are also influential in the field, are notably absent, perhaps because they originated as theories of perception rather than consciousness.

The researchers found 68 articles that analyzed theoretical aspects of consciousness and that were published between 2007 and 2017 in English or Italian. Together, they represent 29 different types of theories. More than half (18) were suggested only once, but others garnered more interest.

All of these proposals are wildly different, and only some are supported by evidence. The researchers analyzed how each tried to address six dimensions of consciousness: (A) what brain activity correlates with conscious experience, (B) how consciousness relates to other mental faculties such as memory and attention, (C) the clinical treatment of disorders involving consciousness, (D) how levels of consciousness could be measured, (E) how consciousness relates to sensory information, and (F) where subjective experience comes from.

From anxious Weimaraners to aggressive Chihuahuas: What science can tell us about dog breeds

A large dataset shows some dog stereotypes are based in reality, and others might be unfair characterizations

Dogs can have wildly different personalities, which often vary by breed and size. Although individual temperament matters most, larger trends can help predict which pooch will be meek and mild and which is most likely to bite the postal worker.

The Dog Aging Project, a long-term study on canine aging, has collected data on dog behavior from more than 50,000 owners, distilling the results into scores for traits such as trainability, excitability and aggression. Owners of mixed-breed dogs reported higher average scores for fear and aggression than owners of single-breed dogs, for instance. And compared with larger dogs, smaller dogs tended to score higher for fear, aggression and excitability and lower for trainability. Understanding these patterns is key to improving the compatibility of people and their pets. “Dogs are entirely dependent on their owner,” says veterinarian Audrey Ruple of the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, a collaborator on the Dog Aging Project. A mismatch can be “devastating,” but a good match can ensure dogs receive the care and affection they need.

Dog breeds classified as toy or small have higher owner-rated scores on aggression and fear, as well as lower trainability scores. Large and giant dog breeds, in contrast, are on average the most trainable and the least aggressive and anxious. “I suspect it has to do with the way small dogs are treated as compared with large dogs,” Ruple suggests. Good behavior in a big dog is often judged as more of a necessity, whereas people may let little dogs off the hook.

Dogs rated as more trainable tend to learn new skills more readily. They often obey “sit” or “stay” commands immediately, and they aren't as easily distracted by interesting sights, sounds or smells. Some breeds are known for being easily taught, and mixed-breed dogs tend to get rated as less trainable than purebreds. That pattern, however, might reflect the early life experiences of mixed-breed dogs, who often are adopted from shelters or rescues and have experienced trauma, Ruple says. A purebred dog raised by a reputable breeder, however, will be primed to be comfortable around people and eager to learn. collectively find solutions to these problems as long as the federal government remains committed to providing funding for this research,” Wilson notes.

Mind=blown.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Entropy. The word itself should cause insomnia. It means that matter and energy will degrade—ultimately leading to chaos in the universe—if things are left alone. So why is a new theory suggesting that gravity could possibly emerge from entropy?

Yup, you read that right: quantum relative entropy may determine the action of gravity. This is what physicist and mathematician Ginestra Bianconi from Queen Mary University of London proposes in a new theory. There's just one issue: for this to work, two theories that have forever been at odds with each other need to harmonize.

The idea of quantum relative entropy mashes up the clashing concepts of general relativity and quantum theory. Einstein's theory of general relativity sees gravity as the curvature or warping of spacetime by an object, with more massive objects having a greater effect on the spacetime surrounding them. For example, the Sun is 330,000 times the mass of the Earth. As a result, our planet is orbiting within the huge distortion in spacetime that the Sun's enormous presence has caused, like a quarter rolling around one of those oversized funnels.

Quantum theory, on the other hand, views the universe as being made of extremely small objects (think subatomic particles) that act as both particles and waves. Particles are minuscule pieces of matter, while waves are disturbances that transfer energy. According to quantum mechanics, the universe is described on micro and nano scales. Relativity is the opposite, in the sense that it describes matter on cosmic scales. 

Finding a way to connect general relativity and quantum mechanics has proved to be an enduring headache for scientists. To that end, enter Bianconi's theory. She posits that spacetime is actually a quantum operator, meaning that it acts on quantum states to turn them into different types of quantum states. Quantum entropy quantifies (no pun intended) how much disorder or unpredictability is in the state of something, which helps distinguish between two quantum states. Bianconi, in her work, found that she could use it to describe how spacetime and matter interact.

“Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry [of spacetime],” she said in a study recently published in Physical Review D.

By allowing quantum entropy to describe differences between matter and spacetime, Bianconi's theory modifies general relativity by first giving the fabric of spacetime low energy and a small curvature, and then by predicting a small cosmological constant (which explains how much and how fast the universe is expanding). 

The new theory also incorporates a G-field, or gravitational field. G-fields are vector fields—which means they have both magnitude and direction—that explain how space is influenced by an object. Bianconi uses the G-field as what is known as a Lagrangian multiplier, which finds the maximum and minimum of a function. Waves, which are one of the two quantum states, are described by a wave function. Finding the maximum and minimum of a wave function with a G-field could reconcile quantum theory with general relativity.

If the clash between the theories is finally resolved, you end up with quantum gravity, which would exist in particle and wave form. 

That said, gravity existing in particle form raises another question. Dark matter is made of particles, but the nature of those particles remains an enigma, since they have never been directly observed. Bianconi thinks that, if gravity can exist as particles, the G-field might offer an explanation for dark matter. 

“This work proposes that quantum gravity has an entropic origin and suggests that the G-field might be a candidate for dark matter,” she said in a press release. 

There's still a lot of work that needs to be done before this idea is anywhere near confirmed. But, there's a chance that chaos brings about gravity, which in turn might, in one form, possibly be dark matter. Mind blown.

For the first time, researchers at the University of British Columbia have shown how to consistently produce a crucial type of human immune cell, known as helper T cells, from stem cells in a controlled lab setting.

The research, published on January 7 in Cell Stem Cell, removes a major barrier that has slowed the development, affordability, and large-scale production of cell therapies. By solving this problem, the work could help make off-the-shelf treatments more accessible and effective for conditions such as cancer, infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, and more.

""Engineered cell therapies are transforming modern medicine,"" said co-senior author Dr. Peter Zandstra, professor and director of the UBC School of Biomedical Engineering. ""This study addresses one of the biggest challenges in making these lifesaving treatments accessible to more people, showing for the first time a reliable and scalable way to grow multiple immune cell types.""

The Promise and Limits of Living Drugs

Over the past several years, engineered cell therapies such as CAR-T treatments have produced dramatic, sometimes lifesaving results for people with cancers that were once considered untreatable. These therapies work by reprogramming a patient's immune cells to recognize and destroy disease, effectively turning those cells into 'living drugs'.

Even with their success, cell therapies remain costly, complex to manufacture, and out of reach for many patients around the world. One key reason is that most existing treatments rely on a patient's own immune cells, which must be collected and specially prepared over several weeks for each individual.

""The long-term goal is to have off-the-shelf cell therapies that are manufactured ahead of time and on a larger scale from a renewable source like stem cells,"" said co-senior author Dr. Megan Levings, a professor of surgery and biomedical engineering at UBC. ""This would make treatments much more cost-effective and ready when patients need them.""

Cancer cell therapies are most effective when two types of immune cells work together. Killer T cells directly attack infected or cancerous cells. Helper T cells, which act as the immune system's conductors -- detecting health threats, activating other immune cells and sustaining the immune responses over time -- play a central coordinating role.

While scientists have made progress using stem cells to create killer T cells in the lab, they have not been able to reliably generate helper T cells until now.

""Helper T cells are essential for a strong and lasting immune response,"" said Dr. Levings. ""It's critical that we have both to maximize the efficacy and flexibility of off-the-shelf therapies.""

A Key Advance Toward Stem Cell Based Immune Therapies

In the new study, the UBC research team addressed this long-standing challenge by carefully adjusting biological signals that guide how stem cells develop. This approach allowed them to precisely control whether stem cells became helper T cells or killer T cells.

The scientists found that a developmental signal known as Notch plays an important but time-sensitive role in immune cell formation. Notch is necessary early in development, but if the signal stays active for too long, it blocks the formation of helper T cells.

""By precisely tuning when and how much this signal is reduced, we were able to direct stem cells to become either helper or killer T cells,"" said co-first author Dr. Ross Jones, a research associate in the Zandstra Lab. ""We were able to do this in controlled laboratory conditions that are directly applicable in real-world biomanufacturing, which is an essential step toward turning this discovery into a viable therapy.""

The team also confirmed that the lab-grown helper T cells functioned like real immune cells, not just in appearance but in behavior. The cells showed signs of full maturity, carried a wide variety of immune receptors, and were able to develop into specialized subtypes with distinct immune roles.

""These cells look and act like genuine human helper T cells,"" said co-first author Kevin Salim, a UBC PhD student in the Levings Lab. ""That's critical for future therapeutic potential.""

Researchers say the ability to generate both helper and killer T cells, and to carefully control their balance, could greatly improve the effectiveness of stem cell-derived immune therapies.

""This is a major step forward in our ability to develop scalable and affordable immune cell therapies,"" said Dr. Zandstra. ""This technology now forms the foundation for testing the role of helper T cells in supporting the elimination of cancer cells and generating new types of helper T cell-derived cells, such as regulatory T cells, for clinical applications.""

Nearly everyone knows the feeling. After a night of poor sleep, it becomes harder to stay focused. Thoughts drift, reaction times slow, and mental clarity fades when attention is needed most.

New research from MIT sheds light on what is happening inside the brain during these brief lapses in focus. The study shows that when attention momentarily fails, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) moves out of the brain, a process that normally happens during sleep and helps clear away waste that accumulates throughout the day. This cleansing activity is considered important for keeping the brain healthy and functioning properly.

When someone is sleep-deprived, the body appears to try to make up for lost rest by triggering bursts of this fluid movement during wakefulness. That compensation, however, comes with a significant downside: sharply reduced attention.

""If you don't sleep, the CSF waves start to intrude into wakefulness where normally you wouldn't see them. However, they come with an attentional tradeoff, where attention fails during the moments that you have this wave of fluid flow,"" says Laura Lewis, the Athinoula A. Martinos Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, a member of MIT's Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and the Research Laboratory of Electronics, and an associate member of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory.

Lewis is the senior author of the study, published in Nature Neuroscience. MIT postdoctoral associate Zinong Yang is the lead author.

How Sleep Cleans the Brain

Sleep is essential for survival, yet scientists still do not fully understand why it plays such a critical role. What is clear is that sleep is necessary for staying alert, and that losing sleep reliably harms attention and other mental abilities.

One important function of sleep involves cerebrospinal fluid, which surrounds and cushions the brain. During sleep, CSF helps flush out waste that builds up during waking hours. In a 2019 study, Lewis and her colleagues found that this fluid moves in a rhythmic pattern as people sleep, closely linked to shifts in brain wave activity.

That earlier discovery raised a new question: what happens to this fluid system when sleep is disrupted? To find out, the researchers recruited 26 volunteers who completed testing twice, once after a night of sleep deprivation in the lab and once after being well-rested.

The following morning, participants completed a standard task used to assess the effects of sleep loss while researchers tracked a wide range of brain and body signals.

Measuring Attention and Brain Fluid Flow

During the experiment, each participant wore an electroencephalogram (EEG) cap to monitor brain activity while lying inside a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. The team used a specialized version of fMRI that could track both blood oxygen levels and the movement of CSF in and out of the brain. Heart rate, breathing rate, and pupil size were also recorded.

Participants completed two attention tests inside the scanner, one visual and one auditory. In the visual task, they watched a fixed cross on a screen that occasionally changed into a square. They were instructed to press a button whenever the change occurred. In the auditory task, the visual cue was replaced by a sound.

As expected, sleep-deprived participants performed significantly worse than when they were well-rested. Their reactions were slower, and in some cases they failed to notice the signal entirely.

When these brief attention failures occurred, the researchers observed multiple physiological changes happening at the same time. Most notably, CSF moved outward from the brain during the lapse and then flowed back in once attention returned.

""The results are suggesting that at the moment that attention fails, this fluid is actually being expelled outward away from the brain. And when attention recovers, it's drawn back in,"" Lewis says.

The team believes this pattern reflects the brain's attempt to compensate for missed sleep by activating a cleaning process that normally occurs at night, even though doing so temporarily disrupts attention.

""One way to think about those events is because your brain is so in need of sleep, it tries its best to enter into a sleep-like state to restore some cognitive functions,"" Yang says. ""Your brain's fluid system is trying to restore function by pushing the brain to iterate between high-attention and high-flow states.""

A Brain and Body System Working Together

The study also revealed that attention lapses are linked to changes beyond the brain itself. During these moments, breathing and heart rate slowed, and pupils became smaller. Pupil constriction began roughly 12 seconds before CSF moved out of the brain and reversed after attention returned.

""What's interesting is it seems like this isn't just a phenomenon in the brain, it's also a body-wide event. It suggests that there's a tight coordination of these systems, where when your attention fails, you might feel it perceptually and psychologically, but it's also reflecting an event that's happening throughout the brain and body,"" Lewis says.

These findings suggest that a single control system may coordinate both attention and basic bodily functions such as fluid flow, heart rate, and alertness.

""These results suggest to us that there's a unified circuit that's governing both what we think of as very high-level functions of the brain -- our attention, our ability to perceive and respond to the world -- and then also really basic fundamental physiological processes like fluid dynamics of the brain, brain-wide blood flow, and blood vessel constriction,"" Lewis says.

While the researchers did not identify the specific circuit involved, they point to the noradrenergic system as a strong candidate. This system, which uses the neurotransmitter norepinephrine to regulate cognition and bodily functions, is known to fluctuate during normal sleep.

The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health, a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Research Fellowship, a NAWA Fellowship, a McKnight Scholar Award, a Sloan Fellowship, a Pew Biomedical Scholar Award, a One Mind Rising Star Award, and the Simons Collaboration on Plasticity in the Aging Brain.

At 6:42 p.m. EST on Saturday, Jan. 17, NASA's Artemis II SLS (Space Launch System) rocket and Orion spacecraft completed their move to Launch Pad 39B at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The rollout from the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) took nearly 12 hours from start to finish.

The trip began hours earlier when NASA's crawler-transporter 2 set off on a 4-mile journey carrying the fully stacked SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft. Traveling at a top speed of just 0.82 mph, the crawler moved the massive Moon rocket steadily toward the launch pad.

After exiting the VAB's high-bay doors, the rollout briefly paused so teams could adjust the crew access arm, a structure that allows astronauts and closeout crews to enter Orion on launch day.

Preparing for Critical Prelaunch Testing

Over the next several days, engineers and technicians will focus on readying Artemis II for a wet dress rehearsal. This test simulates key launch-day activities, including fueling the rocket and running through countdown procedures. The rehearsal is currently targeted for no later than Feb. 2.

During the test, teams will load the rocket with cryogenic, or super-cold, propellants, carry out a full countdown sequence, and then safely drain the propellants. These steps are essential preparations ahead of NASA's first crewed Artemis mission.

Possible Additional Testing Before Launch

NASA may conduct more than one wet dress rehearsal to ensure the rocket and spacecraft are fully prepared for flight. If additional work is needed, the agency could roll SLS and Orion back to the Vehicle Assembly Building after the rehearsal for further inspections or adjustments.

Astronaut Crew and Mission Goals

The Artemis II test flight will carry NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Christina Koch, along with CSA (Canadian Space Agency) astronaut Jeremy Hansen. The crew will spend about 10 days traveling around the Moon before returning to Earth.

This mission marks another major step toward future U.S.-crewed landings on the Moon's surface. Those efforts aim to establish a long-term human presence on the Moon and help NASA prepare to send the first astronauts -- Americans -- to Mars.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A faint signal from the Universe's dark ages could reveal dark matter","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260120000318.htm","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:36:23 GMT","

The Universe began about 13.8 billion years ago with the Big Bang, a moment of extremely rapid expansion. Roughly 400,000 years later, after the cosmos cooled enough for atoms to form, it entered a long and quiet phase known as the ""Dark Ages."" This period lasted for around 0.1 billion years, ending only when the first stars and galaxies finally ignited and began producing light.

Although the Universe was dark during this time, it was not completely silent. Scientists believe hydrogen atoms emitted very faint radio waves with a wavelength of 21 cm. These signals are thought to preserve valuable information about the earliest stages of cosmic history.

Simulating the Early Universe and Dark Matter

Using advanced numerical simulations, researchers from the University of Tsukuba and The University of Tokyo explored how this 21-cm signal might behave under different theories of dark matter. Dark matter is an unseen form of matter that makes up about 80% of all matter in the Universe.

By recreating the structure and movement of gas and dark matter in the young Universe on powerful supercomputers, the research team was able to predict the strength of the radio emission during the Dark Ages with unprecedented accuracy.

What the Signal Could Reveal About Dark Matter

The simulations suggest that hydrogen gas during the Dark Ages produced a distinct signal with a brightness temperature of roughly 1 millikelvin (one-thousandth of a degree) when averaged across the sky. Importantly, dark matter is expected to cause variations in this signal of a similar size.

Measuring the overall radio signal across a wide frequency range of about 45 MHz could therefore provide critical information about dark matter, including the mass and speed of its particles.

Why Scientists Are Looking to the Moon

To detect such an extremely weak signal, astronomers need a location free from interference caused by Earth's atmosphere and human technology. Several upcoming lunar missions, including Japan's Tsukuyomi Project, aim to place radio telescopes on the Moon for this reason.

If these lunar instruments succeed in capturing the ancient radio signal, they could offer a powerful new way to investigate the nature of dark matter and deepen our understanding of how the Universe began.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Unbreakable? Researchers warn quantum computers have serious security flaws","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260120000330.htm","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:05:16 GMT","

Quantum computers are expected to deliver extraordinary speed and computing power, with the potential to transform scientific research and business operations. That same power also makes them especially appealing targets for cyberattacks, said Swaroop Ghosh, a professor of computer science and electrical engineering at the Penn State School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

Ghosh and Suryansh Upadhyay, who recently earned his doctorate in electrical engineering from Penn State, coauthored a research paper that outlines several serious security weaknesses affecting today's quantum computing systems. Published online in the Proceedings of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the study argues that protecting quantum computers requires more than securing software alone. The physical hardware that runs these systems must also be part of any serious defense strategy.

In a Question and Answer discussion, Ghosh and Upadhyay explained how quantum computers work, why they face unique security challenges, and what steps developers can take to prepare these machines for wider use.

Q: What makes a quantum computer different from a traditional computer? 

Ghosh: Traditional computing works using units of information called bits, which you can picture as a light switch in the ""on"" or ""off"" position. These positions are assigned values of one or zero, with one representing on and zero representing off. We program computers by using algorithms or educated guesses to develop the best possible solution for a problem, compiling this solution to generate machine-level instructions -- directions specifying which bits need to equal one and which bits need to equal zero -- that the computer follows to execute a task.

Quantum computers are built on quantum bits, or qubits. These qubits are much more versatile than standard bits, capable of effectively representing one, zero or both at the same time, otherwise known as a superposition. These qubits can also be linked to one another, known as entanglement. By incorporating superpositions and entanglement into decision making, quantum computers can process exponentially more data than bit-powered computing systems, while using an equivalent number of qubits.

This is useful for improving workflows in many industries, since quantum computers can process information much faster than traditional computers. One example is the pharmaceutical industry, where quantum computing can quickly process data and predict the efficacy of potential new drugs, significantly streamlining the research and development process. This can save companies billions of dollars and decades spent researching, testing and fabricating innovative drugs.

Q: What are some of the main security vulnerabilities facing quantum computers right now? 

Upadhyay: Currently, there is no efficient way to verify the integrity of programs and compilers -- many of which are developed by third parties -- used by quantum computers at scale, which can leave users' sensitive corporate and personal information open to theft, tampering and reverse engineering.

Many quantum computing algorithms have businesses' intellectual property integrated directly in their circuits, which are used to process highly specific problems involving client data and other sensitive information. If these circuits are exposed, attackers can extract company-created algorithms, financial positions or critical infrastructure details. Additionally, the interconnectedness that allows qubits to operate so efficiently inadvertently creates a security vulnerability -- unwanted entanglement, known as crosstalk, can leak information or disrupt computing functions when multiple people use the same quantum processor.

Q: What are current commercial quantum providers doing to address the security concerns? Can they use the same security methods implemented in traditional computers? 

Upadhyay: Classical security methods cannot be used because quantum systems behave fundamentally differently from traditional computers, so we believe companies are largely unprepared to address these security faults. Currently, commercial quantum providers are focused on ensuring their systems work reliably and effectively. While optimization can indirectly address some security vulnerabilities, the assets unique to quantum computing, such as circuit topology, encoded data or hardware coded intellectual property systems generally lack end-to-end protection. Since quantum computers are still a relatively new technology, there is not much incentive for attackers to target them, but as the computers are integrated into industry and our day-to-day life, they will become a prime target.

Q: How can developers improve security in quantum computers? 

Ghosh: Quantum computers need to be safeguarded from ground up. At the device level, developers should focus on mitigating crosstalk and other sources of noise -- external interference -- that may leak information or impede effective information transfer. At the circuit level, techniques like scrambling and information encoding must be used to protect the data built into the system. At the system level, hardware needs to be compartmentalized by dividing business data into different groups, granting users specific access based on their roles and adding a layer of protection to the information. New software techniques and extensions need to be developed to detect and fortify quantum programs against security threats.

Our hope is that this paper will introduce researchers with expertise in mathematics, computer science, engineering and physics to the topic of quantum security so they can effectively contribute to this growing field.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","The overlooked survival strategy that made us human","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260118233601.htm","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 02:29:15 GMT","

Researchers from IPHES-CERCA have contributed to a new study led by the National Research Center on Human Evolution (CENIEH) that challenges long-standing ideas about how early humans survived. Published in the journal Journal of Human Evolution, the research takes a sweeping look at carrion consumption from the earliest hominins to modern humans. The authors argue that scavenging was not an occasional fallback, but a core survival strategy repeated throughout human evolutionary history.

The study brings together an international group of experts, including Dr. Jordi Rosell, a professor at the Universitat Rovira i Virgili and researcher at IPHES-CERCA, and Dr. Maite Arilla, also of IPHES-CERCA. Additional contributors came from CENIEH, IREC-CSIC, IPE-CSIC, Universidad Miguel Hernández, and the universities of Alicante, Granada, and Málaga.

Why Scavenging Was a Smart Survival Strategy

According to the researchers, scavenging offered clear benefits to early humans. Finding and exploiting animal carcasses required far less energy than hunting live prey and could provide critical nutrition during times of scarcity. During periods of famine, carrion may have been one of the most reliable food sources available.

Recent ecological studies also support this view, showing that carrion is more abundant and predictable than previously assumed. Many scavenger species have also developed behaviors that help limit their exposure to disease, further reducing the risks associated with this food source.

Humans Were Well Equipped to Scavenge

The researchers emphasize that humans are biologically and behaviorally suited for scavenging. ""The acidic pH of the human stomach may act as a defense against pathogens and toxins, and the risk of infection decreased considerably when we began to use fire for cooking. Moreover, our ability to travel long distances with low energy expenditure was key to finding food opportunities,"" they explain.

These traits, combined with early technology, gave humans a unique advantage. Language and stone tools -- even the simplest ones -- made it possible to coordinate group efforts, locate carcasses, and extract valuable resources such as meat, fat, and bone marrow. Scavenging worked alongside hunting and plant gathering as part of a flexible and efficient food strategy.

Challenging the Idea of Scavenging as Primitive

The question of how early humans first obtained meat has been debated for decades. In the 1960s, discoveries in Africa showing that ancient hominins consumed meat raised a key question: were they skilled hunters, or were they primarily scavengers? For many years, scavenging was dismissed as a temporary and inferior phase that humans abandoned once hunting skills improved.

That interpretation has now been overturned. Modern research shows that all carnivorous species consume carrion to some degree. In addition, many present-day hunter-gatherer societies still include scavenging as part of their subsistence practices, demonstrating that it remains a practical and effective strategy.

A Core Behavior That Helped Make Us Human

The authors conclude that scavenging was never just a stepping stone on the path to hunting. Instead, it was a consistent and essential part of human survival that complemented other food-gathering methods. Far from being a marginal behavior, eating carrion (far from being a marginal behavior) played a central role in shaping human evolution and ultimately helped make us human.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists discover why some wounds refuse to heal","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260120015650.htm","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 07:36:45 GMT","

An international research team led by Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore), has identified a promising way to help chronic wounds heal faster, including wounds infected with antibiotic resistant bacteria.

Chronic wounds are a growing global health problem. Each year, about 18.6 million people worldwide develop diabetic foot ulcers.[1] Over a lifetime, as many as one in three people with diabetes may experience a foot ulcer.

These long lasting wounds are a leading cause of lower limb amputations. Ongoing infections often make healing even harder, trapping patients in a cycle of repeated complications.

In Singapore, chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, pressure injuries and venous leg ulcers are becoming more common. More than 16,000 cases are reported each year, particularly among older adults and people living with diabetes.[2]

How a Common Bacterium Blocks Healing

The findings were published in Science Advances in collaboration with researchers from the University of Geneva, Switzerland. The study reveals how a widespread bacterium, Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), can actively interfere with the body's ability to heal wounds. The team also showed that blocking this process allows skin cells to recover and close wounds.

E. faecalis is an opportunistic pathogen often found in chronic infections such as diabetic foot ulcers. These wounds are notoriously difficult to treat and frequently fail to heal, raising the risk of serious complications and amputation.

Antibiotic resistance adds another layer of difficulty. Some strains of E. faecalis no longer respond to several commonly used antibiotics, making infections increasingly challenging to control.

While doctors have long known that infections can slow wound healing, the exact biological reason for this effect has remained unclear.

The study was jointly led by NTU Associate Professor Guillaume Thibault from the School of Biological Sciences and Professor Kimberly Kline from the University of Geneva, who is also a visiting professor at SCELSE -- Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences and Engineering, at NTU.

The Role of Bacterial Metabolism and Cell Stress

The researchers found that E. faecalis behaves differently from many other bacteria that infect wounds. Instead of relying mainly on toxins, it releases reactive oxygen species (ROS), a metabolic byproduct that disrupts the normal healing function of human skin cells.

First author NTU Research Fellow Dr Aaron Tan discovered that E. faecalis uses a metabolic process called extracellular electron transport (EET). This process continuously produces hydrogen peroxide, a highly reactive oxygen species capable of damaging living tissue.

When E. faecalis is present in a wound, the hydrogen peroxide it produces causes oxidative stress in nearby human skin cells.

Laboratory experiments showed that this oxidative stress activates a protective response in keratinocytes, the skin cells responsible for repairing wounds. This response is known as the ""unfolded protein response.""

Under normal conditions, the unfolded protein response helps cells survive damage by slowing protein production and other essential activities, giving them time to recover.

However, once triggered in this context, the response effectively paralyzes the cells. It prevents them from moving into the wound area to seal the damaged tissue, a process known as migration.

To confirm the importance of this pathway, the researchers tested a genetically modified strain of E. faecalis that lacked the EET pathway. These altered bacteria produced much less hydrogen peroxide and were no longer able to block wound healing.

This result confirmed that the metabolic pathway plays a central role in how E. faecalis disrupts skin repair. The team then investigated whether neutralizing hydrogen peroxide could reverse the damage.

A Potential Treatment Beyond Antibiotics

When the researchers treated stressed skin cells with catalase, a naturally occurring antioxidant enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide, cellular stress levels dropped. As a result, the cells regained their ability to migrate and heal the wound.

This approach offers an alternative way to address infections caused by antibiotic resistant E. faecalis. Instead of trying to kill the bacteria with antibiotics, the strategy focuses on neutralizing the harmful substances the bacteria produce.

""Our findings show that the bacteria's metabolism itself is the weapon, which was a surprise finding previously unknown to scientists,"" said Assoc Prof Thibault, who is also the Assistant Dean (International Engagement) at the College of Science.

""Instead of focusing on killing the bacteria with antibiotics, which is becoming increasingly difficult and leads to future antibiotic resistance, we can now neutralize it by blocking the harmful products it generates and restoring wound healing. Instead of targeting the source, we neutralize the actual cause of the chronic wounds -- the reactive oxygen species.""

The study directly links bacterial metabolism to dysfunction in human cells, pointing to a new therapeutic strategy for chronic wounds.

The researchers suggest that future wound dressings infused with antioxidants such as catalase could help promote healing.

Because antioxidants like catalase are already widely used and well understood, the team believes this approach could move from laboratory research to clinical use faster than developing an entirely new drug.

Since the mechanism was demonstrated using human skin cells, the findings are directly relevant to human physiology and may lead to new treatments for people with non healing wounds.

Next, the researchers plan to move toward human clinical trials after identifying the most effective way to deliver antioxidants through ongoing studies in animal models.

Quantum circuits with local unitaries offer a platform to explore many-body quantum dynamics in discrete time. Their locality makes them suitable for current processors, but verification at scale is difficult for non-integrable systems. Here we study dual-unitary circuits, which are maximally chaotic yet permit exact analytical solutions for certain correlation functions. Using improved noise-learning and error-mitigation methods, we show that a superconducting quantum processor with 91 qubits is able to accurately simulate these correlators. We then perturb the circuits away from the dual-unitary point and benchmark the dynamics against tensor-network simulations. These results establish error-mitigated digital quantum simulation on pre-fault-tolerant processors as a reliable tool to explore emergent quantum many-body phases.

Mammalian cells receive signaling instructions through interactions on their surfaces. Proteoglycans are critical to these interactions, carrying long glycosaminoglycans that recruit signaling molecules. Biosynthetic redundancy in the first glycosylation step by two xylosyltransferases XT1/2 complicates annotation of proteoglycans. Here we develop a chemical genetic strategy that manipulates the glycan attachment site of cellular proteoglycans. Through a bump-and-hole tactic, we engineer the two isoenzymes XT1 and XT2 to specifically transfer the chemically tagged xylose analog 6AzGlc to target proteins. The tag contains a bioorthogonal functionality, allowing to visualize and profile target proteins in mammalian cells. Unlike xylose analogs, 6AzGlc is amenable to cellular nucleotide-sugar biosynthesis, establishing the XT1/2 bump-and-hole tactic in cells. The approach allows pinpointing glycosylation sites by mass spectrometry and exploiting the chemical handle to manufacture proteoglycans with defined glycosaminoglycan chains for cellular applications. Engineered XT enzymes permit an orthogonal view into proteoglycan biology through conventional techniques in biochemistry.

Proteoglycans are large biomolecules that consist of a core protein and one or more glycosaminoglycan (GAG) modifications on cell surfaces and within the extracellular matrix in metazoa1,2. Growth factors, neurotrophic factors and chemokines can be recruited to target cells through GAG-binding sites, rendering proteoglycans important determinants for development3,4. Consequently, dysfunctions in GAG biosynthesis cause severe phenotypes from embryonic lethality to skeletal and muscular deficiencies5. Binding events between proteoglycans and their receptors are impacted by the core protein and the identity of GAGs, which are classified into heparan sulfate (HS), chondroitin sulfate (CS), dermatan sulfate and keratan sulfate6,7. Biochemistry and genetic engineering have linked proteoglycan physiology to the GAG structures on particular cell types or even on distinct subcellular locations8,9,10,11,12,13. Despite their relevance in physiology, only a relatively small number of proteoglycans (<100) are known in humans14,15. Furthermore, it is challenging to dissect the role of the protein backbone in proteoglycan physiology from the role of the GAG chain, necessitating strategies in chemistry to manipulate and alter proteoglycans16.

An impediment for profiling proteoglycans is the large size of GAG modifications that renders analysis by mass spectrometry (MS) challenging. While GAG-carrying glycopeptides contain common amino acid signatures such as acidic patches and a central O-glycosylated Ser with often flanking Gly or Ala residues, there is no consensus sequence to predict GAG glycosylation in the Golgi6,9,17,18. Common strategies to identify proteoglycans feature enzymatic digestion of GAG chains either before or after isolation of glycopeptides9,19,20,21,22,23,24. While powerful, such procedures make use of complex digestion and purification protocols and focus solely on the GAG-carrying glycopeptide, without the advantages of shotgun (glyco)proteomics methods that use the full MS peptide coverage of individual proteins for detection.

The biosynthesis of HS and CS commences through a common O-linked glycan ‘linker' modification consisting of a glucuronic acid (GlcA), two galactoses (Gal) and a xylose (Xyl) in the GlcA(β-3)Gal(β-3)Gal(β-4)Xyl(β-)Ser sequence (Fig. 1a), with optional further modifications7,25. The first glycosylation step attaching Xyl to Ser is subject to redundancy by the xylosyltransferase isoenzymes XT1 and XT2 that use uridine diphosphate (UDP)-Xyl as a substrate. The isoenzymes share 60% amino acid identity but display tissue-specific expression patterns. Dysfunctions are associated with different genetic disorders: Desbuquois Dysplasia Type 2 and Spondylo-ocular syndrome for XYLT1 and XYLT2 mutations, respectively26,27,28,29. Differential roles in physiology have been attributed to XT1 and XT2 (refs. 30,31). Although XT2 appears to be the dominant isoenzyme in cell lines and serum32,33, mice with Xylt1 and Xylt2 knockout (KO) display differential defects in development30,31. It is currently not possible to directly profile the substrate proteins or even individual glycosylation sites of XT isoenzymes in cells or in vivo.

Source data

Here, we use a chemical biology tactic termed bump-and-hole (BH) engineering to probe the substrates of human xylosyltransferases in living cells. On the basis of the structural considerations, we replace a bulky amino acid in the active site of XT1 with a smaller residue to accept the chemically modified substrate UDP-6AzGlc that is not accepted by the wild-type (WT) enzyme. The chemical modification contains an azide group for bioorthogonal incorporation of fluorophores or biotin (Fig. 1a). Judicious choice of the analog as a derivative of UDP-glucose (Glc) enables cytosolic delivery, circumventing the lack of a cellular salvage pathway for ‘direct' analogs of Xyl. After in-depth biochemical characterization, we install the BH-XT1 system in mammalian cells to directly visualize, profile and probe proteoglycans. We further show that BH engineering can be applied to the isoenzyme XT2, allowing differential substrate profiling of both isoenzymes in mammalian cells. Introduction of a chemical handle at the native glycosylation site enables attachment of a bioorthogonally tagged GAG chain, furnishing ‘designer' proteoglycans to modulate cellular behavior. Through an XT BH system, we chemically manipulate proteoglycans in mammalian cells for functional evaluation.

Our XT BH design was prompted by biosynthetic and structural considerations (Fig. 1b). In the absence of a functional group that allows facile chemical modification34,35, the most common approach to develop bioorthogonal reporters of monosaccharides is the replacement of hydroxyl groups with azido groups36,37,38. Previous studies developed a 4-azido-substituted Xyl analog that is incorporated into proteoglycans by XT1 (ref. 39) but the corresponding UDP-sugar cannot be biosynthesized in mammalian cells as there is no salvage pathway for Xyl40. The BH tactic uses substrate analogs that would normally not be accepted by glycosyltransferases (GTs)41,42,43. Thus, we sought to reprogram XTs to accept a UDP-sugar that is not accepted by WT-XT1 but can be biosynthesized in mammalian cells. WT-XT1 has been reported to use UDP-6-azido-6-deoxy-D-glucose (UDP-6AzGlc) with approximately 20-fold lower enzymatic efficiency than UDP-xylose (UDP-Xyl)44. We opted to develop a mutant with reversed selectivity to accept UDP-6AzGlc over UDP-Xyl. As an analog of Glc, 6AzGlc was projected to hijack parts of the UDP-Glc salvage pathway and, therefore, allow cellular biosynthesis unlike Xyl analogs36.

Our recent crystal structure of XT1 revealed a two-lobe architecture containing a catalytic glycosyltransferase (GT) domain17. As XT1 contains an unusually constricted UDP-Xylbinding site that prevents the use of larger UDP-sugars such as UDP-6AzGlc, we deemed it possible to generate additional space (a ‘hole') in the active site by mutation. XT1 harbors several bulky ‘gatekeeper' amino acids in close proximity to C5 of UDP-Xyl, namely Trp392, Leu525 and Leu526 (Fig. 1b). We designed, expressed and purified from Expi293 cells a total of 16 XT1 single-mutant and double-mutant variants in which these residues were replaced with smaller amino acids (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1). In vitro glycosylation of a bikunin substrate peptide in a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay served to assess glycosylation from the sugar donors UDP-Xyl, UDP-6AzGlc and, as a substrate of intermediate size of the ‘bump', UDP-Glc17.

WT-XT1 displayed exclusive activity for UDP-Xyl in our hands, with no activity toward UDP-Glc or UDP-6AzGlc44. Most engineered XT1 variants displayed either no activity at all or were still selective for UDP-Xyl, with some displaying activity toward UDP-Glc. Strikingly, the variant Leu526Gly preferred UDP-6AzGlc as a substrate, with 7–8-fold higher turnover than using UDP-Xyl or UDP-Glc in an endpoint assay. Compared to the Leu526Gly mutant (henceforth termed ‘BH-XT1'), the construct Leu526Ala displayed no such selectivity, with equal activity on all three UDP-sugars (Fig. 1c). We determined optimal enzyme concentrations and kinetic constants for the native and BH enzyme–substrate pairs (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). We found that the KM of the BH pair (41.2 µM) was similar to the WT pair (37.4 µM), while the kcat was 2.8-fold reduced in the BH pair. In contrast, BH-XT1 uses UDP-Xyl with an approximately tenfold lower catalytic efficiency and UDP-Glc with an approximately threefold lower catalytic efficiency than UDP-6AzGlc, suggesting that the native UDP-sugar substrates should not be able to outcompete UDP-6AzGlc in cellular applications. Taken together, we established a sensitive structure–activity relationship in the development of a BH-XT1 variant.

To assess whether BH engineering retains substrate preference of WT-XT1 toward the proteoglycan backbone, we first tested the BH enzyme–substrate pair (BH-XT1 and UDP-6AzGlc) with a panel of 240 acceptor peptides in an in vitro glycosylation assay. The panel contained derivatives of the bikunin XT1 substrate peptide in which each amino acid was substituted with each of the other 19 proteinogenic amino acids. We previously used the same peptide panel to extract amino acid preferences of the native enzyme–substrate pair (WT-XT1 and UDP-Xyl) in a luminescence-based assay17. Using the same assay, the peptide substrate preferences were found to be conserved between WT-XT1 and BH-XT1, with positive Pearson correlation across all peptides and specifically to individual substitutions across all independent replicates (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5; WT peptide preference discussed in a previous study17). Introducing basic Lys or Arg residues anywhere in the substrate peptide lowered enzyme activity, whereas acidic Glu and Asp tended to increase activity. An exception was the substitution of Glu at the −4 position with Asp that led to a decrease in turnover for both WT-XT1 and BH-XT1 (ref. 17). Substitutions of glycine residues at positions −1 and +1 of the central Ser were not well tolerated by either WT-XT1 or BH-XT1. An exception was substitution of Gly at +1 position to hydrophobic amino acids Leu, Met or Phe, which led to residual activity in BH-XT1 but not WT-XT1. As this Gly is in contact with Leu526 in WT-XT1, we reasoned that the Leu526Gly ‘hole' left space for substitutions to larger hydrophobic amino acids in substrate peptides. As these were the only reproducible differences between WT-XT1 and BH-XT1 (other replicates in Supplementary Fig. 4) and low in number from a 240-member peptide library, we concluded that BH engineering exhibits conservation of peptide substrate preference in vitro.

We next assessed whether BH-XT1 retains the activity of WT-XT1 to initiate GAG attachment sites on proteoglycan backbones. We prepared membrane fractions from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with or without KO for endogenous xylosyltransferase genes Xylt1 and Xylt2 (ref. 10). Membrane fractions were incubated with recombinant WT-XT1 or BH-XT1 and synthetic UDP-Xyl and UDP-6AzGlc, followed by reaction with alkyne-biotin under copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddtion (CuAAC) ‘click' conditions. Analysis by streptavidin blot suggested labeling of lysate proteins with 6AzGlc only when BH-XT1 but not WT-XT1 was present (Supplementary Fig. 6). As Xylt2 is the major xylosyltransferase gene expressed in CHO cells10, we used CHOKO Xylt2 cells for further in vitro glycosylation experiments. We established that labeling by BH-XT1 with UDP-6AzGlc could not be outcompeted with increasing concentrations of UDP-Xyl, suggesting that BH-XT1 specifically and potently recognizes UDP-6AzGlc as a substrate (Fig. 2b). Preincubation of the membrane protein fraction with WT-XT1 and UDP-Xyl abrogated incorporation of 6AzGlc by BH-XT1, suggesting that the same glycosylation sites are introduced by both enzymes (Fig. 2c).

We next confirmed in vitro that BH-XT1 emulates the activity of WT-XT1 to glycosylate proteoglycans. Human decorin has a single site of GAG attachment. Recombinant expression in the CHO cell mutant pgsA-745 that lacks endogenous XT activity results in a GAG-free decorin preparation7,8. We incubated this GAG-free decorin with either WT-XT1 or BH-XT1 in the presence of UDP-Xyl and/or UDP-6AzGlc, followed by CuAAC with alkyne-biotin and streptavidin blot (Fig. 2d). While WT-XT1 activity did not lead to discernible streptavidin signal on decorin, BH-XT1 in the presence of UDP-6AzGlc led to an intense streptavidin signal that could be abrogated by preincubation of decorin with WT-XT1 and UDP-Xyl. These data indicate that the single GAG attachment site was blocked with a Xyl residue by WT-XT1, preventing BH-XT1 activity. We observed the same behavior in a GAG-free preparation of human glypican 1, GPC1 (Supplementary Fig. 7), suggesting that BH-XT1 recapitulates the activity of WT-XT1 across a range of proteoglycans.

We confirmed the glycosylation site modified by BH-XT1 on in vitro glycosylated recombinant decorin by tandem MS. Two fragmentation methods are routinely used for O-glycopeptides. Higher-energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) primarily fragments the glycosidic bond to detect glycan oxonium ions while electron transfer dissociation (ETD) fragments the peptide backbone to allow glycan site annotation. The clickable azide tag was essential to improve sugar identification in mass spectra, allowing incorporation of functional groups that are beneficial to analysis. Specifically, we used a clickable imidazolium tag (ITag) that carries a permanent positive charge and increased the charge state of glycopeptides, allowing direct glycosylation site annotation45. We first applied a standard workflow in which HCD fragmentation led to an ITag-containing, 6AzGlc-derived signature ion that was used to trigger ETD on the same glycopeptide35,41,43,45. This tandem strategy is used because O-linked glycan modifications are usually too labile to be detected within peptide fragments during HCD, hampering glycosylation site localization. Surprisingly, ITag-modified 6AzGlc was detected on peptide fragments in HCD spectra on a tryptic glycopeptide derived from decorin, without the need for additional ETD (Fig. 2e).

Decorin is proteolytically processed during secretion to remove a propeptide and shorten the N terminus46. HCD fragmentation allowed for direct identification of Ser34 as the attachment site of 6AzGlc by BH-XT1 on this mature form, consistent with Ser34 being the site of cellular GAG attachment (Fig. 2e)47. Taken together, these results suggest that the BH-XT1 enzyme–substrate pair glycosylates native GAG attachment sites in proteoglycans in vitro.

Application of a GT BH system in living cells requires biosynthesis of the nucleotide-sugar. In general, caged, membrane-permeable monosaccharide precursors are used with ester modifications that are deprotected in the cytosol. Free monosaccharides can then be converted to UDP-sugars before transport to the Golgi42,43,48. Although human cells are devoid of a salvage pathway for UDP-Xyl, the use of UDP-6AzGlc provided an opportunity for the cellular biosynthetic pathway for UDP-Glc instead. Glc is activated in mammalian cells first by phosphorylation to Glc-6-phosphate and, subsequently, isomerization by phosphoglucomutase (PGM) to Glc-1-phosphate (Fig. 3a). Conversion to UDP-Glc then features the enzymes UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase 1 or 2 (UGP1/2). As phosphorylation at the 6-position was prevented by the azido group, we sought to bypass the kinase and PGM steps and provide a sugar-1-phosphate as a direct substrate for UGP1/2. We were encouraged by analysis of the UGP1–UDP-Glc cocrystal structure in which the UDP-Glc 6-hydroxyl group is solvent exposed, suggesting that an azido group at that position should be tolerated by the enzyme (Fig. 3a)49. While we and others have made sugar-1-phosphates caged as labile bis-S-acetylthioethyl (SATE) phosphotriesters, synthesis of SATE-caged 6AzGlc-1-phosphate failed in our hands43,50,51. Instead, we took inspiration from the increasingly popular ProTide technology that has gained attention to cage phosphates in antiviral nucleotides52,53 and has been recently used to cage sugar-phosphates54,55,56. We synthesized phosphoramidate diester 1 as a caged sugar-1-phosphate to be deprotected by hydrolases in the cytosol of living mammalian cells (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Note)52. The synthesis proceeded from 6-azido-6-deoxy-D-Glc 3 through the intermediate triacetate 4. Treatment of 4 with phosphoramidite precursor 5 under basic conditions yielded both α-phosphoramidate diester 1 (60% yield) and β-phosphoramidate diester 2 (9.8% yield) (Fig. 3b)57. As UGP1/2 is naturally restricted to the α-configured Glc-1-phosphate, preferential formation of the α-anomer was gratifying. In turn, β-phosphoramidate diester 2 served as a negative control in feeding experiments. Feeding K-562 cells the α-phosphoramidate diester 1 led to notable and reproducible biosynthesis of UDP-6AzGlc (Fig. 3c). In turn, β-configured phosphoramidate diester 2 led to negligible UDP-6AzGlc levels, possibly arising from very small (4%) amounts of α-configured 1 as a contaminant of 2 (Supplementary Information). These data suggest that α-phosphoramidate diester 1 is a suitable precursor to deliver UDP-6AzGlc to mammalian cells by entering the UDP-Glc biosynthetic pathway.

With a strategy for UDP-6AzGlc delivery in hand, we established a BH system to chemically tag XT1 substrate proteins in mammalian cells (Fig. 4a). The pgsA-745 CHO cell line was stably transfected with plasmids encoding WT-XT1 or BH-XT1 using a transposase-based genome insertion method43,58, followed by feeding the 6AzGlc-1-phosphate precursor 1. After overnight incubation, CuAAC was performed to attach clickable alkyne-CF680 to 6AzGlc on the cell surface while keeping cells alive35,43,48. Surplus click reagents were washed away, cells were lysed and fluorophore incorporation was assessed by SDS–PAGE and in-gel fluorescence (Fig. 4b). Minimal background fluorescence was observed in cells fed with DMSO or only expressing WT-XT1, even when fed with increasing concentrations of 6AzGlc-1-phosphate precursor 1. In the presence of BH-XT1, clear bands of fluorescently labeled proteins were observed at 30 kDa, 90 kDa and >260 kDa. With increasing feeding concentration of 1, a concentration-dependent increase of fluorescence was observed, along with labeled protein bands of lower intensity, especially between 50 and 90 kDa. In accordance with biosynthetic experiments, the β-configured 6AzGlc-1-phosphate 2 yielded a weak and diffuse labeling signal when fed to cells, indicating that UDP-6AzGlc biosynthesis is a direct prerequisite for cellular chemical tagging of glycoproteins by BH-XT1. The fluorescence bands at 90 kDa and 260 kDa in the BH-XT1–compound 1 lanes were observed weakly when compound 2 was fed, which we attribute to small residual levels of compound 1 in the preparation (Fig. 3c). Ac4ManNAz as a precursor to azide-tagged sialic acid yielded a strong and uniform fluorescence signal across all cell lines tested59. Our data indicate that BH-XT1 specifically tags cell-surface proteins with bioorthogonal 6AzGlc in the secretory pathway of mammalian cells.

The mammalian genome encodes two xylosyltransferase isoenzymes that have been differentially implicated in disease and proteoglycan function28,30,32,60. To allow for substrate profiling of the second isoenzyme XT2, we extended the BH strategy by using structural similarities between the two isoenzymes. A structural overlay between the XT1 crystal structure and the XT2 AlphaFold structure highlighted conservation of amino acids interacting with UDP-Xyl (Fig. 4c). We identified the gatekeeper residues Leu431, Leu432 and Trp298 in XT2 that occupied the same role as the respective residues in XT1, with Leu432 in XT2 overlaying with Leu526 in XT1. The BH-XT2 mutant L432G was, thus, stably expressed in pgsA-745 CHO cells. Feeding with 6AzGlc-1-phosphate precursor 1 and cell-surface CuAAC reaction with CF680-alkyne led to a similar band pattern by in-gel fluorescence, with glycoprotein bands at 90 kDa and >260 kDa identified in BH-XT2-expressing cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4d). We noted that the intensity of fluorescence bands specifically tagged by BH-XT2 was lower than by BH-XT1, indicating a lower activity of the second isoenzyme. WT-XT2 expression did not lead to the same fluorescence band pattern. Neither feeding DMSO nor compound 2 led to discernible signal over background and Ac4ManNAz was included as a positive labeling control. To apply the BH-XT approach in human cells, we knocked out the XYLT1 or XYLT2 gene in the K-562 leukemia cell line. Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding for the corresponding WT-XT or BH-XT and biorthogonal tagging was performed through feeding 1. A cell-surface CuAAC reaction with CF680-alkyne led to a discernible glycoprotein band pattern by in-gel fluorescence, with bands at 70 kDa and 160 kDa identified in both BH-XT1-expressing and BH-XT2-expressing cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 8). Our data suggest that the BH approach is applicable to both xylosyltransferase isoenzymes in mammalian cells, allowing to assess their substrate profiles.

Xylosyltransferase BH engineering is poised to allow the identification of proteoglycans, a feat that normally requires elaborate methods of glycopeptide enrichment and characterization9,21,23. A prerequisite to glycoprotein enrichment and identification is biosynthetic simplicity; ideally, 6AzGlc would replace an entire GAG chain without added complexity for glycan elaboration. Thus, to establish an MS-glycoproteomics workflow, it was important to assess whether 6AzGlc, like Xyl, was extended to a functional GAG linker tetrasaccharide. We recently reported an enzymatic method for extension of xylosylated glycopeptides by recombinant preparations of the GTs: B4GALT7, B3GALT6 and B3GAT3 (termed linker enzymes) in the presence of UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) and UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA). Using a fluorescently labeled bikunin-derived peptide, we first confirmed by HPLC that attachment of either Xyl (by WT-XT1) or 6AzGlc (by BH-XT1) led to a shift of peptide retention time (Fig. 5a). Upon addition of the linker enzymes, the Xyl moiety was sequentially elongated to the full tetrasaccharide. In contrast, a 6AzGlc-modified peptide did not shift in retention time upon incubation with the GTs and UDP-sugars. We concluded that 6AzGlc is a chain-terminating modification that is not extended to functional GAG chains. We interpreted this substantial decrease in glycan complexity as an advantage for MS and to manipulate the composition of proteoglycans, as discussed below.

a, 6AzGlc is not elongated by GAG linker enzymes. Fluorescently labeled bikunin-derived peptide was incubated with WT-XT1–UDP-Xyl or BH-XT1–UDP-6AzGlc and, subsequently, with the indicated soluble GTs7 and corresponding UDP-sugars. Elongation was assessed on each step by HPLC. Data are from one experiment each with different combinations of transferases. b, Using BH-XT1/2 to profile proteoglycans by MS. c, Analysis of the glycosylation site on decorin introduced by BH-XT1 in living cells by MS and HCD fragmentation.

In d,e, statistical significance was assessed using a two-sample Welch's t-test to evaluate differential enrichment between BH/WT-XT1/XT2 pairs and generate P values. Multiple-hypothesis testing was corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure to calculate FDRs. Protein hits with adjusted FDR values ≤ 0.05 were retained for visualization. f, Analysis of cell spreading of MDA-MB-231 cells (dark gray) with SDC1-knockdown (SDC1KD, light gray) and rescue with clickable heparin introduced either into alkyne-tagged SDC137 or azide-tagged SDC1-6AzGlc (light orange for SDC137, dark orange for SDC37-Hep, light green for SDC1-6AzGlc and dark green for SDC1-6AzGlc-Hep).

We next determined that a functional XT1 system chemically tags a model proteoglycan in mammalian cells by MS. FLAG-tagged human decorin was overexpressed as a secreted proteoglycan in pgsA-745 CHO cells that expressed BH-XT1. Cells were fed with 6AzGlc-1-phosphate precursor 1 and decorin was immunoprecipitated from conditioned supernatant. The preparation was subjected to CuAAC with ITag-alkyne, digested and subjected to MS with HCD fragmentation. We confirmed unambiguously that Ser34 was glycosylated by BH-XT1 inside mammalian cells, confirming the BH approach as suitable to identify proteoglycans including native Xyl attachment sites (Fig. 5b,c).

Our in-gel fluorescence data suggested that the two isoenzymes XT1 and XT2 may exhibit an overlapping substrate glycoprotein profile. To test this notion, we compared the glycoproteome tagged by either BH-XT1 or BH-XT2 in cells by MS. Chemically tagged glycoproteins in conditioned supernatants of stably transfected pgsA-745 CHO cells fed with 250 µM caged phosphate 1 were treated with alkyne-biotin under CuAAC conditions, enriched on neutravidin resin and subjected to on-bead proteolytic digest. Peptide fractions were analyzed by MS using data-independent acquisition over three replicates each, with WT-XT1/2-expressing cells fed with 250 µM caged phosphate 1 as control conditions. Data were processed using the software DIA-NN to identify and quantify Cricetulus griseus proteins61. Enriched peptide and protein fractions were analyzed with Perseus62. Glycosylation by BH-XT1 led to a striking enrichment of cellular proteoglycans, including syndecan 4 (SDC4), glypicans (GPCs) 1, 4 and 6, APLP2 (amyloid precursor-like protein 2), versican, betaglycan and CD44, compared to the supernatant of cells expressing WT-XT1 (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 9). To control for the relatively high concentration of compound 1 used in these experiments, we repeated the experiment with 50 µM 1 over four independent replicates (Supplementary Fig. 10). Similarly, glycosylation by BH-XT1 led to the enrichment of bona fide proteoglycans decorin, SDC4, GPC1 and CD44. We note that these data may explain the band pattern seen by in-gel fluorescence (Fig. 4b), with tentative annotations of SDC4 (30 kDa), glypicans (50–70 kDa), APLP2, betaglycan or CD44 (90 kDa) and versican (>260 kDa). BH-XT2 led to strong and selective enrichment of GPC1 and SDC4 over WT-XT2 at both concentrations tested (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10). In both cases, we analyzed the identity of detected peptides from these enriched proteins and found them to lie outside previously annotated glycosylation site(s) (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Table 1). These findings suggest that cellular BH-XT1/2 engineering allows unambiguous proteoglycan profiling without the need to annotate the GAG attachment site. When a less stringent comparison was made between cells expressing BH-XT1/2 fed with compound 1 against the same cell lines fed with DMSO as a control, the bona fide proteoglycans nidogen 1, CS proteoglycan 4, agrin and aggrecan were additionally found to be enriched (Supplementary Fig. 12). We conclude that BH engineering enables straightforward detectability of proteoglycans from mammalian cells.

The BH approach replaces the GAG chain of a proteoglycan with a bioorthogonal modification. We reasoned that this approach could be used to introduce suitably modified GAG polysaccharides, creating neoglycoproteins that allow for functional dissection of the proteoglycan components in cell biology. We previously used unnatural amino acid introduction through amber stop-codon reassignment to produce SDC1 chemically tagged at position 37 (termed SDC137) with a clickable alkyne16. Through CuAAC, SDC137 could be furnished with azide-containing, clickable heparin to generate a neoglycoprotein termed SDC137-Hep. In the presence of either fully glycosylated, HS-containing SDC1 or SDC137-Hep, MDA-MB-231 cells exhibit enhanced spreading on vitronectin-coated surfaces in an integrin αvβ3-dependent fashion that can be analyzed by microscopy. Soluble SDC1 preparations can be deposited on cells by virtue of their 6×His tags through the use of a synthetic Ni2+-displaying, membrane-anchored cholesterol anchor16. We used BH-XT1 to introduce 6AzGlc into a nonglycosylated WT-SDC1 preparation in vitro, to generate SDC1-6AzGlc. Heparin was derivatized with an anomeric alkyne tag through hydrazide chemistry and introduced into 6AzGlc-SDC1 through CuAAC to furnish SDC1-6AzGlc-Hep.

Both SDC1-Hep conjugates displayed an increase in molecular weight (Supplementary Fig. 13). MDA-MB-231 cells were depleted of endogenous SDC1 by siRNA-based knockdown, significantly impacting cell spreading (Fig. 5f). Deposition of nonglycosylated SDC137 or SDC1-6AzGlc enhanced cell spreading by approximately 20%, suggesting a role of the SDC backbone alone for MDA-MB-231 spreading that has been noted before16. Heparin-containing SDC137-Hep and SDC1-6AzGlc-Hep fully rescued cell spreading, indicating that BH engineering and bioorthogonal chemistry restored the functional properties of a proteoglycan.

The importance of proteoglycans in physiology is undisputed, as the vast majority of signaling events between cells or with the extracellular matrix are modulated by the associated GAG chains. While great efforts are being made to understand the details of GAG polysaccharide sequence on biology10,14,22,63,64, we still lack important information on the first step of glycosylation to the protein backbone. The two human xylosyltransferases display tissue selectivity and differences in attached GAG sequences but we do not yet have fundamental insight into their individual biological functions28,31,32,33,60. A chemical tool to dissect XT1/2 biology must accurately report on XT1/2 activity while being orthogonal to other glycosylation events in the secretory pathway and deliverable to living mammalian cells. Both catalytic efficiency and peptide substrate preference of the BH-XT1 enzyme–substrate pair were remarkably conserved. Incorporation of 6AzGlc into cell-surface proteins was dependent on the presence of BH-XT1. We note that this finding does not exclude incorporation into glycoconjugates that naturally contain D-Glc, as most of these are either glycolipids or intracellular glycoproteins, neither of which would be visible with our assays.

The finding that 6AzGlc is not extended to the common GAG linker tetrasaccharide was expected because of the restrictive active site architecture of the follow-on enzyme B4GALT7 (ref. 65). However, we recognize this nonextension as an advantage for MS because 6AzGlc is structurally well defined and can be directly modified through bioorthogonal chemistry. In our MS experiments, annotation was further simplified by the availability of the ITag technology to facilitate MS45,66. Furthermore, a chain-terminating, clickable inhibitor of chain extension has the potential to be used to study GAG biology in vitro or in vivo16,39,67, substantially expanding our toolbox.

Establishing a cellular XT BH system required a biosynthetic entry point for UDP-6AzGlc. Previously used per-acetylated 6AzGlc was not a suitable precursor for glycosylation in our hands36 but we note that cell lines from different organisms can vary in their biosynthetic potential68. Nevertheless, a ProTide-based caged sugar-1-phosphate was a reliable precursor for UDP-6AzGlc to fashion a cellular BH system.

While XT2 appears to be the dominant isoenzyme expressed in humans, dysfunctions in both enzymes lead to severe yet differential disorders in mouse models and in humans30,31,32,33. After fully characterizing a BH-XT1 system, we designed a functional BH-XT2 mutant simply on the basis of structural homology. BH-XT2 was directly applied in living cells without characterizing the corresponding soluble recombinant enzyme first, showcasing the reliability of the tactic and the importance of structural data for identification of nucleotide-sugar binding.

Proteoglycans can be perceived as a modular assembly between a protein backbone and one or more GAG chains. While biological function can be imparted by either component, it can be challenging to differentiate both. The biosynthetic details of GAG extension by either HS or CS/DS are beginning to be understood7 but methods to reliably swap the GAG chain on a given proteoglycan are of fundamental importance for proteoglycan biology. We recently used stop-codon reassignment to introduce an alkyne-tagged amino acid into a recombinant proteoglycan backbone16, as a critical aspect of understanding the role of SDC1 for cell spreading. We applied BH engineering to underpin these findings, allowing to chemoenzymatically attach a chemical modification to the recombinant protein. We note the ability to use this modular approach to generate ‘designer proteoglycans' with unnatural GAG chains to generate functional understanding.

Our work is setting the foundation to establish the fine differences between XT1 and XT2 and profile proteoglycans in a range of different model systems.

A pCEP-Pu vector containing DNA coding residues 232–959 of WT and Trp392Ala human xylosyltransferase 1 (original complementary DNA from Dharmacon, BC045778, clone 4791553) with a tobacco etch virus protease-cleavable His tag at the N terminus of the secreted protein was used previously17. The plasmid was used as a template to generate genes of single and double mutants of XT1 by overlap extension PCR using the Q5 HiFi polymerase (New England Biolabs) and bespoke primers (Supplementary Table 1) designed with the Agilent QuikChange tool (https://www.agilent.com/store/primerDesignProgram.jsp, accessed on 4 December 2023), according to the manufacturer's instructions. In PCR step 1, two 25-µl reactions were set up individually with 10 ng of WT-XT1 template DNA, 12.5 µl of Q5 HiFi mastermix and either 0.5 µM primer mix of ‘XT1 pOPING for' or ‘XT1 pOPING rev' primer with ‘XT1 pOPING infusion rev' or ‘XT1 pOPING infusion for' primer for the targeted XT1 mutation. Conditions featured 1 min at 98 °C (denaturation), 25 cycles of 10 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 68 °C and 1 min at 72 °C and a final extension of 15 min at 72 °C. PCR products from the two reactions were purified by agarose gel using a Macherey-Nagel NucleoSpin gel and PCR cleanup kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), concentration was measured by nanodrop ranging from 10 to 50 ng µl−1 and then 2.5 µl of the purified PCR products were mixed with 0.5 µM primer mix of infusion for and infusion rev primers following the same PCR protocols as above. Next, 100 ng of purified final PCR product was then mixed with 50 ng pOPING plasmid digested with KpnI-HF and Pmel (New England Biolabs). pOPING plasmid was a gift from R. Owens (Addgene, plasmid 26046; RRID:Addgene_26046)69. Inserts were introduced using an infusion HD cloning kit (Takara Bio) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stellar competent cells (Takara Bio) were transformed by heat shock and used for plasmid amplification. All plasmids were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Genewiz) and nanopore sequencing (Plasmidsaurus) before use.

Expi293F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were cultured in 10 ml of Gibco FreeStyle medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 50-ml cell culture flasks at 37 °C, 8% CO2 and 125 rpm. The cells were subcultured to 0.8 × 106 cells per ml 2 days before transfection at the exponential growth phase with a viability of at least 95%. Transfection of the Expi293F cells was performed at a density of 3 × 106 cells per ml using the ExpiFectamine 293 transfection kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For each 10-ml cell culture, 10 µg of DNA and 30 µl of ExpiFectamine 293 were diluted in 500 µl of OptiMEM I (Thermo Fisher Scientific), with the ratio of DNA to ExpiFectamine 293 at 1:3 (w/v) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. They were then mixed and incubated for 20 min at room temperature to allow the DNA–transfection reagent complexes to form before being added drop by drop to the cells. The cells were then incubated in the same conditions for another 20–24 h before adding 50 µl of ExpiFectamine 293 transfection enhancer 1 and 500 µL of transfection enhancer 2. The cell culture supernatants were harvested on the fifth day in 15-ml tubes by centrifuging at 500g for 5 min and then 100× Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to a 1× final concentration.

HisPur Ni-NTA RA resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) (100 µl of bead slurry per 10 ml cell culture medium volume) were washed with ten column volumes (CVs) of water and equilibration buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole) twice each before being added to the cell culture supernatant and incubated at 4 °C on a roller overnight. The cell culture supernatants were then centrifuged at 500g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting resin was resuspended and eluted sequentially with ten CVs of equilibration buffer, ten CVs of 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 with 150 mM NaCl and 50 mM imidazole and ten CVs of 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 with 150 mM NaCl and 200 mM imidazole twice sequentially and centrifugation at 380g, 4 °C for 5 min after each wash to collect the supernatant. All fractions were checked by SDS–PAGE and those containing XT1 were pooled, concentrated to 600 µl by Vivaspin column (30-kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWCO); Cytiva) and buffer-exchanged with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 with 150 mM NaCl and 20% (v/v) glycerol. Protein concentration was measured by NanoDrop One (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as 0.05–0.12 mg ml−1 (yield: 30–72 μg). Protein was aliquoted into 50 µl per aliquot, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.

A bikunin-derived peptide described previously17 was conjugated to 5-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) through an ɛ-aminohexoic acid (ɛ-AHx) linker resulting in 5FAM-ɛ-Ahx-GQEEEGSGGGQGG-CONH2 (5FAM-bik) as described previously7. Glycosylation assays with a total volume of 25 µl were carried out using 100 µM 5FAM-bik peptide, 0.2 µM purified XT1 (WT or mutants) and 200 µM UDP-Xyl, UDP-Glc or UDP-6-azido-6-deoxy-Glc (Biosynth) and incubated in reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0 with 50 mM NaCl) at 37 °C overnight. The reaction mixtures were then boiled at 95 °C for 2 min to stop the glycosylation reaction and were briefly centrifuged. Of each reaction mixture, 5 µl was then run on an Acquity H-Class PLUS qDA ultra-HPLC (UPLC)–MS (Waters) equipped with an Acquity UPLC glycan BEH amide column (130 Å, 1.7 µm, 2.1 × 100 mm). Samples were run at flow rate of 0.35 ml min−1 using buffer A (10 mM ammonium formate at pH 4.5) and buffer B (10 mM ammonium formate in 90:10 acetonitrile and water). The percentage of turnover of 5FAM-bik peptide into the corresponding glycopeptides was calculated by integration of the HPLC ultraviolet trace (260 nm absorption) of the peptide and the glycopeptide and calculated as turnover percentage = peak area of glycopeptide/peak area of (5FAM-bik + glycopeptide).

Enzyme concentration titration was carried out to identify the concentration of WT-XT1 and BH-XT1 required for a turnover of maximum 10–20%. For purified XT1 preparations, a serial dilution from 500 nM to 3.9 nM was used in reaction buffer. Following this, 200 µM UDP-sugar and 100 µM synthetic fluorescent peptide 5FAM-bik were added with a total volume of 25 µl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h, stopped by incubation at 95 °C for 2 min and then briefly centrifuged. Aliquots of 5 µl of the reaction mixtures were checked by HPLC and the turnover rate was calculated to give 16 nM WT-XT1 for incubation with UDP-Xyl, 30 nM XT1-Leu526Gly (BH-XT1) for incubation with UDP-6AzGlc and 100 nM BH-XT1 for incubation with UDP-Xyl as suitable concentrations for Michaelis–Menten kinetics. A serial dilution of UDP-sugar from 400 to 3.125 µM was run in glycosylation reactions in 20 µl of reaction buffer with 100 µM synthetic fluorescent peptide 5FAM-bik and the optimal concentration of WT-XT1 or BH-XT1. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h; reactions were stopped by incubation at 95 °C for 2 min and briefly centrifuged. Aliquots of 5 µl of the reaction mixtures were checked by HPLC; the turnover was calculated and transformed into rate with the formula 1,000 × ((peak area of glycopeptide/peak area of (5FAM-bik + glycopeptide)) × 100 µM)/5,400 s to give the rate v in nM s−1. The kinetics curve was then plotted with Prism 10 (GraphPad) and fitted with a Michaelis–Menten function to calculate kcat, KM and vmax.

BH-XT1 activity toward a collection of substrate peptides was assessed by using a UDP-Glo GT assay kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. The collection of 240 peptides was described previously17 and their sequences are shown in the heat map in Fig. 2. In brief, 25-µl reactions contained 25 nM BH-XT1, 100 µM UDP-6AzGlc and 25 µM peptide in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0 with 50 mM NaCl in 96-well plates. Reactions were shaken at 350 rpm for 30 s on a thermomixer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at room temperature and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h followed by adding 25 µl of freshly prepared UDP-Glo reagent for detection. A series of diluted UDP standards from 0 to 25 µM were included in each set of experiments to plot the standard curve and blank UDP-6AzGlc was run as background subtraction. Luminescence was read using a plate-reader (Tecan) with luminescence readout at 1,000 ns of integration. Luminescence values were background-substracted using the UDP-6AzGlc blank, normalized to the average luminescence of WT bikunin peptide run in parallel, and the resulting percentage turnover relative to WT is presented as a heat map. The Pearson correlation coefficients and P values were calculated using the pearsonr function in the scipy.stats Python library.

CHO cells with a CRISPR KO for either Xylt1 or Xylt2 or parental CHOZN GS−/− (WT CHO cell with glutamine synthetase KO) were cultured in EX-CELL CD CHO fusion medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 2% Glutamax (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as described previously10. Supernatants (15 ml) were collected when cells were at a density of 1 × 106 cells per ml, concentrated with Amicon ultra centrifugal filters (30-kDa MWCO; Merck), aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Cell pellets were treated with the subcellular fractionation kit for cultured cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer's instructions. Membrane fraction protein concentrations were measured using a Pierce BCA protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Glycosylation reactions were run in 25 µl of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0 with 50 mM NaCl with 16 µg of membrane protein, 200 nM WT-XT1 or BH-XT1, 250 µM UDP-6AzGlc and 100, 200 or 300 µM UDP-Xyl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C overnight, treated with 7.5 µl of a click reaction mastermix (final concentrations: 1,200 µM BTTAA, 600 µM CuSO4, 100 µM biotin-alkyne, 5 mM sodium ascorbate and 5 mM aminoguanidinium chloride), incubated at room temperature overnight and quenched by the addition of 3 µl of 50 mM EDTA. Reaction mixtures were then subjected to SDS–PAGE and western blot. The total protein and streptavidin signal was recorded as described above.

Competition glycosylation reactions were run as described above, except that membrane fractions were preincubated with WT-XT1 and UDP-Xyl before the addition of BH-XT1–UDP-6AzGlc in the indicated concentrations and incubating for another 16 h. Reactions were treated as described above.

GAG-free glypican 1 was prepared as reported previously7. For each sample, the 25-µl reaction mixture contained 200 nM WT/BH-XT1, 250 µM UDP-Xyl and/or UDP-6AzGlc and 16 µM glypican 1 in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0 and 50 mM NaCl. Reactions contained WT-XT1 and UDP-Xyl (A and D), WT-XT1, UDP-Xyl and UDP-6Az-Glc (B) or BH-XT1, UDP-Xyl and UDP-6AzGlc (C). Reactions A–D were incubated at 37 °C overnight, after which 200 nM BH-XT1 and 250 µM UDP-6AzGlc were added to reaction D, which was then incubated for an additional 16 h. Following this, 7.5 µl of a click reaction mastermix was added to give a final concentration of 1,200 µM BTTAA (Jena Bioscience), 600 µM CuSO4 (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 µM biotin-alkyne (Biotium), 5 mM sodium ascorbate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 5 mM aminoguanidinium chloride (Cayman Chemical). Click reactions were carried out at room temperature overnight at 350 rpm and later quenched by the addition of 3 µl of 50 mM EDTA. Reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS–PAGE and western blot. Total protein content was measured on an Odyssey CLx (LI-COR Biosciences) using the Revert total protein kit (LI-COR Biosciences) and biotinylation was assessed with IRDye 800CW streptavidin (LI-COR Biosciences). FLAG-tagged decorin was visualized with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Invitrogen, PA1-984b) and a 700CW anti-rabbit antibody (LI-COR Biosciences).

GAG-free decorin in pgsA-745 CHO cells was prepared previously7. For each sample, a 25-µl reaction mixture contained 200 nM WT/BH-XT1, 250 µM UDP-Xyl and/or UDP-6AzGlc and 0.64 µM decorin in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0 and 50 mM NaCl. Reactions contained WT-XT1 and UDP-Xyl (A and D), WT-XT1, UDP-Xyl and UDP-6Az-Glc (B) or BH-XT1, UDP-Xyl and UDP-6AzGlc (C). Reactions A–D were incubated at 37 °C overnight, when 200 nM BH-XT1 and 250 µM UDP-6AzGlc were added to reaction D, which was then incubated for an additional 16 h. Following this, 7.5 µl of a click reaction mastermix was added to give a final concentration of 1,200 µM BTTAA, 600 µM CuSO4, 100 µM biotin-alkyne, 5 mM sodium ascorbate and 5 mM aminoguanidinium chloride. Click reactions were carried out at room temperature overnight at 350 rpm and later quenched by the addition of 3 µl of 50 mM EDTA. Reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS–PAGE and western blot. Total protein content was measured on an Odyssey CLx (LI-COR Biosciences) using the Revert total protein kit (LI-COR Biosciences) and biotinylation was assessed with IRDye 800CW Streptavidin (LI-COR Biosciences). FLAG-tagged decorin was visualized with rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG and a 700CW anti-rabbit antibody (LI-COR Biosciences).

GAG-free decorin protein (10 µg) was incubated with 250 µM UDP-6AzGlc and 200 nM BH-XT1 in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0 with 50 mM NaCl in a 30-µl total reaction volume at 37 °C overnight. The glycosylation reaction was treated with 7.5 µl of a click reagent mastermix containing 1-(3-butyn-1-yl)-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate described before45 and termed ITag-alkyne (final concentrations: 1,200 µM BTTAA, 600 µM CuSO4, 100 µM Itag-alkyne, 5 mM sodium ascorbate and 5 mM aminoguanidinium chloride). The reaction was incubated by shaking at 350 rpm on a thermomixer at room temperature overnight. The clicked decorin sample was digested by trypsin in solution with S-trap (Protifi) following the manufacturer's instructions.

Samples were analyzed by online nanoflow LC–tandem MS using an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid MS instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For each analysis, 14 µl was injected onto a trap column (Acclaim PepMap 100, 75 µm × 2 cm, NanoViper) with loading buffer (2% acetonitrile and 0.05% TFA) at 7 μl min−1 for 6 min (40 °C). Glycopeptides were then separated on an analytical column (PepMap RSLC C18, 75 µm × 50 cm, 2-µm particle size, 100-Å pore size, reversed-phase EASY) using a gradient of 2–40% solvent B (5% DMSO, 0.1% formic acid, 75% acetonitrile and 20% water) over 140 min at 275 nl min−1.

Full-scan MS1 spectra acquired in the Orbitrap were collected at a resolution of 120,000 at full width at half-maximum and a mass range from 300 to 1,500 m/z.

Dynamic exclusion was enabled with a repeat count of three, repeat duration of 10 s and exclusion duration of 10 s. Only charge states 2–6 were selected for fragmentation. MS2 scans were generated at top speed for 3 s. HCD was performed on all selected precursor masses with the following parameters: isolation window of 2 m/z, 28% normalized collision energy, orbitrap detection (resolution of 30,000), maximum inject time of 54 ms and a standard automatic gain control target. An additional ETD fragmentation of the same precursor was triggered if (1) the precursor mass was between 300 and 1,500 m/z and (2) the fingerprint ion generated by the specific tag (322.1507 for ITag-Alkyne) was present at ±0.1 m/z and greater than 10% relative intensity.

Raw files were searched using Byonic (Protein Metrics, version 4.6.1). For glycopeptide analysis, search parameters included semispecific cleavage specificity at the C-terminal sites of Arg and Lys, with two missed cleavages allowed. Mass tolerance was set at 10 ppm for MS1s, 20 ppm for HCD MS2s and 0.2 Da for ETD MS2s. Carbamidomethyl cysteine was set as a fixed modification. Variable modifications included methionine oxidation and asparagine deamidation. O-glycan modification was set to N-acetyl-hexosamine with an additional 118.0643 m/z to account for the chemical modification. A maximum of two variable modifications were allowed per peptide. For each sample, variable modifications were searched against a focused FASTA file that exclusively contains protein sequences find in that sample. Identifications that contained chemically modified glycans on the peptide of interest were manually validated and localized using a combination of HCD and ETD information.

This protocol was adapted from previously published procedures35,43,48. K-562 cells (American Type Culture Collection, CCL-243) were cultured in RPMI (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10% (v/v) FBS, penicillin (100 U per ml) and streptomycin (100 µg ml−1). Approximately 5–10 million cells (comparable numbers between treatment conditions) were fed with DMSO or 250 µM caged sugar-1-phosphates 1 or 2. After 16 h of incubation, K-562 cells were harvested by centrifugation (500g, 5 min, 4 °C). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS twice and zirconia and silica beads (0.1 mm; Biospec) were added to packed cell pellets with a 1:1 ratio. Then, 1 ml of 1:1 acetonitrile and water was added to lyse the cells with a bead beater at 6 m s−1 for 30 s and the cell lysates were cooled at 4 °C for 10 min. They were then centrifuged at 14,000g for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was transferred to a protein low-bind Eppendorf. Supernatants were dried down with a SpeedVac and the residue was dissolved in 0.3 ml of Milli-Q water. The supernatant was passed through a centrifuge filter (30 min, 14,000g) using an Amicon ultra centrifugal filter (3-kDa MWCO). The flowthrough was dried by SpeedVac and the residue resuspended in 50 µl of MQ water. High-performance ion-exchange chromatography was used to analyze lysates, using a Waters Arc Premier HPLC with photodiode array detector equipped with a Dionex CarboPac PA1 column (2 mm × 150 mm) and matching PA1 guard column at a flow rate of 0.25 ml min−1. The gradient with buffers A (1 M sodium acetate and 1 mM NaOH), B (1 mM NaOH) and C (1 M NaOH) was as follows: 0 min, 5% A, 95% B; 20 min 40% A, 60% B; 60 min, 40% A, 60% B; 63 min, 50% A, 50% B; 87 min, 80% A, 20% B; 95 min, 80% A, 20% B; 96 min, 5% A, 95% B; 101 min, 5% A, 95% B.

A full-length XT1 plasmid in pDonor221 vector was purchased from DNASU (HsCD00744626). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a Q5 HIFI mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's instructions using the two mutagenesis primers CTACACCCTCGGCCCCGCTGAGTC and GAGTAGAACTGTTTCATCTTG. Full-length WT/BH-XT1 DNA was then prepared using the two primers ATGGTGGCGGCGCCAT and CCGTAGCCGGCCATCAG. To add a VSV-G tag, a third PCR was performed using the primers ACCCCAAGCTGGCCTCTGAGGCCATGGTGGCGGCGCCATGCGCCCG and CCCCAAGCTTGGCCTGACAGGCCCTACTTACCCAGGCGGTTCATTTCGATATCAGTGTACCGTAGCCGGCCATCAG. pSBbi-GH was a gift from E. Kowarz (Addgene, plasmid 60514; RRID:Addgene_60514)58. The plasmid was linearized using restriction enzyme SfiI (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer's instructions and purified from agarose gel. Full-length WT-XT1 and BH-XT1 were then inserted into pSBbi-GH using the infusion cloning kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Genes of interest were sequenced by Sanger sequencing and the full plasmids were sequenced by nanopore sequencing before use.

RNA-guided DNA endonuclease was performed to edit genes through coexpression of the Cas9 protein and guide RNAs (gRNAs). The targeting sequences for XT1 and XT2 were at exon 3 of XYLT1 (5′-ACAACAGCAACTTCGCACCC-3′) and exon2 of XT2 (5′-GACAGTTCAGCAGGGCGACG-3′), respectively. The target sequences were cloned into the gRNA cloning vector using the restriction enzyme BsmBI (New England Biolabs, R3539). KO cells were all obtained through clonal propagation from a single cell. For genotyping, the following PCR primers were used: 5′-CGGGACGCTGGAACAAAATG-3′ and 5′-GGGGTTGGAACTTACCCTCG-3′ for XT1 alleles; 5′-GGTGGTACTGATTGTGCGGA-3′ and 5′-CAGGGAGGTAGGATCCCCTT-3′ for XT2 alleles. PCR products were sequenced.

The plasmid pCMV(CAT)T7-SB100 was a gift from Z. Izsvak (Addgene, plasmid 34879; RRID:Addgene_34879)70. PgsA-745 CHO cells were cultured in growth medium to 0.5 × 106 cells per ml for 24–48 h before transfection. Next, 2.5 µg of pSBbi plasmid containing full-length WT-XT1 or BH-XT1 was transfected together with 125 ng of pCMV(CAT)T7-SB100 plasmid per well of a six-well plate using Lipofectamine LTX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, cell culture medium was aspirated and cells were treated with fresh growth medium containing 200 µg ml−1 hygromycin B. Cells were cultured under these conditions for 2 weeks to obtain stable cells. Following selection, cells were propagated with 150 µg ml−1 hygromycin B in growth medium.

Stably transfected pgsA-745 CHO cells with full-length WT-XT1 or BH-XT1 were plated in six-well plates at a density of 0.4 × 106 cells per ml in growth medium without hygromycin B and then treated with the indicated concentration of caged sugar-1-phosphates 1 or 2, Ac4ManNAz (Jena Bioscience) or DMSO. Cells were grown for 16 h. The cell culture medium was aspirated and cells were washed with cold PBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+. The cells were then detached with 1 ml of ice-cold 8 mM EDTA for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were transferred to a 1.5-ml cup and harvested by centrifugation at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C.

Cells were then resuspended in 200 µl of cell buffer (2% FBS in PBS), transferred to a V-shaped 96-well plate (Thermo Fisher) and harvested by centrifugation at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended in 35 µl of cell buffer and treated with 35 µl of click solution mastermix (200 µM CuSO4, 1200 µM BTTAA, 10 mM sodium ascorbate, 10 mM aminoguanidinium chloride and 50 mM CF680-alkyne in cell buffer). Cells were briefly mixed and incubated for 7 min at room temperature on an orbital shaker. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 35 µl of 3 mM bathocuproinedisulfonic acid in PBS. Cells were then harvested, washed twice with 200 µl of cell buffer and once with PBS and then resuspended in 100 µl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 with 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1× Halt protease inhibitor and 100 mU per µl of benzonase (Merck)). Cells were lysed for 20 min at 4 °C on an orbital shaker and centrifuged at 1,500g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were then transferred to 1.5-ml protein LoBind tubes (Eppendorf). The protein concentration was measured using Pierce BCA protein assay kits before in-gel fluorescence. Samples were then analyzed after SDS–PAGE by in-gel fluorescence on an Odyssey CLx (LI-COR Bosciences). Total protein content was then assessed by Coomassie staining on the same gel using SafeBLUE protein stain (NBS Biologicals). Another gel was prepared and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for western blot, using antibodies to rabbit VSV-G tag (Abcam, ab50549) and GAPDH (Abcam, ab181602) and secondary antibodies IRDye 800CW donkey anti-mouse (LI-COR) and IRDye 680RD donkey anti-rabbit IgG (LI-COR). The image background was adjusted by LI-COR software.

Xyl-containing or 6AzGlc-containing glycopeptides were generated enzymatically in a 100-µl reaction with 100 µM 5FAM-bik peptide, 200 nM WT-XT1 and 200 µM UDP-Xyl or 200 nM BH-XT1 and 200 µM UDP-6AzGlc, respectively. When full conversion was reached, glycopeptides were desalted with a Strata-X (60 mg ml−1) Phenomenex solid-phase extraction column following the manufacturer's instructions and dried with a Genevac miVac centrifugal concentrator (Fisher Scientific) before downstream one-pot enzyme reactions. These were carried out in 50 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.5, 25 mM MnCl2 and 50 mM NaCl in a total reaction volume of 20–30 μl as reported previously7. Soluble enzymes for extension (B4GALT7, MBP–B3GALT6 and B3GAT3) were prepared previously7. These enzymes were added at 0.025 μg ml−1 in different combinations to glycopeptides at 500 μM and the UDP-sugars UDP-Gal and UDP-GlcA were added as needed at a twofold molar excess to the acceptor. The reaction mixture was left at 30 °C overnight and the reaction progress was monitored by HPLC as reported previously7.

An expression construct of human decorin containing a C-terminal FLAG tag was prepared previously7. Cultured pgsA-745 cells stably transfected with full-length BH-XT1 were plated at 1 × 106 cells per ml in 5 ml of growth medium in a T25 flask and grown to 100% confluency. The cells were then detached using 0.05% (v/v) Trypsin-EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and resuspended in 5 ml of fresh medium. While the cells were still in suspension, 5 µg of plasmid DNA and 15 µg of polyethylenimine MAX (40 kDa; Polysciences) were diluted separately in 250 µl of OptiMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Both solutions were mixed and incubated at room temperature for another 20 min before added to the cell culture dropwise. The cells were incubated overnight to attach and 50 µM caged sugar-1-phosphate 1 was added. On the fourth day after transfection, the culture supernatant was collected. A 100-µl slurry of Pierce anti-DYKDDDDK affinity resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was washed with 30 CVs of FLAG buffer (25 mM HEPES with 150 mM NaCl) and added to the cell culture medium. The suspension was incubated at 4 °C overnight and then centrifuged at 4 °C at 1,000g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and the beads were incubated with FLAG buffer containing 100 µg ml−1 FLAG peptide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at room temperature. An Amicon ultra centrifugal filter (3-kDa MWCO) was used to concentrate the protein to 300 µl and remove the FLAG peptide. The protein concentration was measured by BCA and the final yield of the protein estimated as 120 µg.

An aliquot of 20 µg of purified decorin in 60 µl of FLAG buffer was treated with 30 µl of CuAAC mastermix (final concentrations: 1,200 µM BTTAA, 600 µM CuSO4, 100 µM Itag-alkyne, 5 mM sodium ascorbate and 5 mM aminoguanidinium chloride) overnight at room temperature.

The clicked decorin sample was digested by trypsin in solution with S-trap (Protifi) following the manufacturer's instructions. MS data acquisition and analysis were performed as described above.

A full-length XT2-pJF7_nHalo vector was purchased from DNASU (accession number HsCD00866744). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by overlap extension as described above using the mutagenesis primers AGAAGGACTCGGCTGGGCCCAGTGTGTATGTGTAG and CTACACATACACACTGGGCCCAGCCGAGTCCTTCT, as well as ATGGTGGCGAGCGCGCGAG and CAACCTGAGTCGCCCGTCTG. PCR reaction conditions were as stated above. Following assembly of the full-length XT2 gene, another PCR was performed using the primers AACTACCCCAAGCTGGCCTCTGAGGCCATGGTGGCGAGCGCGCGAG and CCCCAAGCTTGGCCTGACAGGCCCTACTTACCCAGGCGGTTCATTTCGATATCAGTGTACAACCTGAGTCGCCCGTC. The PCR product was inserted into pSBi-GH by infusion cloning. Genes of interest were sequenced by Sanger sequencing and the full plasmids were sequenced by nanopore sequencing before use. Cell-surface labeling and in-gel fluorescence were performed as described above.

Stably transfected pgsA-745 CHO cells with full-length WT-XT1 or BH-XT1 were seeded in T-75 flasks at a density of 1 × 106 cells per ml in growth medium. After 6 h of incubation, cells were fed with either 50 µM or 250 µM caged sugar-1-phosphate 1 or DMSO. The cell culture medium used for feeding was BalanCD CHO growth A medium (Fujifilm Irvine Scientific). Cells were grown for 16 h. The cell culture medium (secretome) was harvested and centrifuged (350g, 5 min) to pellet debris. The secretome samples were concentrated using Amicon ultra centrifugal filters (3-kDa MWCO). The buffer was exchanged with PBS twice. The Pierce BCA protein assay kit was used to measure the protein concentration of secretome samples.

Secretome samples (0.50 mg each) were normalized up to 250 µl with PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 300 µl of Neutravidin bead slurry (Sera-Mag SpeedBeads neutravidin-coated magnetic beads, Cytiva), previously washed twice with PBS (200 µl each), to remove endogenous biotinylated proteins. The supernatant was collected and then incubated with PNGase F overnight at 37 °C to remove N-glycans. The reaction was then quenched by heating to 95 °C for 10 s with subsequent cooling at 4 °C. The samples were then treated with a 10× click solution mastermix (6 mM CuSO4, 12 mM BTTAA, 1 mM biotin-DADPS-alkyne (Vector Laboratories), 50 mM sodium ascorbate and 50 mM aminoguanidinium chloride) to a 1× final concentration. The click reaction was incubated overnight at room temperature under shaking (400 rpm). The reaction was passed through Amicon ultra centrifugal filters (3-kDa MWCO) to exchange the buffer with PBS.

The samples were then incubated with 350 µl of dimethylated Neutravidin bead slurry (previously washed twice with 200 µl of PBS) for 1 h at room temperature41. Supernatant was discarded and beads were washed with 1% (w/v) SDS (three times, 350 µl each), 6 M urea in PBS (three times, 350 µl each), 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (AmBic; three times, 350 µl each) and 40% (v/v) LC–MS-grade acetonitrile (four times, 100 µl each). Beads were resuspended in 100 µl of AmBic containing 10 mM DTT and then incubated at 50 °C for 15 min. Beads were washed with AmBic (two times, 350 µl each) and 100 µl of 20 mM iodoacetamide in AmBic was then added. Samples were kept for 30 min in the dark. Iodoacetamide was then quenched by adding DTT 10 mM (final concentration). The beads were washed with AmBic (three times, 350 µl each) and then resuspended in 100 µl of AmBic. Next, 300 ng of Lys-C (MS grade; Promega) was added to beads, followed by overnight incubation at 37 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and 200 ng of trypsin gold (MS grade; Promega) were added. The digestion was left for 8 h at 37 °C. Peptides were desalted by UltraMicroSpin (The Nest group) according to the manufacturer's protocol and vacuum-dried by SpeedVac.

Dried peptides were resuspended in 16 µl of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in LC–MS-grade water, sonicated for 15 min in a water bath, vortexed briefly and harvested for 5 min at 18,000g. The peptides were then loaded on Evotips (Evosep) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The data were acquired on TIMS TOF Pro2 (Bruker) coupled to an Evosep One LC system. For the LC separation, a standard 60SPD 2.3 method was used, separation was performed using an EV-1109 column and the column was heated to 40 °C during analyses. TIMS TOF Pro2 was operated in data-independent acquisition parallel accumulation–serial fragmentation mode, scan width was set to 100–1,700 m/z with ion mobility (1/K0) of 0.6–1.6 and ramp and accumulation time were locked at 100 ms.

Raw MS files were loaded into DIA-NN 1.8.1 for quantification and identification by using the C. griseus FASTA protein sequences database from UniProt for database search. Among the DIA-NN output files, both protein groups and peptide groups were uploaded into Perseus (version 2.0.11)62 to allow for data transformation and visualization and then into GraphPad for statistical analysis. Briefly, to visualize the results on Perseus, the proteingrougs.txt file or peptidegroups.txt file was uploaded, followed by transformation of all the values to log2(x). Then, the data were imputed to replace missing values from normal distribution. Data from three independent replicate experiments of each sample in a row were categorically annotated with the same name. Once annotated, a two-sample Welsh's t-test was performed to statistically analyze the data. Welch's t-test was performed between samples from BH-XT1-expressing versus WT-XT1-expressing cells and BH-XT2-expressing versus WT-XT2-expressing cells to generate P values. Multiple-hypothesis testing was corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure to calculate false discovery rates (FDRs). Protein hits were filtered using an FDR value ≤ 0.05. The scatter plot function was used to visualize the volcano plots.

A previously published procedure was modified to produce alkyne-modified heparin16,71. Briefly, 20 mg of heparin (Iduron, HEP001) was dissolved in 94 µl of 100 mM sodium acetate and 100 mM aniline buffer (pH 5.5) and prewarmed to 55 °C. Warmed heparin was mixed with 6 µl of alkyne hydrazide (BroadPharm BP-28990, 1.68 mg in DMSO, 80 equivalents), and DMSO was added to bring the ratio of aqueous buffer to DMSO to 1:1. The mixture was protected from light, incubated at 55 °C for 72 h before dilution into 10 ml of PBS, filtered at 0.45 µm and dialyzed into Milli-Q H2O (48 h, buffer changed three times). The sample was then lyophilized. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance verified the conjugation of alkyne hydrazide to heparin.

The human SDC1 ectodomains were cloned into pET28a expression vectors for production in BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli. SDC137 refers to a variant ectodomain wherein the canonical GAG attachment site S37 is replaced by the unnatural amino acid p-propargyltyrosine (pPY) with an alkyne handle for click chemistry. This variant was produced as previously described16, wherein the expression plasmid was cotransformed into BL21 with pULTRA-CNF, which permits the incorporation of unnatural amino acids. pPY (400 mg L−1) was added to the bacterial culture during induction. Protein was purified using HisPur cobalt resin (Thermo Fisher). SDC137 was treated with azide-containing heparin as previously described16.

Recombinant SDC1 and SDC137 were in vitro glycosylated with 6AzGlc using the procedure established for decorin described above. In brief, two 78.5-µl reaction mixtures containing 15 µM SDC1 or SDC137, 200 nM BH-XT1, 250 µM UDP-Xyl and UDP-6AzGlc in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0 with 50 mM NaCl were incubated at 37 °C overnight. The enzymes were then deactivated by incubation of the reaction mixtures at 95 °C for 2 min. The glycosylation reaction mixtures were then buffer-exchanged with the reaction buffer using Amicon ultra centrifugal filters (3-kDa MWCO) to remove excess UDP-sugars. The supernatants containing glycosylated SDC1 and SDC137 were then collected and dried under SpeedVac before proceeding to the next step to be clicked with the alkyne-heparin.

6AzGlc-modified hSDC1 (100 µM) and alkyne-heparin (20 molar equivalents) were dissolved in PBS with aminoguanidinium chloride (5 mM) in protein LoBind Eppendorf tubes. Click reagents (320 µM CuSO4, 1,600 µM Tris(3-hydroxypropyltriazolylmethyl)amine and 21 mM sodium ascorbate) were added and the reactions were incubated at 37 °C. Reactions were monitored using an Ultimate 3000 ultra-HPLC system and WAX-10 (4 × 250 mm) column at 1.0 ml min−1 in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5) buffer. After reaction completion (~16 h), 5 µl of HisPur cobalt resin beads (Thermo Fisher, 89966) and an equal volume of wash buffer (10 mM imidazole and PBS, 40 µL) were added to each reaction. This mixture was incubated on a VortexGenie with the multiple-sample attachment for 1 h at room temperature. The supernatant was removed and beads were washed twice with wash buffer (5 min, orbital shaker), before incubation with elution buffer (150 mM imidazole and PBS, 5 min, orbital shaker). Eluate was concentrated using an Amicon ultra centrifugal filter (3-kDa MWCO) and buffer-exchanged into PBS. The concentration of glycoconjugate products was measured on a NanoDrop One using absorbance at 205 nm.

MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 200 nM pooled SDC1 TriFECTA Dicer substrate RNAs (hs.Ri.SDC1.13) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX. Then, 24 h after transfection, 24-well plates were coated with 1× poly(D-lysine) (15 min, room temperature) before incubation with 10 µg ml−1 vitronectin (4 °C, overnight, rocking). The following day, the plate was washed twice with PBS and blocked in 2% BSA in DMEM (1 h, 37 °C). Cells were harvested with nonenzymatic dissociation buffer and remodeled in 96-well round-bottom plates with 10 µM cholPEGNTA (1 h, 37 °C) followed by SDC constructs (2 µM, 1 h, 37 °C). Cells were resuspended in DMEM + 10% FBS and allowed to adhere to vitronectin-coated plates (overnight, 37 °C). Cells were then fixed with 4% PFA in PBS and stained with rhodamine phalloidin (2 U per ml, 1 h, room temperature, rocking), followed by Hoechst staining. Cells were imaged on an EVOS M500 fluorescence microscope. The extent of cell spreading and cell number were counted by ImageJ macros using previously published methods16.

Microscopy images were analyzed using ImageJ software. Individual channel microscopy images were converted to 8-bit grayscale and segmented with the threshold function, with holes filled. The ‘analyze particles' function was then used (size: 150–∞) to quantify cell spreading. This operation was performed on both Hoechst and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin images to quantify the number of cells and extent of spreading, respectively. The extent of spreading was quantified by dividing the total rhodamine-positive area by the number of Hoechst-stained nuclei. Normalization was performed relative to the least spread cells and WT cells. Negative values were treated as 0. Measurements were taken from >6 images of selected areas of cells, which were chosen at random across three biological replicates. Image fields that showed significant autofluorescence from the plate perimeter were not used. Statistical analyses and graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism 10. Normalization was conducted as follows:

Food consumption generates substantial environmental externalities that remain insufficiently addressed by public policies. Here we explore the global environmental footprints induced by food consumption in the European Union (EU27) based on a multi-regional input–output model, and assess the potential of tax policies for mitigation. Using household expenditure data, we estimate country-specific demand systems for food products and link these to the footprints for the policy analysis. We find that removing current VAT reductions on meat products has the potential to decrease food consumption-related greenhouse-gas emissions, water consumption, land use, biodiversity loss, and the nitrogen and phosphorus footprints of EU27 household food consumption by 3.5%–5.7%. A greenhouse-gas emission price of ~€52 per tCO2e on all food products leads to equivalent emission reductions with higher associated environmental co-benefits. The mean net welfare costs of the two policies amount to €12–26 per year per household.

The global food system generates large externalities that impose pressure on the environment1,2 and contribute to the risk of transgressing a number of planetary boundaries3,4. Given the current trends in dietary patterns, these pressures and consequent damages are projected to increase substantially in the next few decades5,6,7. Food consumption in the member states of the European Union (EU27) is a major contributor to the global food system's externalities8,9,10, which are generated both within and outside the EU through global supply chains11,12,13. There is thus an urgent need to mitigate the environmental pressures induced by the dietary choices of EU27 households, with shifts towards more plant-based diets highlighted as being crucial3,14. Consumption taxes have emerged as a particularly effective policy intervention to promote the changes in food consumption patterns necessary for the food system to remain within planetary boundaries15,16,17,18,19.

Previous research investigating the effectiveness of externality-correcting policy instruments in the food sector has mainly analysed carbon taxes to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of food consumption19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27. Some studies have examined the distributional effects of externality pricing, particularly for carbon and nitrogen28,29, but the effectiveness as well as costs and benefits of policies addressing climate and non-climate environmental externalities such as biodiversity loss, water consumption and nutrient emissions have generally not received adequate attention30. Furthermore, existing studies often lack a comprehensive consideration of complementing and substitution patterns when assessing consumers' reactions to policy interventions, and often neglect to contrast the benefits with the costs of policy instruments.

This study analyses the environmental footprints of EU27 households' food consumption, evaluates the potential of consumption tax policies for mitigation, and assesses the consumption-related welfare costs incurred by households. The analysed environmental impacts are directly associated with the food system and quantified to be at increasing or high risk of transgressing planetary boundaries4. To simulate the effect of demand-side policies on households' food consumption patterns and the resulting footprint reductions, we estimate country-specific price elasticities. To mitigate the environmental pressures from EU27 households' food consumption, we analyse two specific policy options, which differ in precision in the pricing of external effects, flexibility, administrative costs and the associated time frame for implementation, but yield equal GHG emission reductions.

We first analyse the removal of existing value-added tax (VAT) reductions for meat products, in a similar manner to previous studies28,31,32. Currently, 22 out of 27 EU member countries apply reduced VAT rates on meat products, despite their adverse environmental impact. We anticipate that a VAT reform faces relatively low administrative barriers given that it aligns with the EU's declared sustainability objectives33 and reflects a minor reform within a well-established system. Second, we analyse a GHG emission price on all food products. This approach aligns with the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change's recommendation to introduce emissions pricing in the agricultural sector by 203134 and is under consideration by the EU Commission35. An externality-specific pricing is favourable from an economic perspective as it induces a more comprehensive adjustment in production and consumption decisions by directly targeting environmental impacts. However, it involves substantial implementation challenges, including measurement and monitoring of emissions along supply chains, and thus requires considerable time and administrative capacity to be implemented.

The two policies represent distinct approaches to addressing environmental externalities from food consumption. The VAT reform exemplifies a pragmatic short-term solution that leverages existing tax infrastructure but offers limited flexibility. In contrast, the GHG emission price demonstrates how precise externality pricing could work in practice, although it will require more sophisticated implementation mechanisms. By examining both options, we provide insights into the trade-offs between administrative feasibility and economic efficiency in environmental policy design. Our analysis demonstrates how diverse policy instruments can be consistently compared across different cost and benefit dimensions by normalizing with respect to one selected environmental impact (that is, GHG emission reductions). This approach allows quantification of the synergies and trade-offs between environmental impacts while accounting for consumer costs and tax revenues. Finally, we contrast the policy-induced welfare costs with the additional tax revenue generated by the policies.

We compute the currently observed profile of environmental footprints induced by household food consumption in the EU27 based on the multi-regional input−output model EXIOBASE (base year 2019)36,37. Countries' environmental food consumption footprints are defined as the aggregate global environmental impacts induced by the respective country's final household food consumption per year. These impacts encompass the total amount of a stressor released (for example, GHG emissions) or the amount of resources used (for example, land) in the production of food within a geographical unit per year. We exclude final demand categories other than final consumption expenditures by households.

Environmental satellite accounts provided in EXIOBASE allow us to relate environmental impacts along the entire global supply chain to final household demand. Specifically, the impacts we analyse are GHG emissions (in CO2 equivalents (CO2e), excluding emissions from land use and land-use change), blue water consumption (that is, consumptive use of ground and surface water flows), nitrogen and phosphorus emissions and 20 land-use stressors (Supplementary Table 3). To quantify biodiversity loss impacts, each land-use stressor is translated into spatially explicit biodiversity loss in terms of the global potentially disappeared fraction (PDF) of species using region-specific characterization factors9,38.

Figure 1 displays the EU27 households' global environmental footprints in 2019, categorized into food and non-food consumption, and differentiated into ten food categories. Food consumption accounts for less than a quarter of the total EU27 households' GHG emission footprint, more than half of the land use, biodiversity loss and phosphorus emission footprints, and more than two-thirds of water consumption and nitrogen emission footprints. In comparison with the global food system's planetary boundaries3, EU27 households require 2.2% (water consumption) to 16.9% (land use) of the global amount that can be safely used for food production (see the secondary y axes in Fig. 1), compared to the EU27's ~5.5% share of the global population.

Breakdown of footprints, distinguishing between food and non-food (left bar), and ten food categories (right bar). The left y axes display the absolute footprints in the respective environmental impact measurement unit. The right y axes display the share of global food-related planetary boundaries (as quantified by ref. 3) attributed to EU27 households' food consumption. For biodiversity loss, no share can be defined due to the different metrics employed. NEC denotes not elsewhere classified food items.

Source data

To investigate the impact of dietary composition, aggregate food consumption is partitioned into ten distinct categories (Supplementary Table 2). The contributions of the different food categories differ substantially by environmental indicator, with meat, other animal products and not elsewhere classified (NEC) food products predominantly influencing all footprints, except for water consumption. Plant-based food categories (‘bread and cereals', ‘fruits and vegetables' and ‘veg. oils and fats') account for 17.8% of GHG emissions, 29.5% of land use, 32.9% of biodiversity loss, and 36% of nitrogen and 18.8% of phosphorus emissions induced by food consumption in the EU. The water footprint is notably higher for plant-based food categories, which account for almost two-thirds of the EU27's global total water footprint from food consumption.

There is substantial variation in environmental footprints among EU countries, as well as the geographic distribution of environmental impacts. The largest food consumption footprints are caused by the most populous countries (Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Poland; Fig. 2, left panels). Per capita environmental footprints by country are presented in Extended Data Table 1. Heterogeneity in the footprints among countries arises not only from variations in dietary composition, but also from environmental impact intensities in the geographic origins of food. Although between 45% and 73% of environmental impacts associated with EU27 food consumption occur within the EU27, a substantial share of impacts are imported from non-EU27 countries (Fig. 2, right panels). This is particularly severe for water consumption (55% imported), for which large shares are imported from countries in Asia (21%) and the Middle East (15%). Biodiversity loss and land use involve the importation of 45% of environmental impacts, with a substantial share originating from countries in Middle and South America and Africa. The majority of phosphorus emissions are caused within EU boundaries (59%), but considerable proportions are also imported from Middle and South America (17%) and Asia (10%). More than two-thirds of GHG emissions and nitrogen emissions originate from countries within the EU, with the largest share of non-EU impacts imported from countries in Asia.

Source data

We first simulate the removal of VAT reductions on meat products for all countries. This implies that country-specific standard rates instead of reduced VAT rates are applied to the food products falling within the categories Beef, Pork, Poultry and Other meat/animal products. We analyse the effect of such a policy on EU27 households' GHG emissions, land use, biodiversity loss, water consumption, nitrogen and phosphorus footprints.

We next analyse the effects of a CO2e-weighted GHG emission price, applied to all food products according to the country-specific mean GHG emission demand intensity of each food category. The CO2e-weighted GHG -emission price is set to the level that yields equivalent total GHG emission reductions as the VAT reform. In doing so, the two policies can be compared in terms of their global effects on non-climate environmental impacts and their associated costs to consumers. The resulting endogenously computed GHG emission price leading to equivalent GHG emission reductions as the VAT reform is determined at a level of €51.63 (49.02–53.76) per tCO2e.

As a robustness check, we present the respective GHG emission prices under varying demand system estimation specifications in Supplementary Fig. 3, and the associated footprint reductions in Supplementary Fig. 4.

In response to price changes of specific food categories, households may adjust their overall food consumption patterns considering complementary and substitute relationships between food items. These patterns are reflected by own- and cross-price elasticities of demand, which may differ substantially across countries due to varying preferences and income levels39. Because comprehensive and representative estimates for all EU27 countries are not available in the literature, we estimate censored linear-approximated Exact Affine Stone Index (EASI) demand systems40 based on high-quality representative national household surveys including the Eurostat Household Budget Survey 2015 and 2010, the Konsumerhebung 14/15 (provided by Statistics Austria) and Einkommens- und Verbrauchsstichprobe (EVS) 2018 (provided by the German Federal Statistical Office). In accordance with the classification introduced for the footprint analysis, the surveyed food item expenditures are aggregated into ten food categories (Supplementary Table 2). Extended Data Fig. 1 presents the distribution, across all EU27 countries, of the weighted means of household-specific uncompensated own- and cross-price elasticities.

Figure 3 presents the policy-induced price changes in both policy simulation scenarios and corresponding changes in the demanded quantities. We assume a complete pass-through of the price increase to consumers. The left panels present the policy-induced price changes and accompanying demand changes of a VAT reform (that is, the removal of reduced VAT rates for meat products). For those five countries that do not apply a reduced VAT rate on meat products, the VAT reform does not lead to a change in prices. Removing VAT reductions across the EU27 implies an average price increase for meat products of 10.6%, which reduces demand for the respective meat food groups by 8.0%–11.3%, on average, across all EU27 countries. Although non-meat products are not affected by price increases in this scenario, complementary and substitute relationships between food categories lead to heterogeneous demand effects across countries. In some countries, households substitute meat with fish and seafood, fruits and vegetables or vegetable oils and fats. However, complementary relationships and income effects, that is, a decrease in purchasing power resulting from price increases in meat products, lead to reduced consumption of non-meat food categories in several countries.

Simulated relative changes in prices and resulting demanded quantity changes by food category and country in response to removing VAT reductions for meat products (VAT reform) and implementing a uniform GHG emission price of €51.63 per tCO2e on all food products. NEC denotes not elsewhere classified food items.

Source data

The right panels in Fig. 3 present the policy-induced price changes and accompanying demand changes of an EU-wide uniform GHG emission price on all food products, endogenously determined at a price level of €51.63 per tCO2e. Although the GHG emission price is uniform, it translates into varying relative price increases across countries and food categories, ranging from 1.0% to 14.8%, contingent on the GHG emission intensities. The GHG emission-intensive food category ‘beef' is especially affected by large price increases of 9.1%, on average. A GHG emission price imposed on all food categories reduces overall food demand with few exceptions in some countries and categories. In particular, demand for beef decreases by 10.2%, on average, across the EU27, whereas demand reductions for the remaining meat products with lower GHG emission intensities are considerably smaller. In two countries, substitution effects induce an increase in demand for ‘pork' and ‘fish and seafood', respectively. Given that in this scenario the GHG emission price is also imposed on non-meat foods, demand also decreases for these products, leading to an overall reduction in food demand in terms of quantities.

The changes in consumption patterns induced by the VAT reform translate into global impact reductions of 4.96% (29.9 MtCO2e) in terms of GHG emissions, 5.73% (0.058 Mt (megatons)) in terms of phosphorus, 4.41% (0.161 Mt) in terms of nitrogen, 3.48% (1,871 Mm3 (cubic megametres)) in terms of water consumption, 4.76% (10.5 Mha (megahectares)) in terms of land used and 4.93% in terms of biodiversity loss (0.0063 global PDF) (Fig. 4).

Reductions in environmental footprints of EU27 households by food category resulting from removing VAT reductions for meat products (VAT reform) and implementing a GHG emission price of €51.63 per tCO2e on all food products. The left y axes display the absolute footprint reductions in the respective environmental impact measurement unit. Relative reductions in comparison to current environmental footprints (Fig. 1) are displayed on the right y axes. Uncertainty bars represent the range between the minimum and maximum values of the b = 100 computed footprint reductions based on the b = 100 bootstrapped elasticity estimates.

Source data

A GHG emission price of €51.63 per tCO2e achieves equivalent total reductions in GHG emission footprints as the VAT reform. However, the GHG emission price policy yields additional global co-benefits in the form of the following reductions: 16,805 t of nitrogen, 891 t of phosphorus, 486 Mm3 of water consumption and 0.687 Mha of land use. Only for biodiversity loss are the associated co-benefits of the VAT reform marginally higher (0.0001 global PDF) than those achieved under the GHG emission price policy.

The different food categories' contributions to the aggregate EU27 footprint reductions varies. The difference between the footprint reductions induced by the VAT reform, which affects only meat prices, and the GHG emission price, which affects prices of all food categories depending on their GHG emission intensity, is evident in the resulting division of footprint reductions between meat and non-meat categories. For the VAT reform, more than half of all footprint reductions (except for water consumption) are due to reductions in meat consumption. In line with demand changes, footprint reductions induced by GHG emission pricing are distributed more equally across all food categories.

To analyse the consumption-based welfare effects of the two policies, we use the cost-of-living index based on ref. 40, representing the increase in expenditures that would be required for a household to sustain the same standard of living with regard to food consumption. The selected welfare metric only captures changes in food-related consumption expenditures and does not account for other welfare-related dimensions, such as health effects or the benefits accruing to EU households from reduced environmental impacts. An assessment of multiple components of broader social welfare measures, including consumer costs, tax revenues and environmental impacts is provided in Supplementary Fig. 5.

Figure 5 displays the distribution of policy-induced consumption-based welfare changes across EU27 households. To sustain the same standard of living with regard to food consumption, household food expenditures would, on average, have to increase by €109 due to the VAT reform and by €150 due to a GHG emission price of €51.63 per tCO2e (indicated by the solid vertical lines in Fig. 5). The majority of households face higher welfare costs under the GHG emission price policy. This is in line with all food categories being subject to a higher price under this policy, whereas the VAT reform on meat products allows a wider range of substitution choices.

Welfare costs resulting from the removal of VAT reductions for meat products (VAT reform) and a GHG emission price of €51.63 per tCO2e on all food products. Household-specific welfare costs are measured by the cost-of-living index (in euros, €) based on the national household survey data. Vertical lines represent the average change in the absolute cost of living (solid line) and the average change in tax income per household (dashed line), comprising the change in VAT income (for both policies) and the additional income from GHG emission pricing (for the GHG emission price policy only).

Source data

We contrast the increase in food consumption expenditures required to sustain the food-related standard of living with the additional tax revenues from both policies. To do so, we compute the additional available tax revenue per household, incorporating changes in VAT income resulting from both policies, as well as additional income from the GHG emission price. These additional funds could be spent on financial transfers or public goods benefiting households and thus (at least partially) compensate for the policy-induced consumption-based welfare costs. Per household-equivalent, an additional €83 in tax revenue is generated by the VAT reform and an additional €138 in tax revenue by imposing a GHG emission price of €51.63 per tCO2e (indicated by the dashed lines in Fig. 5), on average.

The mean consumption-based welfare costs per household exceed the mean additional tax revenue, with an annual difference of €25.81 for the VAT reform policy and €12.43 for the GHG emission price across all EU27 households, corresponding to €11.40 and €5.49 annually per capita, on average. This suggests that both policies may entail relatively modest welfare costs for consumers, provided that tax revenues are effectively redistributed.

Mean estimates of consumption-based welfare costs and additional tax revenues by country are provided in Extended Data Table 2. There is considerable heterogeneity in consumption-based welfare impacts, changes in tax revenue, as well as the resulting net costs to households. In most countries, the gross consumption-based welfare costs are higher for the GHG emission price policy. However, when additional tax revenues can be effectively redistributed, the implementation of a GHG emission price results in lower mean net costs in the majority of countries compared to the VAT reform policy.

This study establishes the link between the environmental footprints of household food consumption in the EU27 and the implementation of policies aimed at mitigating GHG emissions. Previous studies have focused on singular dimensions of food consumption footprints41,42,43 or individual reduction potentials of demand-side policies in the EU20,22, but the present study provides an integrated assessment for the EU27 covering a comprehensive range of relevant environmental indicators, as well as changes in tax revenue and consumer costs.

We show that removing the VAT reductions for meat products reduces the environmental footprints induced by the food consumption of EU27 households by 3.5%–5.7%. A GHG emission price on all food products of ~€52 per tCO2e achieves equivalent reductions in GHG emissions of 29.9 MtCO2e and yields additional global co-benefits in terms of land use, water, nitrogen and phosphorus footprints. Although a GHG emission price alone results in slightly higher costs for consumers than removing VAT reductions, on average, costs to consumers are substantially reduced compared to removing VAT reductions when additional tax revenues are effectively used to compensate consumers.

Our country-specific results suggest differentiated policy priorities based on consumption-based net welfare costs and environmental effectiveness (Extended Data Table 2). Countries with currently high VAT reductions on meat products and relatively high meat consumption, such as Croatia, Hungary and Ireland, could achieve substantial environmental benefits through the VAT reform. For these countries, implementing the VAT reform with targeted compensation measures can improve environmental outcomes in a short time. In contrast, Bulgaria, Denmark and the three Baltic states that already apply standard VAT rates to meat would need to pursue GHG emission pricing directly to reduce emissions—with its longer lead time until policy implementation. However, all EU countries that currently apply reduced VAT rates to meat products except for Czechia, Finland and Slovakia as well as the aggregate of EU countries would achieve lower net costs under a GHG emission price policy compared to the VAT reform, suggesting this instrument would be more favourable in the long run, especially when revenues are used for compensating consumers. This is particularly true in high-income countries such as Belgium, Ireland and Luxembourg, as well as the large economies of Germany and Poland, where the additional tax revenue largely offsets household costs.

We explicitly consider country-specific complementary and substitute relationships between different food categories by estimating demand elasticities for each EU27 country individually. By employing representative country data as well as the most recent demand system methodology, our results demonstrate high accuracy and robustness across various demand system specifications (see ‘Demand system estimation' and Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4).

In addition to testing the robustness of our results to various assumptions and demand system specifications, we cross-validated our elasticity estimates against available peer-reviewed studies (Supplementary Table 7). We find consistency with previous studies from individual European countries as well as large meta-analyses. Although our elasticity estimates fall within expected ranges, our results demonstrate considerable variation across the EU27 countries, highlighting the importance of using country-specific elasticities rather than uniform values for all countries taken from the literature. The estimated elasticities imply food demand reductions in response to price rises. Our model results may thus imply, under certain conditions, reduced aggregate calorie consumption by households in response to price increases. This relationship conforms to the theoretical basis of demand systems40 and is frequently used in studies modelling food demand responses to policy interventions (for example, refs. 26,44). It is also in line with the literature finding overall calorie consumption reductions in response to GHG emission tax-induced food price increases24,45.

This study has limitations that should be taken into consideration. First, although the administrative implementation of removing VAT reductions on meat products is straightforward, we do not discuss the practical implementation of a GHG emission price policy. It is assumed that the consumer pays the entire additional costs, which depend on the mean country- and food category-specific demand GHG emission intensity, irrespective of the actual origin of the bought item and the point of obligation.

Second, the partial demand system estimation that we conduct considers only households' food expenditures and allows for unobserved within-category substitution by aggregating products into categories. In particular, by estimating a partial demand system we assume the utility function satisfies weak separability between the commodities represented in the demand system (here, food products) and all other commodities consumed by households. The same weak separability assumption is made for the aggregation of products into categories, where the marginal rate of substitution for products within a category is assumed to be independent of the quantities in other categories46. Under these conditions, within-category substitution leads to an optimized (that is, utility-maximizing) bundle of products for each category. Although our estimated elasticities account for potential within-category substitution, the average monetary environmental impact intensities of categories may change in response to the policy interventions due to within-category substitution. Specifically, if the policies lead to an actual intensity reduction due to within-category substitution, we would underestimate, but if they led to an actual intensity increase, we would overestimate the environmental effects of the policies. However, in our analysis, this potential source of bias is not a substantial concern: under the VAT reform scenario, the categories targeted by the policy comprise very homogeneous products, and all products within the categories are subject to the same relative price change. This makes substantial shifts in average emission intensities due to within-category substitution unlikely. In the GHG emission price scenario, within-category substitution to lower-intensity products is incentivized as these products experience lower relative price increases. In this case, post-policy average intensities may be lower than pre-policy, implying that our results can be interpreted as lower-bound estimates on the environmental impact reductions and upper-bound estimates on the costs of the policies (as some margins of adjustments are not considered). The income effect resulting from tax increases may, however, lead in the opposite direction, as it may also imply stronger demand reductions in low-intensity products relative to high-intensity products.

Third, the demand system approach assumes exogenous and constant preferences of consumers, but preferences for low-carbon diets may in fact be endogenous to the policy intervention, for example, in the presence of health benefits47.

Fourth, we do not specify the spatial location at which environmental externalities are reduced, given that we cannot determine origin-specific demand responses, but assume demand reductions proportional to current trade and consumption patterns. Reallocations on the producer side are not considered, as the focus of this study is on the global effect of demand-side adjustments. Future research taking into account dynamic trade effects could yield additional insights into the mid- to long-term effects of the investigated policies and shed light on domestic changes in produced impacts rather than global reductions.

Finally, the analysis using EXIOBASE is subject to the caveats of the underlying data. We use data for the year 2019, which rely on ‘now-casting'. Also, the environmental extensions are subject to limitations that warrant emphasis. Our measure of GHG emissions does not include emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). Due to the challenges in attributing LULUCF emissions to specific sectors, their substantial temporal variability, and the associated measurement uncertainties, we refrain from adding LULUCF emissions from other sources. Given that land-use change can account for up to one-third of GHG emission footprints, in particular for food products imported to the EU42, our GHG emission footprints and resulting reductions should be interpreted as conservative estimates. Also, we show that reducing the consumption of products with high environmental intensities has the potential to liberate large land areas and enable new use options. These may have co-benefits regarding GHG emissions and biodiversity, which we do not consider. We also do not explicitly take into account ecosystem deterioration by land-use change, as our measure only captures the equilibrium effect of land occupation. Furthermore, we focus on terrestrial and land use-related biodiversity loss. We do not account for interactions of biodiversity loss with other impacts, such as those related to climate change48 or nitrogen emissions49. Mitigating these impacts could yield further reductions in biodiversity loss.

Our results imply that the removal of VAT reductions on meat to promote sustainable consumption can be a practicable policy in the short term, as it fosters the reduction of environmental impacts at limited costs for consumers. However, it offers no flexibility for an increase in stringency. In the medium to long term, the reductions achieved by a VAT reform would not be sufficient to meet climate and other environmental objectives. In contrast, a GHG emission price policy allows a gradual increase in its stringency towards the true external GHG emission costs as reflected by the social cost of carbon.

Policymakers aiming to mitigate environmental externalities associated with food consumption should evaluate all relevant welfare dimensions of the different policies. Our framework facilitates this evaluation by normalizing with respect to the primary objective, that is GHG emission reductions. The approach allows for quantifying synergies and trade-offs, and enables a comparison of multiple components of broader social welfare measures, including consumer costs, tax revenues and environmental impacts. By assigning monetary values to changes in environmental footprints, we provide a comprehensive assessment of how each policy affects overall well-being (Supplementary Fig. 5). Our analysis demonstrates that accounting for changes in tax revenue, consumer costs and reductions in domestic nitrogen and phosphorus emissions already results in net-positive aggregate social welfare changes. Accounting for avoided (global) climate damages increases social welfare further.

Larger reductions in food consumption footprints can be expected to be associated with additional costs for consumers compared to the estimates provided in this article. This highlights the importance of implementing revenue redistribution mechanisms, as they have been demonstrated to be pivotal in mitigating the potential regressive effects of policies28.

Food consumption by households in the EU is strongly related to environmental impacts outside of the EU boundaries through global supply chains and trade networks. Thus, to determine the complete environmental footprints of EU households' food consumption and their respective changes due to policy-induced consumption changes, we use a multi-regional input–output (MRIO) model. An input–output model represents the interdependence between different economic sectors by quantifying the flow of goods and services between them.

An MRIO model differentiates a standard input–output (IO) model into different regions connected by trade. A standard IO model assumes a single economy of n sectors, each producing total output xi.Matrix A contains technical coefficients aij, which represent the input of sector i required for sector j to produce one unit of output (also referred to as direct requirements). Final demand in each sector i is denoted by yi. Using this notation, the economy can be expressed as

This can be reformulated to express total output x in terms of final demand y:

To compute the environmental impacts g induced by final demand y we use the relationship

where S are usage and emission intensities expressed per unit of the economic core.

To differentiate multiple regions, the standard IO model is extended by expanding IO relations to represent the trade between regions. Each region r is represented by a standard IO model, where xr denotes the total output vector, the technical coefficients matrix Ars contains the inputs required by region r from region s, and the final demand vector from region r to region s is denoted by yrs.

We use the global MRIO model EXIOBASE (version 3.8.2)36,37. The model has a well-established history of use in analysing dietary footprints and modelling dietary shift scenarios50. It features global coverage represented by 44 major economies and five rest-of-the-world (RoW) regions. The 27 countries of the EU are represented individually. Furthermore, the model has a detailed and globally consistent sectoral resolution of 200 different product categories. We map the 14 agricultural and ten food-processing sectors onto ten distinct food categories using the concordance table shown in Supplementary Table 2. Of the seven final demand categories included in the model, we only consider final consumption expenditures by households.

EXIOBASE provides detailed satellite accounts containing 1,113 environmental stressors and 126 impact dimensions. This analysis focuses on GHG emissions, nitrogen and phosphorus emissions, freshwater consumption and land-use stressors (Supplementary Table 3). For phosphorus emissions and freshwater consumption, we directly use characterized impacts as provided by EXIOBASE. In addition, we evaluate 20 available land-use stressors, including 13 cropland, three permanent pasture, two forest area stressors, infrastructure, and total other land use. GHG emissions cover six types of GHG emissions (CO2, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs)), which are converted to CO2 equivalents based on most recent estimates of the Global Warming Potential (GWP) 100 metric51. Nitrogen emissions, encompassing emissions to water bodies as well as ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions to air, were aggregated into nitrogen impacts using characterization factors provided by EXIOBASE.

We use data for the year 2019. This relies on ‘now-casting' of the economic structure and all environmental satellite accounts except for CO2 emissions. End years of real data points are 2018 for non-CO2 emissions and 2011 for all other environmental accounts. As a robustness check, results based on real data points only using data for 2011 are shown in Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4 (specification 3, 2011).

To translate the land-use stressors contained in EXIOBASE into spatially explicit impacts in terms of biodiversity loss, we use endpoint characterizations based on LC-IMPACT52. The use of spatially explicit characterization factors recognizes that regionalization has been highlighted as crucial to correctly assessing the impact of land use on biodiversity11. The resulting measure of biodiversity loss reflects an increase in global extinction risk due to land occupation, but does not explicitly consider land transformation, reflecting the time lag between the pressure and its effects as opposed to an immediate global species loss. The LC-IMPACT model uses the global PDF of species as a proxy for biodiversity loss. The global PDF measures the committed global loss of species richness over time as a direct consequence of anthropogenic impacts on ecosystem quality considering individual species' vulnerability to deteriorating ecosystem quality given that the pressure (here land occupation) persists52. For a single species, a global PDF of 0 reflects no anthropogenic impact, whereas a PDF of 1 corresponds to this species being globally extinct. The global PDF of the LC-IMPACT model is a weighted aggregate of the impact of land use-based stressors on a range of taxonomic groups52. As such, the PDF is an average and not a marginal measure of the impact on biodiversity.

Each of the 20 available land-use stressors from EXIOBASE is assigned to one of six land-use types to translate land occupation into region-specific biodiversity loss (Supplementary Table 3)9,38. The six land-use types are annual crops, permanent crops, pastures, urban, extensive forestry and intensive forestry. We use region-specific characterization factors for 100-year time horizons consistent with the EXIOBASE mapping determined by ref. 38 and made available in an accessible format by ref. 9. Using characterization factors C, biodiversity loss impacts gBL are determined as

where gLU represents aggregated land-use stressors induced by final demand.

Our analysis requires price elasticities to quantify the effect of price increases on the quantities demanded. There are numerous studies estimating price elasticities for various European countries and food categories21,23,24,26,32,53. However, for our purpose, the elasticity estimates in the literature are neither available for all EU27 countries nor consistent with the food categories on which we base our analysis. Thus, we estimate individual demand systems for all EU27 countries to obtain own- and cross-price as well as expenditure elasticities for ten food categories. Specifically, we estimate a linear approximation of the EASI (LA-EASI) implicit Marshallian demand system40.

The EASI demand system is the most recently developed demand system estimation technique, which has substantial advantages over the previously widely used Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS54) and Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS55). In general, the EASI demand system offers a more comprehensive and flexible approach to estimating consumer demand compared to AIDS and QUAIDS. Most importantly, EASI demand systems can estimate nonlinear, flexible Engel curves, which is in line with empirical evidence56. Furthermore, demands are not constrained by Gorman's rank restriction, error terms can be interpreted as unobserved preference heterogeneity, and, as it is based on expenditure functions, it allows for the derivation of welfare metrics40. We provide a detailed outline of the methodology below and include a summary of all parameter definitions in Supplementary Table 5.

To implement the EASI implicit Marshallian demand system40, we assume that household h with observable characteristics \({{\bf{z}}}_{h}={({z}_{h,\,1},\,\ldots, \,{z}_{h,\,L})}^{{\prime} }\), unobservable preference characteristics \(\bf{{\varepsilon}}_{h}={({\varepsilon }_{h,1},\ldots,{\varepsilon }_{h,n})}^{{{\prime} }}\) with 1nεh = 0 and log nominal total food expenditures xh chooses a bundle of n food categories facing the vector of log prices ph. Thus, following ref. 40, the log food expenditure (or cost) function of household h can be specified as xh = C(ph, uh, zh, εh), expressing the minimum total log expenditures required for household h with characteristics zh and preferences εh to realize utility level uh when facing log prices ph.

Using Shephard's lemma, the Hicksian budget share functions can be expressed as

where ∇p denotes the vector differential operator evaluated for a change in the price vector p. By replacing indirect utility uh = V(ph, xh, zh, εh) = C−1(ph, ⋅, zh, εh) with the implicit utility yh = g(wh, ph, xh, zh), one obtains the so-called implicit Marshallian demand (or budget share) function

The linear approximation of the EASI demand system assumes that implicit utility yh = g(wh, ph, xh, zh) can be interpreted as the log of real expenditures40, which are log nominal expenditures xh deflated with the Stone price index:

We use observed expenditure shares wh to exploit the available household-specific information. We acknowledge that this approach introduces endogeneity, but the linear approximation of the EASI demand system using the Stone price index as defined here has been shown to yield estimates that do not differ substantially from those based on the exact system40. As a robustness check, results using an alternative EASI specification approximating real expenditures using a common Stone price deflator for all households \({\widetilde{y}}_{h}={x}_{h}-{{\bf{p}}}_{h}^{{\prime} }{\bar{{\bf{w}}}}_{h}\) based on the sample mean of expenditure shares, \(\bar{{\bf{w}}}\), are displayed in Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4 (specification 2, ytilda). To reduce numerical problems, yh can be centred in the polynomial regression40. As we did not encounter any numerical problems, our main specification uses the uncentred yh. As a robustness check, results based on yh centred by its sample median, \({y}_{h}^{{\rm{c}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{n}}\mathrm{tr}{\rm{e}}{\rm{d}}}={y}_{h}-\bar{y}\), are displayed in Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4 (specification 4, ycentered).

A convenient estimable functional specification of equation (6) is the following system of equations:

where wh is an n-vector of budget shares that household h spends on the n food categories. The budget share depends on log real total expenditures yh, ph is an n-vector of the food categories' log prices faced by household h, zh is the L-vector of observable sociodemographics, and b, A, B, C and D are parameter vectors and matrices to be estimated.

The polynomials in term (I) of equation (8) allow for flexible Engel curves, which describe the relationship between budget shares and total expenditures. Term (II) captures the effects of all n prices, and term (III) includes the sociodemographic characteristics that serve as demand shifters, capturing observable heterogeneity between households. The sociodemographics vector zh contains dummy coded information for age (household head is older than 45 years), gender of the household head, presence of children in the household, household income (household income is above median) and urbanity (household is located in a high-population-density area). The terms (IV) and (V) are interaction terms between expenditures and prices, and expenditures and household characteristics, which capture additional heterogeneity in household responses. As a robustness check, results based on equation (8) amended by an additional interaction term \({\sum }_{l=1}^{L}{z}_{h,\,l}{{E}}_{l}{{\bf{p}}}_{h}\) to account for the interaction between household characteristics and prices is shown in Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4 (specification 7, pzintyes).

The model is estimated for each EU27 country individually using sample-weighted seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) to account for the potential correlation of errors across equations within the same household. As a robustness check, results using non-weighted SUR are displayed in Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4 (specification 5, unweighted).

Due to data constraints, we estimate partial demand systems resting on the assumption of weak separability between food and non-food consumption57. In other words, we assume that households first allocate their budget to general consumption categories such as housing, energy, mobility, food and so on. Then, households choose an optimal mix of commodities within each category given their budget constraint for this category (see also refs. 23,32,58). Hence, our demand system estimation only considers food categories and disregards expenditures on other commodities and services. This translates into the assumption that households' nominal food expenditures remain constant when facing food price changes. As a robustness check, we alternatively estimate incomplete demand systems by including a composite numéraire good that represents all other non-food goods and services consumed by households. Due to a lack of required data for Germany, incomplete demand systems can be estimated for the remaining 26 EU countries only. Results based on the incomplete demand systems thus need to be compared to the partial demand system results excluding Germany in Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4 (specification 6, incomplete; specification 9, partialnoDE).

Due to the restricted duration of recording periods in the household surveys (14 days to 3 months), yearly expenditures for specific food categories may be recorded as zero for some households even though extending the observation period may have resulted in the recording of positive expenditures. Thus, the true expenditure values are only recorded for a subset of all surveyed households. This is a typical sample selection problem where zero observations are the result of an upstream binary choice problem59,60. The resulting censored distribution of the dependent variable of the demand system, the vector of budget shares wh, may result in biased and inconsistent parameter estimates. Therefore, the use of procedures that account for the censored distribution is necessary. As this is not accounted for in the original LA-EASI model specification40, we apply the widely adopted two-step approach for censored distributions of the dependent variable61.

First, we assume a latent variable for the budget share of food category i, \({{w}}_{hi}^{* }\), and a sample selection process that governs which budget shares are observed and which are not:

We estimate the probability that the observed budget equals the latent budget share by separately regressing for each food category i a binary outcome variable, di, indicating zero expenditures or not, on a vector of household characteristics sh using probit models:

The use of separate probit models implies the assumption of Cov(ζhi, ζhj) = 0 for i ≠ j (ref. 61). Using the estimated vector \({\widehat{{\boldsymbol{\gamma }}}}_{{\boldsymbol{i}}}\), the standard normal cumulative distribution function (cdf) Φ(⋅) and probability density function (pdf) ϕ(⋅) are computed:

In the second step, the parameters in equation (8) are estimated correcting for the censored distribution of the observed budget shares (see also ref. 62) with the estimated cdf and pdf values:

Matrices \({\widehat{\varPhi }}_{h}\) and \({\widehat{\phi }}_{h}\) are n × n identity matrices where the diagonal elements have been replaced by the estimated cdf and pdf values given by equation (11). Homogeneity is satisfied in equation (12) by the use of (log-)normalized prices. That is, we divide all prices by total food expenditures: \({{\bf{p}}}_{h}=\mathrm{ln}(\frac{{\widetilde{{\bf{p}}}}_{h}}{{x}_{h}})\). The symmetry of the Slutsky matrix is ensured by imposing the symmetry of matrices A and B as restrictions in the estimation process. The adding-up restriction does not hold in censoring-corrected demand systems in general, and thus cannot be guaranteed by straightforward parametric restrictions58,63. We therefore use all n equations in the estimation procedure. As a robustness check, results for the uncorrected demand systems, estimated using n − 1 equations and imposing the adding-up restriction, are shown in Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4 (specification 1, uncensored, nmin1).

The estimation procedure of the LA-EASI demand system requires the input of prices for each food category included in the demand system. A common problem in demand system estimation is the limited availability of price survey data that can be matched to the household survey data, including food expenditures and quantities62,64. Thus, we use information on quantities purchased per food category available in the household survey data to compute unit values. Unit values are defined as food category expenditure per unit purchased. This is a common approach in the absence of price data. As the products within each food category purchased by each household may vary in quality and price across households, we adjust the unit values65 (see also, for example, refs. 32,66).

Specifically, we regress computed household- and food category-specific unit values UVhi on a vector of household characteristics th. For each of the n food categories, the estimated regression model is given by

where th contains information on the gender and age of the household head as well as the urbanity of the household location, household size, number of children in the household, and household income (except for Italy where data on household income are missing).

We define the n-vector of adjusted unit value prices as the sum of the regression constant and the predicted residual values:

By correcting for quality effects, the adjusted prices proxy the variation in unit values due to supply-side factors. As for households with zero expenditures and where for quantities purchased in a given food category no unit values can be computed, we impute the country median of adjusted unit values. Also, in some countries and for some food categories, the number of households that consumed a specific food category may be relatively low, and we estimate equation (13) only if at least 30 household observations with positive expenditures are available. If fewer than 30 households in country c consumed food category i, no unit value adjustment is conducted, and the non-adjusted unit value is imputed for the adjusted unit value. As a robustness check, results based on non-adjusted unit values are presented in Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4 (specification 8, uvnonadj).

Price elasticities express the percentage change in quantity demanded of food category i due to a 1% price change in food category j (called own-price elasticity for i = j and cross-price elasticity for i ≠ j). The expenditure elasticities express the percentage change in quantity demanded for food category i due to a 1% change in real expenditures y.

From the estimated parameters of equation (12), compensated (Hicksian) elasticities can be computed by dividing Hicksian semi-elasticities by the budget share whi (ref. 40). The Hicksian semi-elasticities with regard to prices are given by

and the Hicksian semi-elasticities with regard to real expenditures are

Thus, own- and cross-price elasticities are computed using

where \({\eta }_{h}^{\mathrm{PE}}\) is an n × n-matrix of compensated price elasticities of household h, \({\widetilde{{\omega }}}_{h}\) is an identity matrix with the ones replaced by the budget shares wh of household h, and I is an n × n identity matrix.

The expenditure elasticities are computed using

where \({{\boldsymbol{\eta }}}_{h}^{\mathrm{EE}}\) is the n × 1-vector of compensated expenditure elasticities of household h.

The compensated elasticities can then be transformed to uncompensated elasticities using the Slutsky equation. Uncompensated (Marshallian) elasticities reflect both substitution and income effects and are used in the policy analysis to compute percentage changes in demanded quantities due to price changes.

Based on the estimated demand system parameters we compute household-specific elasticity estimates. To evaluate country-specific changes in demand due to policy-induced price changes, we compute country-specific weighted-mean elasticities. The household-specific elasticities are weighted by household expenditures and sample weights to ensure the representativeness of the country-specific elasticity estimate with regard to overall expenditures and household composition. The resulting country-specific elasticities are consistent with values found in the literature (Supplementary Table 7) and fall within expected ranges. Supplementary Data 1 provides mean uncompensated own- and cross-price elasticities across EU27 member states (elas) and their standard deviations (s.d.).

To estimate country-specific demand systems of food consumption, we use the Eurostat Household Budget Survey (HBS) for the reference years 2015 and 2010 for 25 out of 27 EU countries. The national household surveys, which are harmonized in the 2015 (2010) HBS data, were conducted by national statistical offices in the years 2014–2016 (2008–2011) and expenditures in euros are adjusted to the respective HBS reference year using price coefficients67. Due to data being missing for Austria and Germany in the HBS dataset, we also use the Konsumerhebung 2014/15 provided by Statistics Austria68, as well as the Einkommens- und Verbrauchsstichprobe (EVS) 2018 provided by the German Federal Statistical Office69. All 27 surveys are representative cross-sectional sample surveys of private households. A common feature is that they collect households' expenditure information classified along the UN Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP) using diaries maintained over a fixed time period, which varies between countries from two weeks to 3 months67. The data also include selected sociodemographic information of the household and its members (Supplementary Table 4).

For each country covered by the HBS, we consider the most recent available dataset that contains both expenditures and quantities of food items purchased. Specifically, we only use HBS 2010 data if country c has no quantity data for at least one food item available per food category (the aggregation of COICOP level 4 food items into ten food categories is detailed in the following). We remove households that report implausible values on the five-digit (level 4) COICOP classified food items; that is, households are excluded if they report (1) negative expenditures or (2) zero expenditures in combination with positive quantities.

Two cases of missing quantity data have to be considered in the HBS datasets. Case 1 is that the quantities consumed of certain food items i have not been recorded in country c (Supplementary Table 4). Case 2 is that the quantities have been recorded but the recorded data are implausible, as for household h the quantity of food item i is zero and expenditures for food item i are greater than zero. Given the absence of a standardized procedure in the existing literature, we address both cases of missing quantity data separately as outlined in the following.

To address case 1, we use a cross-country matching and imputation algorithm. First, we construct four regions (north, east, south, west) based on the UN geo-scheme for Europe. For each country c, we impute quantities for all food items that have not been recorded. To do so, we construct a matching pool containing all households with positive expenditures from all countries that (1) belong to the same region r as country c and (2) for which quantity data for food item i have been recorded. For each household h of country c that has positive expenditures, the ten nearest neighbours in the matching pool with regard to selected sociodemographic variables, income and expenditures on the specific food item i are found within the matching pool. The missing quantity of food item i for household h in country c is then imputed with the mean of the ten nearest neighbours, weighted by their inverted distance and scaled with the ratio of the distance-weighted-mean expenditures of the ten neighbours and household h's expenditures. For households with zero expenditures, zero quantities are imputed.

To address case 2, we use a within-country matching and imputation algorithm. For each country c, we impute quantities for all household food item observations that have zero quantities but positive expenditures recorded. To do so, we construct a matching pool containing all households from country c with positive expenditures and positive quantities for food item i. For each household h that has positive expenditures but a zero quantity recorded for food item i, the ten nearest neighbours with regard to selected sociodemographic variables, income and expenditures on the specific food item i are found within the matching pool. The missing quantity for food item i of household h is then imputed with the mean of the ten nearest neighbours, weighted by their inverted distance and scaled with the ratio of the distance-weighted mean expenditures of the ten nearest neighbours and household h's expenditures.

We aggregate the five-digit (level 4) COICOP classified expenditures on food items into ten distinct food categories (Supplementary Table 2). In addition to the exclusion criteria mentioned above, we exclude (1) households with unreasonably high food expenditures relative to total expenditures (>75%) and (2) households with zero total food expenditures after the matching procedure. Budget shares of different food categories by country are presented in Supplementary Fig. 1. Using the final data on all EU27 countries, we estimate 27 separate LA-EASI demand systems for each country to obtain country-specific elasticity estimates for the ten food categories as described above.

We simulate two policies inducing different price changes across food categories. For the VAT reform policy, we compute relative price changes of the meat categories using country-specific information on reduced and standard VAT rates (Supplementary Table 1):

where c denotes countries and rc are the VAT rates in country c. This implies that the relative price increase is the same for all meat categories and zero for all non-meat categories.

For the GHG emission price policy, the percentage price increase is determined by country-specific GHG emission intensities and computed as

where μci is the country-specific GHG emission intensity of demand for food category i, displayed in Supplementary Fig. 2. This implies relative price increases for all food categories that vary across categories and countries. The relative price increase, \(\frac{\Delta {p}_{{ci}}}{{p}_{{ci}}}\), only depends on μci as the GHG emission price level, τGHG, isuniform across all food categories and countries. However, as GHG emission intensities are expressed in monetary terms (tCO2e per euro), relative price increases are influenced by the GHG emission content per physical unit of each food category as well as the pre-policy price per physical unit.

The usage of monetary intensities (kgCO2e per euro) is due to the fact that the satellite accounts of EXIOBASE only provide monetary values and no quantities. Just like physical emission intensities (kgCO2e kg−1), monetary emission intensities can be appropriately used for implementing a Pigouvian tax. The monetary emission intensity, μ, of a product can be expressed as

where E are total emissions, Q is physical quantity, p is price per physical quantity and X is total expenditure. This shows that the monetary intensity μ (=E/X) is simply the physical intensity per unit, E/Q, divided by the price per unit, p = X/Q.

When multiplying the monetary intensity by the product price (where τ is the GHG emission price given in euros per tCO2e):

we recover exactly the carbon price applied to physical emissions.

This leads to proper pricing of the externality if the GHG emission price of τ (in € tCO2e−1) ensures that consumers face the full social cost of their consumption choices. For any given product, the tax payment equals monetary intensity times the GHG emission tax times total expenditures:

This equals the product's emissions multiplied by the GHG emission price and thereby adheres to the principle of Pigouvian taxation. The seemingly counterintuitive result presented above that some lower GHG emission intensity food categories face large relative price increases is due to their low pre-policy price per unit. A GHG emission price that will lead to an absolute €1 price increase for products with the same physical emissions per unit will lead to a larger percentage price increase for a €2 product compared to a €20 product. However, although relative price changes may vary, the absolute carbon price signal in € tCO2e−1 remains constant across all food categories and ensures that the externality is priced uniformly across categories.

We assume that the additional cost due to the GHG emission price is not subject to additional VAT. To establish the GHG emission price level (τGHG) necessary to achieve equivalent emission reductions as the VAT reform, the model is iteratively solved.

The vector of percentage changes in the demanded quantities of all food categories in country c depends on both own- and cross-price elasticities:

where \({\eta }_{c}^{\mathrm{PE}}\) is the uncompensated elasticity matrix computed as the country-specific weighted mean from \({\eta }_{{ch}}^{\mathrm{PE}}\) (equation (17)), and \(\frac{\Delta {{\bf{p}}}_{c}}{{{\bf{p}}}_{c}}\) is the vector of relative price changes across all food categories. Thus, the change in footprints associated with consumption of the n food categories in country c is computed as

The contrasting policies' effects on environmental impacts with their corresponding welfare-related costs require a household welfare metric. Given that the EASI demand system is based on an expenditure function model, the estimated parameters of the demand system can be used to compute a closed-form expression of consumer welfare called log cost-of-living (COL)40. As we only capture households' responses to policy-induced price changes in the demand for food, this welfare metric captures the relative increase in expenditures for food required to sustain the same standard of living with regard to food. Mathematically, it is defined as

where C(⋅) is the log expenditure function. The log COL index is equal to the difference in pre-policy log expenditures, C(ph0, uh0, zh, εh), and log expenditures required to achieve the original level of utility uh0 at post-policy prices ph1. Thus, a positive value corresponds to a welfare loss as households need to expend more to achieve the same level of utility. The index comprises both a first-order effect reflecting a change in purchasing power (given by the Stone index for the price change) and a second-order effect capturing substitution effects between food categories. With major substitution in response to price increases, the latter effect will reduce the overall welfare loss. To obtain absolute monetary values in euros that represent the additional expenditures required to sustain the standard of living with regard to food, we multiply the log(COLh) by households' total nominal food expenditures, xh:

We contrast the additional household expenditures required to sustain the standard of living with regard to food with the additional mean tax income per household generated by the two policies in each country c. For the VAT reform, we determine the change in VAT paid by household h (\(\Delta {T}_{h}^{VAT}\)) as

where \({x}_{hi}^{0}\) is the observed pre-policy household food expenditures in food category i, \({x}_{hi}^{1}\) is the post-policy household food expenditures, and \({r}_{ci}^{0}\) and \({r}_{ci}^{1}\) are pre- and post-policy VAT rates applied to food category i in country c in which household h resides. Note that for non-meat categories and countries that already apply the standard VAT rate to meat products, \({r}_{ci}^{1}={r}_{ci}^{0}\).

For the GHG emission price policy, we compute the GHG emission price paid by household h (\(\Delta {T}_{h}^{GHG}\)) as

where μci is the mean GHG emission demand intensity in € tCO2e−1 applied to the net expenditures (\({x}_{hi}^{1}\frac{1}{1+{r}_{ci}^{0}}\)) in food category i for country c in which household h resides and τGHG is the EU-wide GHG emission price level applied. As the GHG emission price policy will also shift demand among the food categories and in some countries different VAT rates are applied to different food categories, we also determine the change in VAT paid by household h for the GHG emission price policy:

As \({x}_{hi}^{1}\) cannot be observed, we derive the vector of post-policy food expenditures from budget share semi-elasticities:

where \(\Delta {{\bf{p}}}^{{\prime} }\) is the vector of price changes and \({{\rm{\nabla }}}_{p}^{{\prime} }{w}_{h}\) is a matrix of Hicksian price semi-elasticities as given by equation (16). Each element of this matrix gives the change in the budget share wi due to a relative price change in food category j, that is, \(\frac{{\rm{\partial }}{w}_{{hi}}}{{\rm{\partial }}{p}_{{hj}}}\). In the case of the VAT reform, each vector element i of \(\Delta {{\bf{p}}}^{{\prime} }\) is \(\frac{\Delta {p}_{i}}{{p}_{i}}=\frac{1\,+{r}_{i}^{1}}{1+{r}_{i}^{0}}-1\). In the case of the GHG emission price policy, each vector element i of \(\Delta {{\bf{p}}}^{{\prime} }\) is \(\frac{\Delta {p}_{i}}{{p}_{i}}={\mu }_{{ci}}{\tau }_{{\rm{G}}{\rm{H}}{\rm{G}}}\).

Using the household-specific changes in VAT paid and GHG emission price tax revenue we compute EU averages using household and population weights to ensure representativeness.

To allow for an overall evaluation of to what extent the policies increase global aggregate well-being, we monetize the changes in environmental footprints using the global social cost of GHGs, the domestic social cost of nitrogen and the domestic social cost of phosphorus. As the changes in environmental footprints cannot be mapped to the location of impact, we assume that reductions occur proportional to where impacts are generated in the status quo. The social costs represent the welfare-equivalent monetary value of the net damage caused by the emission of an additional unit of the respective substance and thus also represent the net benefit to society resulting from the reduction of emissions by one unit.

The social cost of GHGs encompasses CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6. We compute the social benefits from reduced GHG emissions using two different sources. First, we refer to ref. 70, which provides social cost estimates for CO2, CH4 and N2O. As specific values for HFCs, PFCs and SF6 are not available in ref. 70, we convert these gases into their CO2 equivalent (CO2e) and apply the social cost of CO2. We also compute the benefits using ref. 71, which provides a substantially higher mean estimate for the social cost of carbon (US$283 versus US$193 per tCO2). As ref. 71 does not provide social cost values for CH4 and N2O, we impute those values using the ratios between their social cost and the social cost of CO2 derived from ref. 70. HFCs, PFCs and SF6 are also converted into CO2e and valued according to the social cost estimate for CO2 in ref. 71. The social cost of nitrogen is quantified based on estimates from ref. 72, which includes the external costs of damage caused by nitrogen leaching and run-off, as well as ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. Both damage to human health and ecosystem impacts are accounted for. The social cost of phosphorus emissions is quantified based on ref. 73, which estimates the external cost of phosphorus emissions into surface waters to be €153.50 per kg. This value is used to compute the local impacts associated with pollution within all EU27 countries. As no robust social cost of nitrogen and phosphorus estimates are available globally, only the value of benefits accruing within the EU is determined. An overview of the social costs assumed is presented in Supplementary Table 6.

As the MRIO model is provided without associated uncertainty ranges, the only source of uncertainty underlying the policy simulation arises from the estimated elasticities. To quantify the range of uncertainty surrounding our main results, we employ a non-parametric bootstrapping procedure (ref. 74, p. 438), where, for each country c, we treat the original household survey dataset of size Nc as the population and draw b random samples of size Nc with replacement. We set b = 100. Based on each of the b bootstrapping samples, we estimate country-specific demand systems as described in the section ‘Demand system estimation' to obtain country-specific elasticity estimates. Following the same procedure as described in the section ‘Policy simulation', we then compute the VAT-equivalent GHG emission price and the footprint reductions for both policy simulations for each of the b obtained country-specific elasticities. This yields b GHG emission price and footprint reduction values. We report the uncertainty as the range between the minimum and maximum of the b computed GHG emission price and footprint reduction values.

Each line represents the weighted mean of household-specific own- or cross-price elasticities in one country from the food category given in a specific column to the food categories given in the respective rows. Overlaid on the 27 lines representing the country means is a probability density. Own-price elasticities are highlighted in dark blue. In the analysis, both substitution and income effects are considered such that the full effect of policy-induced price changes on the demanded quantities is captured. We find considerable variation in own- and cross-price elasticities across countries for all food categories. This highlights the importance of estimating country-specific elasticities rather than assuming uniform elasticities for all EU countries. In general, households exhibit relatively lower absolute elasticity in basic food categories such as Bread and cereals compared to non-basic food categories like Beef or Pork. Mean country-specific cross-price elasticities, that is changes in demand for one good in response to a price change of another good, are generally centred around zero with goods acting as complements or substitutes depending on the country-specific household preferences. NEC denotes not elsewhere classified food items. Note: The underlying mean uncompensated own- and cross-price elasticities across EU27 member states are displayed in Supplementary Data 1.

The intrinsic organization underlying the central cognitive role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is poorly understood. We approached organization by profiling the activity and spatial location of >24,000 neurons recorded in awake mice. High-resolution activity maps of the PFC did not align with cytoarchitecturally defined subregions. Instead, spontaneous activity and tuning to choice during a behavioral task were both related to intra-PFC hierarchy, suggesting that connectivity, rather than cytoarchitecture, shapes the PFC's activity landscape. Low-rate, regular spontaneous firing was a hallmark of both the PFC and high hierarchy. Surprisingly, choice tuning was overrepresented in units displaying high spontaneous firing rates, linking connectivity-based hierarchy to distinct functional properties in separate neuronal populations. Our data-driven approach provides a scalable roadmap to explore functional organizations in diverse brain regions and species, opening avenues to obtain an integrated view of activity, structure and function in the brain.

The PFC integrates information from all over the brain and is crucial for emotional and cognitive functions1,2. While mapping of gene expression3,4,5, cytoarchitecture6,7,8 and connectivity9,10,11,12,13 provides insights into the PFC's infrastructure, a functional description of the PFC remains elusive14. It is unclear to what extent subregions of the PFC hold functional specializations14,15, and the existing structural descriptions of the PFC are yet to be integrated with the neuronal activities underlying this region's information processing16. Furthermore, it is an open question whether the PFC's neuronal activity is distinctive from other cortical regions and what kind of activity patterns would support PFC-specific functional demands.

In the current study, we approach the organization of the PFC at the level of single-neuron activity. A neuron's firing pattern is a reflection of intrinsic biophysical properties and the neuron's embedding in a particular network17,18,19. The activity profile of neurons should, therefore, inform about the functional properties of brain regions. In line with this, it has been shown that brain regions differ in activity patterns18,20,21,22 and that there is a correlation between connectivity-based hierarchy and firing patterns23,24,25. Yet, while cytoarchitecture is used to spatially define regions in the brain—and to sample and summarize activity—the relevance of cytoarchitectural delineations to function remains unclear, especially in case of the PFC, whose functions are considered to be distributed rather than localized26.

Here, we recorded single-neuron activity using high-density probes (Neuropixels) in awake mice and evaluated neuronal firing patterns at multiple spatial scales. Specifically, we analyzed spontaneous activity patterns, tone response profiles and tuning to aspects of goal-directed behavior. We addressed the general relationship between single-unit activity and brain anatomy, as well as the PFC's distinctive activity characteristics and internal structure. The approach presented is a roadmap, applicable across brain regions and species.

We recorded the firing activity of 24,248 single units from awake, head-fixed mice (dataset KI; Fig. 1a–c). Overall, 52% of the units originated from the PFC and 48% from other brain regions (3 cortical, 10 subcortical; Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). In the PFC, we included 11 subregions9,14: secondary motor area (MOs), anterior cingulate area—dorsal and ventral parts (ACAd and ACAv, respectively), prelimbic area (PL), infralimbic area (ILA), orbital area—medial, lateral and ventrolateral parts (ORBm, ORBvl and ORBl, respectively), agranular insular area—dorsal and ventral parts (AId and AIv, respectively) and frontal pole (FRP). As spontaneous activity, we extracted 3-s epochs preceding the onset of auditory stimuli (Fig. 1c; ~227 epochs per recording session). Epochs contaminated by ‘sleep-like' periods27 were excluded due to their fundamentally different, nonstationary firing characteristics (Extended Data Fig. 1c–e and Methods). While generally stationary for individual units, activity patterns varied considerably across units (Fig. 1d). To capture this diversity, we characterized each unit by three metrics: firing rate, burstiness and memory. Burstiness reflects the variability of a unit's inter-spike intervals (ISIs), while memory is defined as the correlation coefficient between subsequent ISIs (Fig. 1e)28. Note that burstiness solely describes the distribution of ISI durations, while memory reflects the temporal ordering of ISIs. Memory and burstiness are mathematically independent of each other and together comprehensively capture two key aspects of firing patterns: sequential structure and regularity. These two metrics thus offer a robust characterization that encompasses the information provided by other commonly used interval metrics, such as CV2 and ‘local variation' (LvR)20. The memory metric is related to neuronal timescales that recent studies23,24 derived from firing autocorrelations. However, the complexity of the autocorrelations at the single-neuron level disagrees with parametrization into a timescale through exponential fitting17. In contrast, the memory metric used here avoids the assumptions underlying timescales and describes the sequential structure of firing in a less biased way. Each metric was computed per 3-s epoch and averaged across epochs, thus summarizing each unit's firing pattern into three metrics (Fig. 1e,f and Extended Data Fig. 1f–i).

Spike waveforms have been widely used to distinguish two neuron types, wide-width (ww) and narrow-width (nw) units (Fig. 1g), identified as putative excitatory and putative inhibitory neurons, respectively29. As expected, spike widths were bimodally distributed, allowing us to distinguish ww (n = 19,186; 81.1%) and nw (n = 4,200; 17.7%) units (Fig. 1h). nw neurons are expected to fire at high rates29,30, and indeed, nw units displayed significantly higher firing rates, along with higher burstiness and memory compared to ww units (Fig. 1i). To adequately analyze differences within each unit type, we processed ww and nw units separately. In the following section, we focus on ww units.

To obtain an overview of naturally occurring firing patterns, we trained a self-organizing map (SOM) on the three metrics extracted from the ww units. A SOM consists of a grid of nodes (here visualized as hexagons), where each node represents a combination of metrics; similar nodes are neighbors on the map (Extended Data Fig. 2a). The SOM displayed perpendicular gradients of burstiness and firing rate, showing that these two metrics vary independently of each other. In contrast, high memory patches coincided with medium to low burstiness, indicating that high memory and high burstiness are mutually exclusive (Fig. 2a). Thus, burstiness and memory were empirically dependent, albeit mathematically independent. Note that linear correlation did not reveal this empirical dependence between burstiness and memory (Extended Data Fig. 1f,g).

Each unit was assigned to the node of the SOM that matched its metrics best. Every node represented units from numerous recordings, confirming that inter-animal variability did not drive the SOM's feature landscape (Extended Data Fig. 2b). While PFC units constituted 54% of the ww dataset used to create the SOM, units from other brain regions were represented similarly well by the SOM (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). Overall, PFC units were widely distributed on the SOM, with many units matching best to regular firing (that is, low burstiness) and avoiding anti-memory territories (Fig. 2b), while units from other brain regions populated different territories (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Notably, occupancy of SOM territories varied across PFC subregions, indicating spatial differentiation of firing repertoires within the PFC (Extended Data Fig. 2f).

To enable a statistical analysis of the spatial distribution of firing patterns, we categorized firing patterns by hierarchically clustering the SOM's nodes—and, implicitly, the matched units (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Units within a category displayed similar firing statistics (Fig. 2d). To test whether units maintained stable firing properties over time, we allocated the spontaneous epochs into equally sized blocks and determined each unit's category in the respective block. The category label (1–8) assigned to a unit per block matched well with the unit's category obtained across all epochs (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Consistently, around 57% of units remained in the category they had in the previous block, which is considerably above the 18% expected from chance (marginal distributions; Fig. 2e). Splitting data into blocks reduces the sampling of spikes, deteriorating metric estimation and consequently also categorization (clustering) of units. This should disproportionately affect low-rate units, leading to underestimation of the stability for units with low firing rate in particular. Indeed, the block-wise assignment of categories to units was substantially less stable for low-rate categories (1–3, 7 and 8) compared to high-rate categories (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 3d): low-rate, regular-firing categories (1–3) mostly transitioned among themselves, as did the low-rate, bursty categories (7 and 8), suggesting the existence of statistically similar category groups.

To quantify differences in firing patterns across various spatial entities—brain (sub)regions, layers and regions of interest (ROIs)—we defined a variable, the E-score, expressing for any selection of units the enrichment/depletion of a given unit category (1–8) relative to a chance distribution (Extended Data Fig. 3e). E-score analysis of ww unit activity revealed substantial enrichment in bursty units in the superficial cortical layers (L2/3), while deep cortical layers (L5–6) were enriched in regular-firing units (Extended Data Fig. 3f,g and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Given the anatomical organization of the mouse PFC and the experimental constraints, 95% of cortical units were recorded from deep layers. Therefore, the subsequent analyses include only the deep-layer (L5–6) units from cortical regions as well as all units from non-cortical regions.

The majority of the cytoarchitectural PFC subregions, that is, ILA, PL, ACAd, ACAv, ORBm and ORBvl, were generally enriched in low-rate, regular-firing units (categories 1–3), while holding subregion-specific differentiations (Fig. 2g). Interestingly, ILA and PL were both heavily and significantly enriched in units of the most regular-firing category 1 (Supplementary Table 3). The ORBl, MOs and AIv, in contrast, were significantly enriched in bursty category 8 units. Thus, the subregions ILA, PL, ACAd/ACAv and ORBm/ORBvl formed an activity-defined prefrontal entity, excluding ORBl, MOs and AIv (Fig. 2h). Other brain regions like thalamus (TH) and hippocampal formation (HPF) were heavily and significantly enriched in bursty units (categories 6–8), revealing a PFC-specific signature of low-rate, regular-firing units. Characterizing brain regions by firing properties requires reproducibility and robustness across datasets. Repeating the analyses with spontaneous activity obtained from the International Brain Laboratory (dataset IBL Passive31) revealed a high degree of similarity between the regional enrichment profiles of the two datasets (Fig. 2i and Extended Data Fig. 4).

To analyze nw unit activity, we trained a separate SOM and then repeated categorizations and comparisons of brain regions (Extended Data Fig. 5). ILA, PL and ACAd/v were significantly enriched in high-rate, regular-firing nw units with high memory (Extended Data Fig. 5g and Supplementary Table 4). ORBl was consistently and significantly enriched in high-rate, bursty units. Considering both nw and ww unit activity, we found regular-firing patterns to be the hallmark of the medial wall PFC subregions (ILA, PL and ACAd/ACAv). Relating nw and ww category enrichment profiles (Fig. 2j), we observed that brain (sub)regions enriched in low-rate, regular-firing ww units were enriched in high-rate, regular-firing nw units. Similarly, regions enriched in low-rate, bursty ww units were enriched in high-rate, bursty nw units. This could be interpreted as high-rate, putative inhibitory nw units contributing to the low-rate characteristic of ww units and implies that the PFC operates in an inhibition-dominated regime, which could be conducive to fine-tuned processing required for complex cognitive processes.

Having found differences between brain regions in terms of firing patterns, we next asked whether these differences are linked to the hierarchical organization of brain regions. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas describes the hierarchy of mouse cortical regions based on input/output connectivity motifs occurring between cortical and thalamic regions9. To investigate the relationship between the spontaneous unit categories (1–8) and cortical hierarchy, we correlated the E-scores of cortical (sub)regions with their respective cortical hierarchy score established by Harris et al.9. We found a positive correlation between cortical hierarchy and enrichment in low-rate, regular-firing units (categories 1–3). This positive correlation was not driven by a continuous relationship but due to a bimodal distribution of hierarchical scores between the low-hierarchy sensory regions versus the high-hierarchy PFC subregions (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 6a). To sample a wider range of cortical regions and hierarchical scores, we repeated the analysis with the dataset IBL Passive and found positive correlations between cortical hierarchy and the PFC's signature categories 1–3 (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 6b). We identified even stronger, negative correlations between cortical hierarchy and enrichment in bursty, low-memory units (categories 6–8; Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Importantly, when we limited the correlation analysis to PFC subregions, we found no direct relationship between cortical hierarchy and enrichment/depletion in unit categories (Supplementary Table 5), suggesting that firing patterns did not reflect cortical hierarchy at the level of cytoarchitectural subregions.

Given the accumulating evidence for the incongruence between cytoarchitecture and connectivity in the mouse PFC14, demarcating and analyzing activity profiles based on cytoarchitecture could be called into question. Therefore, we parcellated the PFC subregions into smaller ROIs (dataROIs, n = 42), each containing a similar number of deep-layer ww units (~200; Fig. 4a,b and Extended Data Fig. 7a) and calculated E-scores per dataROI. Low-rate, regular-firing units (categories 1 and 3) were significantly enriched in dataROIs located in ILA and PL, while low-rate, bursty units (categories 7 and 8) were enriched in dataROIs located in the MOs and the ORBl (Fig. 4c,d, Extended Data Fig. 7b,c and Supplementary Table 6). Clustering dataROIs based on category enrichment profiles enabled us to define and spatially outline activity-based modules (Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). This revealed a homogeneous enrichment profile in ILA, creating an ILA-specific activity module that bordered a module with similar firing patterns in the adjacent parts of PL and ACAd (Fig. 4e). Other activity modules stretched over cytoarchitectural boundaries and occurred in multiple places. Thus, several cytoarchitectural subregions lacked spatially homogeneous activity signatures. The strong enrichment of low-rate, bursty units (categories 7 and 8) characterizing ORBl (Fig. 2g) could now, due to the improved spatial resolution, be pinpointed to a dataROI in the most ventral portion of this subregion. The similarity in the activity patterns in ILA and the adjacent portions of PL is consistent with the proposition of a ventromedial subdivision of the PFC defined by input and output connectivity12,14. We could not, however, identify specific activity signatures for the proposed dorsomedial and ventrolateral subdivisions14. A confound could be that our focus on deep layers primarily captures output activity, while the connectivity-based subdivisions of the PFC also consider the superficial input layers. Conversely, our relatively coarse sampling of the extensive territory of the dorsomedial (MOs and ACAd/ACAv) and the ventrolateral regions (ORBl and ORBvl) precludes discovery of small, homogeneous activity modules.

Recently, two studies from Gao et al.10,11 used single-neuron connectivity tracing to describe the mouse intra-PFC connectivity in detail and provided a map of the hierarchical organization of the PFC. Gao et al. parcellated the PFC into 60 ROIs of similar volume (GaoROIs) and found no apparent correspondence between connectivity-based hierarchy and cytoarchitecture. Using GaoROIs (Fig. 4f), we corroborated the category enrichment profiles and the modules of spontaneous activity obtained with dataROIs (Extended Data Fig. 7e–h and Supplementary Table 7). To determine how spontaneous firing patterns relate to the detailed intra-PFC hierarchy proposed by Gao et al., we correlated the intra-PFC hierarchy score with the E-scores across GaoROIs (Fig. 4g,h and Extended Data Fig. 7i–p). Enrichment in low-rate, regular-firing units (category 1) was positively correlated with intra-PFC hierarchy (Fig. 4g), while enrichment in high-rate, bursty units (category 6) was negatively correlated to intra-PFC hierarchy (Extended Data Fig. 7n). Specifically, GaoROIs (19, 20, 41) located in PL displayed exceptionally high hierarchy scores and the strongest enrichment in unit category 1, while the GaoROI (23) located in the ventral part of ORBl featured the lowest hierarchy score and most prominent depletion in unit category 1 (Fig. 4g). Unfortunately, no hierarchy scores were available for ROIs located in ILA, where we had observed a particularly strong enrichment in unit category 1 (Fig. 4c). Overall, our results demonstrate that the positive correlation between enrichment in regular-firing unit categories (1–3) and connectivity-based hierarchy observed across cortical regions (Fig. 3) is replicated within the PFC across ROIs, indicating a general, scale-invariant link between enrichment in regular-firing units and hierarchy. Yet, as mentioned, the category enrichment profiles of cytoarchitecturally defined PFC subregions did not show an obvious relationship to cortical hierarchy (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 5). A partitioning scheme transcending the traditionally defined subregions might, therefore, better capture both activity and connectivity-based hierarchy in the PFC.

We addressed how sensory responses in the PFC map to cytoarchitecture by analyzing PFC unit activity related to presentation of 10-kHz tones (200 ms, 5–10-s random interstimulus intervals; dataset KI). To characterize tone responses, we extracted peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) of ww units in deep layers (n = 15,352 units; Fig. 5a). Each PSTH was normalized to the pre-stimulus period. The resulting response traces were clustered based on their temporal profile into tone response categories 1–8, labeled according to their average peak delay. Tone response categories differed in response onset time, amplitude and persistence (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 8a–c). Most units displayed flat or negative response traces (category 8). Units belonging to tone response categories 1–4 exhibited well-defined peaks and consistent response peak onsets. In contrast, units belonging to tone response categories 5–7 had variable peak onset latencies and persistent responses.

To map the different tone responses onto the PFC space, we calculated the tone response enrichment profiles for dataROIs. Units displaying the earliest responses (category 1) were enriched in anterior parts of ACAd and ORBvl and in parts of PL (Fig. 5c). Neither this response map nor the maps of the other response types (categories 2–8) obeyed cytoarchitectural boundaries (Extended Data Fig. 8d). Clustering the dataROIs based on their enrichment profiles into modules corroborated tone response heterogeneity within PFC subregions (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 8e,f). Furthermore, classifying units as either tone-responsive or nonresponsive (Zenith of event-based time-locked anomalies (ZETA) test32; Methods) confirmed that tone-responsive units were enriched in spatial patches distributed across the PFC (Fig. 5e).

Previous research has attributed cognitive processes to specific PFC subregions14. Our findings, however, show that spontaneous and tone response activity patterns defy these cytoarchitecturally defined subregions. To investigate how processes involved in goal-directed behavior map onto PFC space, we analyzed single-unit activity from the IBL decision-making task (dataset IBL), which includes sensory integration, decision-making and action execution31. Briefly, mice viewed a stimulus patch appearing on either the left or the right side of a screen and should turn a steering wheel to center the patch (left stimulus indicates a clockwise turn; right stimulus indicates a counterclockwise turn). Correct turns were rewarded with water, while incorrect turns were punished with white noise. Like the original study31, we focused on three task variables: (1) stimulus (0–100 ms after visual stimulus onset), (2) choice (100–0 ms before first wheel movement) and (3) feedback (0–200 ms after reward/noise delivery; Fig. 5f). Using a statistical procedure to isolate the individual task variables and account for spurious correlations31,33 (Methods), we identified units as ‘tuned' if their firing rate significantly differed between stimuli (left-versus-right stimulus position), choices (leading to clockwise-versus-counterclockwise wheel turns; Extended Data Fig. 9a) or feedback type (reward versus noise delivery).

Partitioning the PFC into ROIs each containing ~200 units from dataset IBL (IBL ROIs; Extended Data Fig. 9b,c), we analyzed enrichment of tuned units in IBL ROIs. Only 105 of 16,148 PFC units were tuned to the position of the visual stimulus, with a single IBL ROI in the MOs showing strong enrichment (Fig. 5g). Choice-tuned units (n = 1,109 units) were enriched in a spatially cohesive territory spanning central MOs, the FRP and the anterior parts of ACAd, ORBvl and PL; ILA, ORBm, ORBl and ACAv were consistently depleted in choice-tuned units (Fig. 5g). Feedback-tuned units (n = 2,868 units) were enriched in AId, FRP and anterior parts of MOs, ORBvl and PL, while they were depleted in ILA, ORBm and ACAd/ACAv. Overall, visually tuned IBL ROIs were embedded in the choice-tuned territory, which partially overlapped with the feedback-tuned territory. These overlaps could be interpreted as a spatial evolution of tuning following the temporal progression34,35,36 from stimulus to choice to action.

To determine the relation of tone responsiveness and task variables to connectivity-based hierarchy, we correlated enrichment in tuned and tone-responsive units with the intra-PFC hierarchy score across GaoROIs. Enrichment in choice-tuned units correlated strongly with intra-PFC hierarchy score (R = 0.48, P = 0.002; Fig. 5h and Extended Data Fig. 9d), whereas correlations were weak for visual tuning and absent for feedback tuning and tone responsiveness (Extended Data Fig. 9e–g).

We hypothesized that spontaneous firing properties reflect processing properties of local networks and thus evaluated the similarity of maps of tone response and task tuning to maps of spontaneous activity. To compare maps with distinct ROI partitioning (dataROIs for tone response and spontaneous activity; IBL ROIs for task variables), we rasterized the PFC flatmap into 311,563 pixels. For any given map, each pixel was assigned the E-score of the ROI covering the pixel, resulting in a vector with 311,563 E-score entries. The similarity between two maps was quantified as the cosine similarity between their E-score vectors. Although no pairs of activity maps showed strong overall congruence, several maps exhibited partial spatial overlap (Fig. 5i): the map of choice-tuned units (Fig. 5g) was most similar to the map of low-rate, regular-firing units (spontaneous category 1; Fig. 4c). This spatial similarity aligns with our finding that both enrichment in choice-tuned units (Fig. 5h) and enrichment in low-rate, regular-firing units (Fig. 4g) correlated positively with intra-PFC hierarchy. The map of feedback-tuned units was most similar to the map of high-rate, bursty units (spontaneous category 6), while the map of overall tone responsiveness (Fig. 5e) was most similar to the map of low-rate, bursty units (spontaneous category 8; Fig. 4d). We next established whether the observed spatial similarities between maps reflect associations between spontaneous firing properties and tone response/tuning properties at the single-unit level. We expected, for instance, that tone responsiveness is overrepresented in units with low-rate, bursty spontaneous firing. Surprisingly, we found that tone-responsive units (tone response categories 1–7) were more likely than expected to have high spontaneous firing rates (spontaneous categories 4–6; Fig. 5j). Conversely, units lacking clear positive tone responses (tone response category 8) tended to have low spontaneous firing rates (spontaneous categories 1–3, 7 and 8). Similarly, analysis of goal-directed task variables revealed that units with choice tuning, as well as units displaying feedback tuning, were associated with high-rate, Poissonian firing (spontaneous category 4; Fig. 5k).

In this study, we demonstrate that enrichment in units with low-rate, regular spontaneous firing is a hallmark of the PFC (Fig. 2) and a correlate of both cortical (Fig. 3) and intra-PFC (Fig. 4) hierarchy. These central findings are in line with research tying regular-firing patterns to computational processes supporting cognition, such as sustained input integration and stable representations37,38. Mechanistically, regular firing aligns with known PFC properties, including a high level of recurrent connectivity and ion channels with slow kinetics5,39,40. In apparent contradiction to this, we found that task-tuned units did not display low-rate, regular firing (Fig. 5). An explanation for this could be that regular-firing units support the emergence of task tuning in high-rate units within local networks.

Our results differ from Mochizuki et al.20, who reported near-random (Poisson) firing in the PFC. This is likely due to methodological differences, as Mochizuki et al. focused on in-task, nonstationary activity, analyzed very few units in rodents, pooled units across layers and waveform types and used different delineations of brain regions. In contrast, our analyses specifically focused on ww units in deep layers. Importantly, our enrichment score (E-score) reflects relative deviation from the sampled population; given the overrepresentation of PFC units in the dataset KI, we may even have underestimated how prominent the PFC's regular-firing signature actually is.

The consistent correlations between connectivity-based hierarchy and spontaneous activity across both dataset KI and dataset IBL Passive affirm a robust relationship between cortical hierarchy and spontaneous firing repertoire (Fig. 3). This activity–hierarchy correlation is in line with studies on mice, macaques and humans showing that spontaneous neuronal timescales correlate with connectivity-based hierarchy. In contrast, Siegle et al.23 found no such correlation in the mouse visual system, potentially because (i) their application of the timescale metric to single-unit activity might have been inadequate to capture the complexity of single-unit autocorrelations17, and (ii) spontaneous activity–hierarchy correlations may be absent within the mouse visual system.

Contributing to the ongoing efforts to map the mouse brain3,4,5,9,10,11,12,13, we here provide detailed activity-based maps of the PFC. While we observed that one spontaneous activity module aligned with the cytoarchitecturally defined ILA subregion, other modules did not correspond to single subregions. Likewise, maps of spontaneous activity patterns, tone responses and task variables did not align with PFC subregions. Feedback-tuned units were particularly enriched in the anterolateral part of MOs. This is consistent with previous findings that feedback tuning is mostly carried by licking in the IBL task31 and that the anterolateral part of MOs is implicated in licking37.

Choice-tuned units were enriched in a spatially cohesive, hitherto undefined territory, covering central MOs and anterior parts of several PFC subregions. Interestingly, choice tuning was, despite spatially overlapping with low-rate, regular spontaneous firing, overrepresented specifically in units with high spontaneous firing rates. This indicates that choice tuning and low-rate, regular firing—the two hallmarks of high hierarchy we identified here—are found in separate neuronal populations that overlap in space. As intra-PFC hierarchy is derived from intrinsic input and output connectivity10, our results thus suggest that connectivity, rather than cytoarchitecture, shapes the PFC's activity landscape. The discovery that a high spontaneous firing rate was associated not only with choice tuning, but also with responsiveness to tones and feedback tuning at the single-unit level, further suggests that spontaneous high firing rates, implying high excitability, predispose units to engage in sensory and cognitive processing.

Overall, our results highlight how distinct aspects of neuronal activity—spontaneous firing patterns, sensory responses and task-related tuning—contribute unique and complementary insights into the functional organization of the PFC. By linking spontaneous activity to connectivity-based hierarchy and uncovering how specific firing properties predispose neurons to engage in tone responsiveness and task tuning, we provide a multifaceted perspective on how network organization supports function in this region. Importantly, these findings challenge the traditional emphasis on cytoarchitecture, instead pointing to intrinsic connectivity as a primary organizing principle. Moving forward, expanding the range of tasks, stimuli and behavioral contexts will be essential to piece together the functional organization of the PFC. Our data-driven framework offers a scalable path forward, with broad applicability to other brain regions and species.

All procedures and experiments on animals were performed according to the guidelines of the Stockholm Municipal Committee for animal experiments and the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden (approval numbers 7362-2019 and 1535-2024). Adult wild-type mice (C57BL/6J, Charles River; 27 male and 39 female) aged 3–6 months were used. Animals were group-housed, up to five per cage, in a temperature-controlled (23 °C) and humidity-controlled (55%) environment in standard cages on a 12:12-h reversed light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water, unless placed on a water restriction schedule. All water-restricted mice were restricted to 85–90% of their initial body weight by administering 1 ml of water per day.

Adult mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3% for induction, then 1–2%). Buprenorphine (0.1 mg per kg body weight, subcutaneous (s.c.)), carprofen (5 mg per kg body weight, s.c.) and lidocaine (4 mg per kg body weight, s.c.) were administered. The body temperature was maintained at 37 °C by a heating pad. An ocular ointment (Viscotears, Alcon) was applied over the eyes. The head of the mouse was fixed in a stereotaxic apparatus (Kopf). Lidocaine (2%) was injected locally before skin incision. The skin overlying the cortex was removed; the skull was first cleaned with chlorhexidine and then gently scratched with a scalpel blade. A thin layer of glue was applied on the exposed skull. A lightweight metal head-post was fixed with lightcuring dental adhesive (OptiBond FL, Kerr) and cement (Tetric EvoFlow, Invoclar Vivadent). For extracellular recordings, a chamber was constructed by building a wall with dental cement along the coronal suture and the front of the skull. Brain regions were targeted using stereotaxic coordinates. After the surgery, the animal was returned to its home cage, and carprofen (5 mg per kg body weight, s.c.) was provided for postoperative pain relief 24 h following surgery.

Following surgery recovery, mice were handled and progressively habituated to the head-fixation procedure over a period of 3 to 4 days by increasing the head-restriction time from 15 min to 1 h. After habituation, the mice were engaged in distinct behavioral settings (see Supplementary Methods for details). For each behavioral setting, auditory stimuli (10-kHz pure tones) were delivered through earphones. Importantly, although the mice were engaged in various behavioral tasks, firing metric distributions were not significantly different across behavioral settings. For all behavioral settings, delivery of the auditory stimuli was controlled with custom-written computer routines using a National Instruments board (PCI-6221) interfaced through MATLAB (MathWorks).

For acute recordings, two to four small craniotomies (300–500 μm in diameter) were opened a few hours (>3 h) before the experiment to access the pre-marked targeted entry points (PFC: +2.20 to +1.60 mm AP, ±0.3 to ±1.5 mm ML; AUD: −3.20 mm AP, ±4.20 mm ML; CA1: −1.50 mm AP, ±1.6 mm ML; MOp: +1.90 mm to +1.50 mm AP, ±2.50 mm ML; SSp: −3.10 mm AP, ±2.80 mm ML). The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3% for induction, then 1–2%). Buprenorphine (0.1 mg per kg body weight, s.c.), carprofen (5 mg per kg body weight, s.c.) and lidocaine (4 mg per kg body weight, s.c.) were administered. The open craniotomy was covered with silicone sealant (Kwik-Cast, WPI), and the mouse was returned to its home cage for recovery.

The probes were coated with CM-DiI (Thermo Fisher), a fixable lipophilic dye for post hoc recovery of the recording location. The coating was achieved by holding a drop of CM-DiI at the end of a micropipette and repeatedly painting the probe shank with the drop, letting it dry, after which the probe appeared pink.

First, the reference electrode was connected to a silver wire positioned over the pia in a craniotomy using a micromanipulator. Then, the probe(s) was (were) lowered gradually (speed ~20 μ s−1) with a micromanipulator (uMp-4, Sensapex), using 0° to 20° angles, until the tip reached a depth of ~3,800–4,200 μm under the surface of the pia. The probe(s) was (were) allowed to sit in the brain for 20–30 min before the recordings started. A total of 99 probes were lowered with a maximum of 3 probes inserted simultaneously.

Extracellular potentials were recorded using Neuropixels probes (phase 3B Option 1, IMEC) with 383 recording sites along a single shank covering 3,800 μm in depth or with Neuronexus probes (A1x32-Poly2-10mm-50s-177) with 32 recording sites along a single 750-μm shank. The spike-band data were digitized with a sampling frequency of 30 kHz with a gain of 500 while the local field potential (LFP) band data were digitized with a sampling frequency of 2.5 kHz with a gain of 250. The digitized signal was transferred to our data acquisition system (a PXIe acquisition module PXI-Express chassis: PXIe-1071 and MXI-Express interface: PCIe-8381 and PXIe-8381, National Instruments for Neuropixels recordings or an Open Ephys acquisition board for Neuronexus probes), written to disk using SpikeGLX (B. Karsh, Janelia) for Neuropixels probes or Open Ephys GUI for Neuronexus probes, and stored on a local server for later analyses. The action potential signals (‘spike band') were filtered between 0.3 Hz and 10 kHz and amplified. The LFP signals (‘LFP band') were filtered between 0.5 Hz and 500 Hz.

After recording, probes were cleaned for 30 min with a fresh Tergazyme solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and rinsed with distilled water overnight.

At the end of the last recording session, each mouse was deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital (60 mg per kg body weight; intraperitoneal), and then transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. The brain was removed and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× phosphate buffer.

Brain sections were cut on a vibratome at a thickness of 400 μm (Leica VT1000, Leica Microsystems). Slices were repeatedly washed in phosphate buffer and cleared using ‘CUBIC reagent 1' (25 wt% urea, 25 wt% N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-hydroxypropyl) ethylenediamine, and 15 wt% polyethylene glycol mono-p-isooctylphenyl ether/Triton X-100) for two days. After repeated washing in phosphate buffer, slices were incubated with DAPI (1:50,000 dilution) for one day at room temperature. Slices were then re-washed in phosphate buffer and submerged in ‘CUBIC reagent 2' (50 wt% sucrose, 25 wt% urea, 10 wt% 2,20,20'-nitrilotriethanol, and 0.1% vol/vol% Triton X-100) for further clearing. Slices were mounted on customized 400-μm-thick slides using CUBIC reagent 2 solution and covered with 1.5-mm cover glasses. Blue and red channels were imaged at 4× magnification using a Zeiss 800 or 880 confocal microscope and exported via ZEN black (2.1 SP3 v14.0). For each brain section, 6 to 7 z-stacks spaced by 50 μm were obtained and downsampled to 10-μm resolution. The z-stacks containing the probe's red fluorescent signal (DiI) were registered in the Allen Institute Common Coordinate Framework (CCFv3) and the probe position was estimated using the accompanying ‘SHARP-Track' pipeline (https://github.com/cortex-lab/allenCCF; Supplementary Fig. 1). The electrode locations along the probe were transformed into CCFv3 space based on the orientation and position of the probe track. A unit's location was assigned based on the location of the electrode where the unit had the highest waveform amplitude.

The high-pass-filtered spike-band data were preprocessed using common-average referencing: the channel's median was subtracted to remove baseline offset fluctuations, then the median across channels was also subtracted from each channel to remove artifacts.

The data were spike sorted with Kilosort2.0 (https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort/releases/tag/v2.0/). Clusters of waveforms were manually curated using the phy2 GUI (https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy/). During manual curation, clusters of waveforms showing near-zero amplitudes, non-physiological waveforms, inconsistent waveform shapes and/or refractory period violations were discarded. The remaining units were compared with spatially neighboring clusters. Units showing similar waveforms, clear common refractory periods and putative drift patterns were subjected to a merge attempt: if the cluster resulting from merging was showing consistent waveforms and a clear refractory period in its autocorrelogram, the merged cluster was used. Clusters were split when the principal features of waveforms indicated distinct clusters, and two or more groups of waveforms could be clearly identified. Double-counted spikes were removed.

Automatic spike sorting (Kilosort2.0) followed by manual curation in Phy2 yielded an initial dataset of 34,642 units. We first excluded 24 recordings containing prominent LFP artifacts, reducing the dataset to 29,782 units. Next, we applied the following inclusion criteria based on Siegle et al.23: (1) ISI violation ratio < 0.1 and (2) presence of a plausible spike waveform. Presence ratio > 0 and amplitude cutoff < 0.1 were also checked and enforced (Supplementary Fig. 2). In addition, units were required to have a sufficient number of ISIs (≥4) in at least 12 separate 3-s epochs to allow reliable estimation of the memory metric. Applying these criteria resulted in a dataset KI of 24,248 high-quality units (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Spike times were corrected for temporal drift during the recording time (~10 ms h−1) relative to a clock signal registered independently by the PXIe acquisition module and the PCI-6221 card logging the behavioral signals. First, the temporal drift between the two devices was measured for each recording. Second, a linear regression was applied to correct the behavioral timestamps relative to the spike times. Spikes within an interval from 1 s before saturation onset to 1 s after offset were removed. Spike times were saved in Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files for subsequent analysis.

In Neuropixels recordings, we defined the EMG from the high-frequency (1–10 kHz) muscular tone (neck muscles), picked up by the reference electrode (situated, for example, over the visual cortex) with zero time lag30,38,39. EMG signals were extracted as the band-pass filtered (ellipsoid band-pass filter with a lower and upper cutoff frequency of 1 kHz and 10 kHz, respectively) median signal across all the Neuropixels probe active channels (common noise source). EMG signals were downsampled to 1 kHz and stored in NWB files for further analysis.

Pairwise correlations were quantified with the Pearson correlation coefficient (R). Significance of correlations was tested under the null hypothesis of zero correlation, assuming bivariate normality. All P values reported are two sided. Effects of neuron type on spontaneous firing metrics and differences in response onset time across unit categories were assessed using linear mixed-effect models. Enrichment was assessed using custom shuffling statistics. Responsiveness of single units was assessed using a ZETA test32. Details concerning linear mixed-effect models, enrichment statistics and the ZETA test are provided in ‘Data analysis'. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. Data were not anonymized for analysis. Recording sessions were excluded from any further analysis if (1) the presence of slow waves in the LFP and up-and-down states in cortical activity indicated that the session was dominated by sleep-like states, (2) the abundance of artifacts in the LFP made such assessment impossible, or (3) experiments involved licking and it was not possible to reliably detect licking from LFP artifacts or the piezo element. Following these criteria, 24 recordings were excluded in total.

Unless stated otherwise, continuous variables are reported as the median and interquartile range (IQR, 25th–75th percentiles) in the following.

In 18 of the 99 recording sessions in the dataset KI, mice could lick to obtain water rewards following the tone stimuli. Licking requires motor action, which could influence firing patterns. Licking also occurred outside the reward window and could thus affect not only tone response epochs but also spontaneous epochs. To improve comparability of patterns across sessions, licking periods were detected and both spontaneous and tone response epochs overlapping with licking periods were excluded. If available, licking was detected using a piezoelectric sensor. Otherwise, licking was detected as artifacts in LFPs (LFPs downsampled to 500 Hz with a polyphase filter) using independent component analysis. Lick periods invariably presented as a single independent component displaying a characteristic, rhythmic, saw-tooth like pattern with close to uniform weight contribution across the electrodes of a probe, that is, the lick artifacts were similarly strong across electrodes. Periods of lick artifacts in the lick component were detected using a semiautomatic procedure, which involved manually setting an amplitude threshold for each recording, detecting threshold crossings and manual curation that allowed deletion of false positives and inclusion of false negative detections, respectively.

Sleep-like periods27 were detected per recording session, as illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 1c. A mean firing rate vector across all cortical spikes (10 ms bin width) was computed and smoothed with a Savitzky–Golay filter (11 pts window width; order, 3) to obtain the mean smooth firing rate vector FR(mean). Two thresholds were defined, ϴgmean, the geometric mean of FR(mean) and ϴtrough = 0.2 × ϴgmean. Periods when FR(mean) was below ϴtrough for longer than 5 ms were detected as ‘troughs'. To obtain ‘off periods', troughs were extended forward and backward in time until FR(mean) reached above ϴgmean. Off periods formed the basis of sleep-like activity. Successive off periods closer than 1.5 s were merged. Around merged off periods and individually occurring off periods 1 s and 0.3 s, respectively, were included into the sleep-like periods. All sleep-like periods were reviewed visually and consistently coincided with a flat EMG, indicating absence of movement, and large-amplitude, irregular, slow-wave activity in the LFP typical of non-rapid eye movement sleep and drowsiness27. Detection of sleep-like periods was only performed for the dataset KI, as sessions of this dataset consistently featured a sufficient number of cortical units to detect collective off periods. Sleep-like episodes occupied 6% (IQR, 0–18%) of the time in recording sessions.

In the dataset KI, spontaneous epochs were selected as time windows from 3 s before tone onset until tone onset. All epochs containing licking (see ‘Detection and exclusion of licking periods') and where saturation occurred in the spike band were excluded. Sleep-like epochs were defined as all episodes overlapping with sleep-like periods (see ‘Detection of sleep-like periods'). Sleep-like epochs are only featured in Extended Data Fig. 1c–e. All other analyses of spontaneous activity are based on ‘spontaneous active' epochs occurring with at least 1 s of temporal distance to sleep-like episodes. Recording sessions contained 227 (IQR, 172–284) spontaneous active epochs and 19 (IQR, 1–84) sleep-like epochs.

The dataset IBL Passive is a subset of the dataset IBL and comprises 303 recordings that contain, in addition to task activity, spontaneous activity (IBL Neuropixels Brainwide Map31, accessed February 2024 from https://registry.opendata.aws/ibl-brain-wide-map/). A 5-min block of spontaneous activity was recorded after about 68 min (IQR, 58–80 min), toward the end of a session. We obtained spontaneous epochs by splitting the 5-min block into 99 epochs lasting 3 s each.

We selected a pre-stimulus epoch of 3 s, as the inter-tone intervals varied randomly between 5 s and 10 s, and tone-evoked responses were observed to dissipate within 2 s after tone onset. Analyses based on shorter pre-stimulus epochs of 2 s or 1 s were also performed, but fewer units could be included due to insufficient data (number of spikes) for reliably estimating activity patterns in these shorter epochs. However, when using shorter epochs, results remained qualitatively consistent, validating the robustness of our findings.

In the dataset KI, epochs used to compute tone response traces were selected as time windows starting 2 s before tone onset until 0.7 s after tone onset. All epochs containing licking, sleep-like periods, and where saturation occurred in the spike band were excluded. Recording sessions contained 188 (IQR: 86–228) tone response epochs. The number of tone response epochs per recording was lower than the number of spontaneous active epochs per recording because licking disproportionately occurred during tone response time windows, which coincided with reward presentation in some recordings (see ‘Detection and exclusion of licking periods').

A maximum of 2,000 randomly selected 2.8-ms waveforms per unit were extracted from the spike band. A total of 82 sample points (–1.4 ms and +1.4 ms) around each spike time provided by Kilosort2 were collected per waveform. The mean waveforms per unit were obtained by averaging across all collected waveforms per unit. Each mean waveform was converted from 16-bit analog values (i) to voltage values (V) according to equation (1):

With Vmax = 0.6 V, Imax = 512 bit and gain = 500, where the factor (Vmax) ÷ (Imax × gain) is the least significant byte. The mean waveforms were then interpolated by a factor of 1,000 (one-dimensional linear interpolation) and baseline corrected. A custom script was used to detect and compute the main peaks, amplitude values, the polarity of the waveform, the main slopes and the amplitude ratio of the interpolated mean waveform per unit. Only the peak-to-trough duration was used for waveform classification. The valley observed in the distribution of peak-to-trough durations (Fig. 1h) was used to label units as nw units (peak-to-trough duration < 0.38 ms), ww units (peak-to-trough duration > 0.43 ms) and unclassified units (0.38 ms ≤ peak-to-trough duration ≤ 0.43 ms) in accordance with previous studies30.

Spontaneous activity metrics were extracted from spontaneous epochs (see ‘Epoch selection'). For each unit, the three metrics characterizing firing rate, burstiness and memory were first calculated per epoch. The firing rate metric log10FR was computed as the decadic logarithm of the number of spikes in an epoch divided by epoch duration (3 s). The burstiness and memory metrics were based on ISIs and defined according to ref. 28. In brief, burstiness ‘B' can be understood as the coefficient of variation of ISIs normalized to a range between –1 (completely regular; s.d.(ISI)«mean(ISI)) and 1 (maximally bursty; s.d.(ISI)»mean(ISI)) and was calculated according to equation (2):

with mean(ISI) and s.d.(ISI) being the mean and standard deviation of ISIs, respectively. Memory ‘M' was defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between successive ISIs as given by equation (3):

Burstiness and memory were only computed in epochs with at least six spikes available (corresponding to at least four ISIs). Units with fewer than 12 epochs with at least six spikes were excluded from further analyses. To characterize a unit's firing pattern, each of the three metrics was averaged across epochs. Note that calculating burstiness and memory per epoch before averaging has the advantage that the distribution-based burstiness and the sequence-based memory can both be faithfully computed. The metric LvR proposed by Shinomoto et al.40 was designed to mitigate vulnerability of ISI-based irregularity metrics to slow fluctuations in firing rates when computing ISI-based metrics over longer stretches of time. Yet, given the brief and stationary (stimulation free) character of the spontaneous epochs in the dataset KI, burstiness and memory are a more informative variable choice than LvR as these metrics allow to address the distributional and sequential character of bursting independently of each other.

Tone responses were extracted from tone response epochs, which spanned an interval from 2 s before the stimulus (‘prestim-window') to 0.7 s after the stimulus (‘poststim-window'; see ‘Epoch selection').

For each unit, spikes times relative to tone onset were collected from all tone response epochs to construct a firing rate PSTH (0.5 ms bin width, Fig. 5a). The PSTH was smoothed by convolving it with a Gaussian kernel (10 ms standard deviation of the kernel; 80 ms width of convolution window). Units with an overall average firing rate below 0.1 Hz across all tone response epochs or an average firing rate below 0.1 Hz across all prestim-windows were excluded from further analyses. To obtain a trace reflecting relative stimulus-induced rate changes, each unit's smoothed PSTH was z-scored to its prestim-window through subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation across the prestim-window. Tone response traces were defined as the smoothed, z-scored PSTHs extending from stimulus onset to 0.65 s after onset.

To facilitate later classification of tone responses (see ‘SOM analysis' and ‘Hierarchical clustering analyses' below), the dimensionality of the response traces was reduced using principal component analysis (PCA). Tone response traces from all units (both nw and ww units pooled) were collected into a data matrix (dimensions: (number of units, number of response trace time points)). Each time point in the data matrix was mean centered. PCA was performed on the time points. The top eight principal components, explaining together over 95% of the variance, were retained. The dot product of a unit's original tone response trace and the principal components resulted in eight scores summarizing the tone response trace of a unit.

We closely followed the methods of single-unit analyses used in International Brain Laboratory31, where a comprehensive description of the experiment and its statistical evaluation can be found. For our analyses, which were limited to PFC ww units from deep layers, the dataset IBL provided 16,148 units from 66 recordings in 29 mice.

We assessed tuning to three task variables: visual stimulus, choice and feedback. Each task variable could adopt two alternative task values (visual stimulus: left versus right, choice: counterclockwise versus clockwise, feedback: reward versus noise). Depending on whether the visual stimulus was shown on the left or right, mice had to perform a counterclockwise or clockwise turn of a wheel to obtain a reward. Only trials where the first wheel movement occurred within 0.08 s to 2 s after stimulus onset were included. The task was structured into blocks. The first block had a 50:50 distribution of left/right stimuli, while subsequent blocks alternated between left-biased and right-biased distributions (80:20). Each block contained between 20 and 100 trials.

The aim was to determine, for each unit and task variable, whether the firing rates were significantly higher for one task value as compared to the other, while controlling for the influence of other task variables and spurious correlations due to changes of a unit's firing rate during the experiment41. Firing rates were computed in the analysis windows shown in Fig. 5f. To assess, for example, tuning to choice, firing rates between trials with counterclockwise versus clockwise turns were compared. These comparisons were made within unique condition combinations, defined by the same visual stimulus side and block identity. For each combination, trials were ranked by firing rate and a Mann–Whitney U statistic comparing the two task values (clockwise versus counterclockwise) was computed. Then a combined U statistic across all unique condition combinations was calculated. Correspondingly, when evaluating visual stimulus tuning and feedback tuning the choice value was kept fixed.

To assess significance, the combined U statistic was compared to a null distribution of 2,000 surrogate U statistics generated by shuffling the task values within each condition combination. A unit was considered significantly tuned to a task variable if both the combined-condition U test yielded a P value < 0.05, and a standard (unconditioned) Mann–Whitney U test yielded a P value < 0.001.

Enrichment flatmaps, quantifying the enrichment in significantly tuned units in IBL ROIs, were computed for each task variable (see ‘PFC flatmap projection and parcellation' and ‘Enrichment statistics'). Note that the dataset IBL Passive provided only 1,854 units (24 recordings; 18 mice) in the PFC, which we deemed insufficient for a robust ROI-based enrichment analysis. Yet, the mutual enrichment between spontaneous activity and task variables shown in Fig. 5k is of necessity based on the dataset IBL Passive, for which spontaneous activity was available along with task data.

A SOM is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm42 used here to summarize a set of n-dimensional feature vectors into a two-dimensional grid of nodes. Each node represents an n-dimensional prototype vector (visualized as a hexagon). After training the SOM, similar prototype vectors become neighbors on the SOM grid. Separate SOMs were constructed for the following data selections of the dataset KI: (i) spontaneous activity of ww units, (ii) spontaneous activity of nw units (iii) and tone responses of ww units.

To obtain input for training the SOM, each unit j was represented by a feature vector. For spontaneous activity (i and ii), the feature vector xj consisted of the three spontaneous firing metrics: xj = [log10FR, burstiness, memory]; see ‘Extraction of spontaneous activity metrics'. For tone response activity (iii), the feature vector comprised eight principal component scores (PCSs) summarizing the tone response trace of each unit: xj = [PCSj,1,PCSj,2,…PCSj,8]; see ‘Extraction and post-processing of tone responses'. Feature vectors were collected from all units in the respective data selection. Each feature was standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation across all included units.

The number of nodes in the SOM was manually determined to balance a detailed representation of the input space (requiring more nodes) with preservation of neighborhood relationships and a compact visualization (requiring fewer nodes). The shape (x–y dimensions) of the SOM and initialization of nodes were determined using the linear initialization method suggested by Kohonen43. This involved performing a PCA on the input feature vectors and setting the height and width of the SOM proportional to the ratio of the two largest eigenvalues.

The SOM was trained using the batch training method and the neighborhood functions provided by Kind and Brunner44. In brief, each feature vector (summarizing a unit's characteristics) was first assigned to the SOM node with the closest prototype vector in Euclidean space, referred to as the best matching node (BMN). The prototype vectors of the BMNs and their neighboring nodes were then updated to more closely resemble their assigned input feature vectors, using a Gaussian neighborhood function. Over the 200 training iterations, the neighborhood radius was gradually reduced, leading to more localized and subtle updates to the prototype vectors. After the SOM was trained, each unit was assigned to (that is, represented by) its BMN.

IBL data were projected on the SOM trained on the respective subset of dataset KI by extracting the same features from units of the dataset IBL Passive and standardizing them to the mean and standard deviation of the features of the respective subset of dataset KI. As for the dataset KI, a BMN on the SOM derived from the dataset KI was then assigned to each IBL unit.

The SOM here serves as the first step in a two-step clustering procedure (with the second step detailed in ‘Hierarchical clustering analyses'). Each prototype vector can be viewed as representing a cluster of similar units. This coarse graining into prototype vectors makes subsequent clustering less sensitive to outliers. Additionally, SOMs are well suited for heuristic approaches like ours, as they offer a compact visualization of similarity structures and can accommodate and elucidate nonlinear relationships between features (metrics). Furthermore, new data can be readily projected on existing SOMs (as done here for the dataset IBL Passive), which increases reproducibility and comparability of results across datasets.

Hierarchical trees were computed for three types of data: (i) SOM nodes (for example, see Fig. 2c and a detailed illustration in Extended Data Fig. 3b), (ii) PFC flatmap ROIs (for example, Fig. 4e) and (iii) enrichment matrices (for example, Fig. 2g), using Ward's agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm45.

Before clustering, all features were standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation across samples. The features used for constructing the hierarchical tree varied by type of data; SOM nodes were represented by prototype vectors (‘SOM analysis') and PFC flatmap ROIs and enrichment matrices by enrichment profiles (‘Enrichment statistics'). In the case of enrichment matrices, the hierarchical tree was used solely to order the matrix rows for better visualization.

For SOM nodes and PFC flatmap ROIs, the hierarchical tree was cut at a specific level to define clusters representing categories of spontaneous and tone response activity (for example, Figs. 2c and Fig. 5b) or modules of spontaneous and tone response activity (for example, Figs. 4e and Fig. 5d), respectively.

Specifically, in the case of spontaneous/response categories obtained by clustering the SOM nodes, units inherited their category from their BMN. Repeating analyses using various numbers of unit activity categories, that is, SOM clusters (ww: 5–10 categories; nw: 4–8 categories), led to qualitatively similar results, validating the robustness of our approach.

The number of clusters (that is implicitly the threshold for cutting the hierarchical tree) was manually determined according to the Thorndike criterion46 and the Dunn index47 (for example, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 3a), aiming for a balance between cluster compactness and separation and for summarizing the data with the smallest number of clusters that aligned with both criteria.

To assess the validity of unit categories, we tested how stable unit categories were when subdividing data into blocks and evaluating unit categories per block. Obtaining spontaneous unit categories per block: Obtaining the categories of a unit per block involved three steps: (i) allocating epochs to each block, (ii) calculating spontaneous metrics per block, and (iii) categorizing the unit in each block. (i) In experimental settings where there was an inherent block structure, spontaneous epochs belonging to a certain inherent block were used. Experimentally defined blocks contained 50 or 100 epochs. Blocks of 100 epochs were split in two. In experimental settings without block structure, epochs were allocated to blocks of around 50 epochs. There were 5 (IQR: 3–5) blocks available per recording. Epochs with licking or sleep-like activity (see ‘Epoch selection') were discarded from each block. For each unit, blocks with fewer than 12 epochs with at least six spikes were excluded from further analyses. Per unit, blocks analyzed contained 36 (IQR: 23–49) epochs for ww units and 43 (IQR: 29–51) epochs for nw units, respectively. (ii) For each unit, metrics were extracted per epoch and then averaged per block, as detailed in ‘Extraction of spontaneous activity metrics'. (iii) For each unit, the three spontaneous metrics (features) describing a block were standardized to the mean and standard deviation of the respective original dataset used to compute the reference SOM (‘SOM analysis'). Block-wise ww unit data were standardized to and projected on the SOM derived from the original (full epoch) ww dataset. Block-wise nw unit data were standardized to and projected on the SOM derived from the original (full epoch) nw dataset. After standardizing, the BMN of each unit was identified on the respective SOM. The block-specific category of a unit was inherited from the BMN (‘Hierarchical clustering analyses').

For each unit u and transition t from one block to the next, we calculated a transition matrix Mu,t (dimensions: k × k; where k is the number of categories available for a dataset, that is k = 8 for ww units, and k = 5 for the nw units). This binary matrix contains exactly one nonzero entry at the row corresponding to the category the unit had in the current block and the column corresponding to the category the unit transitioned to in the next block. For each transition, the unit-wise transition matrices Mu,t were summed across all units, resulting in a k × k transition matrix Mt for each transition t (t = 1 corresponds to the transition from block 1 to block 2, t = 2 corresponds to the transition from block 2 to block 3, and so on). Each entry mi,j,t represents the number of times units of a certain category i in a block transitioned to a certain category j in the following block during a transition t. We defined the stability value per transition as the sum of the diagonal elements in Mt divided by the sum of all the entries in Mt. The stability value thus expresses the fraction of units that retained their category in a transition. In Fig. 2e, the stability value is contrasted with the chance stability expected from the marginal distributions of Mt.

To assess how stable individual categories were and which categories preferentially transitioned to which other categories, we summed transition matrices Mt across transitions to obtain an overall k × k transition count matrix M (Extended Data Fig. 3d) and analyzed various matrices derived from M. The transition probability matrix P was obtained by dividing the entries of a row i in M by the sum of the row entries, such that each row sums to 1 (Extended Data Fig. 3d, third panel, rows and columns reversed for visualization). Here, each entry pi,j gives the probability of transitioning to category j in the next block given category i was assigned in the current block. Evaluating stability from P has the disadvantage that categories more abundantly present in the dataset will appear more stable purely by chance. Therefore, we also considered the observed-to-expected ratio matrix O (Extended Data Fig. 3d, last panel). For this, we first defined an expected transition count matrix E derived from the marginal distributions of M (Extended Data Fig. 3d, second panel). An entry ei,j in E is defined as (Ri × Cj)/n, with Ri being the row total count of category i, Cj the column total of category j, and n the grand total of counts of M. O was obtained by dividing M by E. Each entry oi,j gives thus the ratio of the observed count and the expected count. This display accentuates the stability of overall small categories yet underemphasizes the stability of large categories.

To overcome the interpretative limitations of P and O, we developed the coincidence coefficient matrix X (Fig. 2f). We defined the coincidence coefficient xi,j as given by equation (4):

The coincidence coefficient ranges from –1 to 1. A value of –1 indicates that a transition never happens, 0 indicates that the transition happens as often as expected by chance, and 1 indicates that the transition happens as often as possible (relative to the size of the smallest category considered for the transition, that is min(Ri,Cj)).

The need to control for sampling differences between groups (for example, groups of animals undergoing different behavioral settings) necessitated a statistical approach beyond fractional composition to determine whether a certain attribute c (for example, an activity-based unit category) is disproportionately frequent or rare in a statistical population r (for example, all units in a certain brain region). To avoid biases introduced by group-specific sampling, we developed an enrichment statistic that uses group-level shuffling (see Extended Data Fig. 3e for an illustration of the procedure described here).

For each group g counting how often an attribute c appears within a population r generates a group-specific coincidence count matrix Xg (dimensions: n × m; where n is the number of populations and m is the number of attributes). Each entry xr,c,g represents the number of times c occurred in r for group g. Summing these matrices across all k groups produces the overall n × m coincidence matrix X, with xr,c = xr,c,1 + xr,c,2 + …. + xr,c,k.

To estimate the coincidences expected by chance while controlling for group sampling biases, r–c combinations are shuffled (dissociated and randomly re-associated) within each group, generating a surrogate dataset j. The shuffling is repeated 1,000 times, creating 1,000 surrogate datasets. For each surrogate dataset, the process of obtaining X (described above) is repeated, leading to a group-specific surrogate coincidence matrix Sg,j and through summing over groups to an overall matrix Sj. Ultimately, all 1,000 Sj are combined into an n × m × 1,000 surrogate matrix S.

The E-score er,c for each r–c combination is calculated by standardizing the original coincidence count xr,c to the distribution of the 1,000 surrogate counts in sr,c,1:1,000, as given by equation (5):

E-scores for all r–c combinations are collected in the n × m enrichment matrix E.

The significance of an E-score (P value, Pr,c) is obtained from the fraction of surrogate counts sr,c,1:1,000 falling below (fr,c,−) or exceeding (fr,c,+) the original coincidence count xr,c: Pr,c = 1 – max(fr,c,−,fr,c,+).

Category enrichment statistics of (sub)regions and PFC flatmap ROIs (for example, Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 7c), as well as the mutual enrichment of spontaneous activity and tone response categories at single-unit level (Fig. 5j), were group-controlled for behavioral settings. The layer-based category enrichment statistic (Extended Data Fig. 3f) was controlled for combinations of behavioral settings and brain (sub)regions, that is, each unique combination of a sub(region) and a behavioral setting constituted a separate group g.

To evaluate mutual enrichment between spontaneous activity categories and tone response categories (Fig. 5j), as well as between spontaneous activity categories and task variables (Fig. 5k), each spontaneous activity category was treated as the statistical population r, and each tone response category or task variable as the attribute c.

For a compact 2D representation of the PFC, we used the flatmap kindly provided by Gao et al.10. Each unit was positioned on the flatmap by projecting the 3D stereotactic coordinates (AP, ML, DL) from the unit's recording site (where the unit's waveform exhibited the highest amplitude) into the corresponding (u,v) coordinates of the flatmap.

To generate statistically comparable ROIs that respected subregion boundaries, we parcellated cytoarchitecturally defined subregions of the PFC flatmap into ROIs (dataROIs for dataset KI, IBL ROIs for dataset IBL), each containing a similar number of units (dataset KI, Extended Data Fig. 7a; dataset IBL, Extended Data Fig. 9c). This parcellation was based on deep-layer units, aiming for approximately 200 units per ROI. The subregion FRP, which contained fewer than 200 units in total, was not subdivided further. All other subregions were subdivided as follows: The number of ROIs n for each subregion was determined by n = ((unit count in a subregion)/200). The (u,v) coordinates of the units contained in the subregion were then clustered into n groups using a constrained k-means algorithm48 with a target range of 160–240 units per ROI as the size constraint for each cluster. The subregion was then parcellated using a Voronoi diagram49 based on the cluster centers, such that a ROI was defined as the space closest to a common cluster center.

To test for responsiveness of single units to tones and estimate the onset of tone responses, we used the parameter-free ZETA test32. We analyzed the 700-ms tone response time windows following tone onset and obtained a two-sided P value and the response onset time (the time after which half of the response peak is reached) for each unit. Units with a P value < 0.01 were considered responsive to tones.

To estimate the effect of neuron type on each spontaneous firing metric (log10FR, burstiness and memory), we fitted linear mixed-effect (LME) regression models with unit type (categorical variable: ww or nw) as a fixed effect and mouse as random effect50, as shown in equation (6):

Significance of the effects and interactions was assessed with post hoc F tests51 using the Kenward–Roger method for degree-of-freedom adjustment52 and Tukey's method for multiple-comparison correction. We also used LME analysis to estimate the effect of epoch type (categorical variable ‘active' or ‘sleep-like') on each firing metric with the model in equation (7):

To estimate the correlation between firing metrics, we fitted LME models for each pair of metrics (Metric1 and Metric2) with mouse as random effect as given by equation (8):

The correlation between any two variables is reported as the marginal coefficient of determination53.

a, b Count, per brain region (a) and per PFC subregion (b), of all high-quality, manually sorted, single units included in the dataset KI. c, Excluding ‘sleep-like' periods. Gray horizontal bars indicate 3 s epochs of spontaneous activity directly preceding tone presentation (200 ms, orange bar); black vertical line: tone onset. The left side exemplifies spontaneous epochs included in analysis; the right side exemplifies spontaneous sleep-like epochs excluded from analysis. Any 3 s epoch of spontaneous activity temporally overlapping with a sleep-like period was excluded. Sleep-like periods were identified by the presence of ‘off' periods (blue vertical bars). Off periods were defined as drops in FR(mean) below the 20% threshold and extended forward and backward to when FR(mean) reached above its geometric mean. Off periods are accompanied by high-amplitude LFP waves, and sleep-like periods in general coincide with large-amplitude, highly, variable LFP. Time periods neighboring off periods (light blue shadings) were excluded as well (Methods). Top to bottom, Spike raster plot of the single units recorded with the probe whose location is shown in Fig. 1b. FR(mean): the smoothed firing rate averaged across cortical units (bin = 10 ms). Blue solid horizontal line: the geometric mean of FR(mean); blue dashed horizontal line: a threshold corresponding to 20% of the geometric mean of FR(mean). Colored traces of LFPs from the recording site situated centrally in the respective PFC subregion. Concurrent electromyogram (EMG). d, Distributions of the firing metrics log10FR, burstiness, and memory for ww units in included (black) and sleep-like excluded (light blue) 3 s epochs of spontaneous activity. Statistics: mixed-effect regression, two-sided p-values corrected for multiple comparisons as described in Methods. e, Same as d for nw units. f, Correlation between firing rate, burstiness, and memory across all ww units. Marginal coefficient of determination (R2m) values are shown above the diagonal, the respective p-values are shown below the diagonal. n.s.: non-significant, *** p < 0.001, mixed-effect regression. g, Two-dimensional histogram showing, across all ww units, the relationship between firing rate and burstiness (left), firing rate and memory (middle), and memory and burstiness (right). h, i, Same as f and g for nw units. *** p < 0.001, mixed-effect regression. Data: dataset KI, all units across brain (sub)regions and layers, n = 24,248 units; a dataset KI, all units across subregions and layers of the PFC, n = 12,674 units; b dataset KI, ww units, all brain (sub)regions and layers, n = 19,186 units with sufficient number of included 3 s epochs; d black, f, g dataset KI, ww units, all brain (sub)regions and layers, n = 11,599 units with sufficient number of excluded 3 s epochs; d blue dataset KI, nw units, all brain (sub)regions and layers, n = 4,200 units with sufficient number of included 3 s epochs; e black, h, i dataset KI, nw units, all brain (sub)regions and layers, n = 2,549 units with sufficient number of excluded 3 s epochs; e blue.

a, U-matrix visualizing the distance between neighboring nodes of the SOM trained on ww units (Fig. 2a). In the U-matrix, an additional interpolating node is placed between each pair of neighboring (original) nodes. The interpolating node displays in color the Euclidean distance between the pair's standardized metric vectors. The original SOM nodes are colored based on the average Euclidean distance value of all their surrounding interpolating nodes. b, Diversity of units assigned to each SOM node in terms of recording probe. Each pie chart (one pie chart/SOM node) reflects the range of different recording probes contributing units assigned to the node. A piece of the pie reflects the fraction of ww units assigned to the respective node that originate from a specific probe. The dataset KI holds 99 recording probes in total. c, Quantization error (QError) indicating how well ww units of different PFC subregions were represented on the SOM. The QError is defined as the Euclidean distance between a unit's metrics vector and the metrics vector of the SOM node the unit is assigned to. A lower QError indicates better representation. Dots: median, vertical lines: 25th to 75th percentiles. d, Same as c but QErrors for the PFC overall (black) and other brain regions (gray). e, Count of ww units (all layers) assigned to each SOM node for different brain regions (for PFC see Fig. 2b). Orange contours delineate the unit categories defined in Fig. 2c. f, Count of ww units in deep layers (L5–6) assigned to each SOM node for PFC subregions. Data: dataset KI, ww units, brain (sub)regions, all layers, n = 19,186 units; a, b, d, e. dataset KI, ww units, all PFC subregions and layers, n = 10,413 units; c. dataset KI, PFC ww units, deep layers (L5–6), n = 9,319 units; f.

a, Criteria for determining a suitable number of clusters for partitioning the SOM trained on ww units (Fig. 2a,c). Red dashed line indicates the eight clusters used. Top, Euclidean distance in standardized metric space between the last pair of clusters joined as a function of the number of clusters (categories) defined when hierarchically clustering SOM nodes (read graph from right to left). Lower values indicate more homogenous clusters47. Bottom, Dunn index as a function of the number of clusters. The Dunn index is the ratio between minimal between-cluster distance and maximal within-cluster distance, with a higher Dunn index implying more compact and well-separated clusters48. b, Hierarchical clustering (ward linkage) of SOM nodes. Left, dendrogram displaying the hierarchical relationship of the eight unit categories partitioning the SOM in Fig. 2c (same coloring). Right, partitioning of the SOM when opting for four to seven clusters. Coloring follows the respective main branch on the left. c, Percentage distribution of the ww unit category labels computed per block (obtained when splitting unit data into blocks, Methods) for each ww unit category (row). Each row sums close to 100%, as percentages were rounded off. Number of blocks per unit category are indicated on the right. d, Statistics of ww unit category transitions from one block to the next. From left to right: count matrix with color indicting how many units that had a certain category in a block (x-axis) transitioned to a certain category in the subsequent block (y-axis); expected count matrix showing the transition counts expected from the marginal distributions of the count matrix (Methods); probability matrix showing the probability of a unit transitioning to a certain category given its category in the current block, with columns summing to 1; observed-to-expected ratio matrix showing the ratio between the observed and expected count for each transition. e, Statistical procedure for calculating enrichment scores (E-scores). From top to bottom: Schematic representation of two experimental groups (X1 and X2) with differential sampling of single-unit activity in two brain regions, rA and rB, respectively. Vertical bars: recording probes, gray = region rA, black = region rB; colored circles = three unit categories (red/blue/yellow). Coincidences of brain regions (r) and unit categories (c) are counted within each group (X1 and X2) and summed to generate the overall coincidence count matrix across groups (X). To estimate the coincidences expected by chance while controlling for group effects, r and c are dissociated and randomly re-associated for each group, resulting in group-specific surrogate coincidence matrices (S1,j and S2,j). These surrogate matrices are then summed to obtain an across-group surrogate matrix (Sj). The random dissociation, re-association, and coincidence counting process is repeated 1,000 times to generate an overall surrogate matrix, S, with dimensions [n regions] x [n activity categories] x 1,000 (bottom left). To calculate the E-score, er,c, for a specific activity category c in a given region r (shown here for region rB and category c3, bottom middle), the original coincidence count xr,c (yellow vertical line) is standardized to the distribution of the 1,000 surrogate counts in sr,c (yellow shaded area) by subtracting the mean (sr,c) and dividing by the standard deviation (σ) of sr,c. E-scores for all combinations of r and c are collected in the enrichment matrix E. Note that r and c can represent any attribute (for example, r could also refer to layer or experimental group), and that ‘group' in this schematic denotes the attribute being controlled for (for example, ‘group' could also refer to brain region, when controlling for brain regions, as in f). f, Category enrichment profiles of different cortical layers. Enrichment profiles were obtained statistically controlling for brain regions (e and Methods). Rows are sorted according to hierarchical clustering (ward linkage) of enrichment profiles.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) contributes to thermoregulation and glucose metabolism, but how these functions are coordinated remains unclear. While thermogenesis in the activated BAT typically coincides with increased blood flow and glucose uptake1,2,3,4,5, several pathophysiological and nutritional states dissociate these processes6,7, suggesting they are governed by distinct sympathetic circuits. Here we identify subpopulations of sympathetic neurons in the stellate ganglion that mediate distinct functions of intrascapular BAT (iBAT) in mice. Two main types of sympathetic neurons project to iBAT: those that innervate the organ parenchyma and those that innervate the large blood vessels feeding the depot8,9,10,11,12. Here we develop a toolkit to parse the functions of these neuronal subclasses through targeted chemogenetic activation of projections to iBAT, while sparing other organs, and single-cell transcriptomics coupled to retrograde tracing from iBAT to the stellate ganglion. We find that stimulation of the parenchymal projections increases blood flow and thermogenesis in iBAT, without affecting circulating glucose levels. Conversely, stimulation of the vascular projections improves glucose tolerance but does not alter blood flow or thermogenesis in iBAT. These data provide a mechanistic explanation for the dissociation between the thermogenic and glycaemic effects of BAT activation13,14,15,16.

Cold-induced thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) is an energy-demanding process that relies on enhanced blood flow as well as uptake of fuels, processes that are all triggered by sympathetic nervous system (SNS) signalling17. Thus, these parameters are often considered interchangeably when assessing the physiological consequences of stimulating BAT in humans. However, glucose uptake in BAT does not require cold-induced thermogenesis in humans18 or rodents13,14,15, and the metabolically beneficial effects of glucose uptake in BAT are dependent on adrenergic signalling but are independent of cold ambient temperature16. Conversely, diabetes in humans and mouse models is associated with impaired glucose uptake in BAT19,20, while its metabolic activity is normal6. These observations raise the possibility that thermogenic and glucoregulatory functions of BAT are controlled by distinct sympathetic circuits, although the exact neuronal substrates are unknown.

Cold responses in the skin are mediated through the coordinated regulation of functionally distinct populations of sympathetic neurons defined by the expression of different combinations of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides21,22. Neurons that co-express norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y (NPY) project to the vasculature and promote vasoconstriction23,24, while norepinephrine neurons with low levels of NPY promote piloerection (goosebumps)25. This neuroanatomical organization of sympathetic fibres is preserved in BAT8,9,10,11,12. Gain and loss of Npy expression in the SNS impacts both cold tolerance and glucose metabolism11,12,26,27. Since NPY is also expressed in neurons that innervate visceral organs11,28, the function of sympathetic neurons that innervate intrascapular BAT (iBAT) per se cannot be evaluated in these genetic models. Here, we developed novel mouse genetic tools and in vivo assays to parse the functions of molecularly and neuroanatomically distinct sympathetic projections to iBAT, without affecting sympathetic projections to other visceral organs or sensory projections to iBAT that also affect metabolism.

Retrograde adeno-associated viruses (AAVrg) are routinely used to mark and manipulate neural projections to a target of interest within the brain29. We assessed the efficacy of retrograde labelling from iBAT to its largest source of sympathetic innervation, the stellate ganglion (SG)30,31. Despite using viral titres tenfold higher than commonly used in the brain (>1013 vg ml−1), SG labelling following intra-iBAT injections of AAVrg::CAG-GFP was much less efficient than tracing with cholera toxin subunit B (CTB; Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Intersectional approaches involving direct viral injections into the nodose ganglion can effectively target sensory projections to adipose tissues32. However, this approach is not feasible in the SG owing to its physical inaccessibility. Thus, the dearth of tools to robustly modulate SG projections to peripheral organs in the thoracic cavity is a major obstacle to studying their impact on physiology.

Intra-iBAT injections of the MaCPNS1 serotype, which was engineered for use in the periphery33, achieved robust labelling in the SG but also labelled sensory projections from the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) (Fig.1a,b and Extended Data Fig. 1c). Injecting a Cre-dependent MaCPNS1 virus into iBAT of Th-Cre mice robustly labelled sympathetic projections to iBAT (SGBAT) from the SG through T4, with a few neurons labelled between T5 and T7 (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Since iBAT-projecting neurons are distinct from the subpopulation of tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing neurons in the DRG (Extended Data Fig. 2), this strategy avoided labelling sensory neurons that could provide negative feedback to the SNS32 (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1d).

We used this approach to investigate the physiological outcomes of acutely activating SGBAT neurons with Cre-dependent MaCPNS1 viruses expressing either mCherry (control) or an excitatory designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD, hM3Dq; Extended Data Fig. 1f). Three weeks after the viral injection, we assessed the effect of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of saline (SAL) and the DREADD agonist clozapine-N-oxide (CNO, 10 mg kg−1) on thermogenesis and blood flow in iBAT in mice under constant anaesthesia. We used the difference between the temperature of iBAT and the lower back as an estimate of iBAT thermogenesis. CNO injections into hM3D-expressing mice increased iBAT thermogenesis and blood flow, without effects on core body temperature, while mice injected with the control virus did not respond (Fig. 1d,e). Within 5 min of CNO treatment, iBAT temperature increased by ~0.8 °C and blood flow increased by ~25% (Fig. 1f,g). The number of neurons expressing the DREADD virus in this cohort varied from 2,283 to 3,595, but there was no correlation with changes in thermogenesis or blood flow (Extended Data Fig. 3). Thus, when >2,000 neurons are infected, the effect is largely binary. The number of labelled SG neurons and the magnitude of responses were similar in males and females.

Delivery of the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol rapidly reversed the effects of chemogenetic stimulation on thermogenesis and blood flow in both sexes, demonstrating the requirement for SNS signals (Fig. 1e). Treatment with the α-adrenergic receptor antagonist phentolamine acutely reduced blood flow by 60 ± 24.3% (mean ± s.e.m.) but did not affect thermogenesis (Extended Data Fig. 4). While it is possible that increased blood flow contributes to elevated iBAT temperature, the two processes can be decoupled. The experiments presented here do not distinguish between UCP1-dependent and UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanisms.

Next, we explored the effects of chemogenetic manipulation of SGBAT neurons on systemic metabolism in freely moving, awake mice. To minimize possible off-target effects of CNO, we switched to a higher-affinity DREADD ligand, deschloroclozapine6 (DCZ, 200 µg kg−1). Since activated BAT in humans is associated with improved glucose homeostasis16 and β3-adrenergic stimulation improves glucose tolerance34,35, we assessed the effect SAL versus DCZ injections immediately before an oral gavage of glucose (2 g kg−1 at time 0) in a random crossover design (Fig. 1h). DCZ treatment lowered blood glucose levels after 15 min in male and female mice expressing a Th-Cre-driven excitatory DREADD (Fig. 1l,m) but had no effect in wild type (WT) mice (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). The glucose-lowering effect of chemogenetic stimulation was not observed in the absence of oral glucose gavage (Extended Data Fig. 6a–c), raising the possibility that SNS projections to iBAT are endogenously activated by glucose. To test this, we performed complementary intra-iBAT injections of a MaCPNS1 virus expressing a Cre-dependent inhibitory DREADD (hM4Di) in Th-Cre mice. Chemogenetic inhibition impaired glucose tolerance at 30 min after gavage in both sexes (Fig. 1n–p).

Mice expressing the excitatory DREADD were transferred to metabolic cages where they were acclimated to i.p. SAL injections for 5 days before receiving either SAL or DCZ in a random crossover design. While the acute injection stress caused an increase in energy expenditure in all mice, this effect was significantly greater in DCZ-treated mice in both sexes (Fig. 1i,j). DCZ and CNO did not affect energy expenditure when injected into WT mice (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). Increased energy expenditure following chemogenetic stimulation was not accompanied by a compensatory increase in food intake (Supplementary Fig. 1). The average respiratory exchange ratio (RER) in the 30 min post-injection decreased with DCZ but not SAL (Fig. 1k), but some of this effect may be attributable to DCZ alone, as it also lowers RER in WT mice (Extended Data Fig. 5f).

To further investigate the effects of acute chemogenetic stimulation, we performed bulk RNA-sequencing and lipidomics in iBAT in a separate cohort of female and male mice 30 min after SAL or DCZ treatment. We identified 87 (56 upregulated and 31 downregulated) differentially expressed genes with DCZ treatment after controlling for sex (Fig. 2a). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified ‘cell activation' as the top enriched term in upregulated genes (Fig. 2b). This category includes immediate early genes, such as Jun and Egr3, and genes encoding downstream components of adrenergic signalling (that is, Adrb2) and regulators of thermogenesis, metabolism and angiogenesis (Irf4, Irs2 and Thbs1)36,37,38. Notably, Ucp1 expression was not increased at this timepoint. Other enriched GSEA terms are consistent with effects on metabolism in iBAT. Many of the most upregulated and downregulated genes are implicated in lipid homeostasis. Genes encoding proteins that promote lipid biosynthesis (for example Fasn and Acsl5) and lipid transport and signalling (Ffar4/Gpr120, Trim67 and Fabp5) were downregulated, while those that suppress it were upregulated (for example, Sik1 and Dusp1). Together, these results indicate that acute stimulation of SNS projections to iBAT regulates thermogenesis and fuel disposal at the local (tissue) level. In addition, we observed marked sex differences in the transcriptional profile of iBAT, independent of chemogenetic stimulation (Fig. 2c). Females preferentially expressed genes related to amino acid catabolism, glycolysis and triglyceride (TG) biosynthesis (Fig. 2d), whereas males preferentially expressed genes related to lipid and glutathione catabolism (Fig. 2e). The idea that sex differences exist in the metabolic properties of iBAT was also reflected in how stimulating SGBAT neuronal impacts the lipid profiles of both plasma (Fig. 2f,g,j,k) and iBAT (Fig. 2h,i,l,m). Chemogenetic stimulation of SGBAT neurons reduced circulating TG species to a similar degree in females and males (43.1% and 46.4%, respectively) (compare Fig. 2f,g with Fig. 2j,k). Within iBAT of females, chemogenetic stimulation increased the abundance of TGs, although this did not reach significance (Fig. 2i). However, a number of specific lipid species such as TG 58:6-FA20:4 or TG 56:4-FA18:1 that were found significantly lower in plasma accumulate in iBAT of females, suggesting that chemogenetic stimulation mediates uptake and storage of TG species. In males, however, lipids did not accumulate in iBAT (Fig. 2l,m), which is consistent with the idea that the activated iBAT of males is primed to metabolize the TGs taken from the circulation. Uncovering sex differences in the metabolism of different macronutrients that underlie these results is an important area for future research.

To explore the molecular identity of post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons innervating iBAT, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) coupled with retrograde tracing from distinct peripheral targets in the mouse SG. We focused on SG neurons innervating iBAT (SGBAT) and forelimb (SGFL), because they are both involved in thermoregulation and the projections share a similar anatomical trajectory via the dorsal rami. We performed simultaneous retrograde tracing from iBAT and forelimb by injecting CTB conjugated to Alexa555 (CTB–A555) into iBAT and CTB–A488 into the forelimbs. Three days later, we generated z-stacked images of intact cleared ganglia. SGBAT and SGFL neurons were intermingled in the lateral SG but were not overlapping (Fig. 3a).

Next, we performed scRNA-seq in conjunction with CTB retrograde tracing from iBAT and forelimb (Extended Data Fig. 7). We collected a total of 1,039 single cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (433 SGBAT (A555+) and 220 SGFL (A488+) and 375 non-labelled neurons) from three independent sorts of n = 12 SG in 8-week-old mice. The A555+ and A488+ cells were distinct, confirming that SGBAT and SGFL neurons do not overlap (Extended Data Fig. 7d). Based on an unsupervised analysis of single-cell transcriptomic signatures, we divided SG neurons into four clusters, SG1 to SG4 (SG1–4; Fig. 3b,e). Projecting the CTB labelling onto the unsupervised clustering revealed that each cluster contains neurons projecting to iBAT (A555+, red), forelimb (A488+, green) and other organs such as the heart (grey) (Fig. 3f,g). However, >85% of SNS inputs to iBAT derived from the SG1 and SG2 subtypes, with most of the remaining innervation coming from SG3 (Fig. 3g).

Neurons in all clusters expressed Th, Dbh and Slc18a2/Vmat2, consistent with a sympathetic neuronal identity39, but expression was highest in SG1 and SG2 neurons (Fig. 3c). Similarly, Npy was expressed in all clusters, but SG1 neurons expressed it at levels that were 7–50-fold higher than the other clusters (Fig. 3c). While NPY immunoreactivity has been used to mark SG1 neurons (Fig. 3d), its low expression levels in SG2–4 disqualifies its use as the basis for a Cre driver. SG2 neurons expressed Slc18a1/Vmat1 in addition to Slc18a2/Vmat2. This was unexpected as VMAT1 expression is thought to be restricted to neuroendocrine cells in the adrenal gland and gut. SG4 neurons expressed the cholinergic markers Chat and Slc18a3/VAChT (Fig. 3c). We confirmed the specificity of the expression patterns of the marker genes identified in the bioinformatic analyses by multiplex single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) on SG tissue sections (Fig. 3d). We confirmed that the SG1 markers Fst, Sctr and Rfxp1 were co-expressed with Npy, but not with Slc18a1 (SG2), Colq (G2–4) or Aqp1 (SG3). Nearly all Slc18a1+ neurons (SG2) expressed Colq (SG2–4), but little to no Aqp1 (SG3). The transcriptional profiles within each cluster were shared by SGBAT, SGFL and unlabelled neurons. However, the proportion of each of the four subclusters differed according to the projection target. The most notable difference was in the cholinergic sudomotor neurons (SG4), which preferentially projected to forelimb, consistent with the paws serving as the major site of sweat release in rodents.

Next, we explored why the unique markers of SG subpopulations identified here were not revealed by earlier analyses. A major difference between the approaches is our exclusive focus on the SG, while earlier studies pooled sympathetic ganglia from SG through T13 (refs. 40,41). We evaluated the expression of the markers for SG1–3 in ganglia at more rostral (superior cervical ganglion; SCG) and caudal (celiac ganglion) positions in the chain. We performed multiplex smFISH in Npy-GFP reporter mice to map the expression of SG markers genes relative to vasoconstrictor neurons in the SCG previously reported by Lundberg et al. and Pernow et al.23,24. These Npy-GFPHI neurons co-expressed the SG1 markers Rxfp1, Fst and Sctr, and not markers for SG2–4 neurons such as Cckar, Colq or Aqp1 (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Based on these results, we conclude that the gene expression pattern in the SCG parallels our observations in the SG.

Gene expression in celiac ganglion, which innervates the gastrointestinal tract and liver, diverged substantially from the pattern observed ganglia of the rostral sympathetic chain (SCG and SG). Npy-GFPHI neurons co-expressed the SG1 marker Rfxp1, but not the other SG1 markers such as Fst and Sctr (Extended Data Fig. 8b). In addition, the SG2–3 markers Cckar, Colq and Aqp1 were preferentially expressed in Npy-GFPHI neurons in the celiac ganglion (Extended Data Fig. 8b), consistent with prior reports that Npy is broadly expressed by sympathetic neurons in the celiac ganglion11. The only SG markers that maintained the same pattern of relative expression in Npy-GFPHI neurons in the SCG, SG and celiac ganglion were Rfxp1 (SG1) and Slc18a1 (SG2). The differences in the combinations of genes expressed by subpopulations of neurons in the rostral and caudal sympathetic chain explain why pooled sympathetic ganglia analyses across the entire chain did not identify subpopulation-specific markers.

To selectively manipulate SG1/Rxfp1-Cre and SG2/Vmat1-Cre populations, we generated Rxfp1-Cre and Vmat1-Cre lines and validated them using a variety of approaches. We crossed Rxfp1-Cre, Vmat1-Cre and Th-Cre lines to the tdTomato reporter strain (Ai9) and validated the expression of the Tomato lineage trace in the SG by performing smFISH with Rxfp1 and Tomato probes and by visualizing the pattern of fibre projections in the intact iBAT depot. The Rxfp1-Cre lineage trace exhibited the expected pattern: reporter expression confined to Rxfp1 neurons in the SG but absent in Colq-expressing neurons (SG2–4)(Extended Data Fig. 9a–c). We optimized the Fast 3D Clear system42 to visualize axonal projections in iBAT from Th-Cre::tdTOM and Rxfp1-Cre::tdTOM mice that were retroorbitally injected with isolectin (IL)–A647 to mark the vasculature. Pan-sympathetic fibres labelled with the Th-Cre lineage trace were detected around large blood vessels and in the parenchyma (Fig. 3h and Supplementary Videos 1–3). Fibres labelled with the Rxfp1-Cre lineage trace were confined to blood vessels with a diameter of ~10–11 µm (Fig. 3i, Supplementary Videos 4–6 and Extended Data Fig. 10a), consistent with reports that NPY+ fibres exclusively project to arterioles in iBAT12. To quantify this relationship, we calculated the average distance between each 647-nm-positive pixel (blood vessels) and its nearest 550-nm-positive pixel (nerves) and compared the proportional distribution of nerve vessel distances. Rxfp1-Cre::tdTOM fibres had a higher proportion of contacts in close proximity to blood vessels (0.41–2 µm) than the pan-sympathetic Th-Cre::tdTOM fibres, which were the predominant fibres found at greater distances (>5 µm) from vessels (Extended Data Fig. 10c). This further supports our observation that Rxfp1-Cre::tdTOM projections are preferentially associated with blood vessels. It should be noted that Rxfp1-Cre::tdTOM fibres are a subset of the Th-Cre::tdTOM fibres.

When Vmat1-Cre mice were crossed to the Ai9 reporter strain, Tomato was detected in all iBAT-projecting neurons in the SG, including those that expressed Rxfp1 (Extended Data Fig. 9d–f) owing to transient Vmat1 expression in the embryonic peripheral nervous system43,44. To overcome this limitation, we injected Cre-dependent mCherry retrograde viruses into iBAT of Rxfp1-Cre or Vmat1-Cre strains in adult mice and assessed reporter expression in conjunction with NPY immunostaining in the SG and in the DRG. In Rxfp1-Cre mice, most of the neurons expressing the viral mCherry reporter co-expressed NPY (Fig. 3j). NPY+ neurons that did not express mCherry presumably represent SG1 neurons that project to other targets, such as the forelimbs. By contrast, in Vmat1-Cre mice, little overlap between the mCherry reporter and NPY was detected (Fig. 3k). The viral reporter was not detected in the DRGs (Extended Data Fig. 1g,h), confirming the specificity of the SNS targeting.

To further confirm that Rxfp1- and Vmat1-based driver lines target distinct subpopulations in the adult SG, we generated an Rxfp1-Flp driver line and crossed it to Flp-dependent Tomato reporter and Vmat1-Cre lines. The resulting Rxfp1-Flp::FSF-Tomato;Vmat1-Cre mice were injected with a Cre-dependent EGFP-expressing AAVrg in iBAT (Fig. 3l). Notably, most tdTomato+ SG neurons co-expressed NPY, while EGFP+ SG2 neurons did not express NPY or tdTomato (Fig. 3l), demonstrating the existence of two molecularly distinct neuronal populations in the SG projecting to iBAT. Given that Rxfp1+ and Vmat1+ neurons account for >85% of sympathetic innervation of iBAT (Fig. 3g), it is likely that the parenchyma-projecting fibres observed in Th-Cre::tdTOM mice originate from Vmat1+ neurons. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Vmat1+ neurons also project to blood vessels.

We compared the functional consequences of acute selective stimulation of either Rxfp1+ (vasomotor) or Vmat1+ (parenchymal) SGBAT neurons using the chemogenetic tools and paradigms described above (Fig. 4a,e). Of note, the specific stimulation of SG2/Vmat1+ neurons innervating brown adipocytes in the parenchyma induced thermogenesis (Fig. 4b,c), while activation of SG1/Rxfp1+ neurons projecting exclusively to the blood vessels did not (Fig. 4f,g). Contrary to the dogma that NPY+ neurons are vasoregulators8,23,24, blood flow was only increased by stimulating parenchymal SG2 projections (Fig. 4b,d,f,h). Increases in iBAT thermogenesis and blood flow by stimulating parenchymal SG2 projections to iBAT (Fig. 4c,d) were comparable to those achieved by stimulating all iBAT-projecting neurons in Th-Cre mice (Fig. 1f,g).

Next, we examined the impact of stimulating each subpopulation on systemic metabolism in awake animals (Fig. 4i,m). Consistent with observations in anaesthetized mice, activation of parenchyma-projecting SG2/Vmat1+ neurons resulted in higher average energy expenditure across the study in both sexes (Fig. 4j,k), whereas stimulation of vasomotor SG1/Rxfp1+ neurons did not (Fig. 4n,o). RER was decreased in both Cre lines (Fig. 4l,p). The magnitude of the response from SG2/Vmat1+ stimulation (−0.038 ± 0.006, mean ± s.e.m.) was similar to pan-sympathetic stimulation in Th-Cre mice (−0.045 ± 0.007; Fig. 1k), and the RER response to SG1/Rxfp1+ stimulation (−0.022 ± 0.006) was comparable to that in WT mice (−0.028 ± 0.007; Extended Data Fig. 5f). However, we cannot definitively parse the circuits regulating fat oxidation.

In the context of an oral glucose challenge, chemogenetic activation of vasomotor SG1/Rxfp1+ projections to iBAT produced a marked reduction in blood glucose levels at 15 min (Fig. 4s,t), but stimulation without glucose gavage had no effect on baseline glucose levels (Extended Data Fig. 6d–f). Chemogenetic inhibition resulted in increased circulating glucose at 30 and 45 min (Fig. 4u–w), fully recapitulating the effects observed when all iBAT-projecting sympathetic neurons were activated or inhibited in Th-Cre mice (Fig. 1l–p). Notably, stimulating parenchyma-projecting SG2/Vmat1+ neurons had no effect on glycaemia (Fig. 4q,r and Extended Data Fig. 6g–i). In summary, we demonstrated that thermogenesis and blood flow in iBAT are regulated by parenchyma-projecting SG2/Vmat1+ neurons, while systemic glucose is modulated by vasomotor SG1/Rxfp1+ neurons.

By combining retrograde injections with Cre-dependent viral constructs, we targeted manipulations to subpopulations of BAT-projecting sympathetic neurons without confounding effects on the brain, sensory nervous system or other peripheral organs. Acute stimulation of SG2 projections to the iBAT parenchyma is sufficient to increase blood flow and heat production in iBAT and to promote fat utilization, whereas effects on total energy expenditure are modest and variable, consistent with observations in humans45. Our findings do not exclude the possibility that sympathetic stimulation of white adipose tissue lipolysis is needed to fully support energy combustion by iBAT20,46.

NPY co-transmission in the SNS has been implicated in regulating a wide range of physiological functions. In contrast to the dogma that NPYergic sympathetic projections are vasoconstrictors23,24, chemogenetic activation of SG1 projections did not affect blood flow or thermogenesis in iBAT. Since SG1 neurons in the SCG and SG are molecularly distinct from NPYergic neurons in the celiac ganglion, exploring whether other NPYergic neurons in the rostral sympathetic chain share projection targets and functionality is an important area for future research. Another important question raised by our results is whether activation of SG1 and SG2 neurons is sensed by molecularly and functionally distinct populations of DRG neurons that innervate iBAT, as shown for cutaneous-projecting DRG neurons47. For example, it is possible that subpopulations of thermosensors provide negative feedback to prevent overheating in response to activation of SG2 neurons, but not SG1 neurons.

Our data support the idea that effects of SNS-derived NPY on total energy expenditure, cold tolerance and adiposity11,12 reflect direct actions in other tissues and/or chronic adaptations in the context of a congenital knockout driven by a Th-Cre reporter. Since this driver line is also expressed in the brain and DRG, it is possible that central and sensory circuits contribute to these effects. On the other hand, some of the effects of SNS-derived NPY on glucose tolerance that were attributed to actions in the pancreas, liver and white adipose tissue could stem from signalling in iBAT11. Consistent with this idea, glucose uptake in BAT is associated with lower glycaemia and risk of diabetes in humans, independent of external temperature16. As chemogenetic modulation of SG1/Rxfp1+ neurons alters glycaemia in the context of a glucose load but not at baseline, it is possible that crosstalk with other metabolic organs is involved.

The ability to target SG1 projections to iBAT without affecting thermogenesis may be particularly beneficial in the context of diabetes, which is associated with impaired glucose uptake but normal thermogenesis in BAT6,48. In the long term, uncovering SNS targets that mediate the metabolically beneficial effects on glycaemia without activating thermogenic programmes that are subject to robust negative feedback could lead to novel approaches to treat metabolic diseases.

All procedures were performed within the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Columbia University Health Science Division. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to use the minimum number of animals required for statistical validity.

Mice were housed at 22 ± 1 °C on a 12 h light:12 h dark cycle in the Russ Berrie Medical Sciences Pavilion barrier facility with ad libitum access to chow (13.2% calories from fat; 5053, PicoLab Rodent Diet 20) and autoclaved water. C57BL/6J (000664), Ai949 (007909), Flp-dependent Tomato50 (032864) and NPY-GFP51 (006417) strains were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories, Th-Cre (B6.129×1-Tht1(cre)Te/Kieg) from the European Mouse Mutant Archives (RRID: IMSR_EM:00254) and Rxfp1-Cre (B6.Cg-Rxfp1tm1(cre)Zel), Rxfp1-Flp (B6.Cg-Rxfp1tm1(cre)Zel) and Vmat1-Cre (B6.Cg-Slc18a1tm1(cre)Zel) strains were generated by CRISPR-mediated T2A-nlsCre insertion at the Genetically Modified Mouse Model Shared Resource at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Consistent with findings from other groups31, the Jackson Th-Cre line (008601) drove minimal Ai9 recombination. Mice receiving viral injections were single housed post-surgery.

Under isoflurane anaesthesia, the upper back was shaved and sterilized with alternating betadine and 70% isopropyl alcohol. Buprenorphine (0.1 mg kg−1) was given for analgesia. Mice were placed on a heating pad under a sterile drape and a 1 cm incision was made over the interscapular region. The upper white adipose layer was dissected to expose iBAT, and CTB–Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher, C22843; 1 μl of 1% in SAL) was injected at two sites per depot using a glass-pulled needle and mouth pipette. The fat pad was replaced and the incision closed with 4-0 PS-4 sutures (Ethilon, 1662G). CTB–Alexa Fluor 488 (C22841) was similarly injected at three sites per forelimb. Wounds were cleaned and mice monitored for distress. After 72 h, stellate ganglia were collected following euthanasia with Avertin (500 mg kg−1; Fisher, AC421430100), dissociated for analysis or post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1 h, washed and mounted in LIMPID52.

Mice were anaesthetized and prepared as described above. A horizontal incision was made ~2 cm below the iBAT to avoid scar interference with Doppler imaging. The fat pad was exposed, separated along the midline and flipped. Virus was injected at three to five evenly spaced sites per depot using a 25 µl Neuros syringe (Hamilton, 65460-11). Each mouse received a total dose of 1.3 × 10¹² gc, with the injection volume (20–50 µl) adjusted to viral titre (Supplementary Tables). The fat pad was repositioned, and the incision closed and sanitized. At the end of the study, SGs and DRGs were collected, post-fixed in 4% PFA for 1 h, washed and mounted in LIMPID.

SGs and DRGs were incubated overnight at room temperature in the dark and imaged on a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (20×, tiled z stacks, 5 µm steps). Fluorescent reporter-expressing neurons were quantified using Stereo Investigator Cleared Tissue Edition software (MBF Bioscience).

Mice were anaesthetized with Avertin (350 mg kg−1, i.p.) and the interscapular area shaved. Animals were maintained at 35 °C on a heating pad with rectal temperature feedback (Harvard Apparatus, 75-1500). A perfusion needle connected to a syringe pump (Medfusion 3500, ICUMedical) delivered Avertin continuously (190 mg kg−1 h−1) via the lateral vein to maintain anaesthesia. A small incision was made over the previous surgical site to expose iBAT and the fat pad was cut caudally to insert an implantable thermal probe (IT-21, Physitemp). A second probe was placed subcutaneously on the lower back and a third measured ambient temperature. Probes were connected to a thermometer (TC-2000, Sable Systems), and signals digitized via LabJack U3-LV for acquisition on a laptop. Blood flow over the interscapular region was recorded using a high-resolution laser Doppler imager (MOORLDI2-HIR, Moor Instruments). Baseline measurements were acquired for 10 min, followed by i.p. injections of SAL, CNO (10 µg g−1; Sigma, SML2304) and, when indicated, propranolol (5 µg g−1; Thermo Fisher, H26645.06) or phentolamine (20 µg g−1; Millipore-Sigma, P7561). Norepinephrine (0.5 mg kg−1) served as a positive control. All injections were volume-matched to 5 µl g−1. After recordings, mice were euthanized by anaesthetic overdose and ganglia were collected as described above.

Doppler data were processed with Moor LDI Review v6.0. The interscapular region was defined as the area showing maximal norepinephrine-induced activity, and this region of interest was applied to all frames to extract mean perfusion values. Thermal data were analysed in R using a custom script. For each injection, we computed the stepwise temperature difference between iBAT and lower back probes. Baseline (2 min pre-injection) and treated (5–10 min post-injection) averages were calculated and the difference (treated − baseline) was used for SAL, CNO and adrenergic blocker conditions. The same procedure was applied to relative blood flow values.

Mice were transferred to clean cages without food for 4 h before testing. Baseline blood glucose was measured from tail vein pricks (Contour Next EZ, Ascensia). Mice then received an oral gavage of d-(+)-glucose (2 mg kg−1; Sigma, G8769, 1:2 in ddH2O, 20 µm filtered) and an i.p. injection of either DCZ (200 ng g−1) or SAL. Gavage and injection volumes were 9 and 5 µl g−1, respectively. Blood glucose was recorded at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after gavage. Each mouse received DCZ and SAL in a balanced crossover design, with a 7-day washout between sessions.

Mice were single housed in a Promethion Core Metabolic System (Sable Systems) for 1 week under controlled ambient temperature (22 ± 1 °C), a 12 h light:12 h dark cycle and with ad libitum access to food and water from the same barrier facility. Mice were acclimated to the metabolic cages and daily i.p. SAL injections at 16:00 for 3 days. On days 4 and 5, mice received two i.p. SAL injections per day (10:00 and 16:00). During the final 2 days, mice received two daily injections of either DCZ (200 ng g−1) or SAL in a balanced crossover design. Specifically, on day 6, half of the mice received DCZ and half received SAL (10:00 and 16:00), and treatment groups were reversed on day 7. All injections were volume-matched to 5 µl g−1 body weight. Mice were returned to their home cages after each recording session.

Energy expenditure (heat) and RER (CO2 produced/O2 consumed) were quantified. For experiments comparing DCZ and CNO in WT mice, animals were acclimated for 2 days with a single daily i.p. SAL injection, followed by two daily SAL injections on days 3 and 4. Over the next 3 days, mice received two daily injections of either SAL, DCZ or CNO in a randomized and counterbalanced order to minimize carryover effects.

Statistical analyses were performed by comparing average values before and after injections for each mouse and parameter. For each parameter, the mean value during the hour following injection (excluding the first 9 min to account for gas equilibration and stress-induced hyperthermia) was calculated and the equivalent pre-injection mean was subtracted. Differences between groups were analysed using paired t-tests.

Three weeks after intra-iBAT viral injections of Th-Cre+/− mice (six males and six females) with MaCPNS1:CAG-DIO-hM3D-mCherry as described above, mice were anaesthetized with Avertin (350 mg kg−1, i.p.) and injected intraperitoneally with either DCZ (200 ng g−1, i.p.) or SAL. Mice were maintained on a heating pad at 35 °C for 30 min before euthanasia via thoracotomy. Transcardial perfusion with 5 ml of cold PBS (4 °C) was performed to remove residual blood, after which iBAT and SG were collected. Each iBAT was bisected along the midline, weighed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. One lobe per mouse was used for RNA extraction. SG were post-fixed and washed as previously described, mounted in LIMPID mounting medium and imaged to confirm viral expression.

Total RNA was extracted from iBAT using the Tri-Isolate RNA Pure Kit (IBI Scientific, IB47631) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA integrity was assessed using RIN analysis, and sequencing was performed by the Genome Center Core at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. mRNA was enriched using poly(A) selection and sequencing libraries were prepared with Illumina TruSeq chemistry. The final PCR step was modified using the KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready Mix. Libraries were sequenced on an Element AVITI platform to generate paired-end 75 bp reads. Raw BCL files were converted to FASTQ format and adaptor-trimmed using bases2fastq (v1.4.0.833301531). Reads were pseudoaligned to a kallisto index generated from the Ensembl v96 mouse transcriptome (GRCm38.p6) using kallisto (v0.44.0).Gene count matrices were analysed using R53 with DESeq54, while GSEA and Gene Ontology (GO) over-representation analysis (ORA) were done with clusterProfiler55.

Shotgun lipidomic analysis of murine plasma and BAT samples was performed as previously described56. Briefly, 25 µl of plasma or 3–5 mg of BAT samples were spiked with internal standards and mixed with MTBE/methanol/water 10:3:2.5 (v/v/v) as described57. Following homogenization, samples were centrifuged (4 °C, 10,000g, 10 min) and the lipid-containing upper phase was transferred into a new vial. Lipid extracts were concentrated by vacuum centrifugation and reconstituted in a mixture of dichloromethane (50): methanol (50)-containing 10 mM ammonium acetate. Direct infusion of lipid extracts into the mass spectrometer was conducted by an ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography system (Nexera X2, Shimadzu) using dichloromethane (50): methanol (50)-containing 10 mM ammonium acetate as eluent at a flowrate of 0.008 ml min−1. The separation and targeted profiling of lipid species was performed combining differential mobility spectrometry and a QTRAP system (QTRAP 5500, SCIEX) run in multiple reaction monitoring mode operated via Analyst (v1.6.8, SCIEX). The mass spectrometry-generated raw data were converted to mzML format using MSconvertGUI (v3.0.21245-5724be1). Data processing and lipid quantification were performed using the Shotgun Lipidomic Assistant software, a Python-based application according to ref. 56. Values are given as nmol ml−1 (plasma) or nmol mg−1 (BAT).

SG were dissociated following modified published protocols58,59. SGs were collected bilaterally from two 6–8-week-old C57BL/6J males (four SG per batch) in ice-chilled Eagle's balanced salt solution equilibrated to 95% O2/5% CO2 for 1 h. After removing fat and connective tissue, SGs were minced into three to four pieces and transferred to low-bind tubes containing 1.67 ml pre-heated (37 °C) digestion solution for 1.5 h with agitation. The digestion mix contained papain (1,034 µl), collagenase/dispase (200 µl, 20 mg ml−1), d-trehalose (167 µl, 50%), AP-V (3 µl, 25 mM), kynurenic acid (13 µl, 100 mM) and DNase I (250 µl).

Digestion-stop solution consisted of 50% d-trehalose (1,050 µl), AP-V (11 µl, 25 mM), kynurenic acid (44 µl, 100 mM), DNase I (250 µl) and FBS (250 µl). The medium solution contained 50% d-trehalose (1,050 µl), AP-V (8 µl, 25 mM), kynurenic acid (19 µl, 100 mM) and FBS (107 µl) in 9.45 ml DMEM/F12.

Following digestion, half of the suspension was transferred to a new tube, mixed with digestion-stop solution, inverted and centrifuged (300g, 4 °C, 5 min). Pellets were resuspended in 500 µl digestion-stop solution, combined and triturated with BSA-coated fire-polished pipettes of decreasing diameter (400 µm to 150 µm). The cell suspension was washed twice with 1 ml medium, centrifuged (300g, 5 min) and resuspended in 200 µl medium. Cells were filtered through a 40 µm strainer, stained with Sytox Blue (1:1,000) and kept on ice before FACS. A detailed description of this protocol can be found on protocols.io (https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.14egn79e6v5d/v1).

Single cells were sorted into three to four 96-well plates using a FACSAria sorter equipped with a 130-µm nozzle (12 PSI). Approximately two-thirds of wells were filled with CTB–A555 or CTB–A488-positive neurons, and the remaining third with non-labelled neurons. Plates were centrifuged (200g, 2 min) and snap-frozen on dry ice. Three sorting sessions yielded a total of 1,039 cells across 11 plates from 6 mice.

ScRNA-seq was conducted by the Single Cell Analysis Core at Columbia University Irving Medical Center as previously described60. Briefly, libraries were prepared using template-switching reverse transcription with adaptor-linked oligo(dT) primers containing cell- and molecule-specific barcodes. cDNA from each plate was pooled for PCR amplification and library construction, and 3′-end libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500/550.

Reads were aligned to the mouse genome (GRCm38, Gencode M13, Ensembl 88) using STAR v2.5.3a61 and assigned to genes with featureCounts v1.5.362. BAM files were sorted, duplicates removed and unique molecular identifier (UMI) count matrices generated with UMI-tools63, yielding 1,039 cells.

Downstream analysis was performed in Seurat v364. Quality control excluded cells with <1,000 genes, >10% mitochondrial content or no CTB dye assignment, retaining 879 cells. Expression matrices were log-normalized and scaled while regressing out batch, nUMI and mitochondrial fraction. Highly variable genes were identified, and dimensionality reduction was performed by principal component analysis. JackStraw identified 42 significant principal components, of which 30 were retained for clustering.

Cells were clustered using Seurat's FindClusters function on a KNN graph, refined by Jaccard distance and modularity optimization. Cluster markers were identified using FindMarkers (Wilcoxon rank-sum test). To prevent glial gene interference, 136 genes expressed by satellite glial cells65 were removed from the highly variable set (3,555 genes retained). Reclustering across resolutions was visualized using clustree66, and a resolution of 0.6 was chosen. Cluster markers were defined as genes enriched in ≥40% of cells within each cluster. Expression was visualized via heat maps and violin plots. Analyses were conducted in R53.

Mice injected with MaCPNS1 virus were perfused with PBS and 4% PFA at 4 °C. Vertebral columns were post-fixed overnight, washed in PBS and SGs and DRGs were extracted, embedded in OCT, frozen at −80 °C and sectioned at 10 µm.

Thawed sections were washed in PBST (0.1% Triton X-100) and circled with a hydrophobic pen. Slides were blocked in PBST + 5% normal donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (anti-NPY, anti-RFP, anti-GFP and anti-TH, 1:1,000 each). After washing, sections were incubated 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (1:500), washed and mounted with ProLong Glass Antifade.

SGs were imaged on a Zeiss Axio Observer 7 (20×, tiled), DRGs on a Keyence BZ-8000 (20×, tiled). Neurons were manually counted in ImageJ70, using negative controls for background subtraction.

DRGs counts were imaged with a Keyence BZ-8000 fluorescent microscope at 20× as a tiled image. Neurons were manually counted using ImageJ67. Negative control slides (incubated without primary antibodies) were used for background subtraction.

SGs from WT mice and SCG/celiac ganglion from Npy-GFP mice were post-fixed in 4% PFA for 1 h, embedded in OCT, frozen at −80 °C, sectioned at 10 µm and mounted on slides. Multiplex smFISH was performed using the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit following fixed-frozen tissue protocols. To preserve GFP fluorescence, a mild antigen retrieval was used (boiled buffer, 5 min at room temperature). After smFISH, sections were immunostained for GFP (Bio-Rad, 4745-1051, 1:250; Invitrogen, A-11015, 1:500) and imaged on a Zeiss LSM confocal microscope (40× and 63×).

Whole iBAT clearing was performed using a modified Fast 3D Clear protocol42. Mice were perfused with cold PBS followed by 4% PFA, and iBAT was post-fixed overnight at 4 °C. Tissues were washed in PBS (3× 2 h, 4 °C), incubated overnight in 25% Quadrol (Sigma, 122262) in PBS at 37 °C, and washed in double-distilled water. Samples were dehydrated in 50%, 70% and 90% tetrahydrofuran (Sigma, 186562) with pH adjusted to 9–9.5 using triethylamine, then rehydrated in reverse order. Clearing solution was prepared with 48 g Histodenz (Millipore-Sigma, D2158), 0.6 g of diatrizoic acid (Millipore-Sigma, D9268), 1 g of N-methyl-d-glucamine (Millipore-Sigma, M2004) and 10 g of ultrapure urea (Millipore-Sigma, 15505) in 13 ml water, incubated overnight at 37 °C. Samples were incubated in clearing solution overnight at 37 °C and imaged in the same medium on a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (20×).

Whole-tissue iBAT images were acquired as described above using a 2-µm z step. Each stack was divided into consecutive 20-µm substacks (10 images each) and converted into maximum intensity projections. Images were processed in ImageJ with custom Python scripts. For each channel (nerves and blood vessels), projections were converted to 8-bit greyscale, brightness/contrast were manually adjusted and binary masks were generated by manual thresholding.

A custom script calculated the Euclidean distance from each nerve pixel to the nearest vessel pixel, capped at 100 pixels, and converted to micrometres using microscope calibration (2.4089 pixels per µm). Distance distributions between genotypes were compared using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test in R53.

Whole-tissue images of iBAT were acquired as described above, using a 2-µm z step. Each image stack was visually inspected and split into two or more substacks to avoid overlapping between innervated blood vessels, then converted into maximum intensity projections. Blood vessels innervated by tdTomato-positive fibres were manually annotated in ImageJ and traced along their long axis. For each vessel, the diameter was measured manually at five evenly spaced points along the long axis. The average of these measurements was taken as the vessel diameter and converted from pixels to micrometres using the microscope calibration (2.4089 pixels per µm).

Trunk samples were immunostained and cleared using a modified combination of PEGASOS68 and iDISCO69 protocols. Mice were transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS (Thermo Fisher, 10010023) followed by 4% PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 15710). Thoracic and lumbar vertebral columns were post-fixed overnight at 4 °C, washed in PBS and decalcified in 20% EDTA (Millipore-Sigma, E5134) for 4 days at 37 °C with daily solution changes. Samples were washed, incubated in 25% Quadrol (Sigma-Aldrich, 122262) for 48 h, washed again, treated with 3% ammonia (Sigma-Aldrich, 338818) for 6 h and washed overnight at 37 °C.

Tissues were delipidated and dehydrated through graded tert-butanol (tB, 30%, 50% and 70%; Sigma-Aldrich, 360538 with 3% quadrol; Sigma-Aldrich 122262) at 37 °C, rehydrated in reverse order and permeabilized and blocked for 48 h each as in iDISCO. Samples were incubated with rabbit anti-RFP (Rockland, 600-401-379, 1:10,000) for 6 days at 37 °C, washed for 24 h and then incubated with donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen, A10042, 1:1,000) for 5 days at 37 °C, followed by a 24-h PBS wash. Samples were embedded in 1% agarose (Invitrogen, 16500500), dehydrated again in graded tert-butanol, incubated in tB-protected polyethylene glycol (tB-PEG, 75% tB + 22% PEG + 3% quadrol) for 48 h and cleared in benzyl benzoate PEG (BB-PEG, 75% tB + 22% PEG + 3% quadrol) for 48 h at 37 °C following the PEGASOS protocol. Imaging was performed with an Ultramicroscope II light-sheet microscope (Miltenyi Biotec) at 4× in BB-PEG clearing solution.

All statistical analysis were performed in R53 and Graphpad Prism v10.2.0 with the indicated statistical tests. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications32,70, and sample sizes for each experiment are reported in the figure legends. For metabolic data, the sample size was determined based on cage availability. For experiments involving viruses, the sample size was determined based on virus availability. No data were excluded, except mice with deteriorating health issues after surgery or during the experiment and mice with missed viral targeting assessed by histology. All in vivo experiments were performed at least twice or grouped from two independent cohorts with the same conclusion. Experiments were randomized across experimental days and daily blocks were chosen balancing sex and experimental conditions. The Investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. For representative images, the numbers of experimental repetitions were as follows: Fig. 3a: over ten animals across six independent experiments; Fig. 3h,i: over six animals per genotype across four independent experiments; Fig. 3j–l: three animals per experiment; Extended Data Fig. 1a–h: over six animals per experiment, with the exception of Extended Data Fig. 1e, which was two animals per experiment; Extended Data Fig. 9b,c,e,f: over three animals per experiment.

The supermoiré lattice, arising from the interference of multiple moiré patterns, reshapes the electronic band structure of the material that hosts it by introducing new mini bands and modifying the band dispersion. Concurrently, strong electronic interactions within the flat bands induced by the moiré pattern lead to the emergence of various correlated states. However, the impact of the supermoiré lattice on the flat band system with strong interactions remains largely unexplored. Here we report the existence of the supermoiré lattice in twisted trilayer graphene with broken mirror symmetry and elucidate its role in generating mini flat bands and mini Dirac bands. We demonstrate interaction-induced symmetry-broken phases in the supermoiré mini flat bands alongside a cascade of superconductor–insulator transitions enabled by the supermoiré lattice. Our work shows that robust superconductivity can exist in twisted trilayer graphene with broken mirror symmetry and underscores the importance of the supermoiré lattice as an additional degree of freedom for tuning the electronic properties in twisted multilayer systems. It also sheds light on the correlated quantum phases such as superconductivity in the original moiré flat bands, and highlights the potential of using the supermoiré lattice to design and simulate quantum phases.

a–b, Rxx as function of ν and D when B = 0 T (a) and B = 1 T (b) at T = 240 mK. Superconductivity appears on both the hole-doped side and electron-doped side. Correlated states appear at moiré filling ν = 1, ± 2, 3. The result is symmetric with respect to the displacement field, reflecting the device's mirror symmetry. c-d, Landau fan diagram of Rxx (c) and Rxy (d) at D = 0 V/nm. e, The states shown in (c) and (d). Landau levels originating from ν = ± 4, 0 and ν = 1, ± 2, 3 are visible, as indicated by the black and red lines, while those from the Dirac band are shown in pink. The red lines mark the most robust Landau levels stemming from each correlated state at ν and have a slope of C = 2 + 4 − ν in the fan diagram. Dirac Landau levels contribute CDirac = 2, and Cflat = 2 + 4 − ν originates from symmetry-broken Chern insulators in flat bands, similar to those observed in TBG.

a, Rxx and Rxy as a function of B and n when D = − 0.193 V/nm. The right figure extracted the states by black lines, and the red lines mark 1, 1/2, 1/3… quantum flux of the supermoiré lattice. Landau levels stemming from different supermoiré minibands are visible. b, the same measurement as a with fixing top gate voltage Vtg = 11 V and varying Vbg to change carrier density. Four sets of Landau levels can be seen and the distance between each is nsm. (T = 11 mK).

a, Longitudinal conductance as a function of n and B at T = 15 K. The conductance shows peaks at the fractional quantum flux of the supermoiré lattice, suggesting the Brown-Zak oscillation. b, Line cut of conductance at a fixed carrier density from a.

The longitudinal resistance Rxx is plotted as a function of carrier density for a fixed top gate voltage of Vtg = 11 V under different magnetic fields. Red lines serve as guides to the eye, indicating the expected positions of resistance peaks. The spacing between successive red lines corresponds to nsm = 0.468 × 1012 cm−2. The first resistance peak consistently aligns with the corresponding red guiding line. The second resistance peak shows a slight deviation from the red line; however, at B = 0.15 T and B = 0.25 T, it aligns well with the guiding lines. The third and fourth resistance peaks exhibit small deviations from the red lines.

a–p, The single particle electronic structure of the TTG is tracked as a function of interlayer potential difference ΔU and interlayer tunnelling between layer 2 and layer 3. The band color indicates the extent of state polarization on the bottom layer (layer 3). In the weak tunnelling regime, the Dirac band exists and the relative fermi surface between mini bands and Dirac band can be adjusted by the displacement field. a-d show the band structure at ΔU = 0 meV. e-h show the band structure at ΔU = 10 meV. i-l show the band structure at ΔU = 20 meV. m-p show the band structure at ΔU = 30 meV.

a–b, n − D mapping of Rxx and Rxy when B = 1 T. Same as in Fig. 2e,f, vertical features are flat band Landau levels, and ‘S' shape features are the transition lines of nearby Dirac Landau levels. However, compared with the results measured at B = 0.5 T, the distance between different vertical features equals eB/h, which means the four-fold degeneracy of flat band Landau levels is lifted. c-e, Zoom-in of Rxx (c) and Rxy (d). The degeneracy of Dirac band Landau levels is also lifted. There are four Dirac Landau level transition lines near CNP, between which NDirac equals 1, 0, − 1. At a fixed n, the number of total filled Landau levels Ntotal = nh/eB and the filled flat band Landau levels Nflat = Ntotal − NDirac can be extracted. e, Figure shows (NDirac, Nflat) in the n − D mapping. (T = 240 mK).

a, the corresponding Landau fan diagram of Rxy of the Rxx shown in Fig. 3a. b, Line cut of Rxy at a carrier density of n = 4.26 × 1012 cm−2. Rxy shows almost quantized resistance values of h/e2, h/2e2, h/6e2, and h/10e2, attributed to the Dirac Landau levels. When the Fermi level lies within the gap of the flat band, the transport is solely governed by the Dirac band, which transitions into Dirac Landau levels in the presence of a magnetic field. c-d, n − D mapping of Rxx and Rxy at B = 1 T for electron densities near the full filling of the top moiré lattice. The black solid lines indicate the full filling of the top moiré lattice. It is evident that the position of this full filling shifts as a function of the displacement field. This shift arises from the relative band shift between the Dirac band and the flat band. When the displacement field becomes sufficiently large (in our case, D > 0.3 V/nm), the Dirac band hybridizes with the flat band. As a result, Rxy no longer exhibits characteristics associated with the Dirac band. The purple lines mark the strong states appearing at n12 + nsm, which occur when the Fermi level lies within the gap of both the Dirac and flat bands. Additionally, the red dashed line highlights a gapped state induced by the supermoiré lattice. Between the red and black lines, three more states marked by yellow, green, and cyan lines are observed. These are attributed to isospin symmetry breaking within the supermoiré miniband.

Landau fan diagram of Rxx and Rxy at D = 0.145 V/nm. All the observed features in the Landau fan are illustrated. The black dashed lines represent Landau levels originating from the full filling of the top moiré lattice (n12). The red dashed line marks the gapped state induced by the supermoiré lattice. The pink line indicates the transition between different Dirac Landau level regimes and above this line, two Dirac Landau levels are filled; below it, due to a change in degeneracy, six Dirac Landau levels are filled. Additionally, three states highlighted by yellow, green, and cyan lines are observed, with spacings nsm/4. These are isospin symmetry broken states within the supermoiré mini band.

n − D mapping of Rxx on the hole-doped side. The red dashed lines mark the half filling \((\frac{1}{2}* {n}_{12})\) and full filling (n12) states of the top moiré lattice. The green dashed lines are the guiding lines for the other resistive states appearing in the superconducting regime. And the distance between is \(\frac{1}{2}* {n}_{sm}\). Similar to Fig. 4a, the nature of these states depends on the relative strength between interaction effects and the supermoiré potential.

a, n − D mapping of Rxx at T = 240 mK. b–e, dVxx/dI versus Idc and n at different displacement fields. At a very large negative displacement field (b), superconductivity shows a single superconducting dome with the maximum critical current around 100 nA. As the displacement field increases, superconductivity weakens, and the maximum critical current decreases. More interestingly, the superconductor is gradually diced into small superconducting domes. At D = 0 V/nm, the critical current shows a kink in the superconducting dome as marked by the green dashed line where the carrier density is \(\frac{1}{2}* {n}_{12}+{n}_{sm}\). This shows that the supermoiré lattice starts mediating the superconductivity. At higher displacement fields, there are critical current kinks features appearing as marked by green dashed lines in d, e, and f. The carrier density at these green lines corresponds to the half filling of supermoiré minibands. This indicates the appearance of symmetry-broken phases in mini flat bands. (T = 240 mK).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","He Went to Prison for Gene-Editing Babies. Now He's Planning to Do It Again","https://www.wired.com/story/china-he-jiankui-gene-editing-alzheimers/","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:00:00 GMT","

In 2018, a nervous-looking He Jiankui took the stage at a scientific conference in Hong Kong. A hush settled over the packed auditorium as the soft-spoken Chinese scientist adjusted his microphone and confirmed the circulating media reports: He had created the world's first gene-edited babies.

Three little girls were born with modifications to their genomes that were intended to protect them against HIV. The changes he'd made to their DNA were permanent and heritable, meaning they could be passed down to future generations.

A Chinese court sent him to prison for three years, and the Chinese government banned genome editing for reproductive purposes. Now He is trying to reestablish himself as a man out to change history.

Since his release in 2022, He says, he's worked on a gene therapy for boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He has yet to publish or share any results publicly, but he claims that a pharmaceutical company has taken on his Duchenne research and that funders are eager to help him continue his work. And He, who has set up an independent lab in south Beijing, recently started talking again about human embryo editing—this time to prevent Alzheimer's. With germline editing prohibited in nearly every country including the United States, his path forward is unclear.

Through it all, He has documented his life on social media. He has posted about his failed romance with self-styled “biotech Barbie” Cathy Tie, a Canadian former Thiel fellow and cofounder of a human embryo editing startup. A condition of this interview was that WIRED refer to He as a “pioneer of gene editing,” but he has more colorfully referred to himself on X as “Chinese Darwin,” “Oppenheimer in China,” and “China's Frankenstein.”

Here are 23 ways China is rewiring the future.

He often posts photos of himself in a crisp lab coat, posing alone near scientific equipment. One glaringly empty lab shot comes with the text “I did not violate ethics, I overturned it.” More recently he dropped the austere look and posted an image of himself seated on a giant throne with prehistoric animals at his feet, a rainbow beaming down on his crown, and a double helix adorning his purple robe.

WIRED spoke with He about designer babies—the ones already born and the ones he hopes to eventually produce. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Emily Mullin: Back in 2018 the scientific consensus was that gene editing was not a mature technology. Do you think it's mature now?

He Jiankui: Anyone who is the first in the world, no one can say it's mature. The Wright brothers who made the first flight, was it mature? Of course not, but they made history.

I'm lucky that Lulu, Nana, and the third girl were healthy; they're normal. We have observed them for seven, eight years now. So I think it's time to move on to hundreds of gene-edited babies. We should give a trial to maybe 300 now.

Do you keep in touch with the parents of the three babies?

Yes, we have regular contact.

And everything seems fine?

Yeah, they go to primary school. Their family is very happy with it.

Have their parents told them that they were gene-edited?

No.

What is your new lab focusing on?

The new lab is germline gene editing—embryo gene editing—and it is focusing on trying to prevent Alzheimer's disease.

What genes are you working on?

The APP-A673T mutation. This mutation was identified in the population in Iceland. People with this mutation are free of Alzheimer's and even live longer. They're healthy and normal. So we want to introduce the mutation to the next generation, so they will have the same mutation as Icelandic people and be free of Alzheimer's.

Are you currently working with human embryos?

For now, we're not getting into the embryo yet. We're still on human cell line experiments.

And you've been doing this for the past couple of months?

Yes.

Why are you more interested in embryo editing than in treating existing patients with gene editing?

Because it is going to change the world.

Where does your funding come from?

Donations and some people who provided early seed money. I don't talk to investors; they come to me. Maybe every week, an investor comes to Beijing, wants to have dinner with me and also wants to invest in me, or maybe they propose some business ideas. Also from Canada, from Russia, all kinds of places.

How much has your lab raised so far? Does this include any government grants?

50 million yuan [$7 million]. No government funding.

And you're hoping to raise more?

I need $10 million. With that money, I will finish the Alzheimer's work—from cell lines to mice to monkeys. And even a clinical trial, a small-scale clinical trial.

You mentioned on X that a patient had donated some money.

Oh, yes, the patient is an entrepreneur of a big company. Also his family has this disease.

Do you mean Alzheimer's, or another disease?

I cannot disclose the disease. It is the patient's privacy.

Is it fair to say that your funders are wealthy people who want their own babies to have protective traits?

No.

How many people are working in your lab on Alzheimer's?

It's just me plus two, three people.

Are you allowed to carry out a clinical trial in China given your criminal history?

Germline gene editing is currently banned in China. So all I'm doing in Beijing is human cell lines, mice and monkey embryos, then I'll stop. I wanted to start a lab in Austin, Texas, to continue the embryo editing research, but I don't have a passport.

So my new plan is to go to Hong Kong. But for the human trial, it has to be somewhere else. South Africa made it legal last year. [Editor's note: In August 2025, South Africa removed language from its national ethics guidelines that some had interpreted as potentially allowing heritable human genome editing.]

Do you think that South Africa would be receptive to you going there?

I already talked to people from South Africa. They showed great interest.

Are you allowed to leave the country?

It is possible.

You have condemned research on IQ enhancements, but some people might consider editing embryos to prevent Alzheimer's a form of enhancement. Where do you draw the line between disease prevention and enhancement?

Recently, some billionaires in Silicon Valley have been pushing forward to enhance human IQ, in particular in babies. I think that is a Nazi eugenic experiment. That should be stopped. The scientists working on this should be arrested if they want to enhance human IQ for the billionaires. With Alzheimer's or HIV, it's just for preventing human disease and never to enhance the IQ of a person.

How many years away do you think you are from trying to create babies that have been edited for Alzheimer's protection?

I need two years to finish mice and monkeys and also some human embryo studies. And then we wait for regulatory approval in South Africa. Or if Americans are OK with it, then we go to America, or Japan.

There are already animals being created from highly edited embryos. Like the dire wolves that were revealed in 2025 and the pigs that are being used for human transplants. Do you think it might be possible to one day do multiple genetic edits to a human embryo?

That's exactly what we are developing in our lab. We want to make 12 edits in one embryo and make it safe.

If we could have multiple edits that could prevent cancer, Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease, HIV, and others, in a panel of 10 to 20 genes, that will prevent all the major diseases that are happening today. The children born will be much healthier and maybe even live longer than us.

I could see this research being controversial to some people. How do you plan to avoid run-ins with Chinese authorities?

Just be open, transparent, do the right thing. I post my research plan on social media, so everybody knows what I am doing. My lab is also open. It's not a secret. People come visit. Unfortunately, it's not open for foreigners anymore due to national security reasons.

Have you had interactions with the Chinese government since you were in prison?

I'm not going to go against the law.

You gained instant fame with the birth of those babies and then spent time in prison, and now here you are continuing your work. What have you learned in this time?

The most important thing is, make sure the patient is happy. Make sure that it improves their health or happiness. That's the number one requirement for any medical research. You don't worry about ethics, national geopolitics, or anything.

Ma Qianzhu was unsatisfied with Chinese progress. An engineer at a large state-owned enterprise, he belonged to a generation that grew up believing engineering is destiny, that China's future would be built, bolt by bolt, by people like him. Then Ma discovered something extraordinary: a wormhole to the late Ming Dynasty. With more than 500 peers, he commandeered a ship and traveled back in time 400 years, to a preindustrial China wracked by foreign invasion and internal decay. Their mission: trigger an industrial revolution in the past that would, in the future, make modern China great (again).

Here are 23 ways China is rewiring the future.

This, strictly speaking, did not happen. It's the plot of The Morning Star of Lingao (临高启明), a sprawling, collectively written science-fiction web novel that has consumed a corner of the Chinese internet for nearly two decades. It now totals millions of words. It has never been translated into English. Almost no one in the West knows it exists.

But I would argue—somewhat less strictly speaking—that the events of the book did happen. That the time travel worked. And that the secret to understanding modern China is all right there, contained within its prophetic, often frightening pages.

In 2006, a post went up on SC BBS, China's earliest military-themed message board: What would you do if you could travel back to the Ming Dynasty with modern knowledge? The question struck a nerve. The Ming Dynasty occupies a painful place in Chinese historical consciousness. It was a period when Chinese civilization entered a long decline, ending in the so-called Great Divergence. Europe embraced discovery, ascent, and construction; China sealed itself off. Joseph Needham's famous question—“Why did modern science develop in Europe but not in China?”—has haunted modern Chinese intellectual life ever since.

The Morning Star of Lingao emerged as a kind of internet-fueled continuation of this historic discourse. As more people found the original post, forum discussions crystallized into serious, collective story-writing. If you could travel back to the Ming Dynasty with modern knowledge, these users decided, well, you'd obviously industrialize before Europe and win modernity.

Not everyone quite saw it that way. This was also the moment when China's internet began producing its first generation of liberal-minded intellectuals, who debated everything in a relatively free online space—air pollution, labor rights, the brutal relocations preceding Beijing's 2008 Olympic spectacle. I was a teenager coming of age in this internet. I bore witness to the Arab Spring and its Chinese-inspired “Jasmine Revolution.” I devoured Charter 08, a manifesto for political reform and human rights. In 2011, while I was in high school, the renowned blogger Han Han released his pro-democracy trilogy—“On Revolution,” “On Democracy,” “On Freedom.”

The Lingao writers had little interest in these values. If the novel didn't exactly inspire China's effort to industrialize, it certainly reflected and reinforced it, serving as a kind of sacred text. In 2011, a nationalist economist named Wang Xiaodong coined the term “Industrial Party”—not a literal party (there's effectively only one in China) but a way to refer to a circle of internet thinkers and influencers writing essays and cheering on plans the state had initiated. As the scholar Li Qiang has observed, the Industrial Party emphasized a pragmatic attitude of “shelving disputes and focusing on development.” The force they celebrated, ostensibly derived from industrial civilization, was actually development itself—progress as ideology, building as salvation. Revolution, democracy, freedom: These were distractions, even obstacles. What mattered was building. What mattered was speed.

And perhaps no figure better embodied the Industrial Party's evolution from internet subculture to influential public voice than the man who inspired the character of Ma Qianzhu—Ma Qianzu.

That's right: the fictional engineer in Lingao is based on a real-life engineer of the same name. (Or nearly: Their names differ by two Chinese characters.) The writing process for the book was extremely decentralized, so attribution is often messy, but there's a consensus that the real-life Ma was one of the book's writers. Ma—whose real name is actually Ren Chonghao, but he goes by his pen name—trained as a civil engineer and worked at the Suzhou Planning & Design Research Institute. He poured his own dreams and convictions into his fictional counterpart.

Ma's moment arrived in 2011. On July 23, two high-speed trains collided near Wenzhou, killing 40 people. The accident traumatized the nation for what it seemed to reveal about the costs of China's breakneck pace of development. A prominent essay captured the mood, its title becoming a rallying cry: “China, Slow Down, Wait for Your People.” The prose read almost like prayer: “China, please stop your flying pace, wait for your people, wait for your soul, wait for your morality, wait for your conscience!”

Ma and other Industrial Party voices responded with a counteroffensive. The solution wasn't to slow down but to double down, they said—to learn from mistakes, to push through the difficult phase when new technologies were still being mastered. And key to their campaign was Lingao itself. The writing of it became a phenomenon across Chinese internet forums in the 2010s: Its open source ethos and collaborative methods deeply appealed to China's burgeoning tech community. Beyond regular meetups among core contributors, Lingao's creation fostered the formation of China's “keyboard politics”—online communities where users engage in fierce debates about governance, policy, and national direction under the protection of pseudonyms. These conversations became staging grounds for political arguments that couldn't happen elsewhere, where amateur policy wonks, military enthusiasts, and armchair strategists honed their worldviews. In 2012, the nationalist commentary website Guancha (think of it as China's Breitbart) was founded, and its complex entanglement with Industrial Party thought and personnel networks demonstrated how far Lingao's influence extended beyond mere time-travel fiction.

Industrial Party ideology ends up being quite Darwinian. What matters most is the power that flows from industrial capacity. This contributes to what scholars refer to as the party's “aesthetic.” Fred Gao, a Beijing-based journalist who identifies with the Industrial Party and who briefly worked for Guancha, told me: “These people view industrialization as the highest form of beauty. Building things from nothing—that's their romanticism.”

Of course, the techno-nationalist impulse transcends borders. “Elon Musk is the ultimate Industrial Party figure,” Gao said. Musk's vision of colonizing Mars, his impatience with regulation, his worship of engineering solutions, his conviction that making physical things matters more than anything else—his “aesthetic has strong resonances with the Chinese Industrial Party,” Gao said. What differs is simply the political system that channels it.

Almost nobody, including me, can finish all the chapters of Lingao (to say nothing of the more than 1,400 derivative works). It's not just that it's too long. Reading it is quite painful. The novel's language and narrative structure are aggressively anti-literary. To write beautifully would be bourgeois, the Industrial Party seemed to believe. Technical descriptions veer into what feels like self-indulgence, an uncomfortable disregard for readers without STEM backgrounds.

The book asks questions like: How do you solve energy problems when you can't drill for oil? How do you begin mechanization without the machine tools to make machine tools? How do you produce nitric acid when you're starting from literally dirt? From Chapter 22, as the 500 time travelers plan their expedition to colonize Lingao County in Hainan (the southern island in China):

“Besides complete equipment sets, we need backup chemical engineering equipment: synthesis towers, absorption towers, decarburization towers, distillation columns, saturated hot water towers, various reaction kettles, pressure-resistant piping, acid pumps, heaters ... I estimate we need 500–600 tons of materials.”

“Can't we produce these ourselves? Our mechanical industry is fairly complete.”

“Material problems,” Ji Situi said. “Unless we can quickly produce stainless steel and polyethylene, domestic production of chemical equipment will be difficult within 10 years.”

It reminds me of Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, published in 1719. In the story, Crusoe reconstructs the distant island's physicality from first principles. He builds tools, domesticates animals, plants crops, constructs shelter, makes pottery, bakes bread, sews clothes. The novel works like an instruction manual because, just like Lingao, that is the point. Robinson Crusoe is among the first works of fiction to treat industriousness itself as heroic.

Yet Lingao gets at something more specific than Defoe's Enlightenment universalism: It reflects the moral worldview of China during its 21st-century industrial acceleration and nationalism. Consider this passage—the scene when the crew has just time-traveled after 47 chapters of preparation:

Behind them, a crimson sun erupts from the horizon, painting the sky red. The South China Sea's surface glitters with golden light as the dawn of a new world illuminates the time travelers for the first time. On deck, they rise involuntarily, overwhelmed by emotion:

I am witnessing history. I am creating history.

Intoxicated by this feeling, someone begins singing “Ode to the Motherland”:

The five-starred red flag flutters in the wind, Victory songs ring so clear, Wesing of our beloved motherland,

From today walking toward prosperity and strength …

First one voice, then many, then all. The soaring song pierces the clouds, resounding across the new world.

This is the emotional core of Lingao—and of the Industrial Party worldview. The novel never separates technological progress from nationalist revival. Building blast furnaces is patriotism. Engineering is loving your country. The characters in the novel are intoxicated by their mission, and the readers are intoxicated by the fantasy. And perhaps most importantly, the writers are intoxicated by the act of collective world-building itself—the collaborative construction of an alternate Chinese modernity.

Between 2000 and the mid-2020s, China's manufacturing output exploded nearly eightfold. The country became “the world's factory” not gradually but suddenly, and a feedback loop emerged: The Industrial Party worldview and China's actual industrialization reinforced each other. Meanwhile, Lingao provided a narrative framework that made China's development inevitable and righteous.

For educated urbanites, especially those with technical backgrounds, it felt like inhabiting science fiction. The Lingao contributors and readers—typically 20- to 40-year-old males in cities, many with STEM careers—were both witnesses to and agents of this transformation. They worked in the factories, the construction firms, the engineering offices. They experienced firsthand what concentrated state resources and marshaled technical expertise could achieve.

As Dan Wang argues in his book Breakneck, China has become the quintessential “engineering state.” When Xi Jinping stacks his government with aerospace and defense executives, when he demands manufacturing remain at 28 percent of GDP, when he boasts that China produces something in all UN industrial categories—he's speaking the Industrial Party gospel. “Productive forces are what fundamentally drive the development of human society,” he said in a May 2024 speech, “and are the final cause of all social and political changes.” Everything else—democracy, rights, culture—is derivative, subordinate, ultimately irrelevant compared to the question of whether you can manufacture advanced semiconductors or build hypersonic missiles.

But that first generation of liberal-minded intellectuals—the ones I grew up idolizing—hasn't given up. In fact, in recent years, cracks have appeared in the Industrial Party's armor. “Look at Ma Qianzu now,” says Fred Gao. “These past two years, he still talks about industrial systems, but increasingly he's discussing socialized childcare, how local governments should spend money, local debt problems, reflections on unlimited borrowing. The pure Industrial Party worldview—that building solves everything—can't address the structural problems China faces now.”

It's not just Ma. One of the original Lingao authors, writing under the pen name “The Boaster,” has largely withdrawn from public discourse. Those close to the project say he's focused on his day job, occasionally updating the novel but no longer engaging in the debates that once defined the Industrial Party circle. Even Wang, the economist who coined the name, has moderated his views. In recent years, he has said that China is not yet ready to sever ties with the West—a striking retreat from his earlier confrontational nationalism.

For many, “the Chinese Dream” has shattered. Birth rates have plummeted. Unemployment among youth has reached staggering levels. Can the “building more” spirit of Lingao still solve problems? I see doubt everywhere. You can't engineer your way out of a crisis of meaning when an entire generation of young people has chosen to—as the Chinese idiom goes—“lie flat,” rejecting the promise that endless work leads to prosperity.

In a sense, China's Industrial Party has lost its innocence. Just as in the endless Lingao, the boundless worship of industrialization has given way to more tangled narratives. In one of the novel's endings (there are many), the time travelers finally succeed in founding their nation. “All the time travelers gathered—a rare occasion—in the Transmigration Palace, a replica of the Soviet Palace designed by Ma Qianzhu himself ... The banquet tables overflowed with unimaginably exquisite foods ... rare wines of every kind ... truly a scene of indulgent excess and intoxication.” The dystopian absurdity reveals a degree of self-awareness: that power, taken to its extreme, leads to corruption and despotism; that if history can be rewritten, the real challenge comes after victory.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Your First Humanoid Robot Coworker Will Probably Be Chinese","https://www.wired.com/story/china-humanoid-robot-coworkers/","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:00:00 GMT","

The 4-foot-tall humanoid robot that's in front of me seems, quite honestly, a bit drunk. It leaps from one leg to the other, waving its arms. After 30 seconds or so it abruptly stops, then strides toward me with an arm outstretched.

The little robot is at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference, on the banks of the Huangpu river in Shanghai. The convention center is teeming with humanoids—dancing ones, box-toting ones, robot dog-walking ones doing circuits around trade show booths. A few lie slumped in a corner as their batteries recharge.

It's a balmy day in July, and I've come to Shanghai to learn how China's AI world differs from the Western one I usually cover. I'd immediately noticed the sleek electric cars from BYD, Xiaomi, and Huawei that fill the streets of the city's fashionable old French Concession. At Manner, a high-end coffee chain, I sampled an avant-garde beverage called a “sparkling citrus iced Americano.” Now that I'm at the convention, I can't help but picture these dancing robots strolling Shanghai's streets and perhaps carrying their owner's shopping bags.

A group crowds around a small boxing ring, where two humanoids throw punches at each other. One falls down, then gets back on its haunches and straightens up. A young woman offers to let me punch a humanoid. I feel certain that this would make me feel bad, so I decline.

The activity in this convention center is a bit of a mirage, of course. Amid the throngs, you can spot people holding game controllers. They're giving the robots high-level instructions. The humanoids can control their balance and execute short routines, but it's humans who tell them which way to walk, whom to shake hands with, or when to backflip. Another limitation: Many humanoids don't have fingers. Their arms usually end in stumps, meaning that while they can hold and lift boxes (or wear boxing gloves, they can't grasp anything.

Here are 23 ways China is rewiring the future.

Even so, experts predict that robots will have profound effects on the workforce and the economy. Amazon is testing humanoids from an American startup called Agility and, according to leaked memos, expects to replace a significant number of workers with robots in the next few years. Bank of America analysts predict that by 2035, robot makers will ship 10 million humanoids a year. Morgan Stanley forecasts that by 2050 a billion will be in use, with almost a third of them—302.3 million—in China, compared with 77.7 million in the US.

Perhaps no humanoid maker has a bigger lead than a Hangzhou-based company called Unitree. While Elon Musk's Optimus staggers through its demos, Unitree's robots are doing sprints, kung-fu kicks, and acrobatic backflips. (The conference's dancing door greeter was a Unitree.) Unitree's legged robots are also incredibly cheap, costing tens of thousands of dollars or less, a tenth of what a typical humanoid in the US costs. Unitree is China's most prominent robotics startup, a national champion for its tech industry, and is reportedly targeting a $7 billion IPO listing in Shanghai. And if Unitree fails? A staggering 200-plus other Chinese companies are also developing humanoids, which recently prompted the Chinese government to warn of overcapacity and unnecessary replication. The US has about 16 prominent firms building humanoids.

With stats like that, one can't help but suspect that the first country to have a million humanoids will be China.

With its 43 motors and powerful onboard computers, a Unitree G1 can do kicks, flips, and dance moves.

Unitree's home city of Hangzhou is about 110 miles from Shanghai. The place is famous for its vast and photogenic West Lake, but it's also home to Alibaba, the ecommerce giant, Ant Group (one of Alibaba's affiliates), and several fast-growing AI startups. Besides Unitree, this includes DeepSeek, whose open source AI models enjoy global popularity.

I'm hoping to visit Unitree along with a few other companies. Unlike many of its rivals, Unitree sells a wide range of legged robots and is profitable. Unfortunately, I find the company largely off-limits to visitors as it prepares for the IPO. I later hear that the headquarters is battleworn: A set of stairs inside the entrance is battered from legged robots practicing carrying heavy payloads. “It is one of the most run-down places you can imagine,” says Mike Cho, a robotics entrepreneur based in Singapore who has spent time there. “Everywhere there are broken robots, broken parts, and broken concrete.”

Later I connect with Wang Xingxing, Unitree's CEO, who, citing his poor English, agreed to talk via the messaging app WeChat. Wang is something of a celebrity in China. In February 2025, he was invited to an event hosted by the Chinese premier, Xi Jinping, along with several members of China's tech royalty (Alibaba's Jack Ma; Huawei's founder and CEO, Ren Zhengfei; BYD's chairman and CEO, Wang Chuanfu; and the CEO of Xiaomi, Lei Jun). At the conference in Shanghai, I'd seen Wang deliver a keynote speech in rapid-fire Mandarin. He told the crowd that he planned to build robots adept at “serving tea, working in factories, or even performing arts.”

On WeChat, he tells me that he's been fascinated by robots since he was a kid. During his first year at university, he cobbled together a small, two-legged robot on a budget of 200 RMB ($28). “The moment I saw the robot I designed come to life,” Wang writes, “the sense of achievement from combining technology and creativity made me determined to devote myself to robotics research.”

As a master's student at Shanghai University in 2015, he built a small, four-legged robot for less than 20,000 RMB (about $2,800). It became a social media hit; people marveled that a student could build such a sure-footed, low-cost machine. He worked briefly for the drone company DJI before receiving a small amount of seed funding and establishing Unitree in 2016. The company released its first product, a robot dog called Laikago, in 2017.

Wang admits that, early on, Boston Dynamics and its fourlegged robot Spot were an inspiration. Gavin Kenneally, CEO of Ghost Robotics, recalls seeing Laikago at trade shows and conferences. “Their robot really wasn't very capable,” he tells me. But while Spot sold for $75,000, Laikago cost only $25,000.

In 2019, a team at MIT developed an electric motor that would allow its quadruped, Mini Cheetah, to run at record speeds. Less than a year later, Unitree unveiled a new fourlegged robot, A-1. “It was basically an exact copy of the MIT Mini Cheetah,” Kenneally says. “It was leaps and bounds ahead of their previous platform.”

Unitree's business took off. In 2023 its sales of quadrupeds were 10 times higher than Boston Dynamics', according to the consulting firm SemiAnalysis. Nearly 24,000 Unitree quadrupeds were sold for use, among other places, on construction sites and oil rigs and in factories. The robots can climb stairs and traverse rubble to conduct inspections or security patrols.

Disassemble a Unitree robot and you'll see the incredible advantages of China's tightly integrated manufacturing, where strong relationships with suppliers can make or break a company. SemiAnalysis looked at one configuration of Unitree's newest quadrupeds, Go2, priced at about $8,000. All of its core components—the sensors, motors, gearbox, battery, computer—cost only $3,272, the consulting firm found. (Unitree prices other Go2 configurations as low as $1,600.) “What they've done is to iterate extremely quickly, using Chinese manufacturing and supply chains,” Kenneally tells me.

Wang wasn't only interested in robot dogs. Boston Dynamics had been working on a humanoid called Atlas for years. By 2023 Wang was watching Musk whip up enthusiasm for humanoids with his Optimus demos, and Wang started to develop a humanoid of his own. In August of that year, Unitree released its first model, H1. Less than a year after that, Unitree started selling the more capable G1, which costs a little over $13,500 for academic users. This past summer, the company unveiled an even cheaper but less advanced humanoid called R1, which sells for just 39,999 RMB ($5,700).

During his WAIC speech, Wang had hinted that a revolution in robotic intelligence is on the horizon. “The ‘ChatGPT moment' for robots will come when a robot can enter an unfamiliar room, take a bottle of water to someone, or tidy up autonomously after a simple command,” he told attendees. “This could happen in one to three years if fast, or three to five years at most.”

Plenty of roboticists believe they'll get their “ChatGPT moment” soon enough, though the question, of course, is how that's defined. I had reason to suspect, though, that Wang leans optimistic. At a recent major robotics conference in Hangzhou, a panel of experts surveyed the room on whether humanoids would take over most human jobs by 2050. Wang was one of the few who thought they would.

I hurry to catch a flight to Beijing to visit another outfit eyeing robots' ChatGPT moment. The Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence is a nonprofit founded in 2018 by the city government to coordinate AI research. From a window in the BAAI's robotics lab, on an upper floor of a squat office building, I can see the sprawling campuses of Tsinghua University and Peking University, two of China's most prestigious schools. Despite its academic outlook, the BAAI has attracted the US government's attention. In May 2025, the US Commerce Department added the institute to its Entity List, barring it from acquiring American technology. The US government accuses the BAAI of “attempting to acquire U.S.-origin items in support of China's military modernization,” although staff at the BAAI insist it is simply a research lab.

At the academy I meet another dancing Unitree robot. This one assumes a wide stance, then stomps its legs and pumps its fists to a beat. I hadn't seen these moves before, and for good reason. The humanoid is using an experimental approach, in which an AI model learns by observing human movement—in this case, dance routines from Douyin, China's version of TikTok.

Zhongyuan Wang, president of the BAAI and head of its robotics work, tells me about the institute's new open-source robotics model, Robobrain 2.0, which its engineers built to merge a language model's abilities with spatial reasoning. Robots have yet to take full advantage of language models' broad capabilities, and the hope is that LLMs will help robots operate in unfamiliar situations and communicate better. In one experiment, BAAI researchers used Robobrain 2.0 to control a pair of robot arms. When the model heard someone say “I'm hungry, make me a burger,” it translated the statement into actions that commanded the robot arms to place lettuce and meat in a bun.

But language models can only do so much, and what robots need most urgently is a new kind of model that understands the physical world the way an LLM understands the written word. And to build that model, engineers need way more data. While walking around BAAI, I see scores of workers behind desks. They're teleoperating various robot arms and grippers to teach algorithms simple manipulation tasks such as sweeping up beans on a table, pouring liquids from a jug into different cups, and picking items from shelves. A young man wearing a virtual reality headset appears to be making tea as a camera records his every move. The idea is that with enough training data, robots will intuit how to do all sorts of things without specific training.

The trouble is, nobody quite knows what data is most useful to the robots, let alone how much they need or how best to collect it. And for humanoids to become ubiquitous, people need to invent hardware that better mimics a human hand. For a robot, doing a backflip is a lot easier than flipping a coin.

Still, Tony Zhao, cofounder and CEO of Sunday Robotics, a California-based startup, tells me he worries that companies like his don't stand much of a chance against Chinese firms, which can bring on more workers, like BAAI's teleoperators, to train robot models and rapidly roll out new hardware. “The iteration speed, the US is losing there,” he says. “And honestly I don't know how we can win.”

To try to keep up, Zhao recently recruited an executive from a Chinese robotics company with deep connections and experience tapping into China's vast and complex supply chain. “The only way we can beat Chinese companies is to build a China team,” he says.

Some US CEOs, including Demis Hassabis of Google DeepMind and Lachy Groom of Physical Intelligence, both of whom are chasing the robo-ChatGPT moment, have told me they imagine robotics development roughly mirroring that of smartphones, where China makes the hardware and the US makes the brains. (Except that Huawei is now making both.)

The answer might be that the US government needs to get involved, suggests Jonathan Hurst, cofounder and chief robot officer of Agility, which makes humanoids. He's imagining, among other things, heavy investment in advanced domestic manufacturing, such as tax incentives for firms that use robots in their warehouses and factories, as a way to prop up domestic robotics firms. Such a strategy might start to mimic the Chinese government's patient capital investment in its industries. “We have to be very smart about automation,” he says. “It is the only way.”

My hotel in Beijing, in the high-tech hub of Zhongguancun, didn't have any of the wheeled robots that routinely deliver items to guests' rooms at some big-city hotels. Instead, mine had an unfailingly polite human called Stephen. When I needed to get a shirt cleaned, Stephen got the job done in just a few hours. As I flew home at the end of my trip, I reflected on how many hands had washed, pressed, packaged, and transported the garment back at such speed. Even in China, the robots have not yet won.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","23 Ways You're Already Living in the Chinese Century","https://www.wired.com/china-issue/","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:00:12 GMT","

A decade ago, China's political leaders laid out an ambitious industrial plan: By 2025, they pledged, their country would be a world capital, with the goal of moving from “Chinese speed to Chinese quality, the transformation of Chinese products to Chinese brands.” This is the difference, they wrote, between “Made in China” and “Created in China.”

At WIRED, we never take what the government (ours or anybody else's) says at face value. Still, as journalists, we respect the ability to hit a deadline. While the president of this country is promising to make America great again as he strips it for parts, Chinese business and political leaders have quietly seized the moment. This is not to say that China's economy, let alone its repressive totalitarian government, runs perfectly. But today there's almost no limit to what is created in China, then eagerly consumed by the rest of the world.

WIRED's reporters have chronicled the transformation in the Made in China newsletter—and now we're bringing you this special issue. Here are 23 ways China is rewiring the future.

A staggering 200-plus Chinese companies are trying to build humanoid robots. In the US, it's closer to 16.

“Nature has been very kind to Donghai,” explains a plaque at the Donghai Crystal Museum. Blessed with rich deposits of clear quartz, this county in eastern China once supplied raw material for Mao Zedong's transparent coffin. Today, thanks to decades of cutthroat capitalist hustle—including an army of 24/7 livestreamers raised by a local Party secretary—Donghai orchestrates the multibillion-dollar global crystal trade. Here's where that tower of Brazilian amethyst in a London yoga studio, that Colombian quartz on the reception desk of a Miami Botox clinic, and that Zambian citrine in an overpriced tourist shop in Tulum really came from.

Amount of milk, in pounds, that a cloned ""super cow"" in China can produce annually—almost double the output of a typical American bovine.

“Made in China” used to be—and still often is—a label for cheap labor, knockoffs, and $5 gadgets. Now it also means state-of-the-art technology assembled anywhere in the world. To illustrate the trend, WIRED mapped the global manufacturing footprint of China's massive battery industry. In 2024, more than 80 percent of the world's battery cells were produced in China. Today those companies are rapidly expanding and building factories on nearly every continent.

Estimated number of Chinese-made electric vehicles sold in 2025. In that time, the US sold roughly a tenth as many.

For the past six years at least, the United States and China have been locked in a space race to put people on the moon. The US mission, however, has been a boondoggle from the start. NASA's leaders settled on a plan of baffling complexity: a single trip to the lunar surface could require 40-plus rocket launches, while China's mission will have two. Then President Trump pushed thousands of NASA employees to quit; the White House proposed a massive budget cut; and Trump installed a former reality TV star as NASA's part-time acting chief. If you want a microcosm of the political psychosis gripping Washington, you could do worse. As one former top-ranking NASA official put it, “We did the worst of all worlds. We positioned it as a race without planning to win.” Read more

Tons of clothing waste produced in a year by China, the largest manufacturer of textiles worldwide.

In 2018, a scientist named He Jiankui revealed that he had created the world's first gene-edited babies. The Chinese government sent him to prison for three years. Now a free man, He relies on private donors to fund his work at a small independent lab in Beijing. WIRED caught up with him as he tries to reestablish himself as “China's Frankenstein.”

Ma Qianzhu was unsatisfied with Chinese progress. An engineer at a large state-owned enterprise, he belonged to a generation that grew up believing engineering is destiny, that China's future would be built, bolt by bolt, by people like him. Then Ma discovered something extraordinary: a wormhole to the late Ming Dynasty. With more than 500 peers, he commandeered a ship and traveled back in time 400 years, to a preindustrial China wracked by foreign invasion and internal decay. Their mission: trigger an industrial revolution in the past that would, in the future, make modern China great (again).

This, strictly speaking, did not happen. It's the plot of The Morning Star of Lingao (临高启明), a sprawling, collectively written science-fiction web novel that has consumed a corner of the Chinese internet for nearly two decades. It now totals millions of words. It has never been translated into English. Almost no one in the West knows it exists. Read more

World record for most drones controlled by a single computer, at a show in Liuyang last year.

Jade Gu was playing a romantic video game on her phone when she saw Charlie—and fell in love. Being an in-game character, Charlie wasn't the most available boyfriend. So Gu re-created Charlie as a chatbot. Then she started occasionally hiring a cosplayer to impersonate Charlie on dates with her around Beijing. In China, where women dominate the market for AI companions, Gu is one of many women who are finding creative ways to be in love. Read more

While the European Union inches its way toward comprehensive AI regulation—and the US pretty much twiddles its thumbs—the Cyberspace Administration of China has worked out a more ad hoc approach to oversight: the algorithm registry.

Any company launching an AI tool with “public opinion properties or social mobilization capabilities” must first show the CAC how the product avoids some 31 categories of risk, from age and gender discrimination to psychological harm to “violating core socialist values.”

Over time, the CAC has inadvertently created the most detailed map of a nation's AI ecosystem anywhere in the world. WIRED looked inside.

Hours it takes the Chinese company Broad Group to erect a 10-story building.

By now, major headlines have caught on to the reality that China's renewable energy revolution is one of the biggest stories in the world, while Donald Trump's anti-renewable vision of American energy dominance is a backward sideshow by comparison. But chroniclers of this green tech transformation almost always understate its chaos. At this point, it is far less a tightly managed, top-down creation of state subsidies than a runaway train of competition. The resulting, onrushing utopia is anything but neat. And absolutely no one—least of all some monolithic “China” at the control switch—knows how to deal with its repercussions. Read more

Gigawatts of new solar capacity that China—the world's worst polluter—installed in the first half of 2025, more than double the rest of the world.

Every year, more Chinese adoptees send off DNA kits, upload photographs, or submit their DNA to the National Reunion Database. As databases grow and social networks interconnect, the chance of reunion grows. Chinese police now use not only DNA analysis but also face recognition to help families reunite. Some adoptees post their story on RedNote, a social media platform similar to TikTok. What once felt like an impossible quest now feels like a movement. For Youxue and thousands of others, every reunion proves that the past is not sealed off forever. Read more

WIRED took a peek over the Great Firewall to see how a billion-plus people fill their home screens. These made-in-China apps are must-haves (because you can't have anything else).

Is Ne Zha the ugliest main character in the history of animated cinema? The Hunchback of Notre Dame might have him beat, but Quasimodo's ugliness is ennobling; Ne Zha's is corrupting. Not only does he have sunken eyes, bad teeth, and the world's worst haircut, he's also a complete shit. He throws tantrums. He breaks things. He drops trou and pisses wherever he pleases. The Americans I know who've tried to watch either of his two movies shut them off within moments, disgusted.

Not that this little freak needs Americans. Ne Zha II, which came out in China last year, was the first non-Hollywood film to hit $1 billion in a single market. Eventually it doubled that, making it the biggest animated movie of all time. When A24, the hotshot indie studio, picked it up for American distribution, with Michelle Yeoh lending her credibility to the English-language dub, the reaction was: How have I not heard of this? (The first Ne Zha barely registered in America.) Followed by: Why is it so gross? Expand

Number of surveillance cameras across China—more than the rest of the world combined.

Increasingly, it's not imported luxury goods that are popular in China—it's homegrown items. Here are some of the most quirky trends we've spotted recently. Some of them might be showing up in America's malls. Some never will.

For some Chinese kids as young as 5, a smartwatch from a company called Little Genius has become the center of their social world. They chat and share videos, run and play Ping Pong, and send “likes” to their friends, among countless other activities. The more engaged they are, the higher kids rise in Little Genius' social rankings—a dynamic that can fuel relentless competition. Some kids or teens have reportedly used bots to juice their numbers, hacked the devices to dox their enemies, and even dated people they've met through their watches. Read more

Miles in China's high-speed rail network. America's national rail operator, Amtrak, runs 21,000 miles, almost none of it high-speed.

Why did the entire world go mad for a grinning rabbit-gremlin collectible from China? Everywhere Labubu went last year, I went too. I made pilgrimages to stores across four countries. I time-traveled to Hong Kong's early-2000s underground toy scene. If some of the mania around Labubu has cooled, that's just what the company wanted, its COO, Si De, told me. Pop Mart significantly ramped up production last year, and it cracked down on scalpers, which made Labubus easier to buy.

Still, China's first big global pop culture hit isn't going anywhere. Pop Mart has expanded manufacturing to Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Mexico. Sony Pictures has a Labubu feature film in the works. Even Tim Cook has a Labubu now. —Zeyi Yang

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Jimmy Wales Will Never Edit Donald Trump's Wikipedia Page: He ‘Makes Me Insane'","https://www.wired.com/story/the-big-interview-podcast-jimmy-wales/","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:30:00 GMT","

Wikipedia's Jimmy Wales has been called the last decent tech baron. It's sounds like a flattering label, although one I usually associate more with yacht-dwelling meatheads who feed their herds of cattle homegrown macadamia nuts; the kind of person who can most recently be found wining and dining with the President of the United States and his coterie of MAGA sycophants.

Wales, on the other hand, keeps things relatively low-key. Even as the site he founded, Wikipedia, turns 25 years old this month, he seems more interested in fixing his home Wi-Fi than joining the tech elite's performative power games. He has also spent the past few months promoting a new book, The Seven Rules of Trust, that uses Wikipedia's overarching strategy and unlikely rise to articulate Wales' playbook for fixing much of what's broken in today's deeply polarized and antagonistic society.

On this week's episode of The Big Interview, Wales and I discussed what it means to build something used by billions of people that's not optimized for growth at all costs. During our discussion he reflected on Wikipedia's messy, human origins, the ways it's been targeted by governments from Russia to Saudi Arabia, and the challenges of holding the line on neutrality in an online ecosystem hostile to the notion that facts even exist. We also talked about what threatens Wikipedia now, from AI to conspiracy-pilled billionaires, and why he'll never edit an entry about Donald Trump. Read our full conversation below.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

KATIE DRUMMOND: Jimmy Wales, welcome to The Big Interview. Thank you so much for being here.

JIMMY WALES: Thanks for having me on.

We always start these conversations with a few quick questions, like a little warmup for your brain. Are you ready?

Yes.

What's an internet rabbit hole you've fallen into most recently?

Home Assistant. I've just started using Home Assistant to run smart home devices, and there's a huge community and thousands of things to read about and so on and so forth. So it's what I'm obsessed with.

What is this community doing?

Troubleshooting. People are working on extensions to deal with every kind of thing in the world, and it's amazing.

What's a subject you never argue about online anymore?

I would say I don't argue with anybody about trans issues. There's absolutely no point in it. It's too toxic. I never did argue about it, but I don't even talk about it.

You're just going to stay away.

Yeah, it's too unpleasant.

What do you trust more: Wikipedia or ChatGPT?

Definitely Wikipedia.

I had to ask. What's your favorite website or app that is not Wikipedia?

I really do like parts of Reddit. There's some really great communities on Reddit, and great people. I lurk and read in the personal finance subreddit. There's just a lot of really nice people there. I'm always amazed by it.

Reddit is really having a moment. I find that I spend a lot more time lurking in the Reddit app on my phone, because I would rather read thoughtful conversations than scroll on X.

That's exactly it. It's like a place with paragraphs.

And often really thoughtful people. What is the best thing about living in the UK versus the US?

Well, my family's here. I always say this about the US: Tech is in Silicon Valley, and politics is in Washington, and movies and showbiz are in LA, and finance is in New York. But all those things are in London.

So if I lived in Silicon Valley, I would only have tech friends because that's who lives there. Whereas in London, it's much more comprehensive. All kinds of people. So I like that.

If you weren't involved in Wikipedia, what do you think you would be doing instead? What's the road not taken?

I would probably be a programmer, because I really enjoy coding and I really enjoy making things.

What's harder: building trust or keeping trust?

They're kind of the same thing, but I think building trust is harder. Particularly these days, when we are in an era with such low trust that you have to get past people's skepticism. I mean, part of trust is you can make mistakes and people forgive you because they do fundamentally trust you. Obviously you can lose it by violating it, but I think getting it in the first place is really important.

I have to admit, and this is very embarrassing for me because I'm Canadian, and I historically have liked to keep a low profile. But when I was doing research to get ready for this taping with you, I realized that I have a Wikipedia page. So Jimmy, I have to ask you, what does that mean? What does it mean at this moment to have a Wikipedia page? Does that mean that I've made it?

Mainly it just means there's enough third-party, neutral, high-quality sources to be able to put together a biography and collate the information about you and so forth. I have to admit, I didn't look up your Wikipedia page before this.

Oh, that's totally fine.

I hope it's not too bad. I hope it's OK. But in general, you know, it is not that we have recognized you, it's that the world has somehow. That's reflected in the sources, and therefore it ends up in Wikipedia.

One of the issues I'm now dealing with—I mean, this is a minor issue—is, sure, there are third-party sources, but those include small podcasts that I've talked to that a friend hosts where I share information about my spouse and my child, and then you realize, “Oh, that's now on Wikipedia.” I'd love it if it wasn't, but it's a lesson that you learn as you go. Have you experienced that with your own existence on Wikipedia?

I think for a lot of people when you enter the public eye in some capacity, often you don't really realize it because you're on a small podcast with your friend and you're saying, “Oh yeah, whatever. No one's gonna listen to this.” But eventually they might.

So yeah, I've had some funny experiences. One funny experience was when somebody vandalized my Wikipedia page to say that “in his spare time he enjoys playing chess with his friends,” which I love the sound of …

That doesn't sound particularly insulting.

It's not bad, but it's not true. Unfortunately, what happened is during a small gap of time before somebody took it out, because they didn't have a source, some let's just say … slightly lazy journalist actually took it from Wikipedia and put it in a biography magazine piece about me.

Oh my God.

So then there was a source, and I'm like, “Well, hold on a second.” So I contacted the journalist, and I'm like, “Where did you get that?” And they're like, “Well, it was in Wikipedia.” I'm like, “Well, it didn't have a source.” It is not there now, I don't think.

I got invited to do the ceremonial first move in the World Chess Championship. I wonder why; maybe they read in a magazine that I'm a big chess fanatic.

That's really funny. You've been doing a lot of press lately around the book. I was reading a bunch of interviews, and obviously Wikipedia is in the headlines often; I read in one of these interviews that you describe yourself as shy. I'm curious about how you handle being the face of Wikipedia, the author of a book, someone out there doing press. What's that experience like?

It's a funny thing, because I think a lot of people have a hard time getting their heads around that. I do a lot of public speaking, and I do things like this and so on and so forth, and that somehow doesn't bother me at all. I can give a speech to 5,000 people in a room. I don't mind it. It's no big deal.

Actually, for the book, probably where this came up is that Dan Gardner, who I worked with on the book, it's thanks to him that we interviewed people, because he's like, “Yeah, we need to interview people.” Like, we interviewed Thomas Friedman and I'm like, “Well, I've known Tom for years and consider him a friend. I'm a little shy to ask him for an interview,” which sounds like nonsense. And I did, and he was great. So it's that sort of thing. I really like working, I don't like working in a big office with lots of people and lots of meetings. I just wanna get on my computer in a quiet room like this one. That's just much better for me.

Let me back up a little bit. You're originally from Huntsville, Alabama. You left your PhD program to get into tech. Was there a specific moment you remember in your academic time where you decided to leave?

I was really at a point where I wasn't enjoying it. I was a research assistant for a top professor, and then he went off for the summer while I was trying to do my summer paper, which was a big deal. It didn't go well. He wasn't there to help me. At the end of that process I was like, “I just really don't like this.”

A friend who worked in Chicago said, “Well, why are you doing it if you don't like it?” And I said, “Well, I always wanted to work in the markets, but getting an undergraduate degree from the University of Alabama in finance, I couldn't get any good job.” And they said, “Well, come and talk to my boss,” because she worked in the financial markets. I did, and they offered me a job.

From there, we get to something called Nupedia, which was new to me. It was an online encyclopedia with a much more traditional model: articles written by experts, a formal peer-review process. Sort of a precursor to Wikipedia. Can you talk a little bit about that origin story?

Somebody said this to me just recently, and I never thought of it this way. I was describing Nupedia and how it worked, and there was a seven-stage review process to get anything published, and they said, “So that was the Seven Rules of Mistrust.” I said, “Actually, yes.”

A whole system where you had to fax in your CV to prove you were qualified. In other words, there was that challenge of like, “Oh, I don't trust you.” You have to prove every step of the way. As opposed to the open, sort of friendly, “Hey, I'm doing this project, come and help me. Let's start writing together.” There was a lot to learn, and a lot didn't work because it was no fun whatsoever writing for Nupedia because it was very intimidating.

It sounds like a slog. There's a really fraught, and very moving, story in the book about your daughter, where you realize that digital publishing and the internet and access to information wasn't working as quickly as it needed to, which then led to this notion of Wikipedia, if I'm remembering correctly.

I had been working on Nupedia for nearly two years, and it wasn't going well. We had, you know, a couple dozen articles done. In fact, one of the first articles that we published we had to retract, because it was found to contain plagiarism. As soon as we put it out, within three days somebody goes, “Actually, this huge passage is copied from somewhere else.” I was like, “Oh dear. OK. That's upsetting, because that's the whole point of all that review.” It didn't really work. I was discouraged.

Then, when Kira was born, she was very ill and in the hospital, and she had meconium aspiration syndrome and I met the doctor who was explaining it to me. Obviously, I rushed to the internet to try and research what this was, and it was pretty bad. You know, I could find a few blog posts and some academic literature, which was way above my head. I said, “Wow, we really do need an encyclopedia.”

That was December 26, when she was born. I came back on January 15, and I was like, “That's it. We've gotta do this.” I sort of ripped up the whole thing. I installed the Wiki software, which was an open source, very simple wiki package at the time. It was so simple, it didn't even have real passwords. You could create an account, but your account wouldn't have a password, so anybody could log in as anybody. It wasn't even a finished product really, but I just thought we have to get started, because this is really important and life's too short. So we did. And it fortunately worked out.

It did work out. You know, when I think about Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation more broadly, “scrappy” is a word that comes to mind. But today, the foundation has over 600 full-time employees across 54 countries. Your annual operating budget for 2025, 2026—when I say “your,” I'm referring to the foundation—$207.5 million in revenue against a similar number in expenses. That's enormous. I'm curious about the experience of actually scaling Wikipedia.

There's a few things to say about that. So first, some 2 billion devices see Wikipedia every month. It's a pretty small staff compared …

I mean I certainly agree with that.

So it's relative, but yeah, it's a much bigger organization than it used to be. The other thing is there's two tracks that you can think about almost as being somewhat independent. That is the growth of the community and the website, which was very successful and did very well over a long period of time. Then the growth of the foundation, which is the nonprofit organization that owns and operates it, and that was a much bumpier ride. The foundation in the very early days was way too small. People wanted us to do things, but I'm like, well, there's just me here and two other people. We can't do anything.

Then, you know, any growing organization has growing pains. I'm not talking about anything exotic or unique to Wikipedia. You make a few bad hires early on and you're like, “Oh, that didn't work out.” It took some time to think about professionalizing the foundation, while at the same time keeping that real community spirit. A lot of the foundation staff are Wikipedians first. They come to things through being well-known on Wikipedia. Other people come in from various expertise, so that's always a challenge. I'm always a little bit forgiving of companies that hyperscale really, really quickly. Because to go from zero employees to 600 over 25 years, that's some growth. But there are companies that go from zero to 12,000 in just a few years, and it's like, wow. That's gotta be a complete nightmare.

One of the unique challenges to Wikipedia in a global context is that if you're operating in 54 countries, you're going to be running into regimes around the world, authoritarian governments, who want to control the flow of information that you're providing in ways that Americans are not accustomed to. Right?

It is something that we've dealt with for years, and I assume we always will, but it does seem to be a little more difficult more recently, as we see increased legal problems in different places that are clearly politically motivated. For example, we've been issued several fines in Russia, which obviously we don't pay; we don't exist in Russia, so we're just ignoring them.

We're under threat of block in various places. We are completely blocked in China at the moment. We were blocked in Turkey for about three years, and we fought that. Then obviously we have volunteers who are sometimes at risk. We had a volunteer in Belarus who was arrested. We've had a couple of volunteers in Saudi Arabia arrested. These things are heavy, and we really take them seriously. It is true, whatever's going on politically in the US, which is a lot, we still have the First Amendment.

Ironically, at the same time they're canceling the visas of people who they politically don't agree with, they're also sort of campaigning that Europe shouldn't censor people's speech. So they're a mixed bag on that front. The idea for most Americans that somebody is engaging in a dangerous and heroic act, just to write down that Russia invaded Ukraine, is really something to get your head around.

I think it bears repeating that Wikipedia editors are volunteers. They are doing this in their spare time. They're not being paid. What are the limits of your ability to protect them in these contexts? What can you do, and what do you do?

There are limits. We've had cases in the past where it's really hard. Sometimes volunteers would come to me and say, “Oh, why aren't you writing a statement to The New York Times?” I was like, “Well, actually, behind the scenes, one of the problems is that sometimes the families prefer to just lay low.” If you make a big deal out of something the person who might have been in prison for six months could have it arbitrarily extended to 10 years—or be executed.

These are really hard problems. What we try to do is work with the right professionals, like human rights lawyers. We liaise with law firms in whatever jurisdiction to do what we can. But the truth is, in many cases, it's a genuine risk that people are facing. One of the important things that people can and should do is be very, very careful about their privacy online. Use a VPN, really take the technical measures to protect yourself, because that's probably as effective, probably more effective, than what anybody can do for you after the fact, depending on where you are and what's going on, obviously.

Does that advice feel more salient in the United States than it did a couple years ago?

I always say I'm a pathological optimist, so I'm not too worried. But in one interview I started talking about something and the interviewer said, “Jimmy, you're not cheering me up. You're supposed to be the optimist here.” I was like, “I don't think Trump is gonna have a coup, or engage in a coup. I don't. I hope not.”

But you might as well use that VPN.

That's one example in the technology world where—I mean, I live in the UK and VPNs are under political attack. VPNs are demonized as something terrible.

Literally everybody should be using a VPN. Do you use public Wi-Fi and you're not on a VPN? That's a really bad idea. Use them and be serious about them, because it's actually very important.

I want to ask you a little bit about bias. In The Seven Rules of Trust you talk about the importance of sticking to the facts, and that comes up over and over. It's very much a core principle that informs how Wikipedia is run, how it's edited, what ends up sticking to the page and what doesn't.

Whether it's Wikipedia or a newspaper, there is a really important element of trust to non-biased publication of information, right? Share this point of view, share that point of view, but don't, as Wikipedia, take a point of view. There has been, and continues to be, especially in the media, a very heated debate about the idea of objectivity, about the idea of unbiased publishing and whether that's even possible.

It sounds like you certainly think that it is, and I'm curious for you to share how that actually works for someone to sit down and edit a Wikipedia entry. Maybe they themselves have very strong feelings about Ukraine, about abortion, about whatever the subject is, but how does setting that aside actually work in practice?

If somebody says to me, “Oh, I don't think neutrality is even possible. I don't think there's such a thing.” I say, “But wait, do you think there's such a thing as bias? Do you agree that Fox News is biased?” “Oh, yes, yes. They're definitely biased.” “Well, could they be less biased?” Yes. OK. Well, that's what I'm talking about.

Be less biased. Be more neutral. We don't have to have a magical, perfect ideal of neutrality to say there are ways to get it wrong and let's try to avoid that. If you really feel super emotional about a particular topic, it's going be hard to be a good Wikipedia writer on that topic. You should probably just avoid it. This is what I do. I wouldn't edit anything about Donald Trump, because the man makes me insane. I just think I would find it hard to write in a dispassionate manner. But at the same time, I do think it's possible.

A lot of people come to Wikipedia with a spirit of goodwill and collaboration. The classic example I give is a kind and thoughtful Catholic priest and a kind and thoughtful Planned Parenthood activist. They're going to work together writing about abortion. They both understand Wikipedians can't take a side, can't say abortion is a sin. It can say the Catholic Church position on abortion is such and such, and critics have said this, and the Pope has responded that, and so on and so forth. There's sort of two elements here. One is: How emotional you are about it. That can be a problem if you can't calm yourself down enough. But in other cases, how ideological you are might not inhibit you from writing in a fair way. I mean, that Catholic priest and that Planned Parenthood activist may never agree, and they're not about to budge in their views, but they both probably believe if you understood the issue as well as they do, you would probably agree with them.

You see this a lot in social media debates. It's like the person who's getting really angry and flaming everybody who disagrees with them. I think they're just not that confident in their ideas, because if they were that confident—like if somebody said to you two plus two equals five, you wouldn't fly off the handle and go insane at them because you would be like, “Oh, that's a very odd thing to say. Why would you believe that? And certainly if that were true, planes would crash. None of science would work. That's a completely bonkers thing to say.” But we don't get mad about it. Again, I don't think many people are very angry at people who think the Earth is flat. You just think, “Can you tell me more, because I'm really interested in where in the world did you come up with such an idea?” Whereas if it's something that we're less confident about, that's where we can get emotional and so forth.

One of the criticisms leveled at Wikipedia has been that Wikipedia relies a lot on the press. You rely on The New York Times, on WIRED, on a variety of different sources to inform your entries. If an individual thinks well, all of those sources are leftist, they are biased, therefore Wikipedia has an inherent problem with bias because of what it relies on.

How do you see the media at this moment? What would you like to see, if anything, change about how journalists, including WIRED, approach politics, approach abortion, approach all of these subjects that are so fraught and that are really tied up in this conversation about trust that is so fundamental?

There's so many elements to pick apart. We could probably have a four-hour conversation about just this, but the accusation that the media is vaguely liberal is probably not entirely untrue. Hopefully, in my view, at really good publications, which is a lot of publications, the journalists may vote a certain way, but they take the time to be good Wikipedians themselves and to report in a neutral way. I think you can do that, but you have to watch yourself. You always have to be careful about that. There was some claim that now Wikipedia has banned all but left-leaning sources. I'm like, “Well, yeah, if you think The Wall Street Journal is a communist rag, then maybe that's true.” But that actually isn't true.

I think there has clearly been a rise in low-quality, populist right-wing media, and we could probably name a few of the famous names. That's a fact. That's just something that's out there. What I would say is, if there are any right-leaning billionaires who are worried about the media, why don't you fund some really good, quality conservative journalism? If you think The New York Times is sort of vaguely liberal, have another newspaper that's sort of vaguely conservative.

For Wikipedia, what I always say is, look, we have to grapple with this always. We have to always be ready. If somebody gives us a criticism, we have to say, “OK, if we've not got it right, what do we do to improve? How did we get it wrong? What are our processes that aren't working well?” Or, you know, maybe sometimes we look into them and we're like, actually everything's fine. I'm sorry, we're not going to treat the comments of a social media influencer on vaccines the same as the New England Journal of Medicine. That's not gonna happen. At the same time, let's be careful that we aren't jumping on a bandwagon and in a moment of emotion. Let's try to be the place where we say “here's the parameters of the debate” rather than trying to take sides in that debate.

One of the challenges I have come up against in my job around neutrality and bias—actually, it came to mind because I was reading an interview you did with The New York Times–where you said, “In various places around the world, not speaking just of the US, facts are threatening. And if your policies are at odds with the facts, then you may find it very uncomfortable for people to simply explain the facts.”

A lot of people in the United States reject factual information. They might level a term like bias when in fact they're talking about something that is just true. There is still true and false. You know what I mean? But there is this perception that factual information is sort of inherently political and that it is liberal and that it is biased.

I've resigned myself, in some cases, to just accepting that those people live in a different version of reality than I do, and it is a reality informed by certain fictions. How do you think about that, and how do you think about reaching those people? So much of your book is about trying to reach more people with this shared framework of trust. But how do you reach people who won't even engage with facts as facts?

That is definitely hard, but I actually think there are fewer people who are really hardcore about that. I think most people on all political spectrums will say, “I want to be told the truth. I want to make decisions based on facts. I don't wanna live in a delusion.” They may be rejecting elements of the media or this, that, and the other, sometimes for bad reasons, sometimes for good reasons. Sometimes because they have lost trust and so now they don't trust anything.

An old friend from a million years ago said something on Facebook and I was like, Hmm, hold on. I don't think that's right. I just Googled quickly and I found a debunker, sent it, and he said, “I can't believe you were sending me a link to The New York Times.” I'm like, “What?” “They just make stuff up.” I was like, I don't know what to do here.

But usually, the response might've been, “Well you do know, of course, The New York Times is left-leaning and they may have left some things out that might be uncomfortable for their position, you should read this.” That is a conversation; that's something we can work on. But just rejecting it wholesale, as if the mainstream media is propaganda? That's a huge problem. I think Elon Musk has talked about how Wikipedia echoes mainstream propaganda. And I'm like, just the words “mainstream” and “propaganda” are quite an amusing combination. It's a really odd thing to say.

For the media, I think it's really important to be aware that those people exist, and a few of them are just not reachable. I assume that's been true throughout all human history. But there are a lot of people who are like, “No, actually, I'm not listening because you've made these mistakes in the past and didn't correct it.”

I live in the UK, and one of the big political things that we've been through was Brexit. If you go back and you look at the rhetoric around Brexit, all the major political parties, certainly all the journalistic sources, for the most part, and even some of the more right-leaning sources, were against Brexit. There was a real tone that the people who were for Brexit were just racist. The people who were for Brexit were not persuaded by that, because calling people racist doesn't usually change their minds about anything. They were like, “Hold on, you're not listening.” In fact, people probably weren't listening, and that led to a protest vote that actually had dire consequences.

I was gonna say, yeah, look at you now. That went really well.

The public polling suggests that people pretty much agree that that wasn't a good idea. At the same time, these things happen. What we really have to do is say, “OK, how do we get back?”

One of the symptoms of all this, that I have been pointing out recently, is the US just went through the longest-in-history government shutdown, because Congress is so filled with partisan hacks. They are unable to trust each other enough to find some bipartisan solutions and some compromise.

You mentioned Elon Musk a few minutes ago, and this is someone who has built an alternate-reality version of Wikipedia. Do you know why he is so opposed to Wikipedia's continued existence?

I think it's a few things. I mean, I only know things he said. So he thinks Wikipedia is Woke-ipedia.

Wikipedia feels threatened in so many different ways, right? There's the Elon Musk of it all. There's the AI scraping. There are the people finger-pointing. How precarious do things feel for Wikipedia right now, and what feels like the most pressing threat to you? Are you waking up at 3 in the morning because of Wikipedia? Are you waking up at 3 in the morning because of AI? What are you thinking about Wikipedia's place in the world right now?

I don't worry about Wikipedia. It doesn't even come across my mind most days.

AI can do a passable impression of a human being until you look a little closer. I worry about community health. One of the things I say in the book but I've also just said to Elon, is that putting out this idea that Wikipedia has been taken over by far-left activists has two harmful consequences. One, you're telling those kind and thoughtful conservatives who might help with whatever bias you see that Wikipedia is going to be a hostile place for them. And you're telling those crazy woke activists that Wikipedia is their new home. Then we have to deal with them. So for me, the thing I worry about is community health. Are we bringing in a diversity, an intellectual diversity of new people? Are we treating people well when they come in?

In this era of hostility and these culture wars, are we at risk of letting those cultural wars infect our culture of neutrality and being thoughtful and being kind. That's what we have to preserve, because as long as we do that, we'll continue to thrive. The other thing that's funny about Wikipedia is we are a charity, we're a nonprofit organization. But we're even more than that. We are a community. So we're just a bunch of geeks who like writing an encyclopedia as a hobby. As such, when we think about the competitive landscape in a kind of dotcom way, “Ooh, what if Grok takes 30 percent of your traffic? What's that gonna do?” I'm sure it'll hurt the foundation's revenue if we have less traffic. But is it gonna change anything about the community? Not really. Because we write Wikipedia, because we enjoy it, and we're really happy that other people like it. So we'll carry on, even if at a different scale.

But also I think as long as we keep our spirit, I think people will always really want that sort of information that's not just written by human, but that's also been chewed on and thought about and debated and worked out by humans to say, “How can we make it as good as we possibly can?”

What would you tell someone listening who loves Wikipedia, who uses it all the time, besides donating, what can they do to make sure that Wikipedia is around and thriving in 10 years?

I always encourage people, if you like the spirit of Wikipedia just make a little edit now and then. You might find that you enjoy it, and you might come and join us.

Does anyone ever tell you that the idea of becoming an editor on Wikipedia is intimidating? That it feels a bit too powerful?

It shouldn't be. Just pick something obscure and make a little edit. If you've read a book and you're like, oh, actually there's not that much about this book, let me add a little something. Hopefully you'll enjoy that experience. We try to be this friendly bunch of nerds, and we're always looking for friends.

I remember writing high school papers and being told, “You cannot use Wikipedia as a source.” But just looking at everything coming out of Venezuela the last few days and seeing how much of it was AI-generated, Wikipedia now feels much more rigorous and accurate than so much of what we're seeing online. Where do you see our digital experience going from here, and what do you see as Wikipedia's place in that?

I think we all have to worry about it, not just in the context of Wikipedia, but more broadly in the decline of local newspapers. Because I like to be optimistic, I was thinking the other day, oh, are there ways that AI could somehow support local journalism? That's a really fraught topic because the easiest way is the lazy way, which is just turning AI loose, starting to write a bunch of nonsense, and it's just gonna be slop.

The Guardian recently published a story about you, and the headline stood out to me. They asked whether you were “the last decent tech baron,” which is a very flattering way to be described. When I think about a tech baron, I think about Mark Zuckerberg feeding his cows macadamia nuts on his compound in Hawaii. I don't know that I would necessarily think of you as a baron, but I'm curious about how you think about yourself relative to the Mark Zuckerbergs and Jeff Bezoses and Sam Altmans of the world. Do you feel like you are part of that cohort?

I mean, I am and I'm not. Certainly, I know them all, some of them better than others over the years. But the way I live my life is quite different. I'm a geek, and my office is in my basement. At the same time—and this is where I can be a little bit grandiose—in 500 years, people are gonna look back at Wikipedia and go, you know what? That was one of the good things. That was a really difficult time in human history, and there was a lot of crap, but a bunch of really nice people got together to gather knowledge and share it with the world. I'm really happy and proud to be a part of that.

What advice would you give the tech barons about how they can participate in rebuilding trust? So many people don't trust what those barons have built. They don't trust Meta. They don't look at Facebook and think that is a place to find trustworthy information, a place to have trusted conversations. They don't look to the AI industry and feel a sense of trust in those leaders.

I think a big part of it is the algorithms that are optimized for short-term engagement. They have such clear negatives associated with them that you should really rethink that as a business strategy. I've said this to people at Facebook. If people become convinced that you are part of the destruction of civilization, that's not good for business in the long run. Optimizing for next quarter, sure, you could probably goose your revenues a bit, but it isn't really the right answer.

I thought you were gonna ask me for my advice for Elon. My advice for Elon is always the same: Hey Elon, remember that electric car idea? That was good.

Yeah, maybe go back to trying to save humanity.

Yeah, that was a good idea. Some good electric cars. Just stop posting on Twitter. Don't waste your time. There's more important things that you could do.

As a serial optimist, do you think we are too far gone? Or do you think that there is a better, more trusted, more collaborative society on the other side of the AI, of the algorithms, of the polarization of all of it. Is it possible?

My best evidence for that is to step back and not think about social media for a minute, and just think about people in your personal life and the way we treat each other. When you step into an elevator you don't immediately think, “OK, which one of these people's gonna try to slit my throat?” The elevator gets stuck halfway between floors. What do you do? You sort of nervously chuckle and you chat a bit and you laugh together. You're not afraid of them. They're people in an elevator just like you.

Most people assume good faith. We see that and we trust people all the time in all kinds of ways. I think we can just say politics has gotten super broken. Things about social media are super broken, but people are still the same.

We have a very short game I would love to play to wrap up. It's called Control, Alt, Delete. So, what piece of technology would you love to control? What would you love to alt, so alter or change, and what would you love to delete? What would you vanquish from the Earth if given the opportunity?

I would love to be able to control my home Wi-Fi network, which has been driving me crazy all morning.

Join the club.

That's a silly answer, but that's my answer. So, alter? Broadly I would say the algorithms of social media. I'd like to see them become more responsive to genuine quality as opposed to just engagement. I've said for a long time, if I went on Facebook one morning and they gave me an option to say, “We'd like to show you things that we think you're gonna be less interested in but that we think are high quality. You may not agree with them, but we think they're high-quality because we've got these signals. Do you wanna see more like that?” I would say yes.

But what would it do to their ad business?

Well, maybe in the long run I would revert a long trend, which is that I hardly ever go on Facebook anymore, you know?

Then, delete? I think X/Twitter, just delete it. The whole thing's dead. Yeah. It's too late to reboot.

I deleted my account maybe two years ago. I can't even think about it. I cannot disagree with you there.

I haven't deleted my account, but I just go on less and less. I think a lot of people, a lot of journalists, feel like they need it professionally. Because you can post stuff there and people will see it. I do have some friends there who I know. Actually, one of my good friends quit, and I was like, “Well, OK, there's one more reason to just not bother.”

One more reason to give it up. Yep.

I think they should just delete it and start over.

Maybe start over with a different owner.

That would be a good start, yeah.

The Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics will be a magnet for all types of online threat actors, from nation-state spooks to petty scam artists, according to a report released Monday by Palo Alto Networks.

Attackers will include ransomware gangs, predicted the report by Palo Alto's Unit 42, its threat intelligence and incident response group.

“Ransomware is just one type of financial crime that will likely be conducted during the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Games,” the researchers at Unit 42 reported. “Scams and phishing campaigns against attendees will be common, using fake websites, bogus QR codes, fraudulent apps, and other tools to scam victims out of their cash.”

Events like the Winter Games create ideal conditions for disruption because even a minor outage can cause broadcast interruptions, entry delays at venues, and transportation chaos, commented Mike Carr, a field CTO at Xona, a provider of secure remote access for critical infrastructure in Hanover, Md. “Attackers know defenders have low tolerance for downtime, making extortion more effective,” he told TechNewsWorld.

Nation-state actors will also be getting in on the action, as well as hacktivists.

“Celebrities, politicians, and business leaders will likely be in attendance,” the report explained. “Well-resourced nation-state actors may take advantage of this rare opportunity for close access and mount sophisticated attacks to compromise and surveil these VIPs and/or their staff. The stakes are high, in terms of strategic intelligence and impact.”

“The global geopolitical scene is rife with conflict,” the report added. “The Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Games draw billions of eyes. For hacktivist groups, perhaps no occasion offers as much exposure and publicity for their ideology.”

The report pointed out that the sheer volume of people, systems, money, and data surrounding the 2026 Winter Games creates a target-rich environment for attackers. “Cybercriminals may cast a wide net with their scams and phishing campaigns,” it noted. “Like a futbol striker, making one out of a thousand attempts can make the difference.”

“The large number of athletes and fans, the computer and security systems involved, their related data, and the large amount of money spent on such an event make it a popular target,” added Chris Hauk, consumer privacy champion at Pixel Privacy, a publisher of online consumer security and privacy guides.

In addition to scams, he identified other tools that threat actors might deploy at the Games. “Deepfakes and other types of misinformation could be used to discredit Olympic officials and executives, athletes, and other high-profile attendees at the events,” he told TechNewsWorld.

Global events like the Winter Olympics create the perfect cover for cybercriminals, added Diana Rothfuss, global solutions strategy director for risk, fraud, and compliance at SAS, an analytics and artificial intelligence software company in Cary, N.C.

“The volume of digital activity around such events skyrockets with ticketing, travel, streaming, and payments,” she told TechNewsWorld. “That noise makes it much easier for scammers to exploit overburdened systems and distracted consumers. Criminals can blend their illicit activities into high traffic volumes and social buzz, which makes detection more challenging.”

“AI only continues to raise the stakes,” she added. “Europol warns that AI-driven cybercrime is evolving into a digital arms race, where attackers can scale and automate scams faster than ever.”

Rothfuss expects to see a full spectrum of scams at the Winter Games, from fake ticket sites to bogus streaming links to impersonation scams. “With the advance of generative AI, fraudsters can now spin up convincing fake apps, websites, donation pages, and athlete ‘fundraisers' in minutes,” she said.

Phishing attempts will increase, she predicted, with scammers sending emails pretending to be from official Olympic organizations, airlines, or hotels, asking for personal information or payment details.

Impersonation scams involving athletes, staff, and even vendors will also surge as criminals mimic Olympic officials, national teams, or sponsors to solicit fees or sensitive information that can be exploited to commit other crimes, she continued.

Rothfuss warned that charity or humanitarian fraud-type scams tied to athlete foundations or national causes will also pop up. “They'll embed a heavy emotional pull, preying on people's goodwill and the spirit of global unity inspired throughout the Games,” she said.

She also cautioned to watch out for illicit links promising free Olympics coverage that instead deliver malware or enable credential harvesting. “Keep in mind that modern scams don't target the transaction anymore, they target the person,” she explained. “Social engineering is the real threat, and all [kinds] of scams will see a boost from social engineering tactics.”

“Fake ticketing and travel scams will proliferate as fraudsters set up convincing but bogus sites selling tickets, accommodations, and transportation,” she added.

“Olympic-related scams aren't just about fake tickets. They're about context and timing,” observed Gabriel Friedlander, CEO of Wizer, a cybersecurity awareness training company in Boston.

“When you post that you're traveling, attackers know you're out of the office and may contact your team pretending to be you,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“If you vent on social media about a flight or hotel issue, scammers can jump in posing as ‘official support' to steal credentials or payment details,” he continued. “They may call hotels claiming to be the front desk with a ‘payment problem,' or use public announcements, sponsorship news, or even finals appearances to craft convincing spear-phishing emails and meeting invites.”

“At the extreme end, nation-state actors can exploit travel and networking events to approach targets under the guise of sponsors or partners, while others spin up fake apps in minutes or deploy rogue Wi-Fi to infect phones and track movements,” he added. “Big events don't just attract fans, they attract attackers who thrive on urgency, visibility, and trust.”

Phishing and online scams are two of the biggest cyberthreats to fans, noted Darren Guccione, CEO of Keeper Security, a password management and online storage company in Chicago. “Leading up to, and throughout the event, cybercriminals may send phishing emails or text messages with malicious links or attachments disguised as updates on certain events and medal counts,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown sources.”

He added that scammers may also use social media to learn more about you or request money. “They may impersonate a friend or family member claiming to be in urgent need of money to buy tickets or place bets, or even impersonate the athletes themselves,” he warned.

Guccione also advised that, in addition to being wary of fake tickets, fans should be careful about fake contests that promise large prizes to winners. “Once they collect your entry fee or personal information, scammers will disappear, and the winners never receive their prizes,” he said.

Threat actors can be a nettlesome problem for the enterprise during the Olympics, too. “Cybercriminals know employees will be streaming events and engaging on mobile devices during the Olympics,” explained Krishna Vishnubhotla, vice president of product strategy at Zimperium, a mobile security company based in Dallas. “Fake betting apps, fraudulent login pages, and malicious streaming links can easily bypass traditional security layers.”

“Enterprises must take a mobile-first approach to security, ensuring threats are detected in real-time before they impact users or corporate networks,” he told TechNewsWorld. “With employees engaging in Olympics-related activities on mobile devices, security blind spots increase. Cybercriminals take advantage of this with phishing attacks, fake apps, and malicious links that traditional security solutions often miss.”

He recommended businesses implement mobile security that continuously monitors for threats — on and offline — to keep both devices and corporate data safe.

“Events like the Olympics are typically surrounded by meticulous planning, strong security controls, and well-designed redundancy,” observed Martin Jartelius, AI product director at Outpost24, a continuous threat exposure management company. “Organizers know they have the eyes of the world on them and generally prepare accordingly.”

“Overall, most activity will focus on exploiting public attention rather than directly attacking Olympic infrastructure,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Scams and financially motivated cybercrime tend to follow visibility and opportunity, while the core systems of the Games are typically well defended and closely monitored.”

“The biggest risk isn't just technical, it's psychological,” added Ensar Seker, CISO of SOCRadar, a threat intelligence company in Newark, Del.

“Attackers exploit urgency, excitement, and trust in well-known brands,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Organizations involved in the Olympics should assume they are targets, harden their digital perimeter, and actively monitor for brand abuse, impersonation, and emerging threat narratives throughout the event.”

The Pioneer Collective is expanding its co-working space in the Belltown neighborhood of downtown Seattle.

TPC is taking over 6,600 square feet of space directly above its current location in the historic Guiry Schillestad Building at 2101 1st Ave. The new footprint is just under 20,000 square feet.

The space, just a block from the Pike Place Market, was previously home to outdoor retailer Orvis and prior to that, Urban Hardwoods.

TPC, which was founded in 2014 by husband-and-wife team Christopher Hoyt and Audrey Hoyt, operates other co-working locations in Ballard, at the West Canal Yards development near Interbay, and in Tacoma, Wash.

“Even with the challenges downtown has faced, Belltown has been a great neighborhood for us,” TPC CEO Christopher Hoyt said in a news release. “Almost since opening, we've wanted more space at this location and we're excited that we finally have the opportunity to expand.”

The expansion will give TPC extra meeting room capacity and additional private offices for teams of up to 10 employees. The project is currently in permit review and construction is expected to begin in February with an opening date planned for late summer.

Seattle's co-working market ranks 14th nationally by total co-working square footage, with roughly 3.16 million square feet across about 160 spaces.

As farmers grapple with extreme weather, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, Washington state is betting that artificial intelligence could help secure the future of agriculture. 

A new initiative called Growing with AI will bring together the state's tech giants and diverse farming community to tackle the industry's most pressing challenges. Supporters say this is the perfect place to launch such an effort: uniting the region's robust agricultural economy with hundreds of different high-value crops in Eastern Washington, with its world-class tech and AI companies on the western side of the state.

“Our farmers are dealing with so many different external forces, mostly beyond their control,” said Melanie Roberts, executive director of the Washington State Academy of Sciences. “So what if Washington can get ahead of this and be intentional about how we use AI in agriculture?”

The initiative, led by the publicly funded Academy of Sciences, kicked off earlier this month with the first of six free informational webinars. The next session is Jan. 23. The effort will culminate in April with an invitation-only workshop where past participants will strategize action items.

There are already a number of AI-driven, ag tech companies based in Washington, including Carbon Robotics, which manufactures autonomous farming machines that zap weeds with lasers. Carbon is based in Seattle but also runs a manufacturing facility on the other side of the state in Richland, Wash.

While geography might separate the state's tech and ag communities, Carbon CEO and founder Paul Mikesell said the two are natural collaborators.

“Farmers and technologists see the world in similar ways,” Mikesell said. “We can get things done. We tackle problems head on, put in a lot of hard work …. So in a lot of ways, farmers act a lot like engineers because they're trying to design solutions.”

To be successful in this space, he emphasized the importance of genuinely partnering with farmers to learn their specific challenges rather than coming in with predetermined solutions. Mikesell said entrepreneurs need to develop their technology in the literal field to see firsthand how it performs.

Ananth Kalyanaraman, a computer science professor at Washington State University and expert in ag tech applications, highlighted several potential AI applications:

This is the first time the Academy of Sciences, which educates public leaders on scientific matters, has created a series focused on one issue and incorporated a call to action.

Kalyanaraman noted that federal support of AI in the ag sector has been limited, particularly given the importance of building a more robust food-supply system. Farming hasn't been made a priority compared to other areas, he added, but the need is urgent and Washington can help lead.

“We should be able to provide an exemplar to the rest of the nation,” Kalyanaraman said, “in terms of how to most effectively and responsibly embrace AI into a complex, decision-driven system like agriculture.”

In a sign of the demand, or hype, for AI startups, Emergent, an Indian startup building an AI “vibe-coding” platform, has raised $70 million less than four months after it raised a $23 million Series A.

The Series B round was jointly led by SoftBank's Vision Fund 2 and Khosla Ventures, and values the startup at $300 million post-money, sources with knowledge of the deal told TechCrunch. The startup was previously valued at $100 million post-money, another source told TechCrunch.

Prosus, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Together, and Y Combinator also participated. Emergent has now raised $100 million within seven months of its launch.

The funding comes as Emergent claims $50 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and more than 5 million users across 190-plus countries. The startup said it is targeting ARR of more than $100 million by April 2026.

Like other vibe-coding platforms, Emergent uses AI agents to help users design, build, test and deploy full-stack web and mobile apps. It targets entrepreneurs and small businesses looking to ship products without having to hire large engineering teams.

“We continue to see massive demand across our top geographies — the U.S., Europe and India — and we'll continue to expand deeper into these markets,” founder Mukund Jha told TechCrunch, adding that the startup's recently launched mobile app-building service is seeing strong adoption.

Emergent says it is headquartered in San Francisco, but 70 of its 75 employees work out of an office in Bengaluru. The startup is hiring aggressively across functions in both countries, Jha said.

Emergent competes with the likes of Lovable, Cursor and Replit, all of which have mushroomed into huge businesses within a couple of years of launch as AI-assisted coding enables users to develop their own apps without requiring much in the way of actual programming knowledge or skills.

To its credit, Emergent seems to have successfully tapped investor interest in such vibe-coding platforms to fund itself. Accel also backed Rocket, another India-founded startup, in a $15 million seed round last year, along with Together Fund and Salesforce Ventures.

The deal is also notable as it marks SoftBank's return to investing in India — the firm previously backed Indian commerce startup ElasticRun nearly four years ago. 

Emergent says the fresh funding will be used to expand its team, accelerate product development, and deepen its presence in key markets.

Netflix today is launching a new feature that will allow users to interact with live content through voting. The streaming company said the option will be available with the premiere of its live-streamed talent show “Star Search” on January 20.

Subscribers will be able to either pick a selection from a multiple-choice menu or rate someone's performance on a scale of five stars. Votes can be cast using either a TV remote or the Netflix app. 

Netflix said that the feature will work globally, and on the backend, the platform will tally votes in real-time. Viewers will have a limited time to vote, and once that time has lapsed, additional votes won't count. That means if you're watching the show later, you can't participate in the voting. 

The streamer started testing live voting in August 2025 with “Dinner Time Live with David Chang.” During TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, the company's CTO, Elizabeth Stone, confirmed that the company would soon launch the feature widely.

“If you're sitting at home watching ‘Star Search' on your TV, you'll be able to either on the TV or your mobile phone actually put in a vote that advances or doesn't advance some of the contestants on the show,” Stone had said.

“So it's just a very early starting example of the ways that we think content can be more interactive over time, across devices, between TV and mobile, where a member who subscribes to Netflix can actually feel like they're part of the story, influence the storyline, and feel immersed in that.”

Netflix has heavily leaned in to live content with shows like “Everybody's Live with John Mulaney” and “Dinner Time Live with David Chang,” along with sports broadcasts, including the NFL Christmas special and WWE shows. In October, the company launched interactive games that people can play on their smart TVs. Netflix is now merging both these threads into one by launching live voting.

Humans&, a startup with a philosophy that AI should empower people rather than replace them, has raised $480 million in seed funding at a $4.48 billion valuation, reports The New York Times. Investors in the round include chipmaker Nvidia, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and VC firms SV Angel, Google Ventures, and Laurene Powell Jobs' firm Emerson Collective. 

The megadeal for the three-month-old company follows a trend of investors throwing money at startups founded by breakaways of major AI labs. Humans&'s founders include Andi Peng, a former Anthropic researcher who worked on reinforcement learning and post-training of Claude 3.5 through 4.5; Georges Harik, Google's seventh employee, who helped build its first advertising systems; Eric Zelikman and Yuchen He, two former xAI researchers who helped develop the Grok chatbot; and Noah Goodman, a Stanford professor of psychology and computer science. 

Humans&'s 20-odd employees also come from OpenAI, Meta, Reflection, AI2, and MIT, according to the company. The startup aims to use software to help people collaborate with each other — think an AI version of an instant messaging app. One of their goals is to use existing AI techniques to train AI in new ways, like programming chatbots to request information from the user and store it for later use. 

In order to build AI that serves “as a deeper connective tissue that strengthens organizations and communities,” Humans& hopes to rethink “how we train models at scale and how people interact with AI,” per the company's web page. The startup cited a need for innovations in “long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning, memory, and user understanding,” as well as a tightly integrated focus on both science and product development.

TechCrunch has reached out for comment.

Meta's Oversight Board is tackling a case focused on Meta's ability to permanently disable user accounts. Permanent bans are a drastic action, locking people out of their profiles, memories, friend connections, and, in the case of creators and businesses, their ability to market and communicate with fans and customers.

This is the first time in the organization's five-year history as an oversight body that permanent account bans have been a subject of the Oversight Board's focus, the organization notes.

The case being reviewed isn't exactly one of an everyday user. Instead, the case involves a high-profile Instagram user who repeatedly violated Meta's Community Standards by posting visual threats of violence against a female journalist, anti-gay slurs against politicians, content depicting a sex act, allegations of misconduct against minorities, and more. The account had not accumulated enough strikes to be automatically disabled, but Meta made the decision to permanently ban the account.

The Board's materials didn't name the account in question, but its recommendations could impact others who post content that targets public figures with abuse, harassment, and threats, as well as users who have their accounts permanently banned without receiving transparent explanations.

Meta referred this specific case to the Board, which included five posts made in the year before the account was permanently disabled. The Board says it's looking for input about several key issues: how permanent bans can be processed fairly, the effectiveness of its current tools to protect public figures and journalists from repeated abuse and threats of violence, the challenges of identifying off-platform content, whether punitive measures effectively shape online behaviors, and best practices for transparent reporting on account enforcement decisions.

The decision to review the particulars of the case comes after a year in which users have complained of mass bans with little information about what they did wrong. The issue has impacted Facebook Groups, as well as individual account holders who believe that automated moderation tools are to blame. In addition, those who have been banned have complained that Meta's paid support offering, Meta Verified, has proven useless to aid them in these situations.

Whether the Oversight Board has any real sway to address issues on Meta's platform continues to be debated, of course. 

The board has a limited scope to enact change at the social networking giant, meaning it can't force Meta to make broader policy changes or address systemic issues. Notably, the Board isn't consulted when CEO Mark Zuckerberg decides to make sweeping changes to the company's policies — like its decision last year to relax hate speech restrictions. The Board can make recommendations and can overturn specific content moderation decisions, but it can often be slow to render a decision. It also takes on relatively few cases compared to the millions of moderation decisions that Meta makes across its user base.

According to a report released in December, Meta has implemented 75% of more than 300 recommendations the Board has issued, and its content moderation decisions have been consistently followed by Meta. Meta also recently asked for the policy advisors' opinion on its implementation of the crowdsourced fact-checking feature, Community Notes.

After the Oversight Board issues its policy recommendations to Meta, the company has 60 days to respond. The Board is also soliciting public comments on this topic.

Correction: The public comments can be submitted anonymously; this post was updated after publication to reflect this.

SpaceX didn't properly inspect a hydraulic crane that had recently been repaired before it collapsed at the company's Starbase, Texas facility last June, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

As a result, the federal safety agency has hit SpaceX with seven “serious” violations related to its investigation, which it opened one day after the crane collapse. OSHA issued the maximum financial penalty it can levy on six of those “serious” violations, giving Elon Musk's spaceflight company a combined fine of $115,850.

OSHA's probe is still open according to the agency's website. It's still unclear whether any workers were harmed in the accident. SpaceX is able to contest the penalties; the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The penalty and violations come as SpaceX is set to ramp up activity at the Starbase facility, partly fueled by a race to fulfill President Donald Trump's goal of returning astronauts to the Moon by the end of his second term. The company has clearance from the Federal Aviation Administration to perform as many as 25 Starship launches in Texas this year. At the same time, it is undergoing rapid expansion of the launch complex to meet Musk's grand ambitions of building thousands of Starship rockets per year.

SpaceX has had a long history of injuries at the South Texas launch complex. A 2023 Reuters report uncovered dozens of previously-unreported injuries — and one employee death — that happened as the facility was built up across the last decade. A TechCrunch analysis of OSHA data last year showed SpaceX has a much higher injury rate at the Starbase site than at other facilities run by the company, or those of its industry peers.

Accidents keep happening, too. In December, an employee of a SpaceX subcontractor filed a lawsuit against SpaceX after he was allegedly crushed by a large metal support dropped from a crane. OSHA is also investigating that accident, as TechCrunch first reported. 

The crane collapse at the center of the new OSHA penalty happened on June 24, 2025. SpaceX employees at a Starbase test site were cleaning up debris from a Starship explosion just four days prior. Footage captured by LabPadre, which posts live streams of the Starbase site, showed a crane buckling under the weight of a large piece of the exploded Starship.

According to the new citations posted to OSHA's website, one employee was using a Grove RT9150E crane to lift the debris while another used an excavator's bucket to inspect it, in hopes of determining the cause of the explosion.

That Grove crane had recently been repaired, according to the citations, and returned to SpaceX “without the employer ensuring repairs met manufacturer's criteria via an inspection by a qualified person.” It is not clear why the crane was repaired, but another citation states a Grove RT9150E crane at the test site had a computer that would not start until “multiple attempts” were made.

OSHA claims SpaceX was either not performing or not documenting monthly inspections on the Grove crane, and that it hadn't been inspected “within the last 12 months.” SpaceX did not perform monthly inspections of the wire rope being used to move debris either, according to OSHA. And OSHA claims rigging equipment used at the site was missing manufacturer-prescribed markings that are supposed to detail a “safe working load.” 

As part of its investigation, OSHA also found that an employee had been operating a Tadano 90-ton crawler crane to move debris at the test site with an expired certification from the National Commission for the Certification of Crane Operators.

Grubhub parent company, Wonder, announced that it has acquired Claim, a restaurant rewards app.

Founded in 2021, Claim offers cash-back rewards for local restaurants that users can redeem for dine-in or pickup orders. Restaurants partner with Claim to create promotions, boost foot traffic, and track performance insights through the Claim dashboard.

The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed; however, Claim raised a total of $20 million, it said, when it raised its $12 million Series A in October, 2024. PitchBook estimated its valuation at $62 million.

Grubhub says the acquisition will give restaurants on its platform access to Claim's customer acquisition and retention tools, while Grubhub diners will receive additional savings and rewards for dining out.

“By combining a delightful rewards experience and powerful machine learning models, we match restaurants with their next regulars. Claim is a game-changer for these businesses, and joining Grubhub marks an exciting new chapter as we scale to reach millions more diners and thousands of restaurants,” Claim CEO and co-founder Sam Obletz in a statement.

Grubhub told TechCrunch that all members of the Claim team were extended offers to join Grubhub. 

Under Grubhub, Claim will enable more restaurants to connect with consumers through personalized rewards. Grubhub says this will reduce customer-acquisition costs and drive repeat visits, all without adding operational complexity.

“Claim's innovative rewards technology introduces a powerful new way for our restaurant partners to engage in-person diners and builds on Grubhub's robust existing suite of marketing tools,” said Grubhub CEO Howard Migdal in a statement. “With Grubhub and Claim together under one roof, we can scale Claim's data-driven tools to our more than 415,000 merchants and help our nearly 20 million diners save more money at the restaurants they love.”

Claim is now available to Grubhub merchants and diners in New York City, with a nationwide rollout planned for later this year.

Grubhub told TechCrunch that Claim will continue to be available to its current merchants and consumers through the Claim app and website “for the time being.” In the coming months, the company plans to create a “streamlined experience” across the Grubhub and Claim apps for both restaurant partners and diners, but didn't share specifics on what this could look like. 

For current Claim users, Grubhub says there may be some changes to the product and how rewards are paid out, but that users can continue to expect personalized promotions and rewards for going to local restaurants. 

Investors in Claim included VMG Technology, Sequoia Capital, Susa Ventures, Lightbank, and Metalab Ventures.

unclear if its the one where the official HN mods (there are only 2) believed to be the ones doing thisthe reality is that the official mods are largely hands off, when they do get involved, more often than not it is to reverse a community flagging action, which is where most moderation happens, at a large enough community scale that a handful of people cannot wield this much flagging powerIf you believe unjust flagging has happened, the best recourse is to email the HN mods, the are very friendly, helpful and fair

I have done it myself, successfully. (well, minus the coordination. the point is that it only takes a very small number of people to flag something for it be nuked from the front page)Where did I claim that it was mods/some shadow cabal? Please read more carefully.

Most of the big ones are things like skia, harfbuzz, wgpu - all totally reasonable IMO.The two that stand out for me as more notable are html5ever for parsing HTML and taffy for handling CSS grids and flexbox - that's vendored with an explanation of some minor changes here: https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender/blob/19bf1036105d4e...Taffy a solid library choice, but it's probably the most robust ammunition for anyone who wants to argue that this shouldn't count as a ""from scratch"" rendering engine.I don't think it detracts much if at all from FastRender as an example of what an army of coding agents can help a single engineer achieve in a few weeks of work.

I think this kind of approach is interesting, but it's a bit sad that Cursor didn't discuss how they close the feedback loop: testing/verification. As generating code becomes cheaper, I think effort will shift to how we can more cheaply and reliably determine whether an arbitrary piece of code meets a desired specification. For example did they use https://web-platform-tests.org/, fuzz testing (e.g. feed in random webpages and inform the LLM when the fuzzer finds crashes), etc? I would imagine truly scaling long-running autonomous coding would have an emphasis on this.Of course Cursor may well have done this, but it wasn't super deeply discussed in their blog post.I really enjoy reading your blog and it would be super cool to see you look at approaches people have to ensuring that LLM-produced code is reliable/correct.

I think the current models are at a capability level that could create a decent 3D game. The challenges are creating graphic assets and debugging/Qa. The debugging problem is you need to figure out a good harness to let the model understand when something is working, or how it is failing.

What it should have been willing to do is go off and look for free external assets on the Web that it could download and integrate.

Features that I'd normally never have considered building because they weren't worth the added time and complexity are now just a few well-structured prompts away.But how much will it cost to maintain those features in the future? So far the answer appears to be a whole lot less than I would previously budget for, but I don't have any code more than a few months old that was built ~100% by coding agents, so it's way too early to judge how maintenance is going to work over a longer time period.

Although I dissented on the decision, we banned the use of AI. Outside of the project I've been enjoying agentic coding and I do think it can be used already today to build production-grade software of browser-like complexity.But this an example of how NOT to do agentic coding.If those agents kept running for years they still wouldn't be able to bring the project to anything resembling completion.Why? Because the code is extremely bad from a conceptual perspective.I've just looked into the IndexedDB implementation, which happens to be what I am working on at the moment in Servo.Now, my work in Servo is incomplete, but conceptually the code that is in place makes sense and there is a clear path towards eventually implementing the thing as a whole.The indexeddb code in Fastrender doesn't even attempt to build a foundation on which the web standard could eventually be implemented.Example: Arc<Mutex<Database>> is never going to work, because by definition a production browser engine will have to involve multiple processes. That doesn't mean you need the IPC in a prototype, but you certainly should not have shared state--some simple messaging between threads or tasks would do.I glanced around the codebase and spotted other such inconsistencies. It's actually very hard to understand much about the codebase, despite it implementing specifications I know well. For comparison, when I look at the code of Ladybird, another browser project, thanks to my experience with the Web platform and the clarity of the code I can immediately find my way around what is otherwise an unknown codebase.The bots seemed also obsessed with the whole metering thing, which I understand can be a useful feature, but that doesn't mean the logic needs to be peppered all over.Regarding the wow factor of it being able to render something decent to the screen: that is expected since it just requires plugging together existing libraries. Not a hard problem in and of itself.So what do I propose instead of autonomous agents? The focus should shift towards demonstrating how AI can effectively assist humans in building well-architected software.There is one very good idea in the project: adding the web standards directly in the repo so it can be used as context by the AI and humans alike. Any project can apply this by adding specs and other artifacts right next to the code. I've been doing this myself with TLA+, see https://medium.com/@polyglot_factotum/tla-in-support-of-ai-c...

It's ability to pattern match it's way through a code base is impressive until it's not and you always have to pull it back to reality when it goes astray.It's ability to plan ahead is so limited and it's way of ""remembering"" is so basic. Every day it's a bit like 50 first dates.Nonetheless seeing what can be achieved with this pseudo intelligence tool makes me feel a little in awe. It's the contrast between not being intelligence and achieving clearly useful outcomes if stirred correctly and the feeling that we just started to understand how to interact with this alien.

Because that's exactly what they are. An LLM is just a big optimization function with the objective ""return the most probabilistically plausible sequence of words in a given context"".There is no higher thinking. They were literally built as a mimicry of intelligence.

LLM's do not think, understand, reason, reflect, comprehend and they never shall.
I have commented elsewhere but this bears repeatingIf you had enough paper and ink and the patience to go through it, you could take all the training data and manually step through and train the same model. Then once you have trained the model you could use even more pen and paper to step through the correct prompts to arrive at the answer. All of this would be a completely mechanical process. This really does bear thinking about. It's amazing the results that LLM's are able to acheive. But let's not kid ourselves and start throwing about terms like AGI or emergence just yet. It makes a mechanical process seem magical (as do computers in general).I should add it also makes sense as to why it would, just look at the volume of human knowledge (the training data). It's the training data with the mass quite literally of mankind's knowledge, genius, logic, inferences, language and intellect that does the heavy lifting.

But you could make the exact same argument for a human mind? (could just simulate all those neural interactions with pen and paper)The only way to get out of it is to basically admit magic (or some other metaphysical construct with a different name).

It would be an argument and you are free to make it. What the human mind is, is an open scientific and philosophical problem many are working on.The point is that LLM's are NOT the same because we DO know that LLM's are. Please see the myriad of tutorials 'write an LLM from scratch'

But we have no idea how many ""essential"" differences there are (if any!).Dismissing LLMs as avenues toward intelligence just because they are simpler and easier to understand than our minds is a bit like looking at a modern phone from a 19th century point of view and dismissing the notion that it could be ""just a Turing machine"": Sure, the phone is infinitely more complex, but at its core those things are the same regardless.

Many people are throwing around that they don't ""think"", that they aren't ""conscious"", that they don't ""reason"", but I don't see those people sharing interesting heuristics to use LLMs well. The ""they don't reason"" people tend to, in my opinion/experience, underestimate them by a lot, often claiming that they will never be able to do <thing that LLMs have been able to do for a year>.To be fair, the ""they reason/are conscious"" people tend to, in my opinion/experience, overestimate how much a LLM being able to ""act"" a certain way in a certain situation says about the LLM/LLMs as a whole (""act"" is not a perfect word here, another way of looking at it is that they visit only the coast of a country and conclude that the whole country must be sailors and have a sailing culture).

It's an algorithm and a completely mechanical process which you can quite literally copy time and time again. Unless of course you think 'physical' computers have magical powers that a pen and paper Turing machine doesn't?> Many people are throwing around that they don't ""think"", that they aren't ""conscious"", that they don't ""reason"", but I don't see those people sharing interesting heuristics to use LLMs well.My digital thermometer doesn't think. Imbibing LLM's with thought will start leading to some absurd conclusions.A cursory read of basic philosophy would help elucidate why casually saying LLM's think, reason etc is not good enough.What is thinking?

Maybe real intelligence also is a big optimization function? Brain isn't magical, there are rules that govern our intelligence and I wouldn't be terribly surprised if our intelligence in fact turned out to be kind of returning the most plausible thoughs. Might as well be something else of course - my point is that ""it's not intelligence, it's just predicting next token"" doesn't make sense to me - it could be both!

AI makes it cheap (eventually almost free) to traverse the already-discovered and reach the edge of uncharted territory. If we think of a sphere, where we start at the center, and the surface is the edge of uncharted territory, then AI lets you move instantly to the surface.If anything solved becomes cheap to re-instantiate, does R&D reach a point where it can't ever pay off? Why would one pay for the long-researched thing when they can get it for free tomorrow? There will be some value in having it today, just like having knowledge about a stock today is more valuable than the same knowledge learned tomorrow. But does value itself go away for anything digital, and only remain for anything non-copyable?The volume of a sphere grows faster than the surface area. But if traversing the interior  is instant and frictionless, what does that imply?

reply

It's nearly frictionless, not frictionless because someone has to use the output (or at least verify it works). Also, why do you think the ""shape"" of the knowledge is spherical? I don't assume to know the shape but whatever it is, it has to be a fractal-like, branching, repeating pattern.

Even acknowledging it is interpolation, models can extrapolate slightly without making things up, within the range where the model still applies. Whos to say what this range is for an LLM operating in thousand dimensional space? As far as I can tell the main limiters to LLM creativity are guardrails we put in place for safety and usefulness.And what exactly is your proof that human ingenuity is not just pattern matching. Im sure a hypothesis can be put that fire was discovered by just adding up all known facts the people of those times knew and stumbling on something that put it all together. Sounds like knowledge remix + slight extrapolating to me.

It's a hypothesis at this stage, but I'm going to have a go at making it more quantitative. It seems the obvious explanation for ""hallucinations"", and it seems like it should also be rather straightforward to attribute particular inference results to the training data that influenced them.

They can and are improved (papered over) over time. For example by improving and tweaking the training data. Adding in new data sets is the usual fix. A prime example 'count the number of R's in Strawberry' caused quite a debacle at a time where LLM's were meant to be intelligent. Because they aren't they can trip up over simple problems like this. Continue to use an army of people to train them and these edge cases may become smaller over time. Fundamentally the LLM tech hasn't changed.I am not saying that LLM's aren't amazing, they absolutely are. But WHAT they are is an understood thing so lets not confuse ourselves.

The harnesses have helped in training the models themselves (i.e. every good trace was ""baked in"" the model) and have improved in enabling test time compute. But at the end of the day this is all put back into the models, and they become better.The simplest proof of this is on benchmarks like terminalbench and swe-bench with simple agents. The current top models are much better than their previous versions, when put in a loop with just a ""bash tool"". There's a ~100LoC harness called mini-swe-agent [1] that does just that.So current models + minimal loop >> previous gen models with human written harnesses + lots of glue.> Gemini 3 Pro reaches 74% on SWE-bench verified with mini-swe-agent![1] - https://github.com/SWE-agent/mini-swe-agent

Using chatGPT as a professional is different than using it for homework. Homework and school teaches you many things, not only the subject. You discover how you learn, what your interests are, etc.ChatGPT can assist with learning also but SHOULD NOT be doing any of the work for the student. It is okay to ask ""can you explain big O"", then answer follow up questions. However, ""give me method to reverse a string"" will only hurt.

One issue is that the time provided to mark each piece of work continues to decrease. Sometimes you are only getting 15 minutes for 20 pages, and management believe that you can mark back-to-back from 9-5 with a half hour lunch. The only thing keeping people sane is the students that fail to submit, or submit something obviously sub-par. So where possible, even for designing exams, you try to limit text altogether. Multiple choice, drawing lines, a basic diagram, a calculation, etc.Some students have terrible handwriting. I wouldn't be against the use of a dumb terminal in an exam room/hall. Maybe in the background it could be syncing the text and backing it up.> Unless you're specifically testing a student's ability to Google, they don't need access to it.I've been the person testing students, and I don't always remember everything. Sometimes it is good enough for the students to demonstrate that they understand the topic enough to know where to find the correct information based on a good intuition.

Your blue book is being graded by a stressed out and very underpaid grad student with many better things to do. They're looking for keywords to count up, that's it. The PI gave them the list of keywords, the rubric. Any flourishes, turns of phrase, novel takes, those don't matter to your grader at 11 pm after the 20th blue book that night.Yeah sure, that's not your school, but that is the reality of ~50% of US undergrads.

But again, the test creator matters a lot here too. To make such an exam is quite the labor. Especially as many/most PIs have other better things to do. Their incentives are grant money, then papers, then in a distant 3rd their grad students, and finally undergrad teaching.any departments are explicit on this. To spend the limited time on a good undergrad multiple choice exam is not in the PIs best interest.Which is why, in this case of a good Scantron exam, they're likely to just farm it out to Claude. Cheap, easy, fast, good enough. A winner in all dimensions.Also, as an aside to the above, an AI with OCR for your blue book would likely be the best realistic grader too. Needs less coffee after all

Now that I haven't been a student in a long time and (maybe crucially?) that I am friends with professors and in a relationship with one, I get it.

If you can pass an exam just by googling something, it means you're just testing rote-memorization rather, and maybe a better design is needed where synthesis and critical thinking skills are evaluated more actively.

The open book test is purposes is to not have to know all facts (formulas) but proving how to find them and how to apply them.

When I was studying at university there was a rumour that one of the dons had scraped through their fourth-year exams despite barely attending lectures, because he had a photographic memory and just so happened to leaf through a book containing a required proof, the night before the exam. That gave him enough points despite not necessarily understanding what he was writing.Obviously very few students have that sort of memory, but it's not necessarily fair to give advantage to those like me who can simply remember things more easily.

My students then often ask me to do the same, to permit them to bring one page of notes as he does.Then I would say: just assume you're writing the exam with him and work on your one-pager of notes, optimize your notes by copying and re-writing them a few times.  Now, the only difference between my exam and his exam is that the night before, you memorize your one-pager (if you re-wrote it a few times you should be able to recreate it purely from memory from that practice alone).I believe having had all material in your memory at the same time, at least once for a short while, gives students higher self-confidence; they may forget stuff again, but they hopefully remember the feeling of mastering it.

For most of us--myself included--once you graduate from college, the answer is: ""enough to not get fired"". This is far less than most curriculums ask you to know, and every year, ""enough to not get fired"" is a lower and lower bar. With LLMs, it's practically on the floor for 90% of full-time jobs.That is why I propose exactly the opposite regimen from this course, although I admire the writer's free thinking. Return to tradition, with a twist. Closed-book exams, no note sheets, all handwritten. Add a verbal examination, even though it massively increases examination time. No homework assignments, which encourage ""completionist mindset"", where the turning-in of the assignment feels more real than understanding the assignment. Publish problem sets thousands of problems large with worked-out-solutions to remove the incentive to cheat.""Memorization is a prerequisite for creativity"" -- paraphrase of an HN comment about a fondly remembered physics professor who made the students memorize every equation in the class. In the age of the LLM, I suspect this is triply true.

Calculators have never been more accessible/available.

LLM's are not consistent. For example, having a new company make a functional duplicate of ChatGPT is nearly impossible.Furthermore, the cost of LLM's can change at any time for any reason. Access can be changed by new government regulations, and private organizations can chose to suspend or revoke access to their LLM due to changes in local laws.All of this makes dependence on an LLM a risk for any professionals. The only way these would be mitigated is by an open source, freely available LLM that creates consistent results that students can learn how to use.

I thought the point was to continue in the same vein and contribute to the sum total of all human knowledge.

It may be that David Graebers core thesis was correct.  Most jobs are actually ""bullshit jobs,""  and in the era of the Internet,  they don't actually require any formal education to perform.

The culture has moved from competence to performance. Where universities used to be a gateway to a middle class life, now they're a source of debt. And social performances of all kind are far more valuable than the ability to work competently.Competence used to be central, now it's more and more peripheral. AI mirrors and amplifies that.

To the horror of anyone struggling with anxiety, ADHD, or any other source of memory-recall issues under examination pressure. This further optimizes everything for students who can memorize and recall information on the spot under artificial pressure, and who don't suffer any from any of the problems I mentioned.In grade school you could put me on the spot and I would blank on questions about subjects that I understood rather well and that I could answer 5 minutes before the exam and 5 minutes after the exam, but not during the exam. The best way for me to display my understanding and knowledge is through project assignments where that knowledge is put to practical use, or worked ""homework"" examples that you want to remove.Do you have any ideas for accommodating people who process information differently and find it easier to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding in different ways?

At the other extreme are universities offering low quality courses that are definitely degree factories.

Students had very good reason to question the education system when they were asked to memorize things that were safe to forget once they graduated from school. And when most functional adults admitted they forgot what they had learned in school. It was an issue before LLM, and triply so now.By the way, I now am 100% agree with ""Memorization is a prerequisite for creativity."" However, if you asked me to try to convince the 16-year-old me I would throw my hands up.

You are an outlier. When I was in school any outside assistance was tantamount to cheating and, unlike an actual crime, it was on the student to prove they were not cheating. Just the suspicion was enough to get you put in front of an honor board.It was also pervasive. I would say 40% of international students were cheaters. When some were caught they fell back on cultural norms as their defense. The university never balked because those students, or their institutions, paid tuition in cash.

I have corrected exams and graded assignments as an external party before (legal requirement). The biggest problem with LLMs I see is that the weak students copy-paste commands with unnecessary command line switches. But they would have done the same with stack overflow.Some also say they use LLM to help improve their writing but that's where the learning is so why????? I think it's the anxiety for failing, they don't seem to understand I'll not fail them as long as their incoherent text proves they understood what they were doing.Having graduated and knowing how things are ought to look, taking exams are so much less scary now because I'm confident I will be failed for being incompetent, not because I didn't write properly. Not all students have the same privilege, they gain it over time.It does help that computer science assignments and papers are pretty damn standard in form.

The main strategy is collaboration. If you are smart enough to:1. Identify your problem
2. Ask someone about it
3. Get an answer which improve your understandingThen you are doing pretty good by all standardsAnother trick I sometimes use. I take one student which has hard time articulate it a concept. I take student two who don't understand that concept. I say to student 1: ""You have 20 minutes to teach student 2 the concept. When I come back, you will be graded according to his answers""(I, of course, not only grade that. But it forces both of them to make an extra effort, student 2 not willing to be the cause for student 1 demise)

Regarding the collaboration before the exam, it's really strange. In our generation, asking or exchanging questions was perfectly normal. I got an almost perfect score in physics thanks to that. I guess the elegant solution was still in me, but I might not have been able to come up with it in such a stressful situation. 'Almost' because the professor deducted one point from my score for being absent too often :)However, oral exams in Europe are quite different from those at US universities. In an oral exam, the professor can interact with the student to see if they truly understand the subject, regardless of the written text. Allowing a chatbot during a written exam today would be defying the very purpose of the exam.

I think not all exams can occur like that. In some cases
you just have to test one's knowledge about a specific
topic, and knowing facts is a very, very easy way to 
test this. I would agree that just focusing on facts
these days is overrated, but I would still reason that
it is not a useless metric still. So, when the author
describes ""bring your own exam questions"", it more means
that the exam itself is not so relevant, which is fine -
but saying that university exams are now useless in the
age of autosolving chatbots, is simply wrong. It just
means that the exam itself is not important; that in
itself does not automatically mean that ALL exams or
exam styles are useless. Also, it depends on what you
test. For instance, testing solving math questions - 
yes, chatbots can solve this, but can a student solve
the same without needing a chatbot? How about practical
skills? Ok, 3D printing will dominate, but the ability
to craft something with your own hands, that is still a
skill that may be useful, at the least to some extent.I feel that the whole discussion about chatbots dumbs
down a lot. Skills have not become irrelevant just 
because chatbots exist.

In my experience LLMs can significantly speed up the process of solving exam questions. They can surface relevant material I don't know about, they can remember how other similar problems are solved a lot better than I can and they can check for any mistakes in my answer. Yes when you get into very niche areas they start to fail (and often in a misleading way) but if you run through practise papers at all you can tell this and either avoid using the LLM or do some fine tuning on past papers.

Our written assignments were a lot of ""have an LLM generate a business proposal, then  annotate it yourself""The final exam was a 30 minute meeting where we just talked as peers, kinda like a cultural job interview. Sure there's lots of potential for bias there, but I think it's better than just blindly passing students using LLM's for the final exam.

Well, at least it used to be the bottleneck. Nowadays you can just ask an LLM. For all their faults, they are really good at letting you know about what tools exist in out there in the world, surfacing more than you could ever come to know about even if all you did was read about what exists all day, every day.

You are certainly headed in the right direction, but not quite. To be seen as an expert in the eyes of others you need to have had a vision for something and to have successfully executed on it. If the vision was dependent on calculus, then you will have reached a point where you had to learn something about calculus, of course...But that's different to having a taskmaster tell you to learn calculus for no apparent reason. Even if you follow through and built up a huge wealth of knowledge from it, you would still not be deemed an expert by others. You're no different than an encyclopedia, which isn't an expert either. It is being able to see things others can't and the ability to act upon it that makes an expert.Learning taking place when you need it isn't the same as never.> Maybe when we have supremely reliable LLMs that can replace humans we might not but we're not there yet.Frankly, even Page Rank already replaced humans for this. But LLMs are even better at it. Humans are just that poorly performing. Like I said before, even someone doing nothing in life but looking for what exists in the world could not take in as much as databases that have indexed every written thing.

When I was a student, professors maintained a public archive of past exams. The reason was obvious: next time the questions would be different, and memorizing past answers wouldn't help you if you don't understand the core ideas being taught. Then I took part in an exchange program and went to some shit-tier uni and I realized that collaboration was explicitly forbidden because professors would usually ask questions along ""what was on slide 54"". My favorite part was when professor said ""I can't publish the slides online because they're stolen from another professor but you can buy them in the faculcy's shop"".My uni maintained a giant presence on Facebook - we'd share a lot of information, and the most popular group was ""easy courses"" for students who wanted to graduate but couldn't afford a difficult elective course.The exchange uni had none of that. Literally no community, no collaboration, nothing. It's astonishing.BTW regarding the stream of consciousness - I distinctly remember taking an exam and doing my best to force my brain to think about the exam questions, rather than porn I had been watching the previous day.

I'm sympathetic to both sides here.As a professor who had to run Subversion for students (a bit before Git, et al), it's a nightmare to put the infrastructure together, keep it reliable under spiky loads (there is always a crush at the deadline), be customer support for students who manage to do something weird or lose their password, etc.  You wind up spending a non-trivial amount of time being sysadmin for the class on top of your teaching duties.  Being able to say ""Put it on GitHub"" short circuits all of that.  It sucks, but it makes life a huge amount easier for the professor.From the students point of view, sure, it sucks that nobody mentioned that Git could be used independently (or jj or Mercurial or ...)   However, Github is going to be better than what 99.9% of all professors will put together or be able to use.  Sure, you can use Git by itself, but then it needs to go somewhere that the professor can look at it, get submitted to automated testing, etc.  That's not a trivial step.  My students were happy that I had the ""Best Homework Submission System"" (said about Subversion of all things ...) because everybody else used the dumbass university enterprise thing that was completely useless (not going to mention its name because it deserves to die in the blazing fires of the lowest circle of Hell).  However, it wasn't straightforward for me to put that together.  And the probability of getting a professor with my motivation and skill is pretty low.

All other prefixes can be repeated.

* Some instructions require VEX.L or VEX.W to be 0 or 1, and some encodings result in completely different instructions if you change VEX.L.* Different bits of the EVEX prefix are valid depending on the opcode byte.* Some encodings (called groups) produce different instructions depending on bits 3-5 of the modrm byte (the second byte after all prefixes). Some encodings further produce different groups depending on whether bits 6-7 (mod) of the modrm byte identifies a register or not.* Some instructions read a whole vector register but only a scalar if the same instruction has a memory operand. Sometimes this is clear in the manual, sometimes it is not, sometimes the manual is downright wrong.* Some instructions do not allow using the legacy high-8-bits registers even though they don't do anything with bits 8 and above of the operand: they only want a 32- or 64-bit register as their operand.* APX (EVEX map 4) looks a lot like legacy map 0, but actually a few instructions were moved there from other maps for good reasons, a few more were moved there for no apparent reason (SHLD/SHRD iirc), and a few more are new.* REX2 does not extend SSE and AVX instructions to 32 registers even though REX does extend them to 16.* Intel defines a thing called VEX instruction classes, which makes sense except for a dozen or two instructions where it doesn't. For these, sometimes AMD uses a different class, sometimes doesn't; sometimes AMD's choice makes sense, sometimes it doesn't.And many more that I found out while writing QEMU's current x86 decoder (which tries to be table based but sometimes that's just impossible).

There is even an instruction where AMD got this wrong! VPERMQ requires VEX.W=1, but some AMD CPUs also happily execute it when VEX.W=0 even though that is supposed to raise an exception.

This is one of the reasons why the x86 could be extended so much.  PAUSE is just REP NOP, for example.  Segment prefixes in front of conditional branches were used as static branch prediction hints (which I believe have returned in some newer Intel CPUs).  Useful if you want to make a hint on newer CPUs that is harmless on older CPUs.Some prefixes have become part of the encoding for certain SIMD instructions, but that is a different case because those prefixes aren't hints.

The correct behavior for allowing future extensions has already been introduced by Intel with 80186, in 1982, which has introduced an invalid instruction exception, to be used for all undefined instruction opcodes.This behavior was unlike 8086/8088, which happily executed any undefined instructions, most of them being aliases to defined instructions.For any opcode where current CPUs generate invalid instruction exceptions, it is very easy to define them in future CPUs to encode useful instructions. Had REP NOP generated exceptions in old CPUs, it would have been still fine for it to become PAUSE in current CPUs. Unfortunately, the designers of Intel CPUs have not always followed their own documentation, so not all invalid opcodes generate the exception, as they should. The non-enforcing of this condition has led to the existence of even commercial programs that are invalid or of compilers that generate officially invalid instructions.It is true that there are a few cases when Intel has exploited the fact that some encodings were equivalent with a NOP on old CPUs, by reusing them for some instruction on new CPUs, where this allowed the execution of a program compiled for new CPUs on old CPUs. However this has been possible only for very few instructions, e.g. for branch direction hints, when not executing them on old CPUs does not change the result of a program.In general the reuse of an opcode for a new instruction, when that opcode does not generate exceptions on old CPUs, is very dangerous, because the execution on old CPUs of a program compiled for new CPUs will have unpredictable consequences, like destroying some property of the user.Your example with PAUSE is also one of the very few examples, besides branch hints, where the execution of a new program on old computers is not dangerous, despite the reassignment of the opcode.Some time ago there was a discussion about a bug in some CPU, but I do not remember in which one, where the bug was triggered when the order of the REP prefix and of the 64-bit REX prefix was invalid, but the invalid order was ignored by the older CPUs instead of generating the appropriate exception, which allowed the execution of invalid programs, which did not have any bad effects on old CPUs, but they triggered the bug on that specific new CPU.The new CPU should have been bug-free, but also the programs that triggered the bug should not have existed, as they should have crashed immediately on any older CPU.

I've seen benchmarks that go both ways in terms of a ""winner"" but in terms of overall variance there seems to be very little.  There are some cases where ARM64 or RISCV do better and there are some cases where x86_64 does better.  I can't see code density being a relevant factor when picking one ISA over another.We've got good compilers now anyways..  outside of power consumption..  the ISA wars are dead.

But as you point out, code density gets far less attention in tech circles these days.  And higher-level decision makers rightfully focus on higher-level system performance metrics.

Elon Musk and his limitless bank account are getting back into politics.

The multibillionaire is spending $10 million to back pro-Trump businessman Nate Morris in the Kentucky Republican primaries to fill retiring Sen. Mitch McConnell's seat, according to an Axios report. The donation is reportedly Musk's biggest single contribution ever to a Senate race.

Morris is an “anti-establishment” Republican who shares Musk's frustrations with McConnell. He is running on an anti-immigration platform and has already been endorsed by top MAGA figures like Steve Bannon and the late Charlie Kirk. He is also reportedly a good friend of the vice president. Trump himself hasn't yet weighed in with an endorsement.

Once a Democrat, Elon Musk spent more than $290 million on the 2024 election in support of Republicans, most notably President Donald Trump. The election saw a Republican sweep as the GOP secured the trifecta of the House, Senate, and White House while enjoying the fruits of a conservative Supreme Court. Following Trump's inauguration, Musk had a significant presence in Trump's administration, accompanying the President in some public appearances and leading the now-defunct DOGE.

It didn't take long for Musk to reap what he sowed. It turned out that people hated Musk, even more so than they did Trump, according to public polling in the spring of last year. Protesters around the U.S. and abroad organized action in Tesla dealerships as the company saw its biggest sales decline in history.

Then in April, Musk was handed a major political defeat. In an off-year race, Wisconsin voters turned out in record numbers to vote against the candidate for whom Musk had spent $20 million to buy a seat in office.

“He's finished, done, gone. He polls terrible. People hate him,” an anonymous GOP operative told Politico last May.  “He'd go to Wisconsin thinking he can buy people's votes, wear the cheese hat, act like a 9-year-old. … It doesn't work. It's offensive to people.”

And it did seem like he was done and gone for a while, especially after Musk left the political spotlight following a very public fallout with his former best friend, Trump.

But late last year, he returned to Trump's periphery. He can be seen flaunting his private dinners with Trump, signing AI deals with the Pentagon, reaffirming his support for Republican super PACs, and actively engaging in foreign affairs.

Now it seems he's already preparing to shell out big to protect Trump's power in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections. Musk has told Republicans that he plans to give more, Axios reported. Whether Musk will put the cheese hat back on and hit the campaign trail himself remains to be seen.

                Reading time 3 minutes
      

On Monday, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) announced the development of its tokenized securities platform for trading U.S. stocks via blockchain technology. The new platform is said to enable trading on a 24/7 basis and immediate settlement of assets, among other features, and it will operate as a completely separate addition to the traditional NYSE.

The exchange claims it is also currently seeking regulatory approval for the new tokenized trading initiative. Notably, regulatory clarity around tokenized stock trading is a key component of the CLARITY Act, which is currently under discussion in Congress and recently experienced a setback in the form of crypto exchange giant Coinbase's removal of support.

Despite Wall Street's increased interest in the concept of tokenization oftentimes being touted as a win for crypto platforms, CoinDesk has reported the blockchains being used by NYSE are private and not public platforms like Ethereum or Solana. Unlike the decentralized crypto networks that are more frequently reported on in the press, a private blockchain is a permissioned network where access and participation are restricted to authorized entities, often controlled by a single organization or consortium of banks.

The desire to avoid the use of public networks has seen increased interest from some centralized financial institutions over the past year or two. For example, stablecoin issuers Circle and Tether are now promoting their own blockchain offerings that have stablecoin-centric features and avoid costs associated with decentralization that may not be necessary for centrally-issued, dollar-pegged assets like USDC and USDT.

That said, many private blockchain networks are compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is a point often used by Ethereum proponents to show their technology is still having an impact, despite these private systems not having any connection to the public Ethereum network or its associated ETH crypto asset.

Of course, there are also a number of financial firms issuing stocks on public crypto networks, with the current total value of such tokens measured at roughly $850 million by RWA.xyz. Last year, Robinhood also outlined stock tokenization as the key value proposition of their own Ethereum layer-two network. This is also a major area of emphasis for more crypto-focused fintechs such as Coinbase and Kraken. At this point, it's unclear where tokenized stocks will ultimately end up trading, but what is clear is these sorts of centralized institutions built on top of crypto's base layers will want to maximize revenue and control, as has already been seen with the stablecoin issuers.

Increased centralization around real world asset tokens (namely stablecoins) has been a key area of concern and contentious debates over the past year, as more tech giants and banks are coming to the space to issue stablecoins rather than simply become another node on a network like Bitcoin. Indeed, NYSE's announcement from Monday morning also points to the use of stablecoins as a funding mechanism.

As crypto has continued to rely upon stablecoins and other centralized power structures in search of greater adoption, the sector moves further away from Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto's original design, which ironically focused on disintermediating those same sorts of financial and tech institutions.

The Bitcoin network's focus on its own native asset (rather than centrally-issued tokens) has somewhat shielded itself from this trend towards centralization. However, growing institutional support as a long-term reserve asset, whether it be via the Harvard University endowment or the U.S. government, has led to growing concerns around the centralization of bitcoin custody. Then again, it can definitely still be used as a decentralized safe haven option in times of economic crises as well, as most recently seen in Iran.

After sharing 3D renders for the expected foldable iPhone's design, Jon Prosser, aka the YouTuber and leaker who Apple is suing for spilling the beans on iOS 26 and Liquid Glass, is back at it again with another detailed unveil. This time, for the iPhone 18 Pro. But there's one new change that may be completely wrong.

Prosser corroborates previous reports that Apple will announce the iPhone 18 Pro (and 18 Pro Max) alongside the foldable iPhone. There will reportedly be no regular iPhone 18 since that's supposedly getting pushed to a spring 2027 launch, and there may not be an iPhone Air 2 until 2027 as well due to poor sales for the first-gen skinny phone.

As for what to expect from the iPhone 18 Pros: Prosser says they'll look like the iPhone 17 Pros but come in new colors (he says Apple is testing burgundy, brown, and purple), include a faster A20 Pro chip, and the main camera will sport a “variable aperture,” which is a way for the lens to open and close to control how much light reaches the image sensor and, as a result, how shallow the depth of field (background blur or “bokeh” in photography terminology) is. A variable aperture is easily a “pro” camera feature instead of the current point-and-shoot functionality. Prosser does caution that the variable aperture feature may be exclusive to the iPhone 18 Pro Max model or not ship at all on any models.

Samsung introduced a variable aperture in the Galaxy S9 series and kept it for the Galaxy S10 series before removing it from the S20 phones. Needless to say, the feature didn't gain any traction.

Prosser also says that the iPhone 18 Pros will come with a simplified Camera Control button. Instead of having both capacitive touch and pressure-sensitive capabilities, the new Camera Control will reportedly only have the latter, which could mean losing some swipe-based features that the button has on the iPhone 16, iPhone 17, and iPhone Air series.

Furthermore, Prosser says the iPhone 18 Pros will have a C2 modem (no more Qualcomm ones) and a 5G via Satellite feature, which would mirror a similar feature in the latest Apple Watches like the Ultra 3.

However, the biggest change might be to the front of the iPhone—specifically, the top of the display where the Dynamic Island is located. Prosser says the selfie camera will move from the top center to the top left corner, which would be very un-Apple-like. In fact, as many have noted, it'd look like an Android phone, like the Google Pixel 5. Why would Apple copy the look of five-year-old Android phones?

There may have been some information that was lost in translation. While Apple is expected to move the iPhone's flood illuminator to underneath the screen (this is the component that will likely be moved to the top left corner), the selfie camera, dot projector, and infrared camera would remain centered in a smaller pill-shaped cutout.

Always western media messed up the info. It always has been like this. https://t.co/R8WgjdYmYJ pic.twitter.com/GmX83XWp4e

All of this is to say that no leaks—not even from Prosser—should be taken as fact. Remember when Prosser was wrong about the Apple Watch Series 7 getting a flat-sided redesign? As always, nothing is official until it comes directly from Apple. Still, expect the leaks and rumors on the iPhone 18 Pros to pick up from now until September, which is *checks calendar* not for another eight months. This is just how the leak cycle works.

What happens when you die…and you're a cryptocurrency? Because deaths of this sort have been happening in record numbers lately. The most famous death of a cryptocurrency is probably TerraUSD which, along with sister token Luna, plunged in value from its $1 peg to 14 cents over the course of one chaotic week, and then kept dropping to about 2 cents, where it has mostly stayed ever since.This is how currencies die. TerraUSD was renamed USTC, and trades have happened from time to time for whatever reason at various tiny fractions of a dollar. Nothing is truly worth nothing, and technologically speaking, a dead cryptocurrency that is still on a usable blockchain can often still be transferred on the off chance someone is willing to lift a finger. But there's perhaps no better way to illustrate what you learn in the first minute of economics 101. Something no one wants has no market value. That's economic death. With that in mind, a recent report from CoinGecko (via CoinDesk) says the crypto reaper has been unusually busy lately. Looking at its own records from as far back as 2021, CoinGecko found that 20.2 million tokens had been placed on the market, and that the majority—53.2%—have ceased active trading. They're dead. What's more, 11.6 million of the token failures recorded by CoinGecko—86.3%—happened last year. In other words, 2025 was a mass die-off.Incidentally, 2025 was the year Pump.fun, a disturbingly glib “decentralized social casino” overtly dedicated to creating cryptocurrencies cheaply and easily on the spur of the moment, went super viral. In its early days, Pump.fun featured “a guy who smokes meth on stream, a drunk lawyer who gives shitty legal advice that degenerates the longer the stream goes on, and a guy promising not to sleep until his coin hits a $10 million market cap,” Matthew Gault wrote on Gizmodo.So it's not hard to come up with some wild guesses as to just how all these deaths of currencies happened. It's been an era of zero-effort memecoins, spurred in part by a leader of the U.S. who describes himself as the “crypto president.”

One-off joke coins that never came with any expectation of being anyone's long-term investment don't die in exactly the same catastrophic way as TerraUSD. They just freeze at whatever point they stopped being funny, and get abandoned. Nonetheless, each dead currency was somebody's proverbial bag of coins at some point, and each corpse is evidence that someone—maybe a sucker who got grifted, but maybe just the creator who had a private chuckle—got stuck holding it.

Shortage drives fraudsters to target legacy GPUs

The ongoing DRAM shortage has driven the best graphics card prices to new heights for gamers and also created a perfect storm for fraud. In a revealing YouTube video, Brother Zhang, a renowned graphics card technician in China, exposes how scammers are using the old switcheroo tactic on Nvidia's last-generation GeForce RTX 40-series (codename Ada Lovelace) graphics cards to scam unsuspecting buyers in the second-hand market.

In one case, the graphics card in question was the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4080 16GB Aero OC, a custom variant of the GeForce RTX 4080 that retailed for around $1,199 at launch. The seller claimed the graphics card was not functional and wanted to offload it for just $143.50 on Xianyu, a popular second-hand marketplace in China. The suspiciously low price, approximately 12% of the graphics card's original retail value, would raise a red flag among potential buyers.

However, the asking price seemed reasonable at first glance because of the graphics card's supposedly damaged condition. It would be an opportunity of a lifetime for anyone with repair skills or access to a skilled technician like Brother Zhang. The buyer, hoping to score a bargain on premium hardware, pulled the trigger and made the purchase. However, it may be his greatest regret after Brother Zhang took a look at it.

The initial anomalies were a damaged PCIe connector, a partially cracked PCB, and loose screws. The latter suggests that someone had already opened the graphics card previously. Nonetheless, the graphics card is still salvageable because you can transplant the silicon and memory chips to a new PCB, provided they are legitimate and functional. The bad news just kept pouring in as Brother Zhang continued his inspection.

Closer examination revealed the true extent of the scam. The silicon wasn't the Ada Lovelace AD103 die powering GeForce RTX 4080 graphics cards. Instead, Brother Zhang discovered an Ampere GA106 die, specifically the variant used in the GeForce RTX 3060 Mobile. Scammers have really improved their tactics as the engravings on the counterfeit AD103 die were obviously fake. It doesn't surprise us, as Chinese factories were repurposing these mobile Ampere dies into desktop graphics cards a couple of years ago.

The sham didn't stop there, though. The GDDR6X memory chips were also highly suspicious. Brother Zhang suspected they were either fake, defective, or salvaged chips from donor graphics cards. Therefore, the poor buyer struck out as both the silicon and memory chips are useless for anything.

Consumers are already feeling the impact of the ongoing DRAM crisis as graphics card prices have surged substantially across both the retail and second-hand markets. Nvidia has reportedly slashed supply to its board partners by up to 20%. The aggressive reduction will only further tighten the supply of graphics cards and push prices even higher. Meanwhile, AMD has publicly committed to keeping pricing as close to MSRP as possible. Still, realistically, it's only a matter of time before it has to resort to a more significant price increase.

Graphics card scams have always been around, and they flourish during hard times, such as the COVID era or the cryptocurrency mining boom. If you're considering purchasing a second-hand graphics card from Facebook Marketplace or eBay to save money during this shortage, do your due diligence and proceed with extreme caution. Even supposedly “new” graphics cards from questionable sellers have turned out to be elaborate swindles nowadays.

PSMC follows Nanya and Inotera's footsteps, but will retain independence.

In an unexpected turn of events, Micron announced plans to buy Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation's (PSMC) P5 fabrication site in Tongluo, Miaoli County, Taiwan, for a total cash consideration of $1.8 billion. To a large degree, the transaction would evolve Micron's long-term 'technology-for-capacity' strategy, which it has used for decades. This also signals that DRAM fabs are now so capital-intensive that it is no longer viable for companies like PSMC to build them and get process technologies from companies like Micron. The purchase is also set against the backdrop of the ongoing DRAM supply squeeze, as data centers are set to consumer 70% of all memory chips made in 2026.

""This strategic acquisition of an existing cleanroom complements our current Taiwan operations and will enable Micron to increase production and better serve our customers in a market where demand continues to outpace supply,"" said Manish Bhatia, executive vice president of global operations at Micron Technology. ""The Tongluo fab's close proximity to Micron's Taichung site will enable synergies across our Taiwan operations.""

 




The deal between Micron and PSMC includes 300,000 square feet of existing 300mm cleanroom space, which will greatly expand Micron's production footprint in Taiwan. By today's standards, a 300,000 square foot cleanroom is a relatively large one, but it will be dwarfed by Micron's next-generation DRAM campus in New York, which will feature four cleanrooms of 600,000 square feet each. However, the first of those fabs will only come online in the late 2020s or in the early 2030s.

The transaction is expected to close by Q2 2026, pending receipt of all necessary approvals. After closing, Micron will gradually equip and ramp the site for DRAM production, with meaningful wafer output starting in the second half of 2027.

The agreement also establishes a long-term strategic partnership under which PSMC will support Micron with assembly services, while Micron will assist PSMC's legacy DRAM portfolio.

 




While the P5 site in Tongluo isn't producing memory in high volumes today, the change of ownership and inevitable upgrade of the fab itself will have an impact on global DRAM supply, which is good news for a segment that is experiencing unprecedented demand. While it is important that Micron is set to buy a production facility in Taiwan, it is even more important that the transaction marks an end to its technology-for-capacity approach to making memory on the island. In the past, instead of building large amounts of new greenfield fabs in Taiwan, Micron partnered with local foundries (most notably PSMC, but also with Inotera and Nanya) and provided advanced DRAM process technology in exchange for wafer capacity, manufacturing services, or fab access.

This approach allowed Micron to expand output faster and with less capital risk, leveraged Taiwan's mature 300mm manufacturing ecosystem, and avoided duplicating the front-end infrastructure, which was already in place.

However, it looks like the traditional technology-for-capacity model — which worked well in the 90nm – 20nm-class node era — no longer works. It worked well when DRAM fabs cost a few billion dollars, when process ramps were straightforward, and when partners could justify their capital risks in exchange for technologies (which cost billions in R&D investments) and stable wafer demand.

Today's advanced DRAM fabs require $15 – $25 billion or more of upfront investment. This would go into equipment like pricey EUV scanners, as well as longer and riskier yield ramps. In that environment, a partner running someone else's IP absorbs massive CapEx and execution risk while getting limited advantages, which makes the economics increasingly unattractive: after all, if you can invest over $20 billion in a fab, you can certainly invest $2 billion in R&D.

In recent years, Micron's behavior has reflected this shift in thinking. Early technology-for-capacity deals helped it scale quickly, but once fabs crossed a certain cost and complexity threshold, Micron had to move on and own fabs instead of renting capacity. This is reflected in moves like its Elpida acquisition in 2013, where the company purchased a bankrupt memory maker to secure the company's capacity. This was followed up in 2016 with the Inotera acquisition, and now with PSMC.

What remains of the model is essentially pushed to legacy nodes, which are almost all fully depreciated, or to specialty DRAM, which does not require leading-edge process nodes. Other remnants of the model may be found in additional backend services, where capital intensity and strategic risks are also lower.

For leading-edge DRAM, ownership and control now outweigh the benefits of partnership, which marks the end of an era as modern fabs are now too expensive, too strategic, and too tightly integrated with product roadmaps. The acquisition of the P5 site was preceded by perhaps the last technology for a capacity partnership for Micron in Taiwan. Now, the American company will own the site and invest in its transition to its latest process technologies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:medicalnewstoday.com","Aging muscles: How does exercise help prevent protein decline?","https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/exercise-prevents-muscle-loss-aging-how-protein-biology","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 08:27:11 GMT","

From age 30, a person's muscle mass decreases by 3-8% per decade, and this decline accelerates after age 60. Although muscle loss cannot be prevented entirely, we know that an active lifestyle, including strength training, can slow the decline and increase muscle strength, helping people remain mobile and independent for as long as possible.

Now, researchers have uncovered the molecular pathway that explains how exercise helps us maintain muscle.

The study, published in PNAS, found that exercise suppresses a transcription factor, DEAF1, that drives protein imbalance and muscle decline, helping muscles to regenerate.

“We believe our findings are important because they uncover a previously unknown biological mechanism that helps explain why muscles weaken with age. While it has long been known that exercise protects muscle health, the molecular reasons behind this benefit were not fully understood. Our study identifies DEAF1 as a key driver of age-related muscle decline and shows that exercise can directly suppress this pathway.”

— Tang Hong-Wen, Corresponding Author, Assistant Professor at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.

Sebnem Unluisler, genetic engineer at the London Regenerative Institute, who wasn't involved in the study, called the study highly significant, telling Medical News Today:

“It shows that aging shifts muscle protein regulation away from repair toward accumulation, which is a core driver of muscle decline. The transcription factor DEAF1 increases with age and suppresses the cell's ability to clear damaged proteins, leaving muscle tissue less resilient and more fragile.”

The researchers examined a pathway controlled by the mTORC1 complex, which links nutrient signals to the metabolic processes required for cell growth. They knew that hyperactivation of mTORC1 leads to age-related muscle loss, but wanted to find out why.

To do this, they used fruit fly and mouse models to investigate what was controlling mTORC1, discovering that a protein, DEAF1, was key. Although DEAF1 is present in both young and older muscles, aging muscles are much more sensitive to its effects. 

Tang Hong-Wen told Medical News Today: 

“As we get older, our muscle cells slowly lose their ability to clear away damaged proteins and repair themselves. We discovered that a protein called DEAF1 becomes more active in aging muscle and drives another system, mTOR, into overdrive. This makes muscle cells focus too much on growth and not enough on maintenance and repair, which gradually leads to muscle weakness.”

“Exercise turns on protective ‘longevity' genes called FOXO, which act like a brake on DEAF1. When DEAF1 is switched down, muscle cells regain their ability to recycle damaged parts and stay healthy. In simple terms, exercise helps restore balance inside muscle cells and keeps muscles stronger for longer,” Tang explained.

Both DEAF1 and mTORC1 regulate protein synthesis, autophagy (cell recycling), and metabolism. The researchers found that aging muscle is more sensitive to DEAF1 than younger muscle, so it loses its ability to clear damaged proteins and cellular components.

By exercising, you can activate FOXO genes, which regulate DEAF1, allowing the muscle to clear damaged material and focus on producing the proteins needed for muscle repair.

“Exercise counteracts [muscle decline] by down-regulating DEAF1 and re-activating cellular repair and quality-control mechanisms. In simple terms, exercise restores the muscle cell's ability to fix itself rather than just produce new material. Resistance-based exercise is likely the most effective, as it provides the strongest molecular stimulus for repair, adaptation, and long-term maintenance of muscle integrity during aging.”

— Sebnem Unluisler

The researchers found that different exercises have different effects, but that any exercise can help to preserve and strengthen muscle.

Acute or resistance exercise, such as weight training, stimulates mTORC1 to promote muscle protein synthesis, whereas aerobic activity, such as brisk walking or cycling, suppresses the pathway by activating FOXO, which represses DEAF1 and prevents muscle degeneration.

“Our findings suggest that both aerobic (endurance) exercise and resistance (strength) training are beneficial for muscle health. Each type of exercise activates the body's protective FOXO pathway in slightly different ways, and doing a combination of both is likely to provide the greatest benefit. In practical terms, regular physical activity — such as brisk walking, cycling, swimming, along with light weight or bodyweight training — can play an important role in maintaining strong, healthy muscles as we age.”

— Tang Hong-Wen

“One encouraging message from our study,” says Tan, “is that it is never too late to benefit from exercise. Even in older muscle, this protective pathway can still be switched on. We hope our findings will motivate more people to stay active and also help guide the development of new treatments that support healthy aging.”

“Our work also highlights that muscle aging is not simply about losing muscle mass, but about losing the ability to maintain healthy muscle,” he told us. “By identifying DEAF1 as a central regulator of this process, we aim to inspire new strategies — including both exercise-based and medical approaches — to help older adults remain stronger, more mobile, and more independent for longer.”

So even if you do not exercise much at present, introducing more activity into your daily routine at any age can help you preserve that vital muscle as you age.

 January 20, 2026  

Congenital heart defects (CHD) showed clear familial clustering, with the odds rising steadily as more relatives were affected and reaching up to a 45‑fold increase when four or more relatives had CHD. The association was stronger through the maternal line than the paternal line.

""These findings highlight the clinical importance of detailed family history in risk assessment and the need to integrate genomic data in future research to better elucidate recurrence mechanisms and improve counselling,"" the researchers of the study wrote.

The study was led by Kalliopi Kazamia, Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. It was published online on January 08, 2026, in the European Heart Journal.

CHD may have been misclassified because diagnoses were captured from registers. Lack of genetic data limited the ability to distinguish inherited from non‑genetic factors. Differences in ancestry and parental country of birth may have influenced recurrence patterns. 

The study received funding from multiple sources including Hjärt-lungfonden, the Norwegian Research Council, Stiftelsen Samariten, the Gillbergska Foundation, and the Pediatric Research Foundation at Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital. One author reported receiving research funding that supported salary during research time, software licences, and statistical consulting services from Red Door Analytics AB; another author reported being employed by Red Door Analytics AB and receiving payment for statistical support and data management for the study.

Robert J. DeBernardo, MD, discusses how understanding and treatment of endometrial cancer have evolved dramatically, allowing for more personalized care that directly benefits patients. Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, new molecular classifications enable doctors to select therapies best suited to each patient's specific cancer type, improving the chances of better outcomes and potentially longer lives. For patients with aggressive or advanced disease, newly available therapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted medications, have become valuable tools that can offer hope where little existed before.

The impact of these advances is deeply felt in patient stories, like that of a woman with uterine carcinosarcoma whose life might have been extended or improved by today's treatments, highlighting the human significance behind ongoing progress. Ultimately, these innovations mean patients are now more likely to receive therapies tailored to their unique situations, increasing both the quality and duration of life.

She was previously treated with a second-generation H1 antihistamine, which was titrated to the maximum allowed/safe dose, but her symptoms have continued without meaningful improvement.

On examination, she has scattered, transient wheals on the trunk and extremities and mild, nonscarring lip angioedema with no residual bruising or purpura. Vital signs are unremarkable. Laboratory studies, including complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP), are within normal limits. Testing for immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies was carried out.

CSU refractory to H1 antihistamines is the most likely diagnosis in this patient, given her 6-month history of near-daily pruritic wheals and intermittent angioedema, the absence of a consistent external or inducible trigger, and persistent symptoms despite treatment with a second-generation H1 antihistamine at the maximum allowed dose.

Autoinflammatory syndromes such as Schnitzler syndrome, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, adult-onset Still disease, Sweet syndrome, or VEXAS are characterized by recurrent fever, disabling arthralgia or bone pain, markedly elevated inflammatory markers, and dense neutrophilic dermatosis on biopsy, features that are absent in this case. Likewise, dermatologic mimickers (eg, neutrophilic urticarial dermatosis, urticarial bullous pemphigoid, serum sickness-like reaction, urticarial dermatitis, hypereosinophilic syndrome, urticarial mycosis fungoides) usually present with prolonged or painful lesions, eosinophilia, bullae, drug exposure, or organ involvement.

A limited laboratory evaluation is the best method to support the diagnosis of CSU in a patient who already meets clinical criteria based on history and physical examination. CSU remains a clinical diagnosis, and guidelines emphasize that only a focused history, targeted physical exam, and a small set of basic laboratory tests are required to confirm the working diagnosis and exclude relevant alternatives. Routine expanded testing does not improve diagnostic accuracy or clinical outcomes.

The recommended baseline panel is CBC with differential and ESR/CRP in all patients, as well as total IgE and IgG-anti-TPO, in patients in specialist care. This panel screens for inflammatory, autoimmune, or systemic features that may point away from CSU. Mild abnormalities such as eosinopenia, elevated CRP, or increased mean platelet volume can suggest a more active or autoimmune CSU phenotype but do not indicate a different diagnosis. When the history confirms spontaneous, short-lived wheals and the exam shows transient lesions without purpura or residual pigmentation, this limited evaluation is sufficient.

Expanded work-up with biopsy or ASST is usually reserved for atypical features. Complement testing is appropriate only when hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis is suspected based on persistent wheals, angioedema, purpura, or systemic symptoms such as recurrent fever or disabling arthralgias.

Laboratory studies, including CBC, ESR, and CRP, were within normal limits. Anti-TPO results were negative. Based on the patient's symptoms, history, and current treatment regimen, CSU refractory to H1 antihistamines is confirmed.

For patients with CSU who remain symptomatic despite maximally-tolerated H1 antihistamines, the disease is considered antihistamine-refractory, and the recommended next step is escalation to an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody.

H2-antagonists and leukotriene receptor antagonists are not the most appropriate treatment options for this patient at this time. They might offer limited adjunctive benefit but are not part of the evidence-based step-up pathway for antihistamine-refractory CSU. While long-term systemic corticosteroids are not appropriate due to the risk of metabolic, cardiovascular, and immunologic toxicities, short, rescue courses can be administered when absolutely necessary.

The patient is started on omalizumab while continuing a second-generation H1 antihistamine.

For patients with partial or inadequate response after 8-12 weeks of omalizumab, guideline support up-dosing, either increasing the total dose or shortening the dosing interval. Many patients who do not respond at standard dosing achieve control with optimized omalizumab before moving to second-line immunosuppressants.

The same guidelines state short course of systemic corticosteroids may provide temporary symptom relief but is not recommended for routine management due to the risk of cumulative adverse effects and does not constitute a guideline-supported maintenance strategy.

Transition to cyclosporine, a calcineurin inhibitor, becomes appropriate only after failure of optimized omalizumab. It is a valid option as the disease progresses, but not the immediate guideline recommended next step. It is a recommended fourth-line therapy after failure of high-dose antihistamines and omalizumab.

The omalizumab dose given to the patient is increased, and symptoms begin to improve.

Autoimmune thyroid disease is common in CSU and can influence disease activity. Treating abnormal thyroid function is guideline-consistent and can contribute to improved spontaneous urticaria control.

Continuing current treatment is inappropriate, given the breakthrough symptoms and elevated TSH levels. H2-blockers might reduce symptoms, and switching from omalizumab to immunosuppressant therapy with a calcineurin inhibitor can be appropriate, but presence of hypothyroidism should be addressed first.

The patient is started on thyroid replacement therapy, and CSU control improves over subsequent visits.

Treatment with dulaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, led to a substantial decrease in copeptin levels compared to that with placebo in participants with euvolaemia, independent of changes in blood pressure, BMI, or nausea.

""Results of our study show that a 3-week treatment with dulaglutide resulted in a significant reduction in copeptin levels, showing an approximate 12% decrease compared to placebo,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Svenja Leibnitz, Department of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Metabolism, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland. It was published online on January 12, 2026, in the European Journal of Endocrinology.

The study pooled data from two different study populations consisting primarily of participants with euvolaemia. The baseline comparison of copeptin levels was not performed. Participants with primary polydipsia showed lower copeptin levels under placebo due to excessive daily fluid intake, potentially affecting the treatment effect.

This study was supported by a grant from the Swiss National Foundation and the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. One author reported serving on the editorial board of the European Journal of Endocrinology.

N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels of 200 pg/mL or more independently predicted maternal-foetal complications in pregnant women with hypertensive disorders. Combining NT-proBNP with the angiogenic marker soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1/placental growth factor (sFlt‑1/PlGF) ratio further improved the ability to predict which women are at higher risk.

""NT-proBNP could offer a practical and accessible tool to support earlier and more nuanced risk stratification in hypertensive pregnancy disorders. Even in settings where angiogenic testing is not readily available, elevated NT-proBNP levels may help clinicians recognize women who require closer surveillance, earlier referral, or more individualized care, ultimately contributing to safer management of high-risk pregnancies,"" the authors wrote.

A simple checklist and better handouts helped clinicians transform how concussions are handled in primary care — boosting symptom tracking, family education, and follow-up care.

The intervention, implemented at two clinics affiliated with Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, increased use of the post-concussion symptom scale from 37% to 85% and of educational materials from 42% to 83%. Follow-up visits to primary care physicians among concussion patients rose from 47% to 71%. The findings were published in Pediatrics.

Caring for children with concussions can be daunting for pediatricians because these visits usually involve checking mental status and neurologic exams, said Corinna Rea, MD, MPH, pediatrician at Boston Children's Hospital, who led the study.

To streamline the process, she and her colleagues built a clinical care pathway into the electronic medical record to guide decision-making.

“The idea is that we were managing these kids more safely and effectively so they would have fewer symptoms, their symptoms wouldn't last as long, and they would return to their school and sports more quickly or more safely,” she said.

The pathway recommended using a post-concussion symptom scale at every visit and provided treatment options based on symptoms such as headache, nausea, and sleep disturbances. The system also noted red flags that would prompt referral to specialty care or the emergency room and included instructions for families on what to do at home and when children could return to the classroom and participate in sports.

The initiative has been so successful, she added, that her colleagues have stopped her in the hallways to tell her “how much better they felt it made their care and how much easier it made their visits,” she said.

In 2022 in the US, 2.3 million children and adolescents younger than 18 years were diagnosed with a concussion or brain injury. Research indicates that most of these patients are initially treated by primary care clinicians.

Rea and her colleagues conducted their project between 2021 and 2024, during which 704 unique patients were seen for concussion visits. Their pathway recommendations are from current clinical guidelines, including those from the International Conference on Concussion in Sports and the US CDC.

Rea said the hardest measure to improve was the rate of follow-up visits.

“Oftentimes, they just didn't realize they were supposed to” come back for another visit, she said.

To improve how many families came back for follow-up, the Boston researchers created a checklist in English and Spanish on the next steps to take after initial visits and standardized the scheduling by sending caregivers an email rather than relying on patients to call the front desk. They also encouraged clinicians to make follow-up visits virtual when possible.

They also held educational sessions for clinicians and nurses and gave them individual feedback via email if they did not use the concussion tools in the electronic medical record or give out written instructions.

Rea and her colleagues found in their baseline data that non-English-speaking families and those with public insurance were less likely to complete the symptom scale or receive written instructions than those who spoke English or had commercial insurance. After the intervention, these differences were no longer statistically significant, she said.

Rea said that patients did not report that the visits were more burdensome than usual care, and rates of children being sent to the emergency department did not increase.

“By building a few simple things into our electronic medical record, we saw a really significant improvement in standardization without really making anything worse,” she said.

Christina Master, MD, co-director of the Minds Matter Concussion Program at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, said one of the strengths of the study is that each step in the quality improvement project was clearly defined, which may be helpful for other clinicians who want to better care for patients with potential concussions.

“Half of the treasure that you're getting out of this is actually the process,” Master said.

The study was funded by a grant from the Boston Children's Hospital Program for Patient Safety and Quality. Master reported receiving grant funding from the US Department of Defense, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, and Toyota's Way Forward Fund, among others.

 January 20, 2026  

With hospitals and health systems looking for better ways to support patients with serious illness, a new resource is showing up as an addition to inpatient care teams: death doulas. Also known as end-of-life doulas, these practitioners provide nonmedical support focused on the emotional, practical, and existential dimensions of dying.

While not much research exists around this burgeoning field, a study published in November 2023 that surveyed 10 bereaved family members indicated a positive impact of their services. The conclusion says that “For families in this study, DDs (death doulas) enabled the family member to be prepared for death, which led to a sense of empowerment. This, in turn, made them feel emotionally supported and enabled the family member to provide personalized deaths and funerals for their loved ones.”

“End-of-life doulas provide nonmedical, holistic services that support person-centered care and complement a clinical care team,” said Cryst'l Scheer, an end-of-life doula, educator, and owner of Lanexa, Virginia-based Summit Care Partners. “Death doulas are not clergy and are not able to provide pastoral, spiritual, or religious guidance through a professional lens. But death doulas are trained to support personal rituals, legacy work, and values-based conversations.”

Hospice, palliative care, and even social workers have different roles from a death or end-of life doula, Scheer said.

“Hospice and palliative clinicians diagnose, manage symptoms, and facilitate complex medical planning,” she said. “A death doula can support the lived experience of that plan by helping families process the information provided, prepare for next steps, and stay grounded throughout the process.”

Social workers, she said, are experts in psychosocial assessments, resources, and systems navigation, while a death doula can reinforce that work by staying close to the bedside, facilitating family communication, and accompanying patients and loved ones as they navigate next steps and create new routines.

While death doulas have traditionally worked in community or home-based settings, some hospitals are now exploring how (and whether) to integrate them into inpatient palliative care programs, volunteer services, or hospice-adjacent teams. The model is evolving quickly, but evidence remains limited, and questions about role definition, workflow, accountability, and reimbursement persist.

Much of the renewed attention to death doulas reflects a broader discomfort with how dying unfolds in modern medical settings.

End-of-life nurse educator, hospice pioneer, and author Barbara Karnes has long framed death doulas as a parallel to birth doulas not because death and birth are identical but because both represent profound transitions that are physically intense, emotionally charged, and unfamiliar to most families.

“There are so many similarities between birth and death — I mean I can go on and on, from food to sleep to labor,” Karnes said. “It takes some of the fear out of dying if we understand that this is a normal part of life. We are born, we experience, and then we die, and both ends are very similar.”

That framing resonates with clinicians who regularly care for dying patients in hospitals.

For Adjoa Boateng Evans, MD, MPH, an anesthesiologist and critical care physician at Duke Health and an assistant professor of anesthesiology at Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, who spends a significant amount of time at patients' bedsides during life's final hours, the idea of adding nonclinical end-of-life support feels like a recognition of what hospital medicine often can't provide consistently: time, presence, and emotional steadiness.

“Even as a physician, I wholeheartedly agree that death is not a medical event,” Evans said. “It's actually a spiritual one. We have medicalized it in this country in particular, but it really isn't.”

She said clinicians who have been present for many deaths recognize that the transition itself is qualitatively different from most other hospital events.

“Even the physical process of someone making that transition — it's very different from most of the other medical events that happen in a hospital,” she said.

For Evans, the analogy often used by end-of-life doulas — that this work parallels that of birth doulas — is more than metaphor. It's a practical description of the kind of support patients and families often need.

“When we think about the introduction of midwives or doulas at birth, it was all about support,” she said. “It's an extraordinary life experience that's physically challenging, emotionally charged, and a myriad of emotions. The same is true with death.”

One reason, Evans noted, is that most people have very limited firsthand experience with dying.

“Most people might witness one, two, maybe three deaths in a way where they're physically present,” she said. “So to have someone who is comfortable in that space and can say, ‘I've walked this path many times, I sort of know what you're about to experience' — that expectation setting, I can't emphasize how important that is.”

Shoshana Ungerleider, an internal medicine physician and founder of the End Well Project, said doulas are most often brought in when a patient transitions to comfort-focused care or when death is anticipated within days to weeks.

“Their support tends to be most beneficial for families with limited emotional or social support, those struggling to process the dying process, or those seeking to bring intentional rituals and meaning to the experience,” she said.

Scheer noted that doulas may be especially helpful during prolonged or complex dying trajectories.

“Within hospitals, death doulas can assist with high family distress, vigil or respite care, decision fatigue, death and grief education, and nonmedical comfort techniques like guided imagery, meditation, and breathing exercises,” she said.

She said that because doulas are not embedded in hospital staffing models, they can often provide continuity and flexibility that clinical teams cannot.

Evans said that ultimately, end-of-life doulas could provide a real resource to clinicians as well, in helping address families' urgent, concrete fears without turning the interaction into a medical discussion.

“When someone is transitioning to comfort care or they're on the precipice of dying, so much of my job in family meetings is expectation setting,” Evans said. “It's not a medical conversation.”

Evans said the kinds of questions families often carry into the room have medical components but actually come from a place of seeking reassurance or comfort: Is my loved one suffering? Are they choking? Are they suffocating?

“When we go into the room, it's expectation setting: ‘Here's what your loved one might look like. Their breathing is going to be irregular. It might sound gaspy,” she said. “That is part of the dying process. It's scary, but it's actually normal.'”

At the same time, Evans said that families also need to hear that comfort is being actively managed.

“We let them know, ‘We're giving medication for anxiety. We're giving medication for pain. We're giving medication for secretions,' so they feel like everything is being addressed in that moment,” she said.

She said that's where doulas can be especially complementary.

“Sometimes we (as clinicians) can get hyper-focused on the medical aspects,” she said. “End-of-life doulas are well-equipped in a language that speaks to that spiritual aspect, and a lot of physicians aren't versed in that. Most physicians are trained to do science and medicine.”

Many hospitals already have resources available to dying patients and their families, including palliative care teams and chaplains. Death doulas can be complements to these resources, and don't overlap their work.

“What I see as the difference is individualized care, you know, like having one doula for one individual patient, vs as the physician and the palliative care team, we've got to spread ourselves thin between multiple patients and just can't give the amount of time and attention that we would like to,” Evans said.

“Today, hospice is absorbed into the medical model, there's all kinds of things that have taken away from the time that is needed in working with people at the end of life,” Karnes said. “I think the biggest gift end-of-life doulas give is time.”

Scheer said that in most hospital settings, death doulas are not formally integrated into care teams. Instead, patients and families typically engage them independently, often alongside hospice or palliative care services.

Evans, Karnes, Scheer, and Ungerleider reported having no disclosures.

Dems point to contradictions.","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260120/GOP-promotes-MAHA-agenda-in-bid-to-avert-midterm-losses-Dems-point-to-contradictions.aspx","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:18:00 GMT","

When a ""Make America Healthy Again"" summit was held at the posh Waldorf Astoria in Washington, the line of attendees stretched down the block.

The daylong, invitation-only event in November featured a who's who of MAHA luminaries. Vice President JD Vance attended, as did Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the leader of the ad hoc movement whose members rail against vaccines, Big Pharma, and ultraprocessed food.

During a fireside chat that organizers broadcasted online, Vance extolled MAHA's impact on the Trump administration, calling it ""a critical part of our success in Washington.""

The summit underscored just how closely Republicans have hitched themselves to the MAHA campaign, banking on its popularity to give them an electoral bounce in the midterms. But the strategy carries risks, because support for Kennedy is cratering and polls show voters care more about reducing health care costs than MAHA priorities such as ending vaccine mandates and promoting raw milk.

""Polls show clearly MAHA issues are not the top issues for people,"" said Robert Blendon, a professor emeritus of health policy and political analysis at Harvard University. ""The top health care voting issue is cost, and costs are actually rising.""

The disconnect was on display Nov. 12, the day of the MAHA summit, where attendees picked up swag bags and mingled amid the hotel's blue-velvet couches and crystal chandeliers.

A few blocks away at the White House, President Donald Trump that day signed legislation to reopen the federal government. The 43-day shutdown centered on disagreement over expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies, which Democrats wanted to extend and GOP congressional leadership declined to take up. The government went back to business and, in the midst of a political and legislative push and pull, those subsidies expired at the end of 2025. That has fueled the national affordability debate, as many of the roughly 24 million people who buy coverage on the health law's marketplaces are now facing premium payments more than double what they faced last year. In January, Congress continues to wrestle with what has emerged as a key kitchen table issue.

Said Blendon: ""MAHA is not lowering the cost.""

MAHA was mainstreamed as part of the political platform embraced by Kennedy, an environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist who ran for president in 2023 and 2024. When he suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump, Kennedy united MAHA with conservatives, marrying the ""health freedom"" movement with MAGA.

But the movement took root before then, during the covid pandemic, grounded in the idea that the U.S. is in the throes of a chronic disease epidemic caused by corruption in the food, medical, and pharmaceutical industries, as well as federal agencies. Some adherents also are skeptical of or opposed to vaccines.

""Covid was really eye-opening for people,"" said Andrea Nazarenko, a psychologist and MAHA supporter who co-authored a book on food as medicine. ""They realized, 'Wait a minute — the systems I trusted may not be as trustworthy as I thought.' At its core, people are noticing the systems they relied on are failing them.""

MAHA has since emerged as an influential force for the GOP, gaining significant clout in a short time. Case in point: Early this month, Kennedy announced new dietary guidelines and updated childhood vaccine recommendations, which were both part of the movement's wish list and departures from existing frameworks.

In addition, members of Congress have founded a MAHA caucus. Lawmakers in Republican-led states are introducing or passing legislation to advance the MAHA agenda, including laws to restrict mRNA vaccines or ban certain additives in food. And food manufacturers including Nestle, General Mills, and Kraft Heinz have pledged to remove artificial dyes or additives.

Republicans see the MAHA constituency as critical in the 2026 midterm elections and beyond. Its supporters include desirable voting demographics — independents and some Democrats, many of whom are women, younger voters, or suburbanites. About 21% of independent voters and 8% of Democratic voters held a favorable or somewhat favorable view of MAHA as of early fall, according to a poll by Change Research.

""I think one reason I won reelection was that I advocated for the covid-vaccine-injured and was an ally of Bobby Kennedy back then when he was being vilified,"" Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said. ""People appreciated that. It's about basic health.""

Republicans are counting on a MAHA bounce, and political analysts say they may need it. The party took a drubbing in November's statewide races, and Trump's approval rating has slumped from 47% in early 2025 to 36% by December, according to Gallup polls. Those are ominous trends for the GOP, since the party with the presidency has lost ground in 20 of the past 22 midterm House elections.

Meanwhile, cracks are starting to threaten the Make America Great Again coalition and the lockstep support Trump has enjoyed from Capitol Hill Republicans. While MAGA shows signs of weakening, MAHA is flourishing.

""Kennedy has ratified the Republican agenda around health and food,"" said David Mansdoerfer, who served in HHS leadership during the first Trump administration. ""We sound very much like the issues Democrats were into in the 1990s and 2000s. We've almost done a 180 and co-opted a topic under a Republican agenda.""

Kennedy is expected to soon check another item off MAHA's list by pressing states to remove fluoride from the water supply, according to a source who asked to remain anonymous because he isn't authorized to speak to the media.

But Republicans' embrace of MAHA in the run-up to the November midterm elections could also cost them, political strategists say.

Polling shows popular support for MAHA initiatives such as ridding food of synthetic dyes, but voters are far less enthusiastic about Kennedy and his denouncements of vaccines and efforts to limit access to them. Almost 60% of adults disapprove of his work as head of HHS, according to polling released in October by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.

And only 26% of registered voters support defunding mRNA vaccine research, according to a September survey by left-leaning pollster Navigator Research. In the same poll, 3 in 4 reported feeling positively toward the measles vaccine.

Still, the Trump administration has broadened and accelerated its attack on vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration's top vaccine official in November said in a memo that the agency would overhaul vaccine regulation, asserting without evidence that at least 10 children had died from covid shots.

In December, a federal vaccine advisory panel handpicked by Kennedy voted to stop recommending routine vaccination of newborns against hepatitis B. Medical groups denounced the panel's actions, saying the vaccine is safe and that the recommendation would lead to more infections with the virus, which causes serious liver damage.

Democrats see an opening. The Democratic Doctors Caucus, a group of medical doctors in Congress, issued a statement condemning the federal advisory panel's changed recommendation on the hepatitis B vaccine, calling it an attack on basic science. And Democratic Reps. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, Diana DeGette of Colorado, and Yvette Clarke of New York wrote to the FDA commissioner demanding data from the agency on the covid death claims.

Highlighting the risks of the Trump administration's anti-vaccine initiatives is only part of Democrats' game plan to counter Republicans' alliance with MAHA.

Strategists describe three aims: Expose GOP policies that run counter to MAHA priorities; trumpet Democrats' efforts to tackle health care costs; and highlight their own party's work on such MAHA goals as cracking down on pesticide-makers.

""If people want to be healthier, they need affordable health care, and Democrats are the only ones pushing for affordable health care,"" said C.J. Warnke, communications director for the House Majority PAC, a fundraising group that works to elect more Democrats.

Most notably, the strategy so far hasn't really involved attacks on Kennedy or MAHA itself.

""If Democrats focus on attacking Kennedy, saying he's crazy and he has a brain worm, some voters hear that as reinforcing the notion that Democrats are wedded to Big Pharma and Big Ag,"" said Justin Zorn, a senior adviser at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive nonprofit focused on economic policy.

So Democrats will talk about their continuing fight to address health care costs, such as with a possible retroactive fix to the now-expired ACA subsidies, or a bill by Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) to prevent pesticide manufacturers from getting legal immunity against health claims. And they plan to discuss Trump administration actions that seemingly run counter to the MAHA agenda, such as a decision by the Environmental Protection Agency to relax the health assessments of the carcinogen formaldehyde.

""Everything they're doing actually makes people sicker with higher bills, dirtier air, and fewer people covered with insurance,"" said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist. ""Democrats do need to take MAHA seriously and can't brush it off. The core is to show Democrats are focused on health and health care and exposing what the Republican agenda means.""

For Republicans, the next batch of MAHA events and summits is already scheduled. After taking a political back seat in recent years, health care may dominate the 2026 election races.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Should you relocate your cryo-room?","https://www.news-medical.net/whitepaper/20260120/Should-you-relocate-your-cryo-room.aspx","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:56:00 GMT","

Location and long-term planning are two critical elements that should always be considered when designing a new laboratory or expanding an existing setup. This is because both can have a significant impact on operational efficiency and running costs. Conversely, poor decisions made at the design stage can lead to costly and frustrating consequences for many years.

Many customers are often surprised to learn that Air Products does far more than supply liquid nitrogen and other gases for cryogenic storage.

The company has a dedicated team of specialists who can support the planning, installation, and maintenance of cryogenic facilities to create more efficient and sustainable operations that consume less gas.

As the only gas supplier in the United Kingdom that also offers a comprehensive range of high-quality freezers, Air Products can ensure that every aspect of a facility is aligned with specific operational needs.

For any cryo-room project, numerous factors must be considered. One of the most important is the position, or location, of the cryo-room itself.

Whether the project involves designing a new facility, creating space for future expansion, or reconfiguring an existing laboratory to improve efficiency, careful consideration must be given to where the cryo-room is located within the building.

Best practice indicates that the ideal location is on the ground floor against an external wall, with adequate space outside for a liquid nitrogen storage tank that can be easily accessed for deliveries.

This configuration places freezers as close as possible to the liquid nitrogen supply, allowing for a short pipeline that provides consistent pressure, minimizes losses during filling, and removes the need to transport liquid nitrogen vessels throughout the building.

Ventilation requirements are also simplified, and future expansion can be more easily accommodated. While this approach is well-suited to new-build facilities, space constraints, particularly in city center clinics, can mean cryo-rooms are located on upper floors or in basements.

In these cases, compromises may be unavoidable, including higher liquid nitrogen consumption, the need for forced extraction, or the transport of liquid nitrogen via elevators. However, experience has shown that many challenges initially considered unsolvable can often be addressed by adopting a different design approach.

As a general guideline, it is advisable to consider future requirements five to ten years in advance.

Questions to address include the size of the cryo-room required today, whether expansion will be needed, how many liquid nitrogen freezers may be required, and whether additional storage or pipework will be necessary. Consideration should also be given to how safety regulations and legislation may evolve.

Although it is impossible to predict the future with certainty, factoring these considerations into early planning can deliver long-term benefits, making future expansion or operational changes simpler and more cost-effective.

Selecting the appropriate equipment is just as important as choosing the right location for a cryo-room. Consideration should first be given to what is being stored, such as stem cells, eggs, embryos, sperm, blood, or tissue, along with the volume required and whether vapor or liquid storage is needed.

These factors determine the type and size of freezer required, as well as the inventory system used. Racking is typically best for vials, goblets are used for storing straws, and blood bags can be stored using boxes, cassettes, or racking. With the correct design, available freezer space can be optimized.

Equipment selection also has a significant impact on ongoing operating costs. In a recent project, a customer was transitioned to MVE HEco freezers, which required filling only twice per week compared with previous freezers that needed filling every 18 hours.

This resulted in a substantial reduction in liquid nitrogen consumption and improved sample security.

Pipework is another critical consideration. Most installations use a Super Insulated Vacuum Line (SIVL), and keeping this as short as possible helps reduce installation costs while minimizing liquid nitrogen losses between the storage tank and the freezers.

The choice of liquid nitrogen storage vessel depends on consumption requirements and the SIVL design.

As a general rule, storage capacity should cover at least two weeks of consumption plus an additional 30 to 50 percent, based on a biweekly delivery schedule. Greater storage capacity reduces the risk of supply interruptions and can significantly lower delivery costs.

Fixed vessels are ideally located outdoors to minimize cost and health and safety risks, with adequate clearance, secure fencing, and suitable access for delivery vehicles.

Where this is not possible, wheeled storage vessels may be used, although they introduce higher health and safety risks, stricter usage limitations, and significant weight considerations. A 230-liter cylinder, for example, weighs more than 300 kilograms when full.

A range of regulatory requirements must be met, particularly for new facilities. These are primarily administered by the British Compressed Gases Association (BCGA).

The key guidance document is Biomedical Cryogenic Storage Systems Design and Operation 2021 (CP45), which addresses the design, installation, and operation of systems used for cryogenic storage.

Additional factors must also be addressed when designing a cryo-room. Appropriate materials must be selected for flooring and doors.

Alongside oxygen monitoring, a suitable extraction system is required to prevent alarms from triggering during normal filling operations. Security measures, such as card access or coded entry systems, should also be implemented.

Designing a new cryo room or reconfiguring an existing space to improve efficiency is a complex process that involves many interdependent considerations. Coordinating multiple suppliers and ensuring all aspects are managed correctly can be time-consuming and challenging.

For this reason, many organizations choose to work with a single experienced provider with specialist knowledge of liquid nitrogen and its safe supply.

The Air Products team has delivered numerous successful installations across a wide range of facilities and supports customers at every stage, from acting as a design consultant to installing liquid nitrogen supply systems and managing entire projects from start to finish.

Regardless of the specific requirements or objectives of a cryo-room project, Air Products can help manage the process to save time, reduce costs, and avoid design decisions that could limit future expansion.

Natural killer (NK) cells are large granular immune cells that play an important role in anti-inflammatory responses and in monitoring tumors.1

When using NK cells in adoptive immunotherapy, acquiring enough high-quality NK cells is a major challenge. The ability of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to differentiate into different cell types in vitro offers hope for cell treatments.2

A unique and reliable approach for inducing NK cells from iPSCs (iNK) in a completely feeder-free environment was designed in this study. After 35 days, the cell proportion of CD3- CD56+ iNK Cells reached 96.33 %, and by day 49, the expansion fold had reached 70 K, suggesting the feasibility of large-scale NK cell production for clinical applications.

A culture system was designed to optimize the differentiation of iPSC to iNK cells. NOTCH ligands DLL4 and VCAM-1 provided a supportive environment for HSPC differentiation into the NK lineage.



Figure 1. Flow cytometry analysis of cell components throughout the differentiation and expansion process. Cell percentages of (A) 88.5 % of HSPCs by Day 14, (B) 64.32 % of CLPs by Day 21, and (C) 96.33 % of iNKs by Day 35. Image Credit: ACROBiosystems



Figure 2. (A) iNK cell viability throughout the culture process and (B) expansion fold. After NK cell maturity, expansion reaches over 70K-fold, with an average survival rate of 95 % throughout the differentiation/expansion process, highlighting its potential as a robust NK cell source in only 49 days.

Figure 3. After a 35-day NK cell expansion period, iNKs were analyzed for NK surface markers including (A) NKp46, (B) NKp44, (C) CD16, (D) NKG2D, (E) NKp30, (F) KIR to confirm cell identity and function. High percentages of marker-positive cells reveals the success of NK cell differentiation. Image Credit: ACROBiosystems

Figure 4. iNK (Day 35) and leukemia (K562) cells were co-cultured at various E:T ratios. (A) CD107a marker revealed middling degranulation of iNKs between negative (NC) and positive (PMA+IM) controls, revealing a 53.5 % expression of CD107a. (B)Secretion of IFN-γ at a high level, mimicking cytokine secretion at levels close to the chemically-induced positive control. Image Credit: ACROBiosystems



Figure 5. Measurement of remaining target cells was performed after 7-AAD/CFSE staining and analyzed via flow cytometry. (A) iNK (Day 35) cytotoxicity increased with E:T ratios, revealing > 40 % of target cells lysed at the lowest ratio. (B) During a comparison between PBMC-derived NKs vs iNKs from this method, Day 35 iNKs showed the highest cytotoxicity against K562 cells. Image Credit: ACROBiosystems

This study presents a scalable strategy for producing iNK cells from iPSCs, providing a consistent and efficient solution to fulfill clinical needs. By improving methods, 96.33 % of iNK cells were produced by Day 35.

At day 49, growth had exceeded 70 K-fold, with > 90 % viability and significant cytotoxic activity. This technology addresses the availability and variability of NK cells, providing a stable supply for off-the-shelf immunotherapies. It also supports future clinical applications and expanded accessibility in cell-based immunotherapy.

This article is based on a poster originally authored by Rachel Daniels, Yu Chen, Spencer Chiang, Tianfu Zhang and Yuehchun Hsieh.

The in vitro cultivation of immune cells is an important stage in the development of cell and gene treatments. Immune cells, including T, NK, and Macrophages, require unique media to match their diversity and specialized nature.

Each immune cell group has distinct metabolic requirements, activation pathways, and cytokine reliance. Standard, one-size-fits-all media cannot address these features. When studying diverse cell types, specialized media for cell subpopulations are ineffective.

As a result, any adjustments to target immune cell types, such as switching from CAR-T to CAR-NK therapies, typically involve lengthy cell culture optimization processes.

To address these constraints, this study focused on creating a two-part medium: a universal basic medium and custom-formulated supplements tailored and optimized for specific immune cell subpopulations.

This strategy generates an adaptive yet fine-tuned formulation tailored to each cell type's biological and functional needs by carefully adjusting essential media components, including nutrients, cytokines, growth factors, and serum substitutes.

Two supplements, NK cells and yδT cells, were designed to be used with a universal basal medium. The purity of NK cells and yδT cells increased by 1,000 and 17,600 times, respectively, to 97 % and 93 %.

The customizability of each generated cell media allows researchers to readily adopt and execute highly tailored cell media for diverse cell subpopulations, increasing the efficiency of research on different cell types in immune cell therapy studies.

Figure 1. (A) Donor 1 and (B) Donor 2 human CBMCs were cultured using the Immune Cell Basal Medium with CelThera™ Immune Cell Supplement C. The resulting expansion fold exceeds 1,000 on Day 11 and can reach 10,000 on Day 19. Image Credit: ACROBiosystems



Figure 2. Human CBMCs were cultured for 2 weeks using Immune Cell Basal Medium with CelThera™ Immune Cell Supplement C. Varying ratios of NKp44/NKG2D/CD69, all markers of activation, reveal significant levels of activation after the culturing process. Image Credit: ACROBiosystems



Figure 3. Measurement of remaining target cells was performed after 7-AAD/CFSE staining and analyzed via ELISA. NK cells were used to evaluate cytotoxicity with several E:T ratios, revealing > 30 % of target cells lysed at the lowest ratio, similar to control NK cells. Image Credit: ACROBiosystems



Figure 4. (A) Expansion fold and (B) viability of yδT cells were evaluated from PBMCs cultured with Basal Medium, T cell Expansion Supplement, and GMP Immune Cell Supplement D. Expansion fold exceeds 3,600 with a viability of > 90 % across the culture period. Image Credit: ACROBiosystems



Figure 5. Cell population percentage of yδ2T after culturing using either phenol red or phenol red-free medium resulted in > 80 %. After two weeks, a high percentage of yδ2T was achieved, using the addition of several supplements alongside the traditional basal medium, revealing the capability to tailor media to a specific subpopulation.

The creation of a universal basic medium combined with bespoke additives provides a versatile and efficient option for cultivating various immune cell subpopulations.

This technique supports each cell type's particular biological and functional requirements by allowing for exact adjustments of nutrients, cytokines, growth factors, and serum substitutes.

The expansion of NK cells and yδT cells at high purity resulted in 1,000- and 17,600-fold increases, demonstrating their effectiveness. This adaptable platform streamlines the transition between diverse immune cell targets, reducing optimization time and enhancing the scalability of cell and gene therapy studies.

Shingles vaccination not only protects against the disease but may also contribute to slower biological aging in older adults, according to a new USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology study.

Using data from the nationally representative U.S. Health and Retirement Study, researchers examined how shingles vaccination affected several aspects of biological aging in more than 3,800 study participants who were age 70 and older in 2016. Even when controlling for other sociodemographic and health variables, those who received the shingles vaccine showed slower overall biological aging on average in comparison to unvaccinated individuals.

Shingles, also called herpes zoster, is a painful, blistering skin rash caused by the reactivation of the chickenpox virus, or varicella zoster. Anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk for shingles; while shingles can occur at younger ages, risk is higher for those 50 and older and immunocompromised individuals. Vaccination, which has generally only been provided to older people, offers protection from shingles as well as a lower chance of postherpetic neuralgia, or long-term pain after a shingles infection.

While vaccines are designed to protect against acute infection, recent research has highlighted a possible connection between adult vaccines, including those for shingles and influenza, and lower risks of dementia and other neurodegenerative disorders, said Research Associate Professor of Gerontology Jung Ki Kim, the study's first author.

This study adds to emerging evidence that vaccines could play a role in promoting healthy aging by modulating biological systems beyond infection prevention.""

Jung Ki Kim, study's first author

Unlike chronological aging, biological aging refers to how the body is changing over time, including how well organs and systems are working. Two people who are both 65 years old may look very different inside: one may have the biological profile of someone younger, while another may show signs of aging earlier.

In the new study, Kim and coauthor Eileen Crimmins, USC University Professor and AARP Professor of Gerontology, measured seven aspects of biological aging:

The team also used the measures collectively to record a composite biological aging score.

On average, vaccinated individuals had significantly lower inflammation measurements, slower epigenetic and transcriptomic aging, and lower composite biological aging scores. The results provide more insight into the possible mechanisms underlying how immune system health interacts with the aging process.

Chronic, low-level inflammation is a well-known contributor to many age-related conditions, including heart disease, frailty, and cognitive decline. This phenomenon is known as ""inflammaging,"" Kim said.

""By helping to reduce this background inflammation - possibly by preventing reactivation of the virus that causes shingles, the vaccine may play a role in supporting healthier aging,"" she said. ""While the exact biological mechanisms remain to be understood, the potential for vaccination to reduce inflammation makes it a promising addition to broader strategies aimed at promoting resilience and slowing age-related decline.""

These potential benefits could also be persistent. When analyzing how the time since vaccination affected results, Kim and Crimmins found that participants who received their vaccine four or more years prior to providing their blood sample still exhibited slower epigenetic, transcriptomic and overall biological aging on average versus unvaccinated participants.

""These findings indicate that shingles vaccination influences key domains linked to the aging process,"" Crimmins said. ""While further research is needed to replicate and extend these findings, especially using longitudinal and experimental designs, our study adds to a growing body of work suggesting that vaccines may play a role in healthy aging strategies beyond solely preventing acute illness.""

The study, ""Association between shingles vaccination and slower biological aging: Evidence from a U.S. population-based cohort study,"" was published in the Journals of Gerontology, Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences on January 20, 2026. This work was supported by the National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health (P30 AG017265); the Health and Retirement Study is supported by National Institute on Aging (U01AG009740).

As climate stressors disrupt food systems and nutrient quality worldwide, researchers examine whether dietary supplements could support resilience and nutrition security or whether their role remains unproven amid major evidence and policy gaps.



Perspective: The Role of Dietary Supplements in Environmental Challenges. Image Credit: Artem Stepanov / Shutterstock

In a recent scholarly perspective piece published in the journal Advances in Nutrition, researchers examined how environmental challenges intersect with dietary supplements to identify research gaps related to biological resilience, ecological impacts, and nutrient deficiencies. They concluded that substantially more rigorous, interdisciplinary, and longitudinal research is urgently needed to determine whether, under which circumstances, and for whom dietary supplements might play a role in supporting public health, resilience, and nutrition security in the face of unprecedented environmental change.

Environmental disruptions are increasingly undermining food systems and public health. Climate-related stressors, such as extreme heat, altered rainfall patterns, droughts, floods, and ecosystem changes, impact every stage of food supply chains, from production and processing to distribution and affordability.

Such disruptions threaten nutrition and food security by limiting access to diverse, nutrient-rich foods and increasing the risk of diet-related diseases and nutrient deficiencies, with disproportionate effects on already vulnerable populations.

Despite this growing risk, nutrition science remains underrepresented in environmental health research. In particular, the role that dietary supplements might theoretically play in addressing environmentally driven nutrition challenges has not been systematically examined, and existing evidence remains fragmented and context-dependent, limiting generalizability.

Environmental change affects both the quantity and quality of food. Evidence shows that rising carbon dioxide levels can reduce the concentrations of key nutrients in staple crops such as wheat and rice. Temperature increases and ecosystem disruption also threaten animal-sourced foods and fisheries, potentially reducing intake of high-quality protein, essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals.

Pollinator loss further compounds these risks by reducing the availability of fruits, nuts, seeds, and vegetables, which are critical sources of micronutrients such as folate and vitamin A. Together, these changes could increase the prevalence of undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and nutrition-related chronic diseases, although the magnitude, timing, and population-level distribution of these effects remain uncertain.

Dietary supplements have been proposed as one possible tool to help fill emerging nutrient gaps, particularly for populations at higher risk, including older adults, individuals living with chronic conditions, pregnant women, and children, in settings where food-based strategies are insufficient or disrupted.

However, important uncertainties remain. Research is needed to identify which nutrients are most affected, under what environmental conditions, and in which populations. Supplement strategies must also account for safety, bioavailability, unintended consequences, and the commercial and social determinants of health, rather than assuming uniform benefit or nutritional equivalence to whole foods.

Extreme weather events provide a clear example of how environmental stressors affect nutrition. In the United States alone, hundreds of billion-dollar disasters have disrupted food access and affordability. However, nutrition outcomes are often overlooked in disaster response planning, despite their potential long-term health consequences and cumulative effects across repeated exposures.

Emergency nutrition assistance often prioritizes calories over nutritional quality, leading to diets high in sodium, added sugars, and saturated fats, and low in fruits, vegetables, and fiber.

Although federal guidance suggests including supplements in emergency food stockpiles, there is little evidence-based guidance on the appropriate doses, delivery methods, and nutrient types. This highlights a major research gap in disaster preparedness and recovery, rather than a basis for immediate implementation or routine deployment.

Environmental stressors affect health through several biological pathways, increasing risks for infectious diseases, cardiovascular and respiratory conditions, mental health disorders, and heat-related illness. Resilience is therefore a critical public health goal, though it remains variably defined, operationalized, and measured across studies.

Beyond correcting nutrient deficiencies, dietary supplements have been investigated for their potential to support biological resilience. Scientists have studied certain vitamins, minerals, and botanical compounds for immune support, reducing oxidative stress, and controlling inflammation. However, findings are inconsistent, and study quality varies widely, limiting the ability to make clear recommendations or infer causal mechanisms.

Air pollution illustrates both the promise and complexity of resilience research. Some supplements, such as vitamins C, D, and E, omega-3 fatty acids, and B vitamins, have shown possible protective associations against pollution-related inflammation and respiratory outcomes in selected observational and short-term intervention studies.

However, results differ by population, exposure level, baseline nutritional status, and study design. Future research must use standardized methods, consider multiple organ systems, and account for individual variability, including age, sex, baseline nutrition, genetics, and cumulative environmental exposures, before causal conclusions can be drawn or policy-relevant guidance formulated.

While adaptation strategies are essential, mitigation efforts are equally important. Dietary changes aimed at decreasing environmental impact can introduce new nutritional challenges, including risks of iron, zinc, and vitamin B12 inadequacy. Supplements may become increasingly important in certain contexts as diets change voluntarily or in response to disruptions in the food system, particularly during transitional periods.

At the same time, the environmental footprint of the dietary supplement industry remains poorly quantified. The sourcing of animal-based and botanical ingredients, along with packaging, processing, and transportation, may contribute to carbon emissions, deforestation, overfishing, and pollution. Research is needed to evaluate the full lifecycle impacts of supplements and to explore sustainable alternatives, such as plant-based omega-3 sources, while avoiding unintended ecological harm or problem-shifting across environmental domains.

The authors emphasize substantial methodological challenges, including isolating supplement effects within complex diets, conducting long-term evaluations that align with gradual environmental change, and ensuring product safety and quality.

Regulatory frameworks in the United States further complicate research and application, as dietary supplements are not required to demonstrate efficacy before marketing and lack standardization across brands, limiting the strength of population-level guidance and comparability across studies.

Equity and affordability are central concerns to ensure that supplements do not increase financial burdens or replace efforts to address upstream food system problems. Instead, they should be considered only as complementary tools within broader public health and environmental strategies, rather than as primary solutions to structurally driven nutrition insecurity or substitutes for systemic food policy reform.

The world's leading cardiovascular societies, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association and the World Heart Federation (WHF) have today issued the first ever joint statement calling for urgent action to address environmental stressors as major, yet preventable, causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Environmental stressors, such as air and noise pollution, chemical and plastic contamination, and climate-related hazards contribute an estimated 4−6 million of the global total of approximately 20 million CVD deaths per year. In other words, around one in five cardiovascular deaths worldwide are attributable to environmental exposures, exceeding the impact of many traditional cardiovascular risk factors. The joint statement represents a unified global commitment to place environmental protection at the heart of CVD prevention and policy.

CVD remains the leading cause of death worldwide and environmental stressors have become its silent accelerators. Our message is clear: cleaner air, quieter cities and a stable climate are not solely environmental goals, they are essential for heart health and for reducing the CVD burden globally.""

Professor Thomas Münzel, lead author, University Medical Center Mainz, Germany

As Professor Thomas F. Lüscher, ESC President and senior author explains: ""The heart does not exist in isolation - it beats within an ecosystem. Environmental hazards must stand alongside smoking, hypertension and diabetes in our risk assessments and prevention strategies.""

Immediate, coordinated and courageous actions from policy makers are needed to reduce personal and societal environmental risk factor exposure, particularly in low- and middle-income countries that disproportionately bear the brunt of global environmental degradation.

""Research has shown the negative health impacts of pollution, noise, rising temperatures and other environmental stressors,"" says co-author and ACC President, Dr. Christopher Kramer, ""The time for action on addressing the impact of the environment on cardiovascular health is now and essential to reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease around the world.""

""To treat and prevent cardiovascular diseases, we must tackle the root causes and the increasing pressure of environmental risks. Intense exposure to air pollution and other forms of contamination take their toll especially on the most vulnerable. It's imperative that all sectors act now and play their part to reduce and mitigate risks so that cardiovascular health for all becomes reality,"" says co-author, Professor Amam Mbakwem, WHF's Vice President.

The joint statement calls on policymakers to adopt stricter air quality and noise standards, phase out fossil fuels and regulate toxic chemicals. Political will and international cooperation are essential in establishing and enforcing regulations and creating harmonised standards.

""This joint effort reflects our shared understanding of the need to address environmental factors that affect heart health. Working together across societies and sectors is essential to create meaningful change for cardiovascular well-being worldwide,"" says co-author and past American Heart Association President, Dr. Keith Churchwell.

""The American Heart Association is committed to advancing research and raising awareness so we can better protect heart health from the very start by protecting the planet,"" adds American Heart Association President, Dr. Stacey E. Rosen.

The joint statement outlines six overarching priority areas:

The statement concludes: 'by addressing the root causes of environmental stressors, it is possible to reduce the incidence of CVDs and promote healthier, just and sustainable societies.'

Research led by the University of Sydney is reshaping scientific understanding of one of the world's most widespread canine parasites, suggesting heartworm disease has a far deeper and more complex evolutionary history than previously believed – including a possible ancient origin of Australian heartworms linked to dingoes.

The findings have significance for developing treatments given the rise in drug resistance to the disease.

In a global genome-wide study of canine heartworm parasites, researchers analysed more than 100 heartworm genomes collected from dogs and wild canids across multiple continents. The findings challenge the long-held assumption that heartworm spread largely through recent, human-mediated movement of domestic dogs.

Instead, the study points to a new evolutionary paradigm, where ancient canid hosts such as wolves and dingoes played a pivotal role in shaping the global distribution of heartworms over tens of thousands of years.

The paper is published in Communications Biology.

Heartworm disease, caused by the parasite Dirofilaria immitis, is transmitted by mosquitoes and can be fatal for dogs if left untreated. Adult worms – often described as looking like strands of spaghetti – can grow up to 30 centimetres long and live in the blood vessels of the heart and lungs.

One of the most intriguing findings relates to Australia. Genetic signatures in Australian heartworms suggest they may share ancestry with parasites from Asia. This raises the possibility that heartworm could have arrived in Australia with the continent's first dingoes, which are believed to have migrated from Asia thousands of years ago.

However, the researchers caution that the evidence is not conclusive. An alternative explanation – that heartworm was introduced to Australia more recently, following European colonisation – cannot yet be ruled out.

While our data suggest an ancient link between Australian and Asian heartworms, the sample size means we need to be careful about drawing firm conclusions.""

Jan Slapeta, Study Senior Author and Professor, School of Veterinary Science, University of Sydney

Slapeta added, ""What we can say with confidence is that heartworm evolution is far older and more complex than a simple story of parasites hitchhiking with modern dogs.""

The international team used whole-genome sequencing to compare heartworms from different regions, allowing them to reconstruct population histories and track how parasites diverged over time. By examining patterns across continents, the researchers identified distinct regional heartworm populations, shaped by the movements and isolation of ancient canids during ice ages and interglacial periods.

Lead author Dr Rosemonde Power, who completed her PhD at the University of Sydney and is now based at Stockholm University, said the findings overturn long-standing assumptions in parasitology.

""For decades, we assumed heartworms were spread mainly through recent human activity,"" Dr Power said. ""What we're seeing instead is evidence of deep co-evolution between heartworms and their canine hosts, even before humans were part of the picture.""

The research also has important implications for animal health today, particularly as drug resistance to heartworm treatments emerges in parts of the world.

""Understanding where heartworms come from and how different populations are related helps us respond more effectively to disease and drug resistance,"" Professor Slapeta said. ""Heartworms are not the same everywhere, and local history matters.""

The authors emphasise that while the study analysed over 100 genomes, further sampling – particularly from under-represented regions – will be needed to refine timelines and test competing hypotheses, including the origins of heartworm in Australia.

Still, the study marks a significant step forward in understanding the ancient, global journey of one of dogs' most dangerous parasites – and the long evolutionary history hidden within that unsettling spaghetti in a dog's heart.

A large Danish trial analysis suggests high-dose flu vaccines may offer extra protection against serious influenza-related hospitalizations in seniors.

Study: High-Dose vs Standard-Dose Influenza Vaccine in Older Adults With Diabetes. Image credit: Andrew Angelov/Shutterstock.com

A study published in JAMA Internal Medicine suggests that high-dose influenza vaccine is associated with lower rates of selected influenza-related hospitalization outcomes than standard-dose vaccine in older adults with or without diabetes.

Influenza, commonly known as flu, is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses. Approximately 1 billion influenza cases occur annually worldwide, including 3 to 5 million severe cases. Approximately 290,000 to 650,000 deaths occur each year due to severe infections.

Although the infection remains mild in most cases, children under 5 years of age, older adults, and those with comorbidities such as diabetes are at higher risk of developing severe respiratory and cardiovascular complications.

Seasonal influenza vaccines are primary preventive interventions against severe outcomes. However, the standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine has been found to provide suboptimal protection, particularly in high-risk individuals.

Given the substantial burden of influenza, the high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine has been developed, containing 4-fold higher antigen levels than the standard vaccine. Currently, high-dose vaccination is preferred for adults aged 65 years or older in the US. However, only a few randomized trials have so far analyzed the protective efficacy of high-dose vaccination in susceptible older adults with diabetes.

In the current study, researchers conducted a prespecified secondary analysis of the DANFLU-2 randomized clinical trial in Denmark to compare the protective efficacy of high-dose and standard-dose influenza vaccines in older adults with or without diabetes.

The study included 332,438 older adults, including 43,881 with diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups, one receiving high-dose vaccination and the other receiving standard-dose vaccination.

Participants were followed up from 14 days after vaccination to May 31 of the following year. The efficacy of the two tested vaccines on prespecified cardiorespiratory, cardiovascular, and influenza-related hospitalization outcomes was analyzed in participants with or without diabetes.

The study analysis revealed that the high-dose influenza vaccine was associated with lower rates of hospitalization for several outcomes, most notably influenza-related hospitalizations, among older adults, with a consistent effect across diabetes status.

No overall differences were observed in hospitalization rates for any respiratory disease or myocardial infarction, suggesting that the benefits of high-dose vaccination were not uniform across all endpoints.

Among different diabetes subgroups, diabetes duration was found to modify the association between vaccine type and cardiorespiratory hospitalization. A lower incidence of cardiorespiratory hospitalizations was observed with high-dose vaccination among participants with diabetes of longer duration, but not among those with shorter duration.

The study highlights a potential incremental benefit of high-dose influenza vaccine over standard-dose influenza vaccine in reducing hospitalizations for some, but not all, cardiorespiratory and cardiovascular outcomes, including influenza and laboratory-confirmed influenza, in older adults, irrespective of diabetes status.

These findings should be interpreted in the context of the DANFLU-2 trial's neutral primary endpoint, hospitalization for influenza or pneumonia, and the authors emphasize that the secondary and subgroup analyses are exploratory.

Global public health authorities widely recommend annual influenza vaccination, particularly for individuals with chronic conditions, such as diabetes, due to their high vulnerability to complications, including cardiovascular complications.

The study finds a higher risk of hospitalization due to cardiorespiratory and cardiovascular complications in participants with diabetes than those without diabetes. These findings highlight the importance of optimizing preventive strategies for this high-risk population. Consistent with this higher baseline risk, the absolute benefit of high-dose vaccination was greater in individuals with diabetes, as reflected by lower numbers needed to vaccinate.

Moreover, the study reports a generally consistent direction of association between high-dose vaccination and reduced hospitalizations for cardiorespiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, and heart failure. However, several diabetes-specific estimates were imprecise and not statistically significant. Notably, no overall reduction in cardiovascular death was observed, reinforcing the need for cautious interpretation.

The observed influence of different diabetes characteristics, including diabetes duration, presence of diabetes-related complications, and glycated hemoglobin levels, a measure of glycemic control, on vaccine associations with hospitalization outcomes, suggests that the protective benefits of high-dose vaccination over standard-dose vaccination may be more prominent in individuals with more advanced diabetes, although these subgroup findings are hypothesis-generating.

The authors hypothesize that these findings may reflect a more pronounced suboptimal immune response to standard-dose vaccination in individuals with greater disease burden, as well as higher susceptibility to influenza-related complications associated with longer disease duration and a greater comorbidity burden.

Overall, the study findings highlight that high-dose influenza vaccination may offer superior benefits against selected severe outcomes in vulnerable populations through a single annual intervention that imposes no additional burden on the patients.

The DANFLU-2 trial data analyzed in this study were not specifically powered for subgroup analyses. These findings should therefore be considered as exploratory.

The trial did not have access to follow-up laboratory data, such as follow-up glycated hemoglobin levels, or to the Danish prescription registries, which limited the inclusion of data on filled prescriptions in baseline or endpoint definitions.

The study, therefore, could not determine the treatment patterns, including the use of glucose-independent cardiorenal protective and weight-lowering agents, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and the balance between the groups.

This article is based on a poster originally authored by Linlin Ma, Di Shi, Tianfu Zhang, Zhicheng Dong, Spencer Chiang and Yuehchun Hsieh.

Monitoring ADC internalization requires highly sensitive and specific methods for distinguishing surface-bound from internalized compounds.

ACROBiosystems' pH-sensitive fluorescent dye-based endocytosis detection reagents enable real-time monitoring of key dynamic properties, including initiation speed, uptake length, drug metabolism, and total internalization in target cells.

This approach not only aids in identifying superior ADCs characterized by ""fast initiation, prolonged uptake, and high total internalization,"" but also provides critical data for studying ADC endocytosis mechanisms, optimizing therapeutic dosing, and fine-tuning administration schedules.

Following the preparation of 4X (mass concentration) antibody and 4X Internalization Detection reagent (Cat. No. IGG-PZF2001 working solutions in cell culture medium, the solutions were combined and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature.

For suspension cells, 50 µL of cell suspension (1x106 cells/mL) was placed in a 96-well plate and mixed with 50 µL of the prepared labeling complex. For attached cells, after plating 5,000-10,000 cells per well and allowing attachment, the medium was substituted with 50 µL of fresh medium before adding 50 µL of the working solution.

The cells were then treated with the labeling compound for 0.5-24 hours before being analyzed using flow cytometry or high-content analysis at specific time intervals.

SK-BR-3(HER2+) cells were treated with various anti-HER2 mAbs and the ACROBiosystems Internalization Detection Reagent.

The results showed that ACROBiosystems Internalization Detection Reagent provides reliable and consistent detection across a variety of primary antibodies. Furthermore, the signal intensity grew significantly over time (Fig. 1A).

In contrast, no positive signal was obtained in the control cell line MDA-MB-468(HER2-), demonstrating the ACROBiosystems reagent's great specificity (Figure 1B).

SK-BR-3(HER2+) cells were treated with Anti-HER2 mAbs or matching ADC medicines, as well as the ACROBiosystems Internalization Detection Reagent.

The findings suggest that the intensity of the internalization detection signal increases with reagent dosage; also, the detection results of mAbs and their matching ADCs are consistent.

SK-BR-3(HER2+) cells were treated with the ACROBiosystems Internalization Detection Reagent and an anti-HER2 antibody (Trastuzumab).

The results demonstrated a similar rise in signal intensity with increasing molar ratios (Fig. 3A). Similarly, when Raji (CD20+) cells were treated with the ACROBiosystems Internalization Detection Reagent and Anti-CD20 antibody (Rituximab), a dose-dependent increase in signal was seen (Figure 3B).



Figure 4. The kinetic changes of the internalization detection signal of anti-HER2 antibody in SK-BR-3 cells. Image Credit: ACROBiosystems

The findings indicate that the primary antibody concentration of 2 nM produces the greatest detection signal. The signal intensity steadily increases over the first seven hours, then plateaus and remains steady for up to 18 hours (Figure 4A).

After removing the Internalization Detection Reagent and antibody mixture at seven hours, monitoring shows that the internalization signal in the 2 nM Anti-HER2 antibody group steadily declines over 24 hours (Figure 4B).

A large Australian pilot shows that testing healthy young adults for high-risk genes can reveal serious disease risk years before symptoms appear, challenging traditional family history–based genetic testing.



Study: Feasibility and outcomes of the DNA Screen nationwide adult genomic screening pilot. Image Credit: Westlight / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in Nature Health, a group of researchers evaluated the feasibility, clinical uptake, and diagnostic yield of nationwide genomic screening in the adult population for medically actionable genetic conditions.

What if a healthy 30-year-old could discover a life-threatening disease risk years before symptoms appear? Earlier, genetic testing in adults was dependent on a strong family history and severe personal illness, which left high-risk individuals undetected. But advances in genomic medicine have made this possible. Hereditary diseases like breast and ovarian cancer, hypercholesterolemia, and Lynch syndrome are very common, potentially life-threatening, and can often be prevented or mitigated if detected early, yet they frequently remain undiagnosed. Population genomic screening is one promising alternative, as it identifies genetic risk before disease onset and can guide preventive care. Healthcare systems are increasingly exploring large-scale genetic testing, but real-world evidence is essential to inform ethical, clinical, and economic decisions. Further research is needed to understand long-term outcomes, gene-specific disease penetrance in unselected populations, and downstream impacts of this approach.

A prospective nationwide genomic screening pilot was conducted among Australian adults aged 18–40 years who had no prior genetic diagnosis of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, Lynch syndrome, or familial hypercholesterolemia. Participants were recruited through national media coverage and then invited in stages to assemble a diverse cohort across geography, sex, cultural background, and socioeconomic status. Participants registered online, completed educational modules, passed a knowledge quiz, and provided informed consent before submitting saliva samples by mail.

DNA was extracted and analysed using a custom next-generation sequencing panel targeting ten high-risk genes associated with the three conditions. Only pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were reported, following guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology. Variants of uncertain significance and benign variants were not disclosed to reduce unnecessary anxiety and clinical burden. The reported findings were research results that required confirmation in accredited clinical laboratories, and the assay did not detect large structural variants or copy number changes.

Participants with detected high-risk variants received telephone-based genetic counselling and were offered referral to specialist clinical genetics services or lipid clinics. Clinical teams collected family history, assessed eligibility for government-funded genetic testing, and arranged confirmatory testing through accredited diagnostic laboratories. Study data were managed using Research Electronic Data Capture software, and analyses were performed using the R statistical computing environment.

Public engagement with the genomic screening initiative was substantial. More than 30,000 individuals registered within a short period following national media coverage, reflecting strong interest in proactive health information. Of these, 10,263 participants completed genomic screening, with a median age of 31.9 years. Just under half (45.5%) were male, and 30% were from culturally or linguistically diverse backgrounds, demonstrating a broad demographic reach.

Genetic screening identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 202 participants, representing about 2% of those tested. Variants in BRCA2 and LDLR were the most frequently detected, linked respectively to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and familial hypercholesterolemia. No participant carried more than one high-risk variant. Almost all individuals (98.1%) had no prior personal diagnosis of a related clinical condition, highlighting the ability of genomic screening to identify hidden risk before disease is clinically recognised. However, the likelihood that a detected variant will cause disease may be lower in population-screened individuals than in families referred for clinical evaluation.

Clinical follow-up rates were high. Among participants who required referral, nearly all accepted the referral, and the majority attended specialist appointments. Genetic counselling supported understanding of results and facilitated entry into appropriate care pathways, where participants were typically advised on evidence-based risk management strategies, such as enhanced cancer surveillance or lipid-lowering interventions.

Another key finding was that 74.5% of participants who attended specialist clinics would not have qualified for government-funded genetic testing under existing criteria. Most had no personal disease history and often lacked a family history that would trigger testing. For cancer-associated variants, 72.6% were ineligible for testing based on current guidelines. Similarly, most participants with familial hypercholesterolemia variants had not previously met criteria for funded testing; 38.5% had not had cholesterol measured in the past year, and 63.5% were not receiving lipid-lowering therapy, despite many having elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels when assessed.

Family history proved to be an unreliable predictor of genetic risk. More than half of the participants with high-risk variants reported no affected first-degree relatives. This finding highlights a major limitation of criteria-based testing approaches and illustrates how reliance on family history alone can delay diagnosis and prevention.

From a real-world perspective, these findings have important implications. Early identification enables individuals to take preventive action well before clinical disease emerges, potentially reducing cancer incidence or cardiovascular events during early adulthood and midlife. At a population level, this approach may shift healthcare from reactive treatment to prevention, although longer-term follow-up is needed to assess impacts on health outcomes, healthcare utilisation, variant-specific penetrance, and costs.

This nationwide pilot demonstrates that adult population genomic screening is feasible, highly acceptable, and clinically actionable within a public healthcare system. The programme successfully identified young adults at high genetic risk who would otherwise have remained undiagnosed under current testing frameworks. High clinical uptake and engagement indicate that individuals value early risk knowledge when appropriate counselling and follow-up care are provided. By revealing the limitations of family history-based testing, the findings illustrate how population genomic screening could reshape preventive healthcare, while underscoring the need for continued evaluation of long-term benefits, risks, penetrance uncertainty, and equity considerations.

Transferrin is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 80 kDa, synthesized in the liver.

Each transferrin molecule can bind up to two iron atoms for distribution to cells. The half-life of transferrin in humans is approximately eight days, while the delivery of iron via the transferrin/transferrin receptor cycle can be completed in approximately five to 20 minutes, depending on the cell type.

This means each transferrin molecule can facilitate hundreds of cycles of iron binding and delivery to cells in its lifespan.1

Measuring transferrin iron levels in serum is an essential part of evaluating iron metabolism. Abnormal transferrin levels in serum are associated with various diseases, including certain cancers and other inflammatory syndromes.3

Duetta is a highly sensitive spectrofluorometer that can be used to measure transferrin at very low concentrations. By integrating both fluorescence and absorbance measurements simultaneously, the Duetta spectrofluorometer offers key advantages in protein analysis.



Image Credit: HORIBA Scientific

In their comparative study, Horiba assessed the fluorescence results obtained using the Duetta with absorbance results from a dedicated low-volume benchtop spectrophotometer.

Transferrin was prepared at concentrations ranging from 50 µg/mL to 0.75 µg/mL in 10 mM PBS for fluorescence and absorbance measurements. The same buffer, devoid of protein, was utilized as a blank.

The excitation wavelength was set to 250 nm, with emission collected from 265 nm to 550 nm, using a two second integration time on the CCD and 10 nm slits.

Transferrin solutions from 0.75 µg/mL to 50 µg/mL were measured in absorbance mode. A comparison of the absorbance spectra obtained from both systems at the highest concentrations is shown below.



Figure 2. Comparison of Absorbance spectra between the instruments. Image Credit: HORIBA Scientific

The spectra obtained demonstrate notable differences. The Duetta spectrofluorometer detected transferrin at 12.5 µg/mL, with the signal increasing proportionally to concentration. The comparative data from the spectrophotometer exhibited a limit of detection around 25 µg/mL, with visibly noisy curves.

Figure 3 shows the overlaid fluorescence spectra obtained.

The zoom on the lowest concentrations indicates a limit of detection around 0.75 µg/mL.

Although the Duetta demonstrates twice the sensitivity in measuring protein concentration via UV absorption, its superior performance is further exemplified through fluorescence, as shown in the fluorescence profile in Figure 4.



Figure 4. Comparison of Transferrin concentration measurements obtained with the spectrophotometer and Duetta instruments. Image Credit: HORIBA Scientific

The graph indicates a limit of detection for transferrin of approximately 0.75 µg/mL using the Duetta. The signal amplitude is directly proportional to the measured concentrations.

In contrast, the lowest concentration detected by the spectrophotometer is 25 µg/mL, 33 times less sensitive than the Duetta. This further demonstrates the sensitivity of its fluorescence spectroscopy.

Fluorescence spectroscopy has numerous applications in life sciences, spanning cell biology to genomics. In protein characterization, the intrinsic fluorescence of certain amino acids (tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine) provides a valuable capability for studying proteins without the need for labeling.

The study presented here illustrates the high sensitivity of the Duetta through fluorescence measurements in comparison to the traditional UV-absorbance approach.

While the Duetta's limit of detection is approximately 25 µg/mL using absorbance, it can successfully detect transferrin at 0.75 µg/mL using fluorescence. This limit of detection can be enhanced by optimizing certain parameters, such as increasing the integration time, widening the slits, and enhancing the emission increment (binning).

The Duetta is capable of measuring both UV-visible absorbance spectra and fluorescence spectra, exhibiting greater sensitivity than other benchtop spectrophotometers that are exclusively designed for absorbance measurements.

The optimized optical layout and dual-purpose design of the Duetta spectrofluorometer make it ideal for protein spectroscopy and analysing low-concentration solutions.

Chronic inflammation is a major contributor to inflammatory, metabolic, neurological, and autoimmune disorders. This gives inflammasome inhibitors broad therapeutic potential, making them highly appealing to drug developers.

Recent advances in inflammasome biology have led to the development of a new line of medicines that target the proteins that regulate the production of inflammatory cytokines.

A critical milestone in successfully bringing this potential new class of therapeutics to market is ensuring that these drugs are effective in vitro and in vivo, on target at the appropriate dose, and have no off-target effects.

Selecting the most relevant assays, reference controls, and output metrics is crucial to accurately quantifying the efficacy of potential therapies and moving the best leads into clinical trials.

This whitepaper explains how a thorough understanding of the inflammasome is essential for accurate pre-clinical assay selection, addresses safety concerns, and examines Concept Life Sciences' portfolio of inflammasome assays, which are developed to assess the efficacy of your candidate therapeutics.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","How ""old RNA"" reshapes sperm metabolism","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260120/How-old-RNA-reshapes-sperm-metabolism.aspx","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:36:00 GMT","

Increasing paternal age has been linked to elevated health risks for the next generation, including higher risks of obesity and stillbirth. But what drives this increased risk remains unknown.

Most research into this link focuses on how the DNA inside sperm changes with age. But sperm carry other molecules as well, including a diverse array of molecules called RNAs. Now, new research from University of Utah Health has shown that the RNA contents of sperm go through similar shifts over time in both mice and humans, which may lead to a rapid, dramatic shift at mid-life. What's more, ""old RNA"" seems to change cells' metabolism-potentially contributing to the health risks of having kids later in life.

It's like finding a molecular clock that ticks with age in both mice and humans, suggesting a fundamental, conserved molecular signature of sperm aging. Maybe this progressive length shift accumulates quietly, until it triggers the 'cliff' change at mid-life.""

Qi Chen, MD, PhD, Study Co-Senior Author and Associate Professor, Urology and Human Genetics, University of Utah Health

The results are published in The EMBO Journal.

Previous work in Chen's lab had established that RNA in sperm could be changed by a father's environment, including diet, and that those changes could impact the next generation. But the kinds of RNA molecules that seemed to be most important were difficult to detect with standard techniques. Chen's team developed an advanced RNA sequencing method, called PANDORA-seq, to ""see"" this previously undetectable world of sperm RNAs.

When they used this new tool to analyze sperm in mice, the researchers spotted a pattern that traditional techniques couldn't detect-a sharp, dramatic transition in sperm RNA contents in mice between 50 and 70 weeks of age. In addition to this ""aging cliff,"" they found what appeared to be a molecular clock. As males age, the proportions of certain sperm RNAs change progressively-longer fragments become more common, while shorter fragments become less common. And when they looked at RNA in human sperm, they found the same progressive shift.

""At first glance, this finding seems counterintuitive,"" Chen says. ""For decades, we have known that as sperm age, their DNA becomes more fragmented and broken. One might expect RNA to follow this pattern. Instead, we found the opposite: specific sperm RNAs actually become longer with age.""

These changes in RNA may affect offspring health in important ways, the results suggest. When the team introduced a cocktail of ""old RNA"" into mouse embryonic stem cells, which are biologically similar to early embryos, the cells displayed changes in gene expression associated with metabolism and neurodegeneration, potentially suggesting a mechanism by which RNA could impact the health of the next generation.

The researchers were only able to detect some of these changes when they looked at RNA from the sperm head alone-the part of the sperm that delivers its contents to the egg. The long tail of the sperm contains other RNA that obscured the pattern until now.

""This rsRNA length shift was a unique signal, specific to the sperm heads. It was obscured by the 'noisier' profile of the whole sperm,"" explains co-corresponding author Tong Zhou, PhD, associate professor of physiology and cell biology in the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine and co-senior author on the paper. ""Sequencing the sperm head sample is what made this discovery possible.""

Researchers were able to confirm these RNA changes in humans thanks to U of U Health's unique clinical and research infrastructure, which connects basic science labs directly with andrology and patient resources, says Kenneth Aston, PhD, director of the Andrology & IVF Lab at the University of Utah and co-senior author on the paper. ""Validating this finding from mice to humans was really exciting,"" Aston says. ""Our sperm bank resources at the University of Utah made this cross-species validation possible.""

""This could be an important step for translational andrology,"" adds James M. Hotaling, MD, Chief Innovation Officer at University of Utah Health and an author on the study. ""This discovery, made possible by PANDORA-seq, could lay the groundwork for future diagnostics to help guide informed reproductive decisions and improve fertility outcomes.""

The team's next steps will focus on identifying the specific enzymes responsible for these changes in RNA.

""If we can understand the enzymes driving this shift, they could become actionable targets for interventions to potentially improve sperm quality in aging males,"" Chen says. ""Stay tuned.""

A controlled feeding trial shows that minimally processed pork, when incorporated into a plant-forward dietary pattern, delivers biomarker benefits comparable to those of legumes in healthy older adults without harming cognitive or physical aging markers.



Study: Effects of Minimally Processed Red Meat within a Plant-Forward Diet on Biomarkers of Physical and Cognitive Aging: A Randomized Controlled Crossover Feeding Trial. Image Credit: Tamara Kulikova / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Current Developments in Nutrition, researchers investigated the impact of integrating minimally processed red meat in a plant-forward diet on short-term biomarkers related to physical and cognitive aging.

The population of the United States (US) is aging rapidly, leading to a demographic shift and a greater healthcare burden from chronic diseases associated with aging. Among age-related conditions, cognitive impairment, especially dementia, poses a significant concern. Dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is projected to impact around 14 million Americans by 2060, underscoring the need for strategies targeting modifiable risk factors. Dietary patterns have been identified as one such modifiable factor, although most evidence relates to cardiometabolic and biomarker outcomes rather than clinical dementia endpoints.

In the present study, researchers investigated the effects of incorporating minimally processed red meat in a plant-forward diet on biomarkers of cognitive and physical aging. This crossover feeding trial recruited community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older. Participants were randomized to a minimally processed pork (MPP) or lentil (MPL) diet. They were required to abstain from non-study foods, alcohol, and supplements, as well as other excluded protein sources, to maintain dietary control.

The diets aligned with the 2020–25 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA). Each meal included plant foods and a moderate amount of eggs, dairy, and plant oils. In arm 1, participants consumed 162 g/day of minimally processed lean pork as the primary protein source. In arm 2, an equivalent amount of protein was provided from chickpeas, lentils, split peas, and black beans. Each intervention lasted eight weeks, separated by a two-week washout period.

Further, a questionnaire was administered at the end of each phase to assess feasibility, adherence, and menu acceptability. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and after the end of each dietary intervention phase. A range of cardiometabolic, nutritional, and neuroactive biomarkers related to cognitive aging were measured in serum. Triglycerides, glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and total cholesterol (TC) were assessed via point-of-care testing.

Serum levels of ferritin, insulin, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were determined using multiplex immunoassays. In addition, free choline, phosphatidylcholine, and homocysteine were measured, and biogenic amine metabolites were profiled. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was performed to assess body composition. Muscle strength and function were evaluated using handgrip strength and chair-rise tests.

The study included 57 participants assigned to an MPL or MPP diet. Of these, 36 completed the full study protocol and were included in the analytic sample. The cohort included Caucasian adults, aged 71 years on average, with a predominance of females (72%; 26 women and 10 men). Educational attainment was considerably high, with over 70% having a four-year degree or higher. Overall, participants were in good health for their age and free of major chronic conditions, which may limit generalizability to older adults with greater multimorbidity or lower socioeconomic diversity.

Energy levels were comparable between intervention phases. The diets met the recommended daily allowance for iron and B vitamins. Self-reported satisfaction and adherence were substantially high, with a majority of the sample interested in continuing a DGA-aligned diet post-intervention. Both diets produced favorable changes in several cognitive-related metabolic markers compared to baseline. Glucose decreased significantly after the MPL diet and non-significantly after the MPP diet.

Fasting insulin levels decreased in both MPL and MPP diet phases, suggesting improved insulin sensitivity across diets. TC was significantly lower after both phases, with no significant group differences. HDL was also lower across diets, though the reduction was smaller following the MPP diet, resulting in higher post-intervention HDL levels than following MPL. Triglycerides decreased by a smaller margin in both groups. BDNF showed a modest increase after MPL that did not reach conventional statistical significance, but was unchanged with MPP. Serum choline levels were stable across diet phases.

However, phosphatidylcholine was significantly lower after MPP and MPL phases. Homocysteine levels increased modestly following MPP but remained unchanged after MPL, with the increase largely driven by a small subgroup of participants who had elevated baseline homocysteine concentrations, while most participants showed little change. Vitamin B12 levels were within clinical range in all participants, while ferritin increased in both groups. Further, both groups had significant increases in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and reductions in its excitatory precursor, glutamic acid, which represent peripheral neurochemical markers rather than direct measures of brain function.

Similarly, both groups had elevated levels of tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine. Body weight and lean mass decreased after both phases, reflecting the broader controlled dietary pattern rather than a specific protein effect, with no significant differences between diets. Handgrip strength was stable across time points, with minimal improvements from baseline. Likewise, the chair stand test indicated stable lower-body function, with no signs of decline during either intervention.

In sum, plant-forward dietary patterns incorporating MPL or MPP produced broadly similar short-term changes in cardiometabolic, nutritional, and neuroactive biomarkers related to cognitive and physical aging. The results challenge perceptions that red meat is broadly unsuitable for older populations when consumed in minimally processed form and within a DGA-aligned dietary pattern. Importantly, the findings relate to short-term biomarker and functional measures rather than clinical outcomes such as cognitive decline or dementia, and longer-term trials in more diverse populations are required to determine clinical relevance.

LA NUCIA, Spain (Jan. 14, 2026) — The U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team defeated Denmark, 3-0, in the second of two friendly matches in Spain during its January training camp.

The first half saw no scoring, but the U.S. was on the front foot the entire time. By the end of the match, the U.S. had outshot Denmark 17-3 with eleven of those shots on target.

The U.S. finally broke through in the 47th minute, earning a free kick that midfielder Jordyn Heathcock sent the ball into the box. Defender Sophia Ahrens got a foot on it to score her first Youth National Team goal in her first YNT international call up. She made her debut for the U.S. three days earlier in the 2-2 draw against Germany.

The U.S. would continue to control momentum and stay on the attack. In the 83rd minute, midfielder Loradana Paletta -- the youngest on the team, born in 2011 — ripped a shot that was deflected by a Denmark defender, but she followed her shot and sent the rebounded ball past goalkeeper Isabella Andersen.

Six minutes later, the U.S. would score a third and final goal on the day. Defender Sam Ogden intercepted a pass and dribbled through the midfield. She played a ball up to forward Deus Stanislaus who finished with her left foot in the 89thminute.

Goalkeeper Avellina Saunders earned the first U-17 clean sheet of 2026.

The U.S. left Spain with one win and one draw to start 2026 as they prepare for 2026 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup qualifications this spring.

The benefit of national team players honing skills abroad is balanced by concerns over a weakened NWSL

The dust has yet to settle on Trinity Rodman's club status, but the star USA forward's near future has ignited an emphatic revival of an old debate on this side of the Atlantic.

How does the National Women's Soccer League stack up against its top competitor leagues? At what point should the league be worried, if top USWNT talent trickles across the Atlantic? And what, if anything, can be done to stop the flow?

The questions swirling stateside have been around for quite some time, though they once operated in much different conditions – a less competitive global landscape, diminished investment abroad, NWSL's formal management by US Soccer.

Those conditions have drastically shifted over the past decade, especially in the past six years. Since winning Olympic gold at the Parc des Princes, some of the USA's biggest names moved abroad. That includes the starting right-back Emily Fox (Arsenal), the centre-back and sometimes captain Naomi Girma (Chelsea) and the ascendant winger Alyssa Thompson (Chelsea). Key players such as Catarina Macario, the captain Lindsey Heaps (who has signed for her home town club in Denver this month), Phallon Tullis-Joyce and Lily Yohannes were already abroad.

As the Guardian noted after the defensive midfielder Sam Coffey – who was among the team's top scorers in 2025 – signed for Manchester City, if Rodman moves abroad, she would be the sixth starter from the Olympic gold-medal match now plying her trade in Europe.

One thing is clear: the NWSL regards the outward flow of the USWNT's marquee names as a matter of grave importance. Given the historic link between US national team stars and the NWSL's biggest crowds and marketability, that concern is merited. (Though notably, the league's health isn't as solely reliant on national team marketability as it has been in the past.)

But what the league can do to stymie the flow – and whether the present trend is worthy of outright panic – is less obvious.

The league's initial attempt to stop the flow (and prevent Rodman's departure in particular) is the High Impact Player Rule, which has already been officially contested by the NWSL Players Association. The NWSLPA alleges that the terms of the HIP Rule violate the terms of their collective bargaining agreement, as well as federal labour law, and advocates for raising the league's salary cap instead.

Nicknamed the “Rodman rule”, the HIP Rule lays out criteria for identifying highly sought-after international talent, and allocates an additional $1m beyond the salary cap to accommodate them in the roster. Criteria includes things such as minutes on the USWNT, and a high ranking on year-end lists such as ESPN's top 50 and the Guardian's top 100.

Emma Hayes has told the press that she was not consulted on the league's criteria for the HIP Rule and that it would not change her approach to management of the team. The former Chelsea manager has addressed this topic at several points publicly, always emphasising that she is there to support each player in their own decisions, and is not pointedly directing them abroad.

So far as the HIP Rule itself is concerned, the NWSLPA may be correct to suggest that renegotiating the salary cap is a better way to stay competitive. But to some extent, it's worth noting that USWNT talent going abroad isn't all about the money. Coffey, for example, moved to Manchester citing the same reasons international talents such as the Spain striker Esther González (who was the top scorer at last summer's Euros) or the Germany goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger gave when they came to NWSL; moving either way across the Atlantic provides players with new challenges in different systems.

With the game growing globally, expecting any international star to play out their entire career in one league could be unrealistic. From the individual or national team perspective, it may also limit the growth of that player as they seek out new elements to their game. In the case of USWNT players moving to Europe, the unique experience of playing in the Champions League – which challenges players to adjust to a variety of styles across Europe's top leagues – is irreplaceable. Fox cited the opportunity to compete in the Champions League as a key motivator in her move to Arsenal, going on to win the competition in her debut season. Hayes has emphasised Champions League experience is a valuable tool for her players to have as they prepare for the 2027 World Cup.

To help assuage fears, at the opposite end of migration, returning to NWSL remains an appeal for USWNT players such as Heaps or Catarina Macario, who have long charted their careers abroad. And while the league hustles to keep Rodman in the US, the other two members of the famed “triple espresso” forward trio that combined for 10 goals in Paris (Mallory Swanson and Sophia Wilson) are set to return to action in 2026, with all the star power they bring.

Eyes remain trained on the future for Rodman, and the NWSL is right to attempt to keep her in the states. Whether the HIP Rule proves consequential on that front (as well as any renegotiated salary cap) is highly uncertain. But long term, USWNT stars spending some time overseas may not necessarily be cause for panic, and from a national team perspective, may add dynamism to the team as they seek to compete at the next World Cup.

The holiday season has come and gone, but it wasn't the right time for U.S. men's national team manager Mauricio Pochettino to play Santa Claus and hand out presents to players. Practically speaking, Pochettino is still about 4½ months away from doling out the biggest gift of all -- a spot on the U.S. World Cup roster. Given his penchant for making unexpected selections, there are still a few spots up for grabs.

At present, the advantage lies squarely with those performers playing overseas. A couple of notable names will be in UEFA Champions League action as the league phase reaches its climax over the next 10 days. Some MLS players haven't played in a competitive fixture in almost three months, but training camps for its teams are about to begin, which means the pendulum on who is fit and ready will start to swing back.

The next goal on the horizon is the March international window. At that point, the MLS season will be just over a month old, but the game waits for no one, meaning now is an opportune time for players to build toward the next six months -- and for ESPN to take stock of the player pool with the latest edition of the USMNT big board.

Freese's last memory of the 2025 MLS season will be Inter Miami CF shipping five goals past him in the Eastern Conference final. But looking at his body of work last year, it was an impressive campaign for the NYCFC keeper and not much has changed for him in terms of the U.S. squad. Freese is still the presumptive starter going forward, having started the past 12 matches in goal. That doesn't mean Pochettino and his staff won't be looking at Freese's performances intently, but barring a drop in form, the starting spot is his to lose.

Turner occupies an odd place in the pool of U.S. goalkeepers. He's the only one with World Cup experience, and yet he was excluded from the November international window. It's imperative that Turner get off to a good start with the Revolution this season. The fact that Turner is once again working with his own personal ""goalie whisperer"" -- Revs keeper coach Kevin Hitchcock -- should provide a boost, but the pressure is on him to return to top form.

The good news for Schulte is that the vast majority of his competition -- both above him and below him -- is based in MLS, meaning he won't have to look far to see how his rivals are doing. But the Columbus keeper is facing the prospect of playing for new club manager Henrik Rydström, which adds an additional wrinkle as he begins a new campaign.

A collective sigh of relief could be heard among the U.S. fan base when it was revealed that Richards suffered a foot laceration a few weeks back and not anything long term. He's back starting for Palace again, although the FA Cup defeat to Macclesfield was a day to forget for him and his club. His return is plenty welcome because for all of Pochettino's statements about there being no guaranteed places on the roster, Richards is one of the few players who, health permitting, is a cinch to be there.

It's beyond remarkable that Ream is still firmly in the mix at age 38, but there you go. Has he lost a step? Perhaps, but his steady play, experience and leadership continue to make him a key part of Pochettino's plans. Could someone push him out of the starting lineup? It's possible, but no one has come close to doing that.

McKenzie's season with Toulouse continues to motor along as he has logged 1,538 minutes, third most on the team, although a foot injury saw him sit out last weekend's 5-1 win against Nice. That kind of consistency is why McKenzie remains in Pochettino's plans. His solid performance against Uruguay helped as well. McKenzie might not be a starter on this U.S. squad, but he remains a sturdy option.

Even in the age of 26-player rosters, versatility is a plus and that's true of Robinson, who has played minutes at right back in the hybrid system employed by Pochettino. That has kept Robinson in Pochettino's thoughts and in the reckoning for the final roster. An impressive start with Cincinnati in the early stages of the MLS season would help Robinson solidify his spot.

If not for an upcoming suspension for yellow-card accumulation, Banks' run in Augsburg's starting lineup would have shown no signs of slowing down, as he made his 14th straight appearance against SC Freiburg over the weekend. His 6-foot-4 frame allows him to be dominant in the air, winning 59.2% of his aerial challenges, and he's completing 90.2% of his passes, a rate that climbs to 90.4% in the attacking third.

The only concern at this stage is that he has yet to feature in a game for the Americans. Will that lack of experience count against him?

Dest's role going forward will be one of the big questions heading into the March window and beyond. He played more as a winger during the November window, but that was also a period in which some of the more prominent attacking options -- such as Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie -- were absent. If everyone is healthy, a spot in the back seems more likely for Dest, but only time will reveal more of Pochettino's thinking on this.

Robinson's return to the Fulham lineup has been the most welcome development since the last international window in November. His ninth appearance in little more than a month -- with him playing 90 minutes in seven of those -- appears to show that he's back to full fitness. Robinson's ability to not only defend but contribute to the attack via his ability to deliver crosses from wide positions, will provide the U.S. with another attacking option.

Freeman's ascendency in 2025 was among the biggest surprises for the U.S., capped off by his two-goal performance against Uruguay. Now, he's basically in a competition with Joe Scally to see who the backup outside back is, although that's dependent in part on Dest's role. Regardless, Freeman will be intent on maintaining his momentum.

Robinson's return means Arfsten is relegated to a backup role, which is perfectly fine given his overall improvement on defense and his continued effectiveness going forward. Will new Crew manager Rydström use Arfsten differently than Wilfried Nancy did? It's possible, but Pochettino has been consistent in how he has deployed Arfsten, so the impact of a new Columbus manager figures to be minimal.

Adams' recovery from an MCL injury to his left knee is ongoing, but given a likely return in March, he still seems a lock to make the roster. There was talk of a potential big move to Manchester United, making the injury even more untimely than it is otherwise, but his value to Bournemouth remains high, so he should slide back into the Cherries' lineup upon his return and satisfy Pochettino's desire for his players to be getting consistent minutes.

McKennie is another player whose role with the U.S. is still unknown, a situation similar to what he's encountering with Juventus right now. For the U.S., McKennie seems likely to occupy either one of the holding midfield spots or one of the two No. 10 positions. The latter seems to better suit his instincts, but the opponent and the availability of teammates will influence where he lands.

With no competitive games in the past two months, the challenge for Roldan is to reestablish the momentum he created toward the end of 2025. Given the competition in the center of midfield, this will be no easy task, but Roldan has established a body of work that has yielded considerable equity with Pochettino.

Morris continues to punch the clock with Middlesbrough, which currently occupies one of the guaranteed promotion places in the English Championship. His 4.91 recoveries per game rank third on the squad, even as he missed a half-dozen games because of a leg injury. The aim now will be to leverage his consistent club form into a more prominent role with the U.S. team.

A crisis along the back line for Lyon has meant that Tessmann has spent some minutes playing as a central defender of late, where he has performed admirably. But the center of midfield is where he belongs for the U.S., and he remains the favorite to partner with Adams when the Bournemouth player recovers.

Pulisic continues to put in a stellar season for Milan, where his 0.84 goals per game tops Serie A for those players with more than 200 minutes played, although he has cooled off of late. The impulse to put him in bubble wrap until March is strong, but so is the desire to see him continue to excel for the Rossoneri, who are second in league play after 21 games.

Weah is another player whose ultimate spot on the field is to be determined. He could be deployed as a wing back or move play as one of the attacking midfielders. With Dest logging time at wing back recently, the logjam at that position looks set to increase. Weah's steady minutes with Marseille mean he's a solid pick to make the final squad. He popped up for his third goal of the season in all competitions last weekend against Angers.

As the Bundesliga emerged from its brief winter break, Tillman remains a big part of Leverkusen's plans, but both player and team have hit something of a rut of late, with Tillman not making a goal contribution since November and Leverkusen losing twice a row since resuming the season. As for the U.S., Tillman needs to pick his game up a notch or two if he's to get minutes when the full team convenes in March.

The bump from a stellar September window has given way to some nagging injuries, and he was held out of América's Clausura opening matches. This has left Zendejas a tad vulnerable in terms of a roster spot, but he retains his place for now. It helps that he has played a variety of attacking and midfield roles in his career, but given Pochettino's emphasis on recent form, Zendejas will need to regain the level that saw him oozing confidence last September.

No player has raised their stock more in the past six weeks than Aaronson. In that time, he has recorded three goals and two assists. From a psychological perspective, he has gone from being derided by the Leeds faithful to being cheered. In terms of his World Cup prospects, his ability to play multiple positions will serve him well, even as he's not as technical as Zendejas or Diego Luna.

For a while, Reyna was slowly ticking the boxes in terms of solidifying his spot on the U.S. roster. He needed to get healthy. He needed to perform in front of Pochettino. Then he needed to start playing consistently for Borussia Mönchengladbach. All of that had been accomplished, but now a bit of backsliding has taken place. Reyna has played only 26 minutes in three games since the winter break. One possible reason is a lack of end product for his club. He has yet to record a goal or an assist for Gladbach. That will have to change for his roster spot to become more secure.

Balogun's grip on the starting spot for the U.S. remains firm. He hasn't been completely tearing it up for Monaco, but he has been steady enough with his goal contributions -- 10 in 22 games in all competitions -- to keep getting consistent playing time. He has been plenty effective in a U.S. shirt as well, scoring three goals in the last three international windows of 2025.

Pepi is still in a good position to make the U.S. squad, but it would help if his injury luck changed. Last Saturday, he sustained a fluke injury when he broke his forearm as he fell to the ground after scoring for PSV. He had surgery Sunday and will sit out two months. That should leave him plenty of time to recover for the World Cup, but this latest ailment -- plus his injury history overall -- raises questions about his durability. That might not be an issue in a short tournament like the World Cup, but it's something Pochettino and his staff will monitor.

The goals have run dry for Wright, but he finally managed to end his drought with a late winner in last weekend's match against Leicester City. That rough stretch has left him vulnerable to being overtaken by the likes of Patrick Agyemang, but Wright keeps his place for now.

Celentano remains in the mix for a roster spot, but at this stage, he's largely dependent on the form of others -- or the lack thereof -- to shoehorn his way onto the roster. Cincinnati looks to have a very competitive team this season, so Celentano should get plenty of support on that front.

The lack of a January camp this year was brought up in the last Big Board, but it bears repeating. The lack of such a camp does Steffen no favors in terms of rising up the goalkeeper depth chart. He'll have to hope that his experiences during the last World Cup cycle, when at one point he was the No. 1, pay off and see him turn in some eye-opening performances.

When Cameron Carter-Vickers went down because of an Achilles injury, Trusty stepped into the Celtic starting lineup, but it didn't coincide with a happy time at Celtic Park, with the club struggling mightily. Much of the blame has been put on now-former manager Nancy, but Trusty didn't acquit himself well during this period either. Back-to-back clean sheets are steps in the right direction.

At this stage, Blackmon looks to be in a battle in which his experience will be weighed against Banks' promise. It's a tough situation for Blackmon to be in given he won't play a league match for another month and a half. The feather in his cap is that he has performed well for Pochettino while Banks has yet to make his debut for the U.S. team. As is the case for so many MLS players, Blackmon will need to get up to speed quickly. His contract situation with Vancouver is something to keep an eye on.

Carter-Vickers' odds of another World Cup are astronomical at this stage, as he has been ruled out for the season because of an Achilles injury. He'll push himself to the maximum in a bid to return, but it's just too big of a mountain to climb.

Scally is the big loser in terms of Antonee Robinson's return. The challenge facing Scally at this point is that while he's versatile in terms of position and formation -- he can play as a center back, wing back or outside back -- he isn't better than any of his competitors at any of those positions. Injuries are always part of the equation, so he should remain on standby.

Tolkin remains a long shot, and Antonee Robinson's return means the odds have only gotten longer. That said, Tolkin had some good moments against Uruguay, and stood up to La Celeste's physical play. He should keep his phone close by.

Wiley has been plagued by a back injury for much of this season, and with his return getting pushed further into the future, the decision was made to terminate Wiley's loan to Watford, and he has returned to Chelsea. It's time for him to get healthy and then retrench with another loan, but any possibility of a World Cup spot is out of reach.

Cardoso has been steadily building up his fitness, and he has started Atléti's past two games (two wins). He has been down this road before, but the hope is that he doesn't endure any more setbacks and can begin to make some inroads. That said, there are a lot of players to climb over for a roster spot.

Following a barren November, Musah has had his playing time steadily climb in the past month, and he even started last weekend's match against Pisa. He still seems a long way away from being a consistent starter, which looks to be the bar that Musah will have to get over if he's to get more of a look at the international level.

As it turns out, De la Torre's San Diego homecoming didn't turn out the way he had hoped, and now he's been sent east to Charlotte FC. Credit him for getting out of a suboptimal situation, but now it's up to him to make the most of it. The list of players sitting above him in the midfield depth chart has grown long.

Berhalter's growth in the past year has been impressive. His set-piece delivery remains arguably the best in the pool, and it still might not be enough to get him to the World Cup. A March call-up is possible given Adams' injury, but if everyone is healthy -- and granted, that's a big ""if"" -- the numbers don't add up. It might come down to which player Pochettino rates higher: Roldan or Berhalter.

Luna hasn't done anything wrong, per se. If anything, he improved his stock during the November window. It's just that Aaronson has raised his game to such a degree that he has supplanted Luna in this hypothetical roster. It's not over for Luna by any means, but the gauntlet has been thrown down -- if it wasn't already -- that he needs to raise his game even more.

Give Agyemang credit. He bet on himself by moving to Derby County last summer and it has paid off to the tune of seven goals and three assists in 1,694 minutes, despite an early groin injury that required surgery. His steady form might yet see him bypass Wright, and Agyemang has the added advantage of having a distinct body type that makes him better able to score by brute force. Spending time out on the wing also has added variety to his game.

After bottoming out in October and November, Sargent enjoyed an uptick in form getting a pair of goals in the past month to bring his league tally to seven on the season. But now it looks as if he wants out of Norwich, declining to play in the Canaries' FA Cup game in mid-January because of a transfer bid from Toronto FC. Regardless of if he moves -- and there are indications Norwich won't necessarily approve the switch -- it's still tough to see him breaking into the roster.

Downs' spell in Southampton wasn't working out -- only one assist on the season and no appearances since November -- so it's back to Germany he goes, where he latched on with Hamburg on loan, long one of the Bundesliga's sleeping giants. It's a country he knows well, having scored 11 goals for FC Cologne in the 2. Bundesliga last season. Those tailwinds probably won't be enough to make the World Cup squad, but the move is a logical step. He played 12 substitute minutes last weekend.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

1938 France World Cup poster by Henri Desmé , photographer unknown, source Public Domain

This article is part three of our series detailing the history of the FIFA World Cup.

The third World Cup saw an even greater interest from around the world. France and Germany bid for hosting rights with the French winning the right to host the third edition. This World Cup was held amid rising tensions around the world, with Germany having annexed Austria, Spain in the middle of a civil war, and Japan aggressively expanding in the East. Fascism was also on the rise in Europe, with both Germany and Italy seeing political opportunities to tout their systems of governance.

In addition, various teams from the American continent refused to attend, protesting FIFA awarding Europe two consecutive World Cups rather than alternating it between the two continents (at that time, Africa and Asia had yet to throw their hats in the ring to bid for hosting rights). 

Most of the South American teams, including Uruguay and Argentina, declined to take part in the competition after the controversy of the Peru v Austria match at the Football tournament of the 1936 Summer Olympics. Peru had won in overtime 4-2 and even had three goals disallowed, but the Olympic Committee ordered the game replayed, citing invasion of the pitch by Peruvian fans.

The United States and Mexico joined the qualifying rounds of this third World Cup, but eventually withdrew. Argentina submitted a late application (which was accepted), before a definitive withdrawal due to disagreements between the National Federation and the local clubs. Spain was unable to participate due to their ongoing civil war (which also had covert and overt participation by France, Italy, Germany, and the Soviet Union).

Despite this strife, 16 teams eventually qualified. However, only 15 participated since Austria withdrew due to their annexation by Germany. This would eventually also have an impact on Germany's performance during the tournament, but the event would still see some very high-quality matches that further drove the interest of the World Cup to a global level.

The final list of participating countries was:

The matches would be played in eight cities. The final would be played in Rome in the Stadio Nazionale PNF that had a capacity of 47,300 (PNF was an abbreviation for Partito Nazionale Fascista).

Some of the firsts in this tournament were:

Five of the seven first round matches went into overtime and even then, two of those games went to replays. In one of those replays, Cuba advanced to the next round by beating Romania 2-1. In the other replay, Germany was beaten by Switzerland 4-2 despite being ahead 2-0 in the first half. It was in this game that the German head coach, Sepp Herberger, blamed the five Austrian players (their country had been annexed by Germany) for having a “defeatist attitude.” Until they were knocked out of the group stages in 2018 and 2022, this was the only time Germany had failed to advance past the first round.

Sweden advanced directly to the quarter-finals because of Austria's withdrawal and then beat Cuba 8–0. The hosts, France, were beaten by the defending champions, Italy, and Switzerland were seen off by Hungary. Czechoslovakia and Brazil went into overtime where Brazil overcame the depleted Czech team (two of their key players had suffered broken bones in the first game). This was the last match to be replayed in a World Cup.

Hungary overwhelmed Sweden in one of the semi-finals 5–1, while Italy and Brazil had the first of their many World Cup clashes in the other. The Brazilians were without their star player Leônidas, who was injured, and the Italians won 2-1. Brazil beat Sweden 4–2 for third place.

The final was held on June 19 at the Stade Olympique de Colombes in Paris, where Italy faced Hungary. Italy struck early with Gino Colaussi scoring in the 6th minute, but Hungary quickly equalized through Pál Titkos. Italy regained the lead almost immediately with Colaussi's second goal, and Silvio Piola added another before halftime. Hungary fought back with a goal from György Sárosi, but Piola sealed the victory with his second goal, making the final score 4–2.

This win marked Italy's second consecutive World Cup title, making them the first team to achieve back-to-back championships. The match was notable for its fast pace and attacking play, with Italy's tactical discipline and counterattacks proving decisive. It was also the last World Cup before World War II, and Italy played in black shirts as a political gesture under Mussolini's regime. The tournament itself was overshadowed by political tensions, but the final showcased Italy's dominance under coach Vittorio Pozzo, who remains the only manager to win two World Cups.

Home » $75 Million at Stake as Esports World Cup 2026 Reveals Full Schedule, Games

The Esports World Cup Foundation (EWCF) has unveiled a $75 million total prize pool alongside the full game lineup and competition schedule for the Esports World Cup 2026.

Set to return to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from July 6 through August 23, the seven-week global showcase will feature more than 2,000 players representing approximately 200 Clubs from over 100 countries. Competitors will battle across 25 tournaments spanning 24 games, all culminating in the crowning of the next Esports World Cup Club Champion.

Now entering its third year, the Esports World Cup continues to evolve beyond a traditional tournament series into a multi-title, season-defining competition that brings together elite players, Clubs, publishers, and fans under a single global calendar. The record-setting prize pool reflects the scale of that ambition, reinforcing the EWC's role as a central pillar of the international esports ecosystem.

At the heart of the event is the EWC Club Championship, the tournament's flagship cross-game competition. In 2026, $30 million will be distributed among the top 24 Clubs, representing a $3 million year-over-year increase. The winning Club will earn $7 million, with expanded payouts flowing deeper into the standings. Last year's championship race remained undecided until the final week, with seven Clubs still in contention during the closing stages.

“The life-changing prize pool exists to support the people at the heart of esports: the players and the Clubs that invest in them year after year,” Ralf Reichert, CEO of the Esports World Cup Foundation, said in a press release. “EWC is different because of the Club Championship. One title crowns a champion. EWC crowns the ultimate cross-game Club Champion.”

Beyond the Club Championship, Individual Game Championships will collectively account for more than $39 million in prize money. Additional funds will be distributed through Club and Player Awards, including MVP honors for each tournament and the Jafonso Award, which recognizes standout performances by players or Clubs that advance from Last Chance Qualifiers to win a Game Championship. Qualifying events hosted by partner publishers and organizers worldwide will also distribute prize money leading into the main event in Riyadh.

EWCF will continue its ecosystem development initiatives in 2026, including the Club Partner Program and the Road to EWC qualification system. The Club Partner Program will once again support 40 leading global esports organizations, while publisher-led leagues, regional tournaments, and grassroots competitions will serve as official pathways to qualification, broadening access for players and Clubs worldwide.

The EWC 2026 game lineup spans major global franchises and competitive genres, with 24 titles confirmed. New additions include Fortnite and Trackmania, joining returning staples such as League of Legends, Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, VALORANT, Overwatch 2, Rocket League, PUBG, EA Sports FC 26, Street Fighter 6, TEKKEN 8, and Call of Duty titles, among others. Chess also returns, underscoring the event's cross-genre competitive scope.

Competitions will take place across multiple arenas in Riyadh, with a coordinated multi-venue schedule allowing several championships to run in parallel. Organizers say the format is designed to enhance both the live fan experience and global viewership throughout the seven-week event.

Tickets for Esports World Cup 2026 will go on sale January 22, 2026, via esportsworldcup.com and international ticketing partners including Webook, Platinumlist, Damai, Maiseat, and Tixr. Early Bird offerings will include Weekly Access Passes, Premium Tournament Passes, and hospitality packages for the Esports Embassy, the event's premium on-site experience.

The announcement builds on the momentum of Esports World Cup 2025, which reached 750 million viewers globally and generated 350 million hours watched. Peak concurrent viewership approached 8 million during the League of Legends tournament, with coverage delivered across 28 platforms by 97 broadcast partners in 35 languages. In Riyadh, more than 3 million visitors attended the EWC and its accompanying festival over the seven-week run.

Inter Miami finally lifted MLS Cup in 2025. After reloading in the transfer market, the Herons are built not just to repeat - but to dominate in 2026.

Noah Allen had to sit down. The celebrations were going on around him, Inter Miami enjoying every moment of a first MLS Cup win in franchise history. But Allen, a crucial piece of the side who had played every minute of their playoff run, just needed to relax for a few minutes. 

""We won, we celebrated a little bit. And I just remember sitting down for five minutes. My legs were gone,"" he told GOAL. 

Allen's cramp was not the lasting image of Miami's cup triumph. No, that would be Lionel Messi celebrating in front of the Miami fans, or perhaps David Beckham on the field after the game. But Allen is more of what the Herons are all about. Yes, this is Messi's team in which the Argentine scores the goals, grabs the assists, and generates headlines. Around him, though, there are others who do all of the bits in between: defend, run, press, stop shots. 

Those are the pieces - not the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner enjoying an all-time playoff run - that turn an excellent MLS team into a championship-winning one. And Allen, a left back turned center back, is the epitome of the perfect supporting cast member. Those guys took Miami to the cup.

Now, though, their other guys just got better. After winning MLS Cup last year, Miami have retooled to a frightening degree. They lost two franchise cornerstones in Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets, and have used that money - and more - to go big. A plethora of expensive signings and a few smarter moves, have seen the best team in Major League Soccer get even better. On paper, they look close to unstoppable. 

""With the team that we're building, the standard now is to lift trophies. Not only is the MLS Cup something that we have our eyes on, but there are multiple other trophies that we're looking forward to, not only competing for, but winning,"" new signing Dayne St. Clair said to GOAL.

Of course, there were some significant outgoings. Alba and SBusquets both left the club after two and a half seasons in South Florida. Busquets was coming towards the end of his career, but Alba, no doubt, still had some football left in him. Miami struck quickly to replace the two. Sergio Reguilon, something of a European journeyman, agreed to join the club before the end of the season and will fill Alba's role wonderfully. Busquets will be slightly harder to replace, but with Yannick Bright ready to step into a midfield role and Rodrigo De Paul also available, his absence can certainly be accounted for. 

""Two players have made history at this club, have completely transformed it along with Leo. Today they are part of the great history of this club, which is very short, very small, but that's what they came for, to change the course of this club,"" Mascherano said after Miami's MLS Cup win. 

And then there are the incomings. The list reads marvelously. On top of Reguilon are: St. Clair, center back Micael, right back Facundo Mura, defensive midfielder David Ayala, and, reportedly, striker German Berterame - a fine marksman from Liga MX. In short, Miami have, unquestionably, gotten better. This is, of course, what co-owner Jorge Mas promised. The outspoken businessman has always made it clear that Miami's priority was to spend in the transfer market

""The best version of your Inter Miami is yet to come… we cannot and will not stay static. We promise our fans and ‘La familia' that we will reload in 26' as our primary goal is to win the ConcaChampions [CONCACAF Champions Cup] and qualify for the FIFA Club World Cup,"" he said on social media. 

What no one could have accounted for is just how aggressive they would be. 

St. Clair said he was going to listen to everyone once he hit free agency. His contract was up with Minnesota United, and the reigning MLS goalkeeper of the year had plenty of options to consider. 

And then, Inter Miami called.

""Once they came in and started to talk about the project and where they saw things going and how they saw me fitting into it, I felt like it was the best decision for me,"" he said. 

The appeals were too many to count. First, Miami had a specific need in goal. Rocco Rios Novo, the youngster who had served Miami well throughout the playoffs, could certainly be upgraded on. Secondly, the games were simply going to be higher profile than those St. Clair was playing in Minnesota. He needed reps, minutes against big teams, and, frankly, more eyes on what he was doing week in, week out. 

""Being at a team that's obviously playing higher profile games in terms of playing CONCACAF Champions Cup, a brand new stadium with Miami Freedom Park, being surrounded by the best players in the world. It was just something that kind of ticked all the boxes, and a new challenge for me,"" St. Clair added.

There were, admittedly, some considerations. Leaving Minnesota was immensely difficult, St. Clair admitted. He had been at the club since 2019, and started consistently for four years. He also talked to Canada Men's National Team manager Jesse Marsch before making the move. Marsch told him that his support would be unconditional, with the caveat that higher-profile games would certainly benefit St. Clair as he looks to push for the No. 1 jersey for Les Rouges at the 2026 World Cup. 

But it wasn't just the goalkeeper that needed sorting. Miami's defense has been a concern for the best part of two years now. The Herons are always going to score goals - that is the benefit of having Messi in the side. But solidity at the back? That was less certain. During their playoffs, it was arguably the defensive unit's improvement that made the difference. They conceded just five goals in six games en route to the cup. 

Maxi Falcon, the oft-criticized, perennially erratic central defender, settled in. Allen, naturally a left back, slipped into a central role with ease alongside him. 

""I do feel like I'm more of a natural left back. But I'm never gonna complain. I'm always gonna do whatever the coach wants me to do. If he says play center back. I'll play center back,"" Allen said. 

Reguilon was a shrewd signing. Despite the fact that he has been a free agent since May 2025, the left back's quality cannot be ignored. And at 29, he will be a fine filler on an affordable contract. Brazilian defender Micael, formerly of Houston Dynamo and impressive at Palmeiras, will offer depth as well as first-team competition in central defense. David Ayala, a former Argentinian youth international, was a regular for Portland Timbers last year, and will add midfield depth - especially in a defensive midfield role. Mura, who was a key contributor for Argentina's Racing Club, brings experience and creativity at right back. 

And then there's perhaps the biggest one of them all. Berterame has flirted with an MLS move before, and two clubs paid his $15 million release clause last year - only for the Mexican to turn down their interest. This time, though, it seems that the move is nearing completion. Berterame is a fully-fledged Mexican international with 68 goals at Monterrey to his name. That deal is reportedly nearing completion, filling another obvious gap as Miami had just one natural No. 9 on the roster - the aging Luis Suarez.

Of course, there could be some negatives to this all. Miami have depth, but they also have plenty of quality. There are some stalwarts - Allen, Tadeo Allende, Marco Silvetti - who will now have to fight for their places. This team clicked into gear with a crucially consistent XI for most of the postseason. There is a danger, with any flurry of acquisitions, that the harmony of a winning side is affected.

Allen, who sees his starting spot in danger, is welcoming the competition.

""Competition brings out the best. Competition to win titles, and I'm just gonna look to embrace it. I'm happy that new guys are coming in. I'm looking forward to working with them. I'm looking forward to hanging out with them in the locker room off the field as well. So I think it's nothing but good, especially bringing in a lot of players,"" Allen said.

The South Florida native also pointed out that, playing or not, there is something to be said for just being there, day in, day out.

""Whether I'm on the bench or not in the team, it doesn't matter to me. I'm going to work hard. I'm going to train hard and help my team and coach whatever they need,"" he added.

There will also be an expanded schedule to work with. Last year was hard on Miami's legs. They played a record 58 games in all competitions. And while there isn't a Club World Cup to worry about, the Herons will likely have to confront a similar workload this year with multiple cup competitions. 

Mascherano told GOAL before the 2025 season that his expectation was to compete for everything, no matter what. Miami, even if they claimed MLS Cup, ultimately failed in that venture, going out of three competitions they are, by name alone, expected to win. Of course, that doesn't make the season a failure. But it's impossible to deny that they fell short in certain areas.

And perhaps that's the real impetus here. Miami might have lost two big names and seen a third lose a step. But they had to add, not only repeat but also improve. No MLS club has retained the cup since LA Galaxy went back-to-back in 2012 and 2013. There is an expectation that Miami will do that, but also be in the mix for CONCACAF Champions Cup and Leagues Cup. A Supporters' Shield wouldn't hurt, either. This is, by some distance, the best team in MLS. Everyone will want to beat them.

""It's obviously been a long time since a team has repeated. But the expectation for us is to win everything we're a part of,"" St. Clair said. 

It will take legs. It will take quality. It will take consistency from Messi and the shrewd navigation of minutes from a still-inexperienced manager. There's also a World Cup, right in the middle of the season, to consider. In effect, there has never been an MLS title more difficult to defend. 

Allen might need a few minutes again at the end of 2026. But the Herons have put all the pieces in place for him to rest as championship celebrations unfold around him once more. 

""I feel like we have the highest standard in the league as a team, and we got to match that standard,"" Allen said.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

While the Manchester derby dominated headlines as the most high-profile rivalry taking place in world football last weekend, a new regional showdown was quietly making history on the other side of the planet. In Oceania, the New Zealand duo of Auckland FC and South Island United met for the first time, ushering in a new rivalry in an entirely new competition.

Saturday's match was only the second ever in the OFC Pro League, following the competition's inaugural fixture between Fiji's Bula FC and Vanuatu United. Played as part of the league's first circuit series – of which there will be six in total – the all-Kiwi clash ended in a comfortable 3-0 victory for Auckland FC, who hosted both matches at their Eden Park home.

Designed to sit above the OFC Champions League as the region's premier club competition, the Pro League represents a major shift in Oceania football. It is the first fully professional tournament the confederation has ever staged, bringing together the leading clubs across the Pacific in a format never seen before in the region. But what exactly is the OFC Pro League? Who is involved? And how, in practice, does it all work?

 

The Oceania Football Confederation has long lagged behind the other five continents when it comes to professionalising the sport.

At the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, semi-pro Auckland City qualified as the region's sole representative by winning the OFC Champions League for the fourth year in a row – a reflection of their continental supremacy and the lack of fully professional structures. For decades, that – combined with limited funding and vast travel distances – has prevented OFC from establishing a professional competition.

But eight years after exploratory discussions first began, the inaugural OFC Pro League launched in January 2026. The competition has been made possible by significant financial backing from Saudi Arabia, which is reportedly investing close to NZ$35 million to help launch the league and underwrite it during its first four years. The move is widely viewed as the latest example of Saudi Arabia's growing use of football as a soft-power tool on the global stage.

The Pro League's objective is to create a sustainable, fully professional environment for players, staff and clubs, while developing young talent across the Pacific and improving Oceania's competitiveness internationally. That ambition inevitably extends to the FIFA Club World Cup, where Oceania's representative will be determined by the best-performing Pro League club over a four-year cycle. So who might that be at the next edition of the tournament in 2029?



The OFC announced the eight participating clubs last August following a formal selection procedure. The line-up includes three established sides – Auckland FC, PNG Hekari (Papua New Guinea) and South Melbourne (Australia) – alongside five newly created clubs: South Island United (formed by Christchurch United to represent New Zealand's South Island), Solomon Kings (Solomon Islands), Bula FC, Tahiti United and Vanuatu United.

The inclusion of A-League club Auckland FC and Australian Championship side South Melbourne among the participants benefits from additional context.

Auckland FC were granted a licence on the condition they would send a reserve side, bolstered by a limited number of senior players, to the competition. South Melbourne, meanwhile, are participating as a guest club from an AFC nation and will not be eligible to represent OFC at the Club World Cup, even if they do qualify on merit.

 

The first stage, which is currently underway in New Zealand (and seen one clash between Bula FC and South Island United postponed), will be followed by circuit series in Papua New Guinea, Australia, the Solomon Islands and Fiji. During that phase, the participating clubs will face each opponent twice and play 14 matches in total – three at each circuit series except for Honiara in the Solomon Islands, where they will each play twice.

At the end of the fifth round in Ba and Suva in April, the eight-team table will split into two groups: the top four (the Leaders' Group) and the bottom four (the Challengers' Group).

The teams will then return to New Zealand in mid-May to play the sixth and final series. Each participant will face the other three teams in their group, with the top three in the Leaders' Group qualifying directly for the semi-finals and the bottom team taking on the winner of the Challengers' Group to determine the remaining knockout berth.

The final four will then play a single-leg semi-final and final to become Oceania's first professional football champion and win the right to represent the continent globally – an honour that will bring the recipient both enormous prestige and valuable prize money.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","How did David Luiz end up at Pafos? The story of Chelsea cult hero's surprise late-career foray in Cyprus ahead of return to Stamford Bridge in the Champions League","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/how-david-luiz-pafos-chelsea-cult-hero-surprise-late-career-cyprus-return-stamford-bridge-champions-league/blta0998bcb352a87e5","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 08:00:00 GMT","

Before last season, very few casual fans would have been aware of Pafos FC's existence. The Cypriot outfit played in Europe for the first time in their 11-year history, reaching the last 16 of the Conference League, and followed up that impressive run by clinching their maiden league title. The latter achievement earned Pafos a spot in the Champions League qualifying rounds, and helped attract one of the most famous footballers of his generation.

David Luiz joined the club at the start of August on a two-year contract, sealing his return to European football after four years back in his home country, Brazil. It was an unexpected late-career move for the 38-year-old, who Pafos described as a ""true titan of modern football"" in their official transfer announcement, and he is now looking forward to an even more unlikely homecoming at Chelsea.

Pafos will travel to Stamford Bridge to take on the Blues in the Champions League on Wednesday, and Luiz is sure to receive a hero's welcome if he is able to prove his fitness after suffering an injury at the weekend. The defender is a beloved figure among the Chelsea faithful, despite his move to London rivals Arsenal in 2019, having helped the club win six trophies, including the Premier League and Champions League, across two spells.

Regardless of the final result, it promises to be a memorable occasion for both Luiz and Pafos, whose rapid rise from complete anonymity to club football's elite stage has been nothing short of remarkable. Certainly, no one would have predicted it when AEK Kouklia and AEP Paphos initially merged to create Pafos FC back in 2014, and they were entered into Cyprus' second tier.

Pafos have been a fixture in the top-flight since being taken over by Russian businessman and former Portsmouth owner Roman Dubov in 2017, and have gone through a host of different managers, including Real Madrid icon Michel Salgado and ex-Manchester United man Henning Berg. But their real success began after the appointment of Juan Carlos Carcedo in 2023.

The Spanish coach, who once served as Unai Emery's assistant at Arsenal, delivered Pafos' first piece of silverware, the Cypriot Cup, in his debut season, and has since turned them into the country's No.1 team. With Luiz now helping to boost their profile even further, the future looks bright. However, one question lingers: how on earth did he end up at Pafos in the first place?

Luiz won the third FA Cup of his career at Arsenal, and became a key player early in Mikel Arteta's tenure, racking up 73 appearances across all competitions. However, a hamstring injury cut short his 2020-21 campaign, and the Gunners decided not to renew the then-34-year-old's contract, instead seeking to strengthen the heart of the defence with younger alternatives.

The former Benfica and Paris Saint-Germain star eventually found a new club in September 2021, with Flamengo snapping him up on a free transfer. Luiz turned down other offers to join the Brazilian giants, as he revealed at his presentation.

""I had a few different scenarios where I could have picked a quieter, more peaceful life, but I like to follow my heart,"" he explained. ""This is another big challenge in my life. I felt during my tour that this is what I always wanted, it gives me the air I breathe. If the voice of the people is the voice of God, then the country called out to me and here I am.""

In typical fashion, Luiz rose to that ""big challenge"", quickly nailing down a starting role despite his late-season arrival. Flamengo did, however, endure a heart-breaking end to the campaign, finishing second in the Brazilian Serie A before suffering a painful 2-1 defeat to Palmeiras after extra-time in the Copa Libertadores final, with Luiz playing the full 120 minutes.

Flamengo dropped to fifth in the league table the following season, but won the Copa do Brasil and went one better in the Copa Libertadores, beating Athletico Paranaense 1-0 in the final. Luiz was the driving force behind their success, and became only the 14th player ever to win the Copa Libertadores and Champions League, earning a contract extension in the process.

""Flamengo is the pinnacle of emotions! It's living life on the edge. Always wondering 'what's going to happen?' But it's also the fulfilment of most Brazilians,"" Luiz said in a subsequent interview with Globo Esporte. ""It's one of the best chapters of my life, one of the best things football has to offer. Did I imagine it? I don't know. Maybe I didn't imagine it would be so special and affect me as much as it does today. It gives me pleasure to say that it's a club that's in my heart!""

Luiz got the chance to compete in the Club World Cup again at the start of the 2023 campaign, as the 2022 tournament was pushed to February so it wouldn't clash with the international World Cup in Qatar. Flamengo failed to set up a blockbuster final clash with Real Madrid, though, falling to a shock 3-2 loss against Al-Hilal in the semis.

Disappointment ended up being the theme of their season as Flamengo fell short in all the major competitions, but Luiz did finally net his first goal for the club in a 3-2 league win over Bahia.

There were also real signs that Luiz's body was starting to fail him during the 2023 campaign. Indeed, he missed Flamengo's final 11 league fixtures after suffering a severely sprained ankle during the team's 2-0 win away at Cruzeiro, with a buggy used to safely transfer the ex-Chelsea star from the field as he broke down in tears. 

However, Flamengo still decided to renew Luiz's contract for one more year, and were vindicated in the early stages of the 2024 season. Luiz played a part in Flamengo's run to the Campeonato Carioca crown, and though persistent struggles with his ankle forced then-manager Tite to keep him on the bench for Flamengo's opening Serie A games, the veteran defender proved his worth upon returning to full fitness.

He was among the scorers in his first game back in the starting XI, a 6-1 league rout of Vasco da Gama, and it was a goal to put right up there with the very best of his career: Luiz pulled away from his marker during a corner delivery before firing a first-time volley into the net, prompting wild celebrations involving the majority of his team-mates. The superb strike capped a colossal overall display from Luiz, who also won five of his six aerial duels while posting a 95 percent pass completion rate.

Luiz became a regular again after that, but consistency proved elusive for Flamengo, and ex-Brazil boss Tite was sacked in September after they were knocked out of the Copa Libertadores by Penarol at the quarter-final stage. The club then turned to Filipe Luis, another former Chelsea star who finished his playing career at Flamengo - an appointment which spelled the beginning of the end for Luiz's spell at the Maracana.

Flamengo went on to win the Copa do Brasil again under Luis, but Luiz was an unused substitute in their semi-final victory over Corinthians, and only played one minute across the two legs of their final triumph against Atletico Mineiro. Luiz did start four of Flamengo's final league matches in 2024, but his Achilles was still causing him pain, which left the club in a bind regarding his future.

On December 22, 2024, Luiz's departure was officially announced on social media, but he did not take kindly to the news, claiming he had been blindsided in an explosive outburst to the press. 

""If I didn't have Instagram, social media, maybe I wouldn't even know today (about the non-renewal),"" he said. ""So, I think it wasn't good, and then I stop to think, there are only two ways: either it was intentional or it was amateurish.""

Luiz was only a free agent for a month, though. Fortaleza handed him a two-year deal at the end of the winter transfer window, prolonging his stay in the Brazilian top-flight. He was subsequently mobbed by fans upon his arrival, and said the club had ""captured my heart"", before immediately targeting silverware at the Ceara-based club. 

""The foundation is here. Everything is here. The cake is almost ready,"" Luiz said at his official unveiling. ""All that's missing is the whipped cream and the cherry on top.""

Fortaleza finished the 2024 Serie A season in fourth, just one place behind Flamengo, to qualify for the Copa Libertadores for the first time ever. They were not able to build on that success with Luiz on the books, though.

It quickly became obvious that Luiz was a club signing, not one that head coach Juan Pablo Vojvoda had pushed for, and he found himself in and out of the team, despite Fortaleza's form falling off a cliff. When Luiz picked up a thigh injury in early July, the writing was on the wall.

On August 1, the defender's contract was terminated by mutual consent, at which stage he had already reached an agreement to join Pafos. After the free transfer went through, Luiz explained why his seven-month spell at Fortaleza went so badly, hinting at a rift with Vojvoda.

""Unfortunately, it didn't happen the way I wanted,"" he said in an interview with Lance. ""There were some things, but it wasn't the way I envisioned, which is also part of football. I played very little, but I understood that the best way to respect the club was to move on to another challenge, because it hadn't worked out the way we expected. I still have the same respect for Vojvoda, even though we think about football in different ways.""

Luiz avoided the indignation of relegation by abandoning Fortaleza early, as they slumped to 18th in the table, but still made unwanted headlines due to off-field legal issues. The centre-back, who is engaged to long-time partner Bruna Loureiro, was accused of threatening a Brazilian social worker with whom he was alleged to be having an affair. Luiz denied all of the allegations, and Ceara police decided not to indict him after an investigation, as per Globo.

Luiz has found happiness again in Cyprus, and is on course to end his glittering career with a bang. Against all the odds, the Cypriot champions dispatched Maccabi Tel-Aviv, Dynamo Kyiv and Red Star Belgrade in Champions League qualifying to reach the league phase, and were rewarded with a dream fixtures against Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Juventus, Villarreal and Monaco, with fellow newcomers Kairat Almaty, Olympiacos and Slavia Prague completing their list of opponents. Luiz wasn't fit enough to play in qualifying, but he was present for the celebrations after the win over Red Star.

""Everybody was in ecstasy,"" Luiz told BBC Sport. ""Nobody expected us to be in the Champions League this season. I'm very happy to be here because I can see this feeling, with everybody's hunger, to do something great.""

He has since become a mainstay in Carcedo's team, aiding Pafos's latest tilt at the Cypriot title, but they have fallen short of greatness on Europe's elite stage. Pafos have only amassed six points from their opening six Champions League fixtures, losing 5-1 at home to Bayern and 2-0 away at Juventus. They were also held to disappointing stalemates on the road at Olympiacos and Kairat, but all hope is not lost just yet.

On matchday four, Pafos pulled off one of the upsets of the tournament, beating La Liga high-flyers Villarreal 1-0 at the Stelios Kyriakides Stadium, and followed that up with a hard-fought 2-2 draw against Monaco at the Stade Louis II. The Cypriot champions twice battled back from a deficit, and Luiz bagged the pick of the goals, brilliantly heading into the top corner after rising highest to meet an in-swinging set-piece.

That was his first Champions League goal since 2017, and made him the second-oldest scorer in the competition's history behind Real Madrid icon Pepe. Luiz has lost much of his mobility, but still has a penchant for the spectacular, and will be highly motivated to deliver more heroics against his old club, Chelsea.

""I'm going to play against Chelsea with my heart totally full of energy,"" he vowed to the BBC. Pafos can still make the knockouts if they get a positive result at the Bridge and in their final league-phase match against Slavia, and if Luiz is true to his word, anything is possible.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

EXCLUSIVE: The 2026 FIFA World Cup is less than five months away and the State Department is set to roll out a system for ticket holders who need visas.

The State Department will launch the FIFA Priority Appointment Schedule System (FIFA PASS), Fox News Digital learned on Tuesday. The system will give World Cup ticket holders the opportunity to access prioritized visa appointments before the event begins on June 11.

Prospective visa holders must be able to show that they qualify to obtain a visa and plan to follow the laws in the United States as well as leave the country once the tournament is over on July 19.

Scheduling the visa interview doesn't necessarily mean a visa will be issued. Each applicant will undergo security screening and proper vetting. They will have to demonstrate that they qualify for a visa.

The State Department will deploy 500 additional staff members to process applications.

President Donald Trump spoke about the FIFA Pass in November. He said the Departments of State and Homeland Security had been working ""tirelessly"" to ""ensure that soccer fans from all around the world are properly vetted and able to come to the United States next summer easily.""

""I've directed my administration to do everything within the power to make the 2026 World Cup an unprecedented success. I think it's going to be the greatest, and we are setting records on ticket sales,"" Trump said at the time.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino said the organization expected ""between 5 and 10 million people coming to America from… all over the world to enjoy the World Cup.""

""With this FIFA Pass, we can make sure that those who buy a ticket that are legitimate football fans, or soccer fans… they can come and attend the World Cup in the best conditions – starting from getting their visa and then coming, of course, in the country to enjoy,"" Infantino said in the Oval Office.

AFCON

Final Drama

Senegal won the Africa Cup of Nations for the second time in three editions Samah Zidan/Anadolu via Getty Images

Now the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) has finished, the 2026 World Cup is the next major international tournament on the horizon.

There will be a record nine African sides competing at this expanded 48-team competition — held across the United States, Canada and Mexico — and that figure could rise to 10 if the Democratic Republic of Congo beat Jamaica or New Caledonia in a one-off inter-confederation play-off final in March.

Eight of the nine African teams guaranteed to be at the World Cup took part in the latest edition of AFCON, with Ghana the exceptions. So what did we learn about them, and who could go the furthest once the tournament kicks off in June?

Here, we rank the African teams in order of their 2026 World Cup prospects.

Group I: With France, Norway, and one of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq

Senegal will be brimming with confidence after winning the African title in dramatic circumstances. They have now triumphed in two of the past three editions of AFCON, after also beating Egypt on penalties in 2021.

They will not fear anybody in their World Cup group. On their debut in that tournament in 2002, they beat then holders France in their opening group game. Under Aliou Cisse, they reached the round of 16 four years ago, where they were beaten 3-0 by England. They avenged that defeat with a 3-1 victory over Thomas Tuchel's side in a June 2025 friendly.

Due to the presence of Erling Haaland and Martin Odegaard within their ranks, some people might assume Norway will battle France for top spot in this section, but that would be extremely disrespectful towards Senegal. They should be setting their sights on the latter stages of this World Cup.

Group C: Brazil, Haiti, Scotland

The ramifications of host nation Morocco's defeat by Senegal in the AFCON final on Sunday are still unclear — multiple journalists called for head coach Walid Regragui to resign in its aftermath. When everything calms down, people may recognise the excellent job Regragui has done since he took charge in August 2022.

Morocco were agonisingly close to winning AFCON for the first time in 50 years, but Brahim Diaz's stoppage-time penalty was saved by Edouard Mendy. That he did not score should not prompt them to bin all of their plans.

What Morocco need to do is pick themselves up quickly and move on, because they arguably have a better squad now than at Qatar 2022, when they created history by becoming the first African side to reach a World Cup semi-final. Brahim is an attacking force and Achraf Hakimi is one of the best full-backs in the world game, while forwards Ismael Saibari and Abde Ezzalzouli have a lot of promise.

Brazil might look difficult opposition on paper, but they have only made it past the World Cup quarter-finals once — when they hosted the competition 12 years ago — since last winning it in 2002, and Morocco's performances over the past few years suggest they should have enough to beat both Scotland and Haiti.

Group A: Mexico, South Korea, UEFA play-off qualifier (Czech Republic, Denmark, North Macedonia or Republic of Ireland)

South Africa cruised through World Cup qualification, even though their group contained Nigeria, Africa Cup of Nations finalists two years ago, and they were docked three points for fielding an ineligible player in a game against Lesotho. But they then underperformed at AFCON and head coach Hugo Broos emerged as one of the tournament's villains after making several distasteful comments.

This side have improved steadily in almost five years under Broos' leadership, though, and are an entertaining watch when everything clicks. They have one of the strongest domestic leagues in Africa as their foundation. Lots of players in the squad represent either Mamelodi Sundowns or Orlando Pirates in that competition, and this familiarity is crucial due to the limited amount of time teams spend together during international tournaments.

This is South Africa's first appearance at the World Cup since hosting it in 2010, but a relatively kind group draw means they have a better chance of going further than continental rivals, who, on paper, possess better squads.

Group G: Iran, Belgium, New Zealand

Mohamed Salah has endured a difficult season so far with Liverpool and will turn 34 during this summer's World Cup, but he is still a star who can win games single-handedly. With him in the team, Egypt have a chance of reaching the World Cup's knockout stages.

Head coach Hossam Hassan has built his team around the attacking talents of Salah and Manchester City's Omar Marmoush. Egypt are happy to soak up pressure before tearing teams apart on the counter, and this approach took them to the AFCON semi-finals, where they lost to eventual winners Senegal and Salah's former Liverpool team-mate Sadio Mane.

Belgium stand out as the strongest team in the group, though they failed to make the knockout phase of the previous World Cup and their best players, including Kevin De Bruyne, Thibaut Courtois and Romelu Lukaku, are now all on the wrong side of 30.

Group J: Austria, Argentina, Jordan

Algeria will be returning to the World Cup after a 12-year absence. Vladimir Petkovic's side were ruthless throughout qualifying as they scored 24 goals in 10 games, won eight of them, and only lost once.

Riyad Mahrez turns 35 next month, so is coming towards the end of his career, but he is still this side's creative spark. The issue is that they might be overreliant on him. Wolfsburg winger Mohamed Amoura is exciting to watch and scored 10 goals in qualifying but he was anonymous in the recent knockout stages of AFCON as they lost to Nigeria in the quarter-finals.

Reigning world champions Argentina will be expected to win this group pretty comfortably, but Algeria should have a decent chance of taking sufficient points in the other two matches to reach the knockouts.

Group E: Germany, Ecuador, Curacao

Ivory Coast qualified for three World Cups in a row between 2006 and 2014 thanks to a talented generation of players that included Yaya Toure and Didier Drogba, but they never made it out of the group stage. This year's expanded 48-team version of this competition means they have a fantastic chance to reach the knockouts for the first time.

Emerse Fae became head coach in bizarre circumstances midway through the 2023 AFCON, which they went on to win. They reached the quarter-finals of this year's edition, as exciting youngsters Yan Diomande and Amad made their debuts at a major international tournament. That experience should prove invaluable in a tricky-looking group.

At the past two AFCONs, Ivory Coast have shown a habit of making silly mistakes under pressure. They need to grow out of this to avoid what would be a disappointing early World Cup exit.

Group L: England, Croatia, Panama

It is a little bit difficult to predict which version of Ghana will show up in the summer.

They were knocked out in embarrassing fashion at AFCON 2023 and failed to even qualify for this edition just ended. At the 2022 World Cup, they finished bottom of their group (though they did beat South Korea, who came second in their section) and appeared to be completely dependent on Mohammed Kudus to provide any attacking spark.

Under Otto Addo, who left as coach after that World Cup in Qatar but returned to the job in March 2024, Ghana were excellent throughout qualifying. They finished top of their group, winning eight of their 10 games.

Manchester City winger Antoine Semenyo has emerged as a genuine star who can take some of the pressure off Kudus. England will be favourites to win this section, which means Ghana's hopes of going far in the tournament probably depend on whether they beat Croatia in their final group match.

Group F: Netherlands, Japan, UEFA play-off qualifier (Albania, Poland, Sweden or Ukraine)

Tunisia have appeared at six World Cups but are yet to go beyond the group stage in any of them. In 2022, they beat defending champions and eventual finalists France 1-0 in their final game. Yes, France were through already and made several changes, but their starting XI still included Real Madrid pair Eduardo Camavinga and Aurelien Tchouameni, and Liverpool defender Ibrahima Konate.

Advertisement

They failed to impress at the recent AFCON, getting eliminated in the round of 16 by Mali in a penalty shootout, and have a difficult group this summer, so it is hard to see Tunisia making a strong impression.

Group H: Spain, Saudi Arabia, Uruguay

It is a remarkable achievement that Cape Verde qualified for this World Cup. The country is a collection of 10 islands off the coast of West Africa with a population of around 525,000. Yet they topped a group containing Cameroon, who had been at eight of the previous 11 editions of FIFA's showpiece event.

Cape Verde's success has been built upon smartly recruiting players who grew up in other countries, including the Netherlands, Portugal, France, and Ireland. When they beat Eswatini in October to secure qualification, the 25 players in the squad represented clubs in 15 different countries.

It will be daunting coming up against the European Championship holders, Spain, in their opening fixture, along with Uruguay and Saudi Arabia, but whatever happens, they will be considered heroes back home.

Group K: Portugal, Uzbekistan, Colombia

The Democratic Republic of Congo still need to beat either Jamaica or Oceania's New Caledonia in an inter-confederation play-off final in March to secure one of the last spots at the World Cup. Sebastien Desabre's side eliminated Nigeria in a tense penalty shootout in November's Confederation of African Football (CAF) play-offs to keep their hopes alive.

DR Congo have a fantastic blend of young players, including Sunderland's versatile midfielder Noah Sadiki, and the experience provided by Chancel Mbemba and Cedric Bakambu. They looked blunt in attack while making a round-of-16 exit from AFCON 2025, but that can partially be attributed to the absence of Newcastle United forward Yoane Wissa through injury.

The biggest concern for DR Congo will be the lack of preparation time if they do qualify.

A well-respected journalist has claimed that eight nations should “pause participation” in the 2026 World Cup after US President Donald Trump announced plans to impose fresh tariffs on eight European allies opposed to his proposed takeover of Greenland.

Ahead of the 2026 World Cup, it's fair to say Trump is causing controversy, which could impact fans' hopes of attending the tournament as well as the respective governments of the nations set to compete.

In June of 2025, the Trump administration announced full and partial travel bans on citizens of a combined 19 nations to protect “the United States from foreign terrorists and other national security and public safety threats”.

Several countries have since been added to the list, with World Cup participants Haiti and Iran currently under full restrictions, with Ivory Coast and Senegal under partial restrictions.

Advert

Since then, the Trump administration has announced an indefinite visa freeze on people from 75 countries, which would take effect on January 21.

The list includes World Cup participants such as Brazil, Colombia, and Egypt.

This led to fears from some fans that they could be turned away at the US border ahead of sporting events such as the 2026 World Cup and 2028 LA Olympics.

Advert

A US State Department official, who spoke to the Mirror, has since insisted that the “ban applies to the issuance of immigrant visas only, and does not apply to non-immigrant visas, such as those for tourists, athletes and their families, and media professionals intending to travel for the World Cup"".

However, sponsors and supporters will likely still be impacted by the visa freeze.

There have also been calls for the US to be stripped of the right to host the tournament due to the Trump administration's foreign policy, with the US taking military action in Venezuela and Nigeria, while also threatening action against Greenland, Mexico, Colombia, and Iran in recent weeks.

Trump has claimed that the US also “needs Greenland,” which is currently an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, and cited its strategic importance to the US.

On Saturday (January 17), Trump threatened European allies, including the UK, with 10 percent tariffs if a deal over Greenland is not reached.

Advert

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer described the move as “completely wrong”.

Also last week, 23 UK MPs from four parties – Labour, Liberal Democrats, Green Party, and Plaid Cymru – signed a motion in parliament calling on international sporting bodies to consider expelling the US from major international competitions, including the World Cup.

At this time, there is no suggestion that this could happen, although British journalist Piers Morgan has suggested that eight World Cup nations - England, France, Spain, Germany, Portugal, Netherlands, Norway, and Italy – should “pause participation” in the tournament as a way to “concentrate some minds”.

Durango-based company MODSTREET will be bringing its urban creations in the form of new bus platforms to MetLife Stadium in New Jersey for the FIFA World Cup Finals.

MODSTREET, which was founded in Durango in 2020 by Maggie Kavan and Michael Carrier, creates innovative urban structures like pedlets – sidewalk extensions that don't require asphalt or pavement construction made from steel and non-slip decking. It also makes bus shelters, outdoor kiosks and outdoor dining spaces – also called parklets.

Durango locals and visitors have inevitably seen – and likely walked on – many of MODSTREET's creations while in town.

MODSTREET was responsible for extending sidewalks on Main Avenue through the use of platforms without the ground having to be broken.

“We were able to give the city of Durango a product that enabled them to widen their sidewalks without committing millions of dollars to putting concrete out there and moving utilities,” said CEO Roger Zalneraitis.

Zalneraitis called the FIFA build MODSTREET's “largest project ever.”

The company is building 10 bus platforms at 1,300 square feet each that will be installed at the stadium for FIFA attendees coming in from the transit center, Zalneraitis said. The platforms must be built intricately and carefully, and align exactly with New Jersey zoning and accessibility regulations and the 35-page list of specifications given by the contracting company.

“It's a 13,000-square-foot project, and one reason the engineering firm liked (our product) was the modularity,” he said. “They see this as something that can relatively easily be stood up. It's a huge platform, right? But then (it can be) taken down, stored and then used again in the future.”

The building and shipping process for the platforms takes about six months, Zalneraitis said. The company began work on the project in December.

Zalneraitis called the FIFA project “something special.”

“What I'm proud of is realizing that this company that I help run is now doing something that's going to be on a global stage,” he said. “That's neat to think about. We're going to have literally tens of thousands of people tramping across this stuff, and it'll be great to see how it performs.”

A German politician has suggested that the German national team could boycott the 2026 World Cup, held in the United States, Canada and Mexico, “as a last resort in order to get [President Donald] Trump to see sense on the Greenland issue.”

Jürgen Hardt, who works as a spokesperson on foreign policy for the Christian Democratic Union party, made the claim on his own to BILD. He was not publicly backed by Sports Minister Christiane Schenderline, also from the CDU, who said that the German Football Federation (DFB) and FIFA, as ""the responsible associations,” should field inquiries. 

Germany, a prominent NATO member alongside Denmark, the nation to which Greenland belongs, has sent military personnel to the nordic island, alongside France and several other European nations. 

Trump, meanwhile, has increased his rhetoric on adding Greenland to the United States, suggesting that “we need Greenland for national security” and that he may impose stricter tariffs on nations “if they don't go along with [the plan for] Greenland.”

While speaking with BILD, Hardt also pointed out that Trump has made it evidently clear how “important the World Cup is to him,” and expressed that he has “confidence that we will reach a better common understanding within NATO regarding the Greenland issue.”

Polling conducted by BILD before Trump's latest threats revealed significant support for a German World Cup boycott, with 47% of Germans in favor and just 35% against if the U.S. took control of Greenland.

Germany qualified for the 2026 tournament after claiming the top spot in Group A of UEFA World Cup qualifying and will play against Curaçao, Côte d'Ivoire and Ecuador in the group stage, with those matches set to take place in Houston and East Rutherford, New Jersey, as well as Toronto, Canada. 

Hardt's concerns about the 2026 World Cup have not dampened excitement for the tournament in Germany. On Jan. 14, FIFA announced that it received over 500 million ticket requests for the tournament, with Germany ranking fourth among countries seeking entry to matches, only trailing the three host nations. 

However, no Germany group stage games were included in the most in-demand matchups, which included Mexico vs. South Korea, Mexico vs. South Africa, the Round of 32 match in Toronto and the World Cup final in New Jersey.

World Cup boycotts have not been common. However, Iran boycotted the 2026 World Cup draw on Dec. 5, 2025, citing visa restrictions for its officials.

Zohran Mamdani hosted a free viewing of the 2026 Africa Cup of Nations final at a city courthouse, and the soccer-loving Mayor has plans to organize more free watch parties during the FIFA World Cup.

It's not just the price of tickets: Another cost-related controversy swirling around the 2026 FIFA World Cup involves the tournament's official fan festivals and viewing parties.

New York/New Jersey is one of 16 host cities during this summer's tri-hosted World Cup in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, and our region made some form of history by becoming the first host to charge fans looking to attend an official World Cup ""Fan Festival.""

Meaning, you're not paying to attend a match, but instead shelling out $12.50 to stand in a crowd in a big public space to watch a live game broadcast on a big screen, with that price not inclusive of any food, drinks, or merchandise you might be compelled to buy while you're standing out in, say, Liberty State Park on a steamy summer afternoon.

The aforementioned Liberty State Park in Jersey City, New Jersey, plus the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing, Queens, and Rockefeller Center in Midtown Manhattan are the three official locations for FIFA-sanctioned fan events this summer.

Liberty State Park is already selling those $12.50 tickets for its Fan Festival, and the tennis center in Willets Point, Queens, is expected to soon do the same for the select group-stage watch parties scheduled to be held inside the 14,000-seat Louis Armstrong Stadium. According to Front Office Sports, the NY/NJ host committee ""should make several million dollars"" from selling Fan Festival admission.

In the other host cities across the United States, though, fan festivals are open to the public and free to attend. Philadelphia, for example, recently rolled out the details of their Fan Festival planned for Lemon Hill, with the city taking a minor victory lap on Twitter over the fact that their event is free while ""other cities"" charge for admission.

New York is one of those pay-to-Fan Fest cities, insult to injury considering the eight matches scheduled for MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, might be some of the toughest and most expensive tickets to get during the 2026 tournament, a tournament consistently and globally excoriated for its exorbitant ticket prices and convoluted, complicated process for acquiring tickets.

Local New York/New Jersey soccer fans priced out of matches and even Fan Festivals may have help on the way from Zohran Mamdani, New York City's new Mayor. 

The soccer-obsessed Arsenal FC fan turned Mayor hard-launched his own version of a big soccer viewing party for the final of the 2026 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), with Mayor Mamdani taking over Surrogate's Court on Chambers Street in lower Manhattan to host a viewing of the wild, drama-filled meeting between Morocco and Senegal on Sunday, January 18.

Clad in a suit with an Arsenal kit over his dress shirt and tie to show he's the ultimate Soccer Mayor, Mamdani enlisted familiar faces to New York City FC fans, The Cooligans, to serve as his event's emcees. The gathering and pulled together a good number of fans willing to spend hours together on a Sunday afternoon inside a historic circa-1907 courthouse to watch a champion of Africa be crowned.

While covering the event for The Guardian, Alexander Abnos wrote that Mamdani administration officials viewed the AFCON final viewing party as the first of ""many more watch parties for major soccer events, including this summer's World Cup."" According to The Guardian, the Mamdani administration is also ""investigating ways to make it easier for neighborhoods to put together their own gatherings."" 

The AFCON party will not, apparently, be a one-off, so it looks like the City of New York will become a consistent source of counter-programming to FIFA's fan events held during this summer's World Cup.

News of Mayor Mamdani-led soccer viewing parties shouldn't come as too much of a surprise to anyone who followed his statements about soccer and the upcoming World Cup during his mayoral campaign and during the early days of his time in office. 

Mamdani made the high cost of tickets to the World Cup, and the lack of any carve-outs giving fans in host cities like New York access to discounted tickets, an issue during his campaign, launching a whole ""Game Over Greed"" initiative that called on FIFA to, among other things, end the use of dynamic pricing, which allows ticket prices to soar for the most in-demand games like, say, the World Cup Final scheduled for July 19 at MetLife Stadium. Taking on the most expensive World Cup in history seemed to fit seamlessly into Mamdani's overall focus during his campaign on the high cost of living New York City residents face in their day-to-day lives.

While Mamdani campaigned on opposing FIFA's pricing choices, now early in his time in office, he's still talking about it.

On January 5, while signing three executive orders meant to crack down on ""junk fees"" tied to memberships, subscriptions, and ticket purchases, Mayor Mamdani again talked about dynamic pricing and the World Cup, saying ""I continue to voice my opposition to the use of dynamic pricing here for the soon-to-come World Cup and the necessity of it being a more affordable experience for all. And I look forward to the conversations, ones that have already begun, both internally and externally, in making that case.""

The Mayor says there are conversations to be had, but FIFA might take some serious convincing to budge on ticket pricing, since part of the agreement ""New York/New Jersey"" signed with FIFA to become a host city for the 2026 World Cup gives soccer's governing body full control over the stadiums and the tickets that get sold to put people in said stadiums for the tournament. 

Public pressure did get FIFA to exclude certain categories of tickets from dynamic pricing, and to make a very small percentage of tickets available for $60 and designated as being for ""Supporters"" of certain competing nations. 

Those are minor ticketing changes, and they're likely not going to be enough to get more local people easy access to any World Cup games held at MetLife Stadium, where ticket prices can range from $200 to $8,000 depending on the match and the category of ticket.

Since going in person will be a tall task for many, Fan Festivals and watch parties get a lot more relevant. FIFA doesn't appear to want to make those free or open access for all New Yorkers, but the city's new soccer-loving Mayor might just use the power of city government to get it done instead.

Dominik Szoboszlai has revealed he spoke to Mohamed Salah ""almost every day"" during the Africa Cup of Nations but refused to clarify the forward's future following his explosive interview about Arne Slot. The midfielder insisted the ongoing saga regarding the Egyptian's broken relationship with his head coach is strictly ""between the manager and the club,"" as uncertainty around the star's situation lingers.

Szoboszlai has offered a glimpse into his close relationship with Salah but stopped short of providing any clarity on the Egyptian's fractious relationship with Liverpool manager Slot. Salah, 33, recently sent shockwaves through Anfield with an explosive interview in which he claimed his relationship with the Dutch coach had ""broken down"". The comments have cast a long shadow over the club, fuelling intense speculation that the forward's time on Merseyside is drawing to a close.

Despite the outside noise, Szoboszlai confirmed that his personal bond with Salah remains as strong as ever. The Hungarian midfielder revealed that the two were in near-constant communication while Salah was away on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations. 

""Yes, to be honest, almost every day,"" Szoboszlai said when asked about the frequency of their contact since Salah departed on 15 December. ""We speak about everything. I'm following him, I guess he is following me. We talk a lot.""

However, when pressed for insight into whether Salah will remain a Liverpool player or how the internal conflict is being resolved, the 25-year-old remained diplomatic. ""That's between me and him,"" he stated firmly regarding their private conversations. ""He will come back and then we keep on going. It's the decision between the manager and the club."" It remains to be confirmed on Tuesday whether Salah will be included in the travelling squad for the crucial Champions League tie against Marseille, though he did train with his team-mates.

While the off-field drama dominates the headlines, Liverpool's on-pitch performances have underscored just how vital Salah remains to their sporting ambitions. Slot stated last week that he is ""happy"" to welcome the winger back into the fold, and Saturday's frustrating draw against Burnley provided a stark illustration of why. Despite dominating proceedings with 32 shots, the Reds could only find the net once, lacking the clinical edge that Salah has provided for nearly a decade.

Szoboszlai, who missed a penalty during the match, tried to take positives from the performance despite the dropped points. ""That's the first time we have played really well against a low block and created a lot of chances,"" the midfielder noted. ""We had loads of guys in the box, we had crosses and shots. That is what we have to aim for against Marseille.""

However, he acknowledged that the midweek European challenge will pose a different tactical question. ""They don't have a low block - they try to play from the back and we have to be ready for this too,"" he added.

It has been a testing period individually for Szoboszlai, who admitted to enduring a ""tough week"" following a high-profile error in the FA Cup. During the tie against Barnsley, the Hungarian attempted an audacious back-heel deep inside his own penalty area, a mistake that gifted a goal to the opposition. Barnsley manager Conor Hourihane subsequently accused Szoboszlai of being ""disrespectful,"" suggesting he would never have attempted such a trick against a top-tier opponent.

Szoboszlai vehemently denied the accusation, insisting his style of play does not change based on the calibre of the opposition. ""Personally, it's been a tough week,"" he confessed. ""I made a mistake against Barnsley but I have to make it clear it wasn't disrespectful and I would do the same against Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea.""

Explaining the mechanics of the error, he added: ""I didn't want to give it back to Giorgi [Mamardashvili]. I tried to pretend I was playing it back.""

The ""tough week"" was compounded by his penalty miss against Burnley - his second failure from the spot in 22 career attempts. Despite striking the crossbar, Szoboszlai remains confident in his ability to deputise, though he readily admits he will step aside the moment Salah returns to the pitch.

""The next one is in,"" he insisted defiantly. ""If he [Salah] comes back, he is the first penalty taker. He will give me some advice on what to think about when you miss as he's missed a couple of times but he forgets what has happened.""

Amidst the scrutiny of his form, Szoboszlai also dropped a significant update regarding his long-term future at Anfield. He revealed that talks are currently ongoing over a new contract, despite his current deal running until 2028.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The new men in charge at Newell's Old Boys have reiterated how it remains the club's “dream” to bring home-town hero Lionel Messi back to his native Argentina. Favio Orsi and Sergio Gomez have taken the reins in Rosario and are preparing for their first season at the helm. Messi will not form part of those plans, as he remains tied to MLS Cup winners Inter Miami, but an emotional return to his roots could be made at some stage.

Messi formed part of Newell's youth system prior to linking up with La Liga giants Barcelona while still in his teens. They agreed to cover his medical expenses at the time and put the South American playmaker on a path to superstardom.

Some 21 years were spent in Catalunya, shattering all kinds of records along the way, before heading to Paris Saint-Germain in 2021. After two seasons in France, Messi decided to chase the American dream when joining David Beckham in South Florida.

The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner has committed to a new contract with Inter Miami through 2028, taking him beyond his 40th birthday, but there has been no word on when he will look to retire.

That is keeping Newell's clinging to the belief that a prodigal son can be brought home. On that subject, head coach Orsi has told ESPN: “Everyone at Newell's, including us, thinks it would be wonderful if he had the chance to play for his club and in his city.” Gomez added: “It would be a dream not only for our fans, but for the whole country.”

Newell's are working towards another round of presidential votes, having narrowly avoided relegation in 2025. One of the candidates there, Guillermo Munoz, has spoken of his desire to get Messi on board.

He told TNT Sports: “First we have to see if Messi is eager to connect with Newell's.” He went on to say of long-running rumours, while pointing out that time and funds will not be wasted chasing an impossible dream: “I may really want Messi to come, but it's not enough to just say, 'someday, someday.' I see Messi and he makes me cry. But that doesn't mean he's above the club at all.”

Messi's fellow World Cup winner Diego Maradona did spend time with Newell's when returning to Argentina from a spell in Europe, while ex-Inter Miami and Barcelona boss Tata Martino also retraced steps to a club that he took in three spells with as a player.

Munoz added on Messi potentially treading a similar path: “One day, Maradona said: ‘I'm going to play in Newell's'. One day Tata Martino said: ‘I'm going to lend a hand in Newell's. Messi has no commitment or obligation to Newell's. But if he really wants to come, he'd have to say so.”

Argentine FA president Claudio Tapia, who witnessed Angel Di Maria's return to Rosario Central at 37 years of age, has told TNT Sports when asked if Messi will one day turn out in his homeland: “I hope so.”

Meanwhile, former Newell's boss Cristian Fabbiano told ESPN F90 back in April 2025 when asked if Messi could be snapped up, with a short-term contract agreement being mooted: “I hope Messi comes to play for just four months, whenever he wants. A tournament lasts that long, four months.”

Messi will not be making that move any time soon as he remains fully committed to Inter Miami for now. He enjoyed a memorable 2025 campaign with the Herons, helping them to a historic MLS Cup title and himself to Golden Boot and MVP honours.

The most decorated player of all-time intends to compete for more major honours in North America before considering another change of scenery. He has revealed that he and wife Antonela, along with their three sons, plan to move back to Barcelona once record-shattering boots have been hung up for the final time.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Raheem Sterling is reportedly ready to snub interest from Italian champions Napoli as he pushes for a move to a Premier League rival. The Chelsea outcast, who has been frozen out at Stamford Bridge, is desperate to remain in the capital for personal reasons and has identified Fulham as his preferred destination.

Sterling is prepared to turn down the opportunity to reinvigorate his career in Italy, despite strong interest from Napoli. The Serie A giants, currently managed by former Chelsea boss Antonio Conte, have identified the 31-year-old as a key target to bolster their attacking options. Napoli are currently sitting third in the Italian top flight, six points adrift of leaders Inter, and are looking for experienced reinforcements to help defend the Scudetto they won last season.

However, reports suggest that Sterling's priority is not chasing silverware abroad, but maintaining stability for his family in the UK. The England international, who has earned 82 caps for his country, is said to have no desire to uproot his life at this stage of his career. Consequently, he has set his sights on remaining in London, say Sky Sports.

This geographical preference has led Sterling to identify Fulham as his ideal landing spot. A move to Craven Cottage would represent the shortest possible relocation from Chelsea's Cobham training base, allowing him to stay in his current home. While West Ham have also been credited with an interest in the winger earlier in the window, the link to Fulham appears to be the most concrete pathway for Sterling to remain in the capital while escaping his Stamford Bridge nightmare.

While the player's preference is clear, the logistics of any potential deal remain incredibly complex. The primary stumbling block for any suitor - be it Fulham, West Ham, or a European giant - is Sterling's astronomical wage packet. The four-time Premier League winner currently earns a reported £325,000 a week at Chelsea, a figure that shatters the wage structure of almost every club outside the elite bracket.

Furthermore, a disagreement over the nature of the transfer is complicating matters. Having endured an ""entirely forgettable"" loan spell at Arsenal last season, where he failed to make a significant impact, Sterling is reportedly finished with temporary moves. He is pushing for a permanent transfer to settle his future once and for all. This stance creates friction in negotiations, as interested clubs are understandably hesitant to commit to a long-term contract and high wages for a player who turned 31 in December and has played zero minutes of football this season.

Chelsea are desperate to get Sterling's wages off their books, with his contract running until the end of the 2026-27 season. However, bridging the gap between Sterling's earnings and what a club like Fulham can afford will likely require a significant compromise from the player or a hefty payoff from the Blues.

The arrival of Liam Rosenior as Chelsea's new manager earlier this month briefly raised hopes that the ""bomb squad"" exiles might be reintegrated. However, despite Rosenior's diplomatic comments, there appears to be little chance of a reprieve for Sterling. The winger has been training away from the first team for months, with his last appearance for the club dating back to May 2024.

Speaking upon his arrival, Rosenior acknowledged the situation involving Sterling and fellow outcast Axel Disasi but stopped short of promising them a return to the fold. ""I will have conversations with them. We're in January, as you know,"" the new Blues boss stated. ""Raheem's had an outstanding career. I've got huge respect for him. Axel is someone I've really, really liked as a player for a long time.""

However, Rosenior emphasised that he has a ""list of priorities"" to work through, suggesting that rehabilitating frozen-out stars is not at the top of his agenda. With Chelsea fighting on multiple fronts including the Premier League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup and European competition, Rosenior's focus is squarely on the active squad he has inherited.

The current situation represents a remarkable fall from grace for a player who was once one of the first names on the team sheet for both Manchester City and England. Sterling's inactivity has seen his career effectively put on hold for the best part of a year. His stock has fallen significantly since his move to Stamford Bridge, and the lack of match fitness will be a concern for any potential buyer.

As the January window ticks down, the pressure is mounting on all parties to find a solution. Chelsea's home game Pafos in the Champions League on Wednesday night will be Rosenior's fourth game in charge in a fourth different competition, highlighting the relentless schedule the club faces. While his team-mates prepare for European action under the lights, Sterling remains in the shadows, hoping that Fulham or another London rival can construct a financial package that ends his exile before the deadline passes. Without a compromise, he faces the prospect of spending the next five months training alone, a scenario neither the player nor the club can afford to let happen.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Ballon d'Or 2026: Lionel Messi winning World Cup again would guarantee his 9th Golden Ball win as former Cristiano Ronaldo teammate left wowed by Inter Miami and Argentina captain's longevity","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/ballon-d-or-2026-lionel-messi-world-cup-guarantee-ninth-golden-ball-former-cristiano-ronaldo-team-mate-inter-miami-argentina/blt956d581eb0de959d","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:08:52 GMT","

World Cup winner Kleberson, who once played alongside Cristiano Ronaldo at Manchester United and in MLS, has explained to GOAL how Inter Miami superstar Lionel Messi can land himself a record extending ninth Ballon d'Or in 2026. The Argentine superstar is readying himself for another shot at global glory, which could put him in contention for Golden Ball recognition.

The most recent of Messi's eight Ballon d'Or triumphs was savoured in 2023. He was recognised as the best player on the planet a matter of months out from inspiring his country to World Cup immortality at Qatar 2022.

The South American GOAT starred across that tournament, delivering when it mattered most in the knockout stages, and was able to complete his historic medal collection on a memorable night in the Middle East.

Messi is expected to form part of Argentina's title defence, despite being yet to confirm his participation, and will have his sights locked on going back-to-back when the most prestigious of trophies come up for grabs.

He helped Inter Miami to an MLS Cup win, and himself to Golden Boot and MVP honours, in 2025 and has been showing no sign of slowing down. If he figures for the Albiceleste at FIFA's flagship event, then he will be determined to claim the ultimate prize.

Asked if that could lead to another Ballon d'Or being secured, 2002 World Cup winner Kleberson - speaking in association with BetVictor Online Casino - told GOAL: “Wow! That guy never stops! Argentina has more chance of winning the World Cup with Messi than any other country, just because Messi is still playing at a good level. 

“It's different from Ronaldo. He is still playing at a level, but the players around Ronaldo, it's not the same as Messi has with Argentina. It's purity. What Portuguese players have and Argentine players have is completely different. That's why Messi has a lot of chance. 

“If he goes and wins the World Cup, 100 per cent he's going to be up to win the Ballon d'Or again. He's brilliant. Even Brazilian players and fans look at him and want to see good players win the Ballon d'Or and the World Cup - players that are a joy to see play. Messi is one of those.”

While preparing to illuminate the international area, Messi has been doing that domestically since heading to the United States in 2023. More records have been broken there, with further additions being made to the most decorated roll of honour in professional football.

Kleberson once graced the MLS ranks himself, with the Philadelphia Union, and is delighted to see Messi building that brand.

Quizzed on whether more big names will follow Messi, Thomas Muller and Son Heung-min to North America in the years to come, Kleberson said: “I first went to MLS in 2013 when I went to play for the Philadelphia Union. At the time there had been [David] Beckham in LA and a few others. After that, more players started to come. A lot of players went to MLS. 

“The league has changed, they are competitive games and a good level. The thing that MLS has, it's entertainment. Games in America are all about entertainment, it's a show and a lot of stuff that happens around the football. Now they are bringing in players like Messi and other top players. They have put the league a little bit up in terms of reputation. 

“I believe more players are going to come. You can see now that more young players are going to MLS because they know the business is a little bit different there. A lot of clubs from Europe, from Brazil, start to get players from MLS. Look at how many American players are in the Premier League now, there's a lot of movement.”

Messi will be sticking around for a few years, with the evergreen 38-year-old committing to a new contract with Inter Miami that will take him through 2028. He will hope to secure more silverware in that time, while also making a big decision on when to call it a day as captain of Argentina - with his tallies of caps and goals at international level being taken to 196 and 115 respectively.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","How did David Luiz end up at Pafos? The story of Chelsea cult hero's surprise late-career foray in Cyprus ahead of return to Stamford Bridge in the Champions League","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/how-david-luiz-pafos-chelsea-cult-hero-surprise-late-career-cyprus-return-stamford-bridge-champions-league/blta0998bcb352a87e5","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 08:00:00 GMT","

Before last season, very few casual fans would have been aware of Pafos FC's existence. The Cypriot outfit played in Europe for the first time in their 11-year history, reaching the last 16 of the Conference League, and followed up that impressive run by clinching their maiden league title. The latter achievement earned Pafos a spot in the Champions League qualifying rounds, and helped attract one of the most famous footballers of his generation.

David Luiz joined the club at the start of August on a two-year contract, sealing his return to European football after four years back in his home country, Brazil. It was an unexpected late-career move for the 38-year-old, who Pafos described as a ""true titan of modern football"" in their official transfer announcement, and he is now looking forward to an even more unlikely homecoming at Chelsea.

Pafos will travel to Stamford Bridge to take on the Blues in the Champions League on Wednesday, and Luiz is sure to receive a hero's welcome if he is able to prove his fitness after suffering an injury at the weekend. The defender is a beloved figure among the Chelsea faithful, despite his move to London rivals Arsenal in 2019, having helped the club win six trophies, including the Premier League and Champions League, across two spells.

Regardless of the final result, it promises to be a memorable occasion for both Luiz and Pafos, whose rapid rise from complete anonymity to club football's elite stage has been nothing short of remarkable. Certainly, no one would have predicted it when AEK Kouklia and AEP Paphos initially merged to create Pafos FC back in 2014, and they were entered into Cyprus' second tier.

Pafos have been a fixture in the top-flight since being taken over by Russian businessman and former Portsmouth owner Roman Dubov in 2017, and have gone through a host of different managers, including Real Madrid icon Michel Salgado and ex-Manchester United man Henning Berg. But their real success began after the appointment of Juan Carlos Carcedo in 2023.

The Spanish coach, who once served as Unai Emery's assistant at Arsenal, delivered Pafos' first piece of silverware, the Cypriot Cup, in his debut season, and has since turned them into the country's No.1 team. With Luiz now helping to boost their profile even further, the future looks bright. However, one question lingers: how on earth did he end up at Pafos in the first place?

Luiz won the third FA Cup of his career at Arsenal, and became a key player early in Mikel Arteta's tenure, racking up 73 appearances across all competitions. However, a hamstring injury cut short his 2020-21 campaign, and the Gunners decided not to renew the then-34-year-old's contract, instead seeking to strengthen the heart of the defence with younger alternatives.

The former Benfica and Paris Saint-Germain star eventually found a new club in September 2021, with Flamengo snapping him up on a free transfer. Luiz turned down other offers to join the Brazilian giants, as he revealed at his presentation.

""I had a few different scenarios where I could have picked a quieter, more peaceful life, but I like to follow my heart,"" he explained. ""This is another big challenge in my life. I felt during my tour that this is what I always wanted, it gives me the air I breathe. If the voice of the people is the voice of God, then the country called out to me and here I am.""

In typical fashion, Luiz rose to that ""big challenge"", quickly nailing down a starting role despite his late-season arrival. Flamengo did, however, endure a heart-breaking end to the campaign, finishing second in the Brazilian Serie A before suffering a painful 2-1 defeat to Palmeiras after extra-time in the Copa Libertadores final, with Luiz playing the full 120 minutes.

Flamengo dropped to fifth in the league table the following season, but won the Copa do Brasil and went one better in the Copa Libertadores, beating Athletico Paranaense 1-0 in the final. Luiz was the driving force behind their success, and became only the 14th player ever to win the Copa Libertadores and Champions League, earning a contract extension in the process.

""Flamengo is the pinnacle of emotions! It's living life on the edge. Always wondering 'what's going to happen?' But it's also the fulfilment of most Brazilians,"" Luiz said in a subsequent interview with Globo Esporte. ""It's one of the best chapters of my life, one of the best things football has to offer. Did I imagine it? I don't know. Maybe I didn't imagine it would be so special and affect me as much as it does today. It gives me pleasure to say that it's a club that's in my heart!""

Luiz got the chance to compete in the Club World Cup again at the start of the 2023 campaign, as the 2022 tournament was pushed to February so it wouldn't clash with the international World Cup in Qatar. Flamengo failed to set up a blockbuster final clash with Real Madrid, though, falling to a shock 3-2 loss against Al-Hilal in the semis.

Disappointment ended up being the theme of their season as Flamengo fell short in all the major competitions, but Luiz did finally net his first goal for the club in a 3-2 league win over Bahia.

There were also real signs that Luiz's body was starting to fail him during the 2023 campaign. Indeed, he missed Flamengo's final 11 league fixtures after suffering a severely sprained ankle during the team's 2-0 win away at Cruzeiro, with a buggy used to safely transfer the ex-Chelsea star from the field as he broke down in tears. 

However, Flamengo still decided to renew Luiz's contract for one more year, and were vindicated in the early stages of the 2024 season. Luiz played a part in Flamengo's run to the Campeonato Carioca crown, and though persistent struggles with his ankle forced then-manager Tite to keep him on the bench for Flamengo's opening Serie A games, the veteran defender proved his worth upon returning to full fitness.

He was among the scorers in his first game back in the starting XI, a 6-1 league rout of Vasco da Gama, and it was a goal to put right up there with the very best of his career: Luiz pulled away from his marker during a corner delivery before firing a first-time volley into the net, prompting wild celebrations involving the majority of his team-mates. The superb strike capped a colossal overall display from Luiz, who also won five of his six aerial duels while posting a 95 percent pass completion rate.

Luiz became a regular again after that, but consistency proved elusive for Flamengo, and ex-Brazil boss Tite was sacked in September after they were knocked out of the Copa Libertadores by Penarol at the quarter-final stage. The club then turned to Filipe Luis, another former Chelsea star who finished his playing career at Flamengo - an appointment which spelled the beginning of the end for Luiz's spell at the Maracana.

Flamengo went on to win the Copa do Brasil again under Luis, but Luiz was an unused substitute in their semi-final victory over Corinthians, and only played one minute across the two legs of their final triumph against Atletico Mineiro. Luiz did start four of Flamengo's final league matches in 2024, but his Achilles was still causing him pain, which left the club in a bind regarding his future.

On December 22, 2024, Luiz's departure was officially announced on social media, but he did not take kindly to the news, claiming he had been blindsided in an explosive outburst to the press. 

""If I didn't have Instagram, social media, maybe I wouldn't even know today (about the non-renewal),"" he said. ""So, I think it wasn't good, and then I stop to think, there are only two ways: either it was intentional or it was amateurish.""

Luiz was only a free agent for a month, though. Fortaleza handed him a two-year deal at the end of the winter transfer window, prolonging his stay in the Brazilian top-flight. He was subsequently mobbed by fans upon his arrival, and said the club had ""captured my heart"", before immediately targeting silverware at the Ceara-based club. 

""The foundation is here. Everything is here. The cake is almost ready,"" Luiz said at his official unveiling. ""All that's missing is the whipped cream and the cherry on top.""

Fortaleza finished the 2024 Serie A season in fourth, just one place behind Flamengo, to qualify for the Copa Libertadores for the first time ever. They were not able to build on that success with Luiz on the books, though.

It quickly became obvious that Luiz was a club signing, not one that head coach Juan Pablo Vojvoda had pushed for, and he found himself in and out of the team, despite Fortaleza's form falling off a cliff. When Luiz picked up a thigh injury in early July, the writing was on the wall.

On August 1, the defender's contract was terminated by mutual consent, at which stage he had already reached an agreement to join Pafos. After the free transfer went through, Luiz explained why his seven-month spell at Fortaleza went so badly, hinting at a rift with Vojvoda.

""Unfortunately, it didn't happen the way I wanted,"" he said in an interview with Lance. ""There were some things, but it wasn't the way I envisioned, which is also part of football. I played very little, but I understood that the best way to respect the club was to move on to another challenge, because it hadn't worked out the way we expected. I still have the same respect for Vojvoda, even though we think about football in different ways.""

Luiz avoided the indignation of relegation by abandoning Fortaleza early, as they slumped to 18th in the table, but still made unwanted headlines due to off-field legal issues. The centre-back, who is engaged to long-time partner Bruna Loureiro, was accused of threatening a Brazilian social worker with whom he was alleged to be having an affair. Luiz denied all of the allegations, and Ceara police decided not to indict him after an investigation, as per Globo.

Luiz has found happiness again in Cyprus, and is on course to end his glittering career with a bang. Against all the odds, the Cypriot champions dispatched Maccabi Tel-Aviv, Dynamo Kyiv and Red Star Belgrade in Champions League qualifying to reach the league phase, and were rewarded with a dream fixtures against Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Juventus, Villarreal and Monaco, with fellow newcomers Kairat Almaty, Olympiacos and Slavia Prague completing their list of opponents. Luiz wasn't fit enough to play in qualifying, but he was present for the celebrations after the win over Red Star.

""Everybody was in ecstasy,"" Luiz told BBC Sport. ""Nobody expected us to be in the Champions League this season. I'm very happy to be here because I can see this feeling, with everybody's hunger, to do something great.""

He has since become a mainstay in Carcedo's team, aiding Pafos's latest tilt at the Cypriot title, but they have fallen short of greatness on Europe's elite stage. Pafos have only amassed six points from their opening six Champions League fixtures, losing 5-1 at home to Bayern and 2-0 away at Juventus. They were also held to disappointing stalemates on the road at Olympiacos and Kairat, but all hope is not lost just yet.

On matchday four, Pafos pulled off one of the upsets of the tournament, beating La Liga high-flyers Villarreal 1-0 at the Stelios Kyriakides Stadium, and followed that up with a hard-fought 2-2 draw against Monaco at the Stade Louis II. The Cypriot champions twice battled back from a deficit, and Luiz bagged the pick of the goals, brilliantly heading into the top corner after rising highest to meet an in-swinging set-piece.

That was his first Champions League goal since 2017, and made him the second-oldest scorer in the competition's history behind Real Madrid icon Pepe. Luiz has lost much of his mobility, but still has a penchant for the spectacular, and will be highly motivated to deliver more heroics against his old club, Chelsea.

""I'm going to play against Chelsea with my heart totally full of energy,"" he vowed to the BBC. Pafos can still make the knockouts if they get a positive result at the Bridge and in their final league-phase match against Slavia, and if Luiz is true to his word, anything is possible.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Ethan Nwaneri agrees loan transfer to Marseille for 'significant fee' as Arsenal teenager set to join Mason Greenwood & Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang at Orange Velodrome","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/ethan-nwaneri-agrees-loan-transfer-marseille-significant-fee-arsenal-teenager-join-mason-greenwood-pierre-emerick-aubameyang-velodrome/blt5c054faa74b40449","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:04:33 GMT","

Arsenal sensation Ethan Nwaneri is set to join Marseille on loan for the remainder of the season after the two clubs reached a full agreement on terms. The 18-year-old midfielder will link up with Roberto De Zerbi in Ligue 1, a move heavily influenced by Mikel Arteta to aid his development. The deal involves a substantial loan fee which could rise to roughly €4 million depending on playing time.

The French giants have agreed to cover the player's salary in full, alongside a loan fee that is described as ""sizeable"" for a six-month stint. Fabrizio Romano reports the total package could be worth around €4 million, but the agreement reportedly includes a clause where the loan fee reduces based on the number of appearances Nwaneri makes. 

Nwaneri is expected to travel to France imminently to undergo his medical and sign the paperwork. He is currently with the Arsenal squad for their Champions League clash against Inter, with the plan being for him to fly to Marseille potentially as early as Wednesday, immediately following the European fixture.

The decision to send one of the brightest talents from the Hale End academy to the south of France was not taken lightly, but it appears to have been driven by Arteta, according to The Athletic's David Ornstein. Reports indicate that the Arsenal manager personally advocated for the move, viewing De Zerbi's Marseille as the ideal finishing school for the teenager.

By sending Nwaneri to work under the Italian coach, Arsenal are ensuring that the player's development continues in a system that shares mirrors the demands he faces at the Emirates Stadium. Direct conversations reportedly took place between the two managers to outline the plans for Nwaneri's usage, with the Gunners hierarchy concluding that the Orange Velodrome offered the best pathway for his immediate growth compared to other potential suitors.

Arsenal have utilised the French league as a development ground with great success in the past, most notably with William Saliba. The French defender spent time on loan at Nice and then Marseille, where he won the Ligue 1 Young Player of the Year award, returning to Arsenal as a Premier League-ready starter. The Gunners will be hoping that Nwaneri can follow a similar trajectory, using the physicality and technical quality of Ligue 1 to bridge the gap between academy football and the Arsenal first team.

Nwaneri, who holds the record as the youngest-ever Premier League player, has outgrown youth football but has found minutes hard to come by in a title-chasing Arsenal side. A move to the Championship was mooted, but the technical level of Ligue 1 is viewed as a better fit for his specific skillset. At Marseille, he will be thrust into a high-pressure environment where results matter, playing in front of one of the most passionate and volatile fanbases in world football.

When Nwaneri arrives at the Orange Velodrome, he will not be the only player with Premier League connections in the dressing room. He is set to join a squad that already features former Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood and, perhaps most intriguingly, former Arsenal captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.

The presence of Aubameyang could provide Nwaneri with an unexpected mentor figure. Despite the nature of Aubameyang's exit from Arsenal, the veteran striker knows exactly what is required to succeed at the Emirates and understands the weight of the Arsenal shirt. Furthermore, playing alongside established attackers like Greenwood and Aubameyang will provide Nwaneri with elite movement to target with his creative passing.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Marin Cilic made a resounding start to his 2026 Australian Open Monday when he ousted Daniel Altmaier 6-0, 6-0, 7-6(3). Now 37 years old and No. 70 in the PIF ATP Rankings, the Croatian showed he is still plenty capable of producing lights-out tennis at an event where he reached the final in 2018.
When conducting his post-match media, Cilic shook hands with Denis Shapovalov, who even joked that 2019 or 2016 Marin Cilic was back. The former World No. 3 quipped it was 2014 Marin, the year he won the US Open. 
ATPTour.com caught up with Cilic about his game, traveling with family, the evolution of the sport and more.
Today you won the first two sets without losing a game. When you're playing well, it's very clear that your tennis is still right up there, so when you feel yourself playing like that, what goes through your mind?
For me, that level comes from the sensation in training. I see where I'm at, I see physically how well I was training in the whole 2025, especially in the offseason. I'm also obviously looking at what the other guys are doing, what their routines are, how I compare to them physically.
Obviously, my body is not the same as when I was 26 or 27. But still, I feel that I'm on a great level and it gives me great satisfaction that I'm still able to produce great tennis. That gives us and my team that feeling of excitement.

Your family is here in Melbourne, including your two sons, so now they've been to all four Grand Slam tournaments. To what extent are you still pushing so they get to experience all of this with you?
I am pushing myself first of all, because I have big support from the family. On the other side, they're able to travel, so that balance makes it easier. If they were at home, not traveling, and I am on the road, it doesn't work because it would break apart really, really quickly. I would miss home, they would miss me; it just doesn't work because the boys are already now six and four, it would be too much.

On the other side, they enjoy traveling, and I also feel that I have a really good position with my body, with my game. I think I can challenge myself in this season to see how far I can go. I added another team member to my team, Mate Delic, who was working with Borna Coric for a few years and also with Borna Gojo, so he's very knowledgeable. He was also a great player, we are really good friends. I'm also seeing that as another motivation to do better and to do well in this season.

Guys like Roger Federer, who you competed against, have been around Melbourne Park and you're still out there competing at such a high level. How rewarding is that for you?
It's beautiful because I still enjoy what I do. And then, obviously it's a reward because when I started young — when I was 15, 16 — I started with a really great work ethic, discipline, being professional, always having a full team with me, taking care of my body. I was planning the scheduling, planning the rest, peaking with the training. And when you add all these things for five, 10, 15 years, the body has rewarded me for another couple great seasons. I'm enjoying the fruits of that, so it's just fantastic.





How interesting is it for you to see how the game has changed from when you started with Roger and Rafa and how guys like Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are playing?
It's interesting how the game changed and I think it came out of nowhere, without sort of any influence from anybody. I think it came as well because of the Covid time…. If you would go and speak to Top 100 or Top 200 players on the Tour, the average racquet weight is, let's say, 305, 310 grams. And that was just impossible to see during the 2000s or 2010s in the past 10 or 20 years. Most of the guys were playing with the racquets which were 330, 340, 345 grams.

My own racquet, I would say is one of the heaviest on the Tour. And so this changed and the game then changed into power and speed. Everyone is athletically incredible. Everyone can hit the ball big, but it shifted a little bit of the game into this direction of ‘Who's going to hit bigger and harder? Who's going to be athletically incredible?' And then it took away a little bit of the intricacies of the game, playing cat and mouse,  just different styles of the game, which we had in these past 15 to 20 years.

Do you just focus on what you do, or do you craft your game again to evolve a little bit, to face these opponents?
You try to adapt, because obviously, the times have changed, and if you are waiting for the change to go back, you are in the wrong position. You have to adapt to what's going on, and adapt to what your needs are. It definitely has changed and so you have to really follow what is going on and try to do the best you can.

Some people might say they would love to play Roger or someone else in a match. You have played all of these guys from your time on Tour… If you could play one match, which opponent would be most intriguing to you?
There are a few incredible champions that shaped tennis when you look at back [at] the start of tennis [like] Rod Laver, how much he has achieved and how many Grand Slams he won at that time. He wasn't playing for six years [in them] because he was considered as a professional, and he definitely shaped the game.

Then Borg, McEnroe, Connors, guys that played after to the '90s [with] Sampras, Agassi, and all these guys. It would be just incredible to go back in time and play some with Borg or even Mats Wilander or Rod Laver.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","A lifetime of net-rushing opponents all adds up to Dimitrov being the 'Pass Master'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/scorecards-dimitrov-opponent-at-net-2025","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 01:33:07 GMT","

When opponents dared to move forward in 2025, Grigor Dimitrov made them suffer. The Bulgarian led the ATP Tour by winning 40.6 per cent of points when his opponent was at the net, a remarkable return rate that earned him a fitting label: the pass master.

That number speaks directly to Dimitrov's artistry. Armed with one of the game's most elegant one-handed backhands, he repeatedly carved out impossible angles, dipping the ball at an opponent's feet or threading it past outstretched volleys.

Dimitrov believes that success is rooted in years of experience dealing with aggressive opponents from a young age, having learned early how to neutralise players who rushed the net.

“When I was a junior, I was always playing against the older guys and [those] taller than me,” Dimitrov explained. “I was not that tall when I was younger, and a lot of them were coming to the net a lot, especially some of the American players when I played as they were always playing serve and volley or attacking me.

“So I always liked to have targets. I loved when some of it was coming through because I was fairly agile to move around the court and [could] predict some of the shots in advance, knowing where I'm going to position the ball in order to get [an easier] next ball coming back at me.”

 

It wasn't just about touch, either. Dimitrov stayed composed in high-pressure moments, trusting his timing and feel to find passing lanes when the court seemed closed off. In a sport where net-rushers often expect reward, he turned their aggression into opportunity. But how does he decide whether to hit an attempted winner or a shot intended to set up an easier pass on the next ball coming back?

“It's very difficult to know what you're going to do, because you just don't know,” Dimitrov said. “You have a split second to make a decision… So for me, I've always focussed most on the ball, because the ball gives me the information, and then hopefully I can make the right decision.”





Nowhere was that skill more evident than at Wimbledon, where Dimitrov's grass-court efficiency and shot-making gave even the very best trouble. In the fourth round, he surged to a two-sets-to-love lead against eventual champion Jannik Sinner, repeatedly neutralising the Italian's forward forays with clean passes and sharp angles. It was a performance brimming with control and creativity, cut short only by a heartbreaking pectoral injury that forced his retirement.

That blend of flair and resilience defined Dimitrov's season. The former No. 3 player in the PIF ATP Rankings and Nitto ATP Finals winner also reached the semi-finals at the ATP Masters 1000 in Miami, another week in which his ability to absorb pressure and counterpunch with precision stood out against the Tour's elite.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Mario Ancic on Michael Zheng: 'It's exceptional what he's doing'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/ancic-zheng-australian-open-2026-feature","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:13:07 GMT","

One of the best stories of the Australian Open has been the breakthrough of Michael Zheng, the Columbia University senior who qualified for his first major main draw before upsetting Sebastian Korda to reach the second round.

The 21-year-old is not the only person who has a connection with both Columbia and the ATP Tour. Mario Ancic, the former No. 7 player in the PIF ATP Rankings who stunned Roger Federer at Wimbledon in 2002 and made the semi-finals two years later, attended Columbia Law School and graduated in 2015. 

The Croatian remains based in New York as a Principal at the private equity company One Equity Partners. The 41-year-old follows the Columbia tennis team closely and over the years and has gotten to know its players, including Zheng.

“I think it's exceptional what he's doing, and he's a very humble person, very humble kid,” Ancic told ATPTour.com. “What all these guys are doing: Going to classes — very intense — competing amongst the best and the brightest in the country and internationally, and then still committing to being part of the programme that's Top 10 in the country is nothing short of inspirational.” 

Ancic is in close contact with head coach Howard Endelman and heard about Zheng before he even began playing for the Ivy League institution. In 2022, Zheng reached the Wimbledon boys' singles final.

“He came heavily recruited. I believe he already had some great results in junior Grand Slams and I was very excited to see that somebody with a lot of success already at ITF [level] committed to come to play for Columbia,” Ancic said. “I actually remember him since he was a freshman. We talked, I met his family. He has a great family behind him and it was obviously very exciting to speak to him and play with him and see his success since.” 

Ancic always thought the two-time NCAA singles champion had a great game entering college, and got the sense that Zheng was a hard worker who was very committed.

“He never rushed anything. I see a lot of junior players are like, ‘I've got to be on ATP, I've got to do this, I've got to do that'. He took time to develop his game,” Ancic said. “I think he developed physically, which is always very important.”

The Croatian pointed to Zheng's work to become stronger and add muscle with the help of the Columbia coaching staff as important to his development as a player. 

“I think that helped him also to develop some bigger shots and more weapons. His questions were always, ‘What do I need to do so I can compete with professionals?'” Ancic said. “I've seen him develop that game, develop bigger shots, a bigger game that can effectively help him ‘hurt' other players with some bigger weapons. And I think that's a testament to him, his family, and the programme.”

Not only does Ancic understand the tennis side of what Zheng is going through, but he is one of few who can put his feet in his fellow Lion's academic shoes. Not only has Zheng been training hard to improve on the tennis court, but he has done so while shining in the classroom.

“It's a commitment. You live in New York. They have classes, they live on campus. It's on 116th Street, and the tennis courts are on 218th Street. So it's not like everything is just there. You have to commute,” Ancic said. “New York is not the easiest city to commute [in], so the days are long. I know the guys… the team would be studying past midnight, early mornings, getting ready for classes, but still fully committed to do their best at the tennis court.

“Commuting back and forth between the tennis centre and the campus, and just going through the rigorous academic program is just something that is remarkable and what Michael was able to achieve to play at that level going through this programme and just representing the Lions in the best possible ways, it just makes us all very proud.”





Ancic understands what it takes to succeed on and off the court. When a player who beat Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray glows about someone like he did about Zheng — who next faces Corentin Moutet in Melbourne — it speaks volumes.

“He's always had a great demeanour about him, believing in himself and always giving his best, fighting. You always knew with Michael that he's going to give it all on the court. That's just something that always resonated with me when I was watching,” Ancic said. “This kid is a true example of a student-athlete. He's committed to the programme, he's committed to the classes, and he's committed to the team in a sense that every time I watch him play, he always would give 100 per cent.

“Of course, when you have that mentality, there's many times in a tennis match where you have this opportunity to win them. If you are stable, if you are mentally strong, opportunities arise in a tennis match. He always had that talent within himself.” 

Did You Know?

Another Croatian, former World No. 3 Marin Cilic, watched 30 minutes of Zheng's opening win against Korda. Cilic said about the college star: “Really, really interesting. A player [who] has got a very diverse game. There are a lot of things that he does well. You still see that it's a work in progress, that let's say if he works himself the next two, three, four years, that he can definitely develop into a great player. What I loved about [him] was [he was] playing for the first time in a Grand Slam, playing a guy, Sebastian, who is a fantastic player, and having such incredible composure and also a physical ability and mental ability to stay and to win in five.”

Naomi Osaka made an iconic entrance to Rod Laver Arena on Tuesday night with an outfit that incorporated a veil, a parasol and a gigantic, butterfly-emblazoned hat.

Parasol? Check. Veil? Check. Gigantic hat decorated with a butterfly and worn low over the eyes à la Beyoncé in the singer's ""Formation"" video? Check. Naomi Osaka, the No. 17-ranked player on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, made a diva-worthy entrance to the Rod Laver Arena for her first-round match against Antonia Ruzic, turning her entrance on to court into a high-fashion catwalk.

Another cultural reference point seemed to be Gunna's 2024 album ""One Of Wun,"" whose cover featured a painting of the rapper veiled in a floral headscarf by artist Calvin Clausell Jr. ""WUN OF ONE,"" Osaka captioned an Instagram post which went up shortly after her match began. 

After the match, though, Osaka revealed that the inspiration behind the outfit was not pop culture, but nature. Designed in collaboration with Robert Wun, it had been modeled after a jellyfish. The butterfly accoutrements had been a reference to Osaka's 2021 Australian Open title run, during which a butterfly had landed on Osaka in her third-round match against Ons Jabeur.

""Honestly it came together quite beautifully,"" she said, ""because I didn't know what to expect when I arrived here. Then it just felt like everywhere I looked, the theme was water. Obviously the walkout was like, you see oceans and waves. I thought that it was really beautiful. Really amazing coincidence.""

After the match, the 28-year-old revealed that the grand entrance was planned well ahead of time, and required some logistical legwork to ensure that it was properly executed. 

""This is definitely months [of] planning,"" the four-time Grand Slam champion said. ""Obviously you kind of have to prep for this. You also have to see the design, see if it works, see if you can walk. The scariest thing for me was I didn't know if the umbrella could fit in the tunnel. I did, low key, hit a couple of the little boards. I think it worked.""

In her tour-level debut, Oleksandra Oliynykova gave defending champion Madison Keys a scare on Rod Laver Arena in the Australian Open first round. But behind the smiles and the hot shots, the Ukrainian is motivated by a more serious message.

MELBOURNE, Australia -- Oleksandra Oliynykova's first words on entering the Melbourne Park interview room after her Rod Laver Arena showdown with defending champion Madison Keys were: ""I'm so happy to be here.""

They encapsulated the attitude the 25-year-old Ukrainian had shown on court. Oliynykova hadn't pulled off the win, though she had held a 4-0 first-set lead and two set points over Keys before falling 7-6(6), 6-1. But few underdogs have embodied the idea of embracing the moment quite like the World No. 92, who was not just making her Grand Slam debut but playing her first-career match on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz.

""It's the best experience in my career,"" Oliynykova told press. ""I never played before -- actually, I never played even 250 main draw, and I never played on a big arena. To get this experience, it's something that I'll remember for the end of my life.""

Oliynykova won the crowd over -- and, for a set, flummoxed Keys -- with her game, all dogged defense and creative variety. When she went up a double break with one of the best points of the match, retrieving the American's hardest strikes before slotting an angled pass past her, an unlikely upset seemed to be brewing.

But even as Keys worked out the puzzle, settled her nerves and reeled her opponent in, nothing could stop Oliynykova from relishing her experience. She frequently clapped Keys' clutch winners and aces, and approached the net after the match with a broad smile on her face.

No wonder that Keys also applauded Oliynykova after their hug, and opened her on-court interview by praising her as a ""great competitor"" -- a moment that only broadened the smile of Oliynykova, who was still signing autographs by the side of the court.

""I think it's not always about winning or losing,"" Oliynykova said. ""It's not good in the sport that we are putting too much pressure on the athlete depending only the results, because when you are playing great tennis, you are playing against great opponents, you see high sportsmanship from both sides, you see very kind fans who are cheering for both.

""We need to enjoy this moment. I cannot be disappointed, because for me, I try to see sport more than just result. It's also something what's motivating me, because actually, if I will be thinking only about the result and that's it, I think I wouldn't be on this level. Because it's, for me, the whole experience. It's more important.""

A post shared by Australian Open (@australianopen)

Behind Oliynykova's smile and sunny demeanor, complete with temporary flower tattoos on her face, her motivation is a more serious one. In 2011, when she was 10 years old, her family fled Ukraine for Croatia as political refugees after protesting against Viktor Yanukovych's pro-Russian government.

They've now returned to their homeland. Oliynykova lives and trains in Kyiv, while her father and coach, Denis, serves on the frontline in the Ukrainian army. Oliynykova now travels solo -- in contrast to Keys' entourage, her player box was empty on Tuesday -- and sees it as her mission to represent Ukraine on the world stage and to remind the world that war is still taking its toll on the country.

""There was a couple of massive attacks [on the] last night I spent in Ukraine before the trip here,"" Oliynykova said. ""There was explosion just near my home, and a drone hit the home just across the road. My apartment was literally shaking because of the explosion.

""Every competition is important, every opportunity to say something about Ukraine. Because it's sad, because this war is very long, and I think people are losing the attention after so many years. But now in Ukraine we don't have electricity. In my apartment, I have no electricity, no water, no heat. That's what's going on. Every opportunity to say about this, I believe it's very important.""

Indeed, Oliynykova says that her father joining the military was the catalyst for her rise up the rankings -- just eight months ago, she was ranked No. 274; since then, she's broken into the Top 100 after winning three WTA 125 titles in Tolentino, Tucuman and Colina. She describes him as her ""biggest support since my childhood in everything,"" and that he dreamed of one day seeing Oliynykova play on courts like Rod Laver Arena.

Denis Oliynykov wasn't able to be there in person this time, but he was watching from Ukraine -- and the message he sent his daughter might have been the most special moment of a special day.

""He told me that it was amazing match,"" Oliynykova said. ""And yeah, I made his dream come true in such a situation. What could be more? What could be biggest motivation? I cannot imagine this.""

After turning heads with a glamorous walk-on outfit, Naomi Osaka had to battle hard to escape Antonia Ruzic in three sets in the Australian Open first round.

Naomi Osaka's arrival to the Rod Laver Arena on Tuesday night was all glamoUr, but her performance needed to be all grit. The No. 16 seed needed 2 hours and 22 minutes to quell the challenge of Croatia's Antonia Ruzic 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 after coming from a break down in the third set.

Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play

The four-time major champion had made a statement entrance in an outfit incorporating a parasol, a veil, a train and a butterfly-bedecked fascinator. It was modeled after a jellyfish, she revealed in her on-court interview, and the butterflies referenced her 2021 title run in Melbourne.

But Ruzic -- who was celebrating her 23rd birthday -- was in no mood to be overshadowed on court. Though she was making her Australian Open debut, and competing in just her second Grand Slam main draw, the Zagreb native was high on confidence -- last week, she made her first WTA semifinal in Hobart, pushing her up to a career high ranking of No. 65.

Ruzic went toe-to-toe with Osaka throughout, matching the Japanese player's shotmaking from the baseline as she overturned a 2-0 deficit to lead 4-3 with a break in the decider. With her back to the wall, Osaka needed to find another gear -- and at the last minute, she did, rattling off 12 of the last 15 points to escape with victory.

""I thought my level was pretty good,"" Osaka said after the match. ""If she's playing at a level that's higher than mine the entire time, then she deserves to win. Obviously I don't want that to happen. But if it does, then it's out of my hands because I'm literally doing the best that I can.

""I tried to change it up a little. I know she had a really good backhand. I tried to hit more to her forehand. I tried to be a little bit more solid, then kind of accelerate when I could.""

Ruzic's baseline brilliance: As befitting someone with the confidence to pull off that outfit, Osaka made a lightning-fast start, dropping just three points in the first three games. But once Ruzic settled, she showed that she could live with Osaka's pace off the ground, particularly if she was able to survive the former World No. 1's first strike -- and she had more than enough firepower of her own, particularly with her forehand down the line, to end points on her terms.

Osaka had the edge in shorter exchanges, winning 62 of the points that lasted four shots or fewer compared to Ruzic's 47. But once the rally went to five shots, it was Ruzic who had the slight advantage, winning 45 of those points to Osaka's 40. And the fact that she was able to extend points to that length on 85 occasions -- invariably high-octane, crowd-pleasing tussles -- was itself evidence of her impact on the match.

Osaka's last-minute escalation: Ruzic also showed impressive fortitude at the start of the third set, fending off three points to go down 3-0 and another one to go down 3-1. Emerging from a sequence of tight games, she broke for 4-3 as Osaka sent a backhand wide.

But Ruzic wobbled, and Osaka stepped up to break back. With the match poised at 4-4, Osaka fired four straight unreturned serves, including two clean aces, each punctuated by a cry of ""c'mon!"". Ruzic's forehand, which had been so lethal for much of the match, let her down badly in the final game with three unforced errors from that wing. Osaka was quick to sense her chance, and slammed a brilliant backhand winner to convert her first match point.

""Honestly it was kind of fun to trade backhands,"" Osaka said. ""The last person that I played that had a really good backhand beat me. I hope that I learned from this match, too.""

Osaka will next face Sorana Cirstea, who came from a set down to defeat Eva Lys 3-6, 6-4, 6-3.

Janice Tjen and Tereza Valentova opened Day 3 of the Australian Open with a pair of upsets over seeded players to reach the second round. Valentova first took out Maya Joint in straight sets, a feat matched by Tjen when she defeated Leylah Fernandez moments later.

For the second straight Grand Slam, Janice Tjen has taken out a seeded opponent in the opening round.

Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Tjen upset No. 22 seed Leylah Fernandez 6-2, 7-6 (1) in 1 hour and 43 minutes on a hot, sunny Tuesday afternoon in Melbourne to reach the second round -- just months after knocking off No. 24 seed Veronika Kudermetova to open her US Open campaign.

Her win was one of several surprises from players on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz to kick off Day 3 of the Australian Open. Moments before Tjen closed out her match at ANZ Arena, Tereza Valentova delivered a stunner of her own, defeating No. 30 seed and Australian No. 1 Maya Joint 6-4, 6-4 in 1 hour and 32 minutes at John Cain Arena for the third Grand Slam main-draw victory of her career.

For Tjen, it's the second Grand Slam win of her career and her first at the Australian Open in her tournament debut. She's the first Indonesian player to win an Australian Open main-draw match since Yayuk Basuki in 1998. Basuki went on to reach the fourth round that year.

“I'm very happy to be a part of history and be able to get a win here for Indonesia,” Tjen said in her post-match press conference. “I think it was special, especially being able to do it in front of my family here.

“They're here, and I think there were a lot of Indonesians, and a lot of my close friends are also here.”

She earned the victory behind an impenetrable first serve, particularly in the opening set, when she won 100% of her first-serve points. That steadiness kept her level through four games before she broke for 3-2 and closed the set by winning the last four games.

Things went from good to better in the second set, when she broke first for a 2-1 lead, but the finish was anything but straightforward. Fernandez mounted multiple comeback attempts, breaking back, getting broken again, and breaking once more when Tjen served for the match. After Fernandez held for 6-5, Tjen pushed through a tight service game to force a tiebreak.

From there, she sprinted away, winning the first three points and six of the first seven to earn a handful of match points. She needed only one, completing the upset with an exclamation point.

Your moment, Janice ✨Tjen defeats the No.22 seed Fernandez in straight sets 🙌@wwos • @espn • @tntsports • @wowowtennis • #AO26 pic.twitter.com/cCjKd5dmzT

The win sets up a second-round meeting with former World No. 1 Karolina Pliskova.

It's safe to say Valentova won't be on many Aussie fans' Christmas card lists after defeating Joint.

The 19-year-old Aussie entered the tournament with plenty of buzz, seeded at a major for the first time in her career, but she found herself under pressure throughout the entirety of the match against her fellow teenager.

Valentova generated a remarkable 17 break points across two sets. And while the 18-year-old converted just five, it proved enough to reach the second round of a Grand Slam for the third time in her career, having done so last year at Roland Garros and the US Open.

It's another in a rapid string of firsts for Valentova.

“It feels amazing,” she said in her on-court interview. “I didn't expect that last year at the beginning of the year. I was playing at the ITF tournaments and now I'm in the main draw here in Melbourne. So yeah, it feels amazing, and to play in front of that crowd and in this stadium, is amazing.”

The crowd was heavily tilted toward Joint, but Valentova seemed to feed off the energy. She broke in the opening game of the match, and after Joint broke back not once but twice, she refused to waver. The Czech kept attacking, landing the decisive blow in the first set when she broke for 5-4 and served it out the following game.

She then fell behind 2-0 in the second set before rattling off four straight games to regain control of the match, which she would never relinquish. Meanwhile, Joint couldn't overcome her serving woes, finishing with eight double faults, many at critical moments.

For Valentova, the win sets up a second-round match against qualifier and compatriot Linda Fruhvirtova, who defeated Lulu Sun in the opening round.

Things are heating up Down Under as World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka kicks off the action, with Coco Gauff, Mirra Andreeva, and Victoria Mboko all fighting for third-round spots in a packed Day 4 schedule.

Sixty-four WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz matches are in the books and already surprises abound. Four seeds from the top half of the draw are out -- and four qualifiers are through to the second round.

Elsa Jacquemot of France displayed some serious stamina to take out No. 20 Marta Kostyuk in the first women's triple tiebreak in the Open era at the Australian Open. Jacquemot was down a set and 5-3, saved a match point and prevailed in 3 hours, 31 minutes.

Turkey's Zeynep Sonmez was a three-set winner over No. 11 Ekaterina Alexandrova and was joined by fellow qualifiers Storm Hunter, Linda Klimovicova and Zhuoxuan Bai.

We can't wait for Wednesday's second round, which includes four Top 10 seeds:

No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka vs. Zhuoxuan Bai

Head-to-head: 0-0

No woman has been more consistent than Sabalenka in majors over the past three years. She's played in 11 of them, winning four titles, losing three finals, three semifinals and one quarterfinal (2024 Roland Garros).

How has she maintained that sort of upset-proof play in the biggest tournaments?

“Maybe because I'm not really thinking about that,” Sabalenka said. “I'm just taking one step at a time. I'm trying to be as present as possible and always thinking on improving myself as a player and a person. I think that's why I was able to be really consistent on court.”

Sabalenka was a 6-4, 6-1 winner over wild card Tiantsoa Rakotomanga Rajaonah in the first round, and now she faces another upstart -- Bai, a 23-year-old from China ranked No. 702.

No. 3 Coco Gauff vs. Olga Danilovic

Head-to-head: 0-0

Gauff, a 6-2, 6-3 winner over Kamilla Rakhimova, has won four of her first five matches this year, including a definitive win over World No. 2 Iga Swiatek in United Cup play.

Meanwhile, Danilovic came back from a set down to defeat venerable Venus Williams. Gauff is aware of the No. 69-ranked Serbian's capabilities.

“I remember she beat Jess [Pegula] I think it was two years ago and obviously had a good match last night,” Gauff said. “It's going to be a tough match. I think she's a talented player. Not often I get to play a lefty. It will be tough.”

Round 2 confirmed ✅Coco Gauff defeats Rakhimova in straight sets on a sunny Day 2 in Melbourne ☀️ pic.twitter.com/5MdPOPyo27

No. 7 Jasmine Paolini vs. Magdalena Frech

Head-to-head: 0-0

Paolini is the only Top 10 singles player also competing here in doubles. She and Sara Errani -- who also, uh, doubles as one of her coaches -- are the No. 2 seeds, behind Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend.

“I like to play doubles and I think, you know, it can help me to stay in the competition,” Paolini said. “Also to share the court with Sara is great.”

Paolini breezed past qualifier Aliaksandra Sasnovich 6-1, 6-2, while Frech was a 6-1, 6-1 winner over Veronika Erjavec.

No. 8 Mirra Andreeva vs. Maria Sakkari

Head-to-head: 0-0

This one could be fun, for Sakkari is showing early signs she might be returning to the form that brought her to a pair of Indian Wells finals and three year-end Top 10 finishes. Sakkari, staging a Greek revival at 30, beat both Naomi Osaka and Emma Raducanu at the United Cup.

She credits tweaks to her serve and forehand under the guidance of coach Tom Hill. You could see that in her 6-4, 6-2 win over Leolia Jeanjean.

Andreeva, the champion in Adelaide, will be a tough out. She fought off Donna Vekic 4-6, 6-3, 6-0 in a testing first-round match and is eager to put together another run like last year's back-to-back titles in Dubai and Doha.

No. 17 Victoria Mboko vs. Caty McNally

Head-to-head: 1-0, McNally, 2024 Austin

Mboko looked tired in the Adelaide final after earlier playing three consecutive matches, but the Canadian teenager scored a crisp 6-4, 6-1 win here over Australian wild card Emerson Jones.

“I felt pretty good on court today,” Mboko told reporters. “I didn't feel too super tired. Mentally I just wanted to put in my head that it's a continuation of the tournament and not really think too much of having to sort of have a brand-new week, brand-new everything.”

McNally was a 6-3, 6-1 winner over qualifier Himeno Sakatsume.

No. 19 Karolina Muchova vs. Alycia Parks

Head-to-head: 1-0, Parks, 2025 Roland Garros first round

Muchova started the season quickly by beating Top 10 players Alexandrova and Elena Rybakina in Brisbane before falling to Sabalenka in the semifinals. She dispatched Jaqueline Cristian in straight sets.

Parks overcame Alexandra Eala and her contingent of supportive fans with a 0-6, 6-3, 6-2 victory. Parks, ranked No. 99, is a go-for-it player; against Eala, she had 12 aces and 10 double faults.

No. 28 Emma Raducanu vs. Anastasia Potapova

Head-to-head: 0-0

Raducanu advanced with a 6-4, 6-1 win over Mananchaya Sawangkaew, while Potapova was pushed by Suzan Lamens 3-6, 7-5, 6-2.

Following her arrival to court for her first round against Antonia Ruzic, Osaka dispensed with the hat and pants and traded them for a warm-up jacket to match her dress, the tie-dye seafoam top accentuated by frilly appliques along the sleeves.""I just feel like I want to do things that, like, create joy and happiness,"" Osaka said after defeating Ruzic in three sets.""For me, obviously I really love fashion.

Djokovic had never played Martinez before, but it looked like he knew exactly what to do from start to finish on Monday night, breaking the No. 71-ranked Spaniard in his opening service game and riding that break to the first set. He then stepped on the gas, breaking twice in each of the next two sets to cruise to victory after exactly two hours on court.The numbers told the story—Djokovic had more than twice as many winners as errors, 49 to 21, including 14 aces to no double faults.And not only did he never face a break point in 13 service games, he never even lost more than one point in any of his service games—he held eight times at love and five times at 15, and that was it.It's now been 20 years since Djokovic last lost in the first round of a major, to American Paul Goldstein at the 2006 Australian Open.

Madison Keys may have made a winning start to her Australian Open title defense on Tuesday in Melbourne, but her beaten opponent, tattooed Ukrainian Oleksandra Oliynykova, made a lasting impression in more ways then one.Listless to start her title defense, Keys hit 15 unforced errors in the first four games to trail 4-0 against a player who was making not just her Grand Slam main-draw debut but her WTA tour-level debut. While Keys reined it in from there, to the tune of five straight games, she later found her range again just in time to stave off becoming the second defending champion to lose her first match the next year in the Open Era. Down 6-4 in the tiebreaker, the No. 9 seed hammered four straight winners to steal the set on her way to a 7-6(6), 6-1 win.""I had been thinking of that moment for basically a year,"" Keys confessed in her on-court interview. ""Obviously, [I was] very nervous at the start.""I was talking to Lindsay Davenport yesterday and she reminded me that not many people get to be a defending champion at a Grand Slam, so just try to embrace it and enjoy it. As nervous as I was at the start, I'm really glad to be back and that I got through that match.""But Keys' nerves weren't all she needed to overcome inside Rod Laver Arena. World No. 92 Oliynykova showed no signs of being over-awed by the occasion, and turned the early games into a chess match.

Recognizing Keys' inconsistencies and nerves, she kept the American guessing with a mix of paces and slices, and her defense-first playing style frustrated Keys into over-hitting. After the one hour and 40-minute match, Keys saluted Oliynykova's effort, as the Ukrainian milled about courtside for the duration of Keys' on-court interview, signing autographs and posing for selfies.""First of all, my opponent today was incredible,"" Keys said. ""She served so well and is such a great competitor, Definitely she made it tricky for me. Just being able to settle a little bit, find my way, trust myself and go after my shots.

The changes of pace, the higher balls, the slice ... she's also super fast and got to a lot of balls, and made me work myself out on the other side of the net today, which I was able to do.""

MELBOURNE, Australia—With each milestone Janice Tjen earns, the rising Indonesian star makes a little bit of history.The 23-year-old became the first from her country to win an Australian Open main-draw match in 28 years on Tuesday, dismissing former US Open finalist Leylah Fernandez, 6-2, 7-6 (1).“I'm very happy to be a part of history and to be able to get a win here for Indonesia,” she told me during her post-match press conference. “I think it was special, especially to do it in front of my family here. There were a lot of Indonesians and a lot of close friends also here.”The soft-spoken Tjen first broke onto the tennis scene last summer when she reached the second round of the US Open as a qualifier, becoming the first Indonesian to make it that far at a major since Angelique Widjaja in 2004. Armed with an athletic game and lethal backhand slice, the former Pepperdine University standout went even further back in time to beat Fernandez, becoming the first to win a round Down Under since Yayuk Basuki in 1998.

“It was crazy, I would say, having that feeling” she said of the enthusiastic fan energy on ANZ Arena, which was reminiscent of what the Philippines' Alexandra Eala experienced on Court 6 yesterday. “I thought getting the chants of “Indonesia!” was something special for me. It feels a lot quite like home, and just knowing that a lot of Indonesians came out today to support me means a lot.”Ranked outside the Top 400 this time last year, Tjen is closing in on a Top 50 debut, reaching two WTA finals last fall and winning her maiden title in Chennai, India.“I get recognized a little bit here and there,” she shyly admitted. “It's nice, a nice feeling. I wouldn't say that it changed my life completely but my life is still the same. I'm a simple person!”

Studying sociology because it helped her lean more about herself, Tjen has become an expert at channeling a partisan crowd to victory, navigating Fernandez's tricky game to edge through a second-set tiebreaker and score her first win of the season.“I think when I start feeling my energy drop a little bit, I know that they're behind me and supporting me no matter what. I think that helps a lot.”Wearing a lime green Asics jacket, Tjen appears keen on letting her tennis—and not her growing national celebrity—do the talking.“I try to have a tunnel vision and just focus on being the best version of myself.”Looking to make a debut appearance in a Grand Slam third round, Tjen will next face former world No. 1 Karolina Pliskova, who edged past former US Open champion Sloane Stephens for her first wins since September.

The former world No. 1 missed nearly all of the 2025 season after undergoing two surgeries on her left ankle.ByDavid KanePublished Jan 20, 2026 copy_link

MELBOURNE, Australia—Karolina Pliskova can handle a little pain.“Everyone's used to it,” she told me at the Australian Open on Tuesday.A little pain was all the former No. 1 had heading into the 2024 US Open. But minutes into her second round against Jasmine Paolini, a bad landing on her left foot put her into a world of hurt.“It was very shocking,” recalled Pliskova, who is in Melbourne by the grace of a protected ranking, “and even more shocking when I got the results that I'd broken all the ligaments and tendons.”Once one of the healthiest players on tour—the 33-year-old previously missed just one major main draw since 2013—an initial six-month break ballooned by nearly double when Pliskova picked up an infection following a surgery on her left ankle.

“The infection made things look really bad,” she said, adding color to her often-monotone staccato for emphasis. “To look at it, you would think I was going to lose the leg. Still, I wasn't even walking after three-four months, so the original timeline became impossible.”A second surgery was required, one that cured the infection but left the already upright Pliskova, who longed joked of a reluctance to bend her knees on the court, with a limited range of motion. Another little pain.“The ankle is still very stiff,” she said. “and this will never get better. To be honest, it doesn't really limit me on the court. I may not move as well, but at least it forces me to play fast!”As Pliskova recovered she settled into life at home, traveling through Europe but largely splitting her time between Prague and Marbella, Spain. She went fishing with her parents, started a Czech-language tennis podcast with twin sister Kristyna—who is based in Madrid—and she continued to foster her eponymous tennis academy.

The academy isn't huge, but [the coaches] are like family. They're following my matches even though it's night now in Czech. Everyone is waking up to follow the score. Karolina Pliskova

“It started back in COVID,” she explained of the latter. “I was at home with my sister and first started thinking of creating a camp for kids. So many hundreds of kids expressed interest, and because we were there teaching them, they absolutely loved it. So, we decided to do it again the following year. The first time was just four days; the following year, we did four weeks like that, so we started having this idea to start an academy.“When we first started, we were renting a club, but we bought one in Prague, so we have indoor courts and built some padel courts. I actually like to play padel a lot. There's a hotel and restaurant part of it, so it's been a big project, and something I also want to enjoy after my career.”Unsure of when (or if) that career would continue, Pliskova followed the sport from afar.“At the beginning, it was difficult because when it happened and I couldn't walk, it was just tough to see people running when I couldn't even walk!” she said with a laugh.The woman who once called tennis matches “better than movies” is now a critic on the *Rakety* podcast, a role that has earned mixed reviews from her fellow players. A real pain.

“Marketa [Vondrousova] was upset because I said something about how I don't like when someone retires,” she told me. “If someone withdraws, that's fine because maybe you're injured, but if you're retiring and if it looks to me like you could finish the match, that's different. There are many people who, to me, retire from matches because they don't want to lose and finish the match. For me, it's a loss regardless, no matter the score. Maybe if you were up when you retire, and that's when you see when something is really happening. But some of the injuries, I think most people can at least finish the matches.“Look, the way I am, sometimes I say things which not everyone agrees. But that's why people do podcasts, right? It's all to express different opinions. Not everyone likes it. That's fine with me.”

Pliskova enjoys unwavering support from her academy's coaching staff, who all tuned in to watch her first match of the season.“The team isn't huge, but we're like a family. Even though it's night now in Czech, everyone is waking up to follow the score.“It's been a good environment, and I even train there myself. I just feel good there. There's no stress or pressure from anyone else. There are some players who come to train with me, but I'm the owner, so if I want to spend one hour the court, that's what I'll do! That's something that's so nice, to have people around that you've chosen and want around you.”

It felt like just yesterday I was playing here the way I was five years, six years ago. Time here is different than when you're at home! Karolina Pliskova on her first Australian Open in two years

For as much as tennis can change with each passing week, to see Pliskova back on Kia Arena against Sloane Stephens—reheating a rivalry that dates back to juniors—was to think she had never left.“It felt like just yesterday I was playing here the way I was five years, six years ago. Time here is different than when you're at home!” she joked.The once and future “Ace Queen” struggled at times on serve but converted six of seven break points to dispatch Stephens, 7-6 (7), 6-2, and win her first Grand Slam match since that disastrous US Open. Still, Pliskova is taking her comeback day by day and, between rust and compensation injuries is reluctant to outline a schedule past the Australian summer.

“I don't want to struggle too much,” she said with her inimitable candor. “I struggled a lot this year because of my legs. I only want to play if I'm at least 90%, if not 100%, ready. I'll wait how I feel, and I need some time to see. When I played two matches in September, I was destroyed for two weeks. There's no sense if I can't play matches back-to-back. From there, maybe I can do a bigger plan. But look, here, I had a bigger plan to play Brisbane and Adelaide and I couldn't because of the leg—the right leg because I'm leaning more on it since getting surgery on the left!“Maybe it'll be different decisions, maybe less tournaments. At the same time, I need matches after a year and a half of not playing. Still, no plans. Sorry!”Pliskova laughs again and wishes me a good day as she heads to the elevator, having ended almost 45 minutes of media. There is still plenty of interest in the two-time Grand Slam finalist, her career, and what she has left to say. If there was a little pain in talking through her past, present, and uncertain future—in two languages, no less—she handled it.

“A lot of people have been asking for a while to be able to buy my kits,” Gauff told Tennis.com in Melbourne.“There are two colors. I decided to wear purple today, because I felt like it gave more ‘day' vibes. And obviously there is an orange kit for night.”The custom kit from longtime sponsor New Balance is an ode to “the spirit of summer,” featuring a palette of hot marigold, navy blue, and daybreak periwinkle, and designed to embrace effortless movement.

“Once I got through kind of the first game—I had like three doubles in the first game—it was pretty much smooth sailing from there,” Gauff told press afterward. “Maybe I would have liked to put more first serves in the court, for sure.“I think I just erased that first game, and then after that I was better… As the match went on, I just told myself to accelerate on my serve more. Obviously when that happens, I get more speed and velocity. So I think the next match I'll try and start quicker than I did today.”

The story of the 2025 season

Red Bull and Racing Bulls unveil new cars

With Arvid Lindblad joining the F1 grid this season with Racing Bulls, he becomes the tenth driver to have graduated from Formula 3 en route to the sport's highest level.

For every driver on the grid, the road to Formula 1 looks a little different, but the FIA Formula 3 Championship has proved to be a valuable stepping stone for 10 of them. Drivers need competitive track sessions to help develop their racecraft, one-lap pace, and tyre management – but the third rung of the ladder helps so much more than that.

Exposing young racers to the travel, media duties, sponsorship obligations and increased global attention – under the watchful eyes of those in the F1 paddock – acts as a trial by fire. Those who master all while performing well on track are likely to ascend to the top of motorsport.

F3 has helped develop drivers since the championship was launched in 2019, and as Arvid Lindblad joins the grid as the sole rookie for 2026 with Racing Bulls, the Briton will add his name to a small but growing group who impressed in the junior categories to earn their place in F1. Let's look at all the drivers who made a similar step up – and how life in F3 set them up for their F1 journey.

It's been a rapid rise for Lindblad, with the 18-year-old due to become the fourth-youngest driver in F1 history when he debuts for Racing Bulls this season.

Just two years ago, the Briton was driving for PREMA Racing, aged 16, in the 2024 F3 season – and what a rookie season it was. He took four wins, including becoming the youngest F3 race winner after his Sprint Race victory in his maiden outing in Bahrain, to come fourth overall as the highest-finishing rookie that year.

Lindblad is the latest success story from the ever-fruitful Red Bull Academy, which has produced some of the premiere talent on the grid since its inception 25 years ago. His 6th place finish in the 2025 F2 season was enough for the Red Bull higher-ups to give him a shot at F1, partnering fellow F3 grad Liam Lawson this year.

Speaking to Lawrence Barretto, Lindblad credited the intense nature of the junior categories in preparing him for this move. He said: ""I've just been in each category one year, so every year I'm used to being thrown in the deep end. For sure on that side it will help me to adapt to F1 because I'm used to being in this situation.”

It's hard to overlook the impact of Gabriel Bortoleto's junior career. Arriving in F3 as a rookie in 2023, the young Brazilian made an immediate impression, winning his first Feature Race and establishing himself as a title contender from the off.

A clinic of consistency followed, and amassing two wins and six podiums, the Trident driver achieved something few else have done – securing the championship in his maiden season.

A rookie title is a strong statement, and Bortoleto backed it up by repeating the feat again in F2 – a sequence of titles that naturally attracted plenty of attention from the Formula 1 paddock. Kick Sauber quickly secured the sought-after 21-year-old to partner Nico Hulkenberg for the 2025 season.

Bortoleto's ability to adapt to the challenges of different cars with ease has been one of his most impressive qualities, but having a two-time World Champion in his corner certainly gave him an edge.

Fernando Alonso's management team snapped him up ahead of his F3 season, helping him gain a seat while giving the type of advice that would be invaluable to a young talent. After a solid debut season with Sauber, Bortoleto will be looking to build further momentum with Audi in 2026.

In 2022, the Red Bull Junior Team had a new member – French-Algerian Isack Hadjar. Joining Hitech Grand Prix for the F3 season, Hadjar pleased the Red Bull higher-ups with a sterling rookie campaign, achieving a Sprint Race win on debut, before taking a further two wins and five podiums to finish an impressive fourth in the standings.

Although a crash in Monza Qualifying curtailed his title charge that year, it's such moments that proved valuable preparation for the realities of racing at the highest level. Hadjar responded to this disappointment by regrouping the following season, bouncing back from a difficult maiden Formula 2 campaign to finish runner-up to Bortoleto and secure a drive with Racing Bulls for 2025.

Even an early setback on his F1 debut weekend in Australia – where he crashed on the formation lap – did little to derail his momentum, as he enjoyed an eye-catching year with a podium at Zandvoort.

Reflecting on his time in F3, Hadjar highlighted the importance of consistency in his development.

“Consistency was something I targeted right away arriving in Formula 3,” he said. “My first years in single seaters were difficult and when I didn't have the pace, I wasn't able to maximise. My approach really changed, and I learned quite a lot and am very happy with that.”

Those lessons will be crucial for Red Bull's newest driver to draw upon this year as he becomes team mates with Max Verstappen.

Before his time in the Alpine Academy, Jack Doohan was part of the Red Bull Junior Team where he experienced two seasons in F3 with very different outcomes.

His 2020 campaign proved a challenging introduction, ending without a points finish as he placed 26th in the standings. But a switch from HWA RACELAB to Trident for 2021 marked a turning point for the Australian. Doohan emerged as a frontrunner, taking four victories and seven podiums on his way to finishing as runner-up in the championship.

Those vastly contrasting seasons become an important part of Doohan's development as a driver. Reflecting on his breakthrough win in the series, he spoke candidly about the challenges he'd faced.

“After all the difficulties of last year, and how much it mentally drained me - figuring out if I was good enough for this and if I was doing the right thing - to have everything fall into place and to show my potential, all the emotions came out,” he said. “It was a very, very tough year, but I feel I can learn more from that than a successful year, and hopefully this can take me on to bigger and better things and make me a stronger person and driver.”

Doohan went on to compete in two full F2 seasons in 2022 and 2023, before graduating to F1 with Alpine in the 2024 season finale at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. While his time in a race seat proved brief, the experience added another chapter to a career shaped by resilience and adaptability – traits certainly forged during his turnaround in F3.

It was during his stint in F3 that Franco Colapinto first exhibited the type of raw speed that proved impossible for F1 teams to ignore. His debut campaign in 2022 with Van Amersfoort Racing was a learning year for the Argentinian, with flashes of brilliance mixed with some bouts of inconsistency, ultimately resulting in a ninth-place finish in the standings.

Even so, two victories and five podiums provided a strong foundation to build from during the next season. And he did exactly that in 2023, finding far more points finishes between his two wins to finish 4th with MP Motorsport.

Despite only spending half a season in F2, in 2024 Colapinto got his shot in F1 when chosen to replace fellow F3 graduate Logan Sargeant at Williams from the Italian Grand Prix onwards. He remained impressively close to team mate Alex Albon for the remainder of the season, making a strong first impression.

While Williams opted to complete their 2025 line-up with Carlos Sainz, Colapinto's performances ensured he remained firmly on the F1 radar. A reserve role with Alpine swiftly followed, before he was promoted to a full-time race seat six rounds into the season.

Although the Alpine package allowed him limited opportunities to fully demonstrate his potential, the flashes of pace he's shown throughout his career have certainly made Colapinto a valuable addition to the grid.

Ollie Bearman will be the fifth-youngest F1 driver in history after Lindblad makes his debut – a feat that requires a stellar junior career to achieve. And that's exactly what Bearman had, with his 2022 F3 season featuring a win and eight podiums for PREMA. That third-place finish in the standings at just 17 years old got him a quick promotion to F2 with the same team.

The Briton had to become comfortable with quick adaptation, as he was thrust into a Formula 1 seat at the last minute for the 2024 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix – replacing Sainz in the Ferrari who had appendicitis.

Despite missing two practice sessions, Bearman had the whole paddock on notice when he qualified 11th and finished P7 to become the then-youngest point scorer on debut.

F3 certainly helped prepare Bearman for the life of a professional driver, and after the 2022 season he said: “The team are super professional, so you always need to be switched on and working at that level. For sure, it made me grow as a person. I feel like I make better decisions now and balance the risk and reward better.”

Having made the step up to F1 permanently in 2025, the 20-year-old had a strong rookie season with Haas, with a breakthrough fourth-place finish in Mexico the highlight.

Liam Lawson learned a thing or two about overcoming setbacks during his time in Formula 3. A throttle failure meant his 2019 F3 campaign got off to the worst possible start, but he recovered well to grab two podiums and 11th place, the highest of the MP Motorsport drivers that season.

The New Zealander used that experience the following season to finish on the top step three times with Hitech Grand Prix, earning an impressive fifth place in the championship.

Lawson spent the next few years racing non-stop, including runner-up spots in DTM and Super Formula, a third-place finish in F2, and some short F1 stints to replace an injured Daniel Ricciardo at Racing Bulls.

Despite being dropped from the Red Bull team in 2025 after only two races, the 23-year-old's perseverance showed again as he found form back with Racing Bulls – a skill certainly strengthened during his time in F3.

Oscar Piastri has his own piece of history as the only driver to win Formula Renault, Formula 3, and Formula 2 championships in successive seasons. His ability to adapt to any machinery is outstanding, but being able to immediately adapt to difficult racing situations is another strength that appealed to F1 teams.

His victorious 2020 F3 season was during the height of COVID racing, but that didn't phase the Australian, winning it all thanks to two wins and six podiums, while suffering only three non-points scoring races with PREMA.

Speaking to Lawrence Barretto, Piastri spoke of the intensity of the F3 step-up. “I had to win pretty quickly after joining the Renault programme,” he said of the urgent nature of the sport. “It wasn't my best season as a driver. It was a tense year.”

His PREMA team mate Sargeant was also a close friend, but Piastri didn't let the title fight get in the way of their relationship. Speaking after claiming the title, he explained: “We've known each other for four or five years. We've been good friends and we didn't come to blows this year, it really wasn't difficult to manage – it was great working with Logan.”

The 24-year-old has arguably become the biggest success story from F3 so far, finishing just 13 points behind title-winning McLaren team mate Lando Norris last season in just his third year in F1.

There is no ceiling for the calm and collected Aussie, and winning what he described as “one of the most competitive championships in the world” in his rookie season has certainly set him up for his Formula 1 successes so far...

Floridian Logan Sargeant partook in a rollercoaster three-year stint in F3 before heading up the ranks, joining Albon at Williams in 2023.

Though his maiden season with Carlin Buzz Racing in 2019 was nothing necessarily to write home about, Sargeant's move to PREMA for 2020 proved to be much more fruitful. Finishing the season with a host of pole positions and six podiums, including his first-ever Feature Race win at Silverstone – the 25-year-old finished just four points adrift of the title in P3.

Sargeant remained in F3 for the 2021 season, though a late switch to Charouz Racing System brought another period of adjustment for the young American. While the move coincided with a more challenging campaign this time round – yielding a single victory in Russia – it was his impact on the team that caught the eye of team managers.

Charouz went on to record their highest-ever points tally that season, scoring 127 points in total, with Sargeant contributing an impressive 101 of those.

That season also proved formative for Sargeant, offering insight into how progress is built across a campaign. Having raced with a front-running team in Prema before switching to a developing Charouz outfit, he was forced to adapt. Reflecting on the year, Sargeant said he felt he had “done what I came in to do,” pointing to how the team had “brought the car a long way from the start of the season”.

Those lessons would soon pay off, as Sargeant was signed to the Williams Driver Academy later in 2021, marking a significant step towards F1. A promotion to Formula 2 with Carlin followed in 2022, where he finished fourth in the championship, before completing the journey to the F1 grid with Williams – where he showed the adaptability and resilience shaped during his years in Formula 3.

The first F3 success story came courtesy of Yuki Tsunoda, who competed in the 2019 season with Jenzer Motorsport. He arrived in Europe from Japan ahead of his season debut with little knowledge of the circuits compared to his rivals, but despite the steep learning curve the Honda and Red Bull Junior proved himself to be a quick learner.

After scoring just two points finishes across the opening seven races, his season certainly gathered momentum in the second half.

Tsunoda went on to score in each of the following seven races, including a podium in Spa, along with a Sprint Race podium and impressive Feature Race victory in Italy.

All that progress in such a short time did not go unnoticed. Then AlphaTauri Team Principal Franz Tost was among those impressed by Tsunoda's first season in Europe, highlighting not just the results, but the circumstances surrounding them.

Tost pointed to the challenge of adapting to a new culture quickly, unfamiliar circuits and a different car, and noted that, even with those factors in play, Tsunoda went on to win in his debut season. The Austrian was also struck by Tsunoda's strengths in wet conditions and his fearlessness when battling future F1 team mate and fellow Red Bull Junior Lawson.

The Japanese racer levelled up to F2 the following year, and with his newfound familiarity of some circuits thanks to his F3 campaign, he enjoyed his best year yet.

Tsunoda went on to finish third in the championship, earning top rookie honours along the way. His rapid progress paved the way into F1 in 2019 with AlphaTauri, as he completed the climb from F3 to F1 after just two seasons.

The story of the 2025 season

Red Bull and Racing Bulls unveil new cars

Aston Martin and Honda have kicked off their new partnership via a Tokyo launch presentation.

Aston Martin and Honda celebrated the start of their works F1 partnership on Tuesday during a special pre-season event in Tokyo, Japan.

Aston Martin Aramco Executive Chairman Lawrence Stroll was joined by Honda President and Representative Executive Officer Toshihiro Mibe for the presentation, while F1 President and CEO Stefano Domenicali also attended and took to the stage.

Since returning to F1 as a works team back in 2021, the Silverstone-based Aston Martin squad have been powered by Mercedes engines, but this changes for 2026 – and the sport's all-new regulations – thanks to their Honda tie-up.

Aston Martin's former Team Principal and new Chief Strategy Officer Andy Cowell has been overseeing the final stages of the integration, drawing on his lengthy and successful stint at Mercedes High Performance Powertrains, with F1 design legend Adrian Newey taking on team boss duties.

“I am delighted to celebrate the start of our partnership with Honda here in Tokyo today,” said Lawrence Stroll. “Aston Martin Aramco Formula 1 Team and Honda share many values, and those values have brought us together for 2026 and beyond.

“The strong collaboration between the AMR Technology Centre at Silverstone and Honda Racing Corporation (HRC) in Sakura demonstrates the depth of our partnership. We are confident that we have all the elements required to fight for victory in the future and we have tremendous faith in Honda's power unit and the engineers behind it.

“Our journey won't always be easy and challenges inevitably lie ahead, but winning is what drives both companies forward and together we look forward to many successful years of partnership.”

Honda chief Mibe added: “Honda's participation in F1, the pinnacle of automobile racing, has been the embodiment of the spirit of the company founder, Soichiro Honda, who inspired Honda engineers to commit to becoming No.1 in the world and to take on the most difficult challenges.

“In 2026, F1 will undergo a major change in regulations for both the chassis and power unit. Honda sees F1 as a symbol of challenge and innovation, and HRC, the global racing arm of Honda, has developed the RA626H, the new power unit for the 2026 season, to meet those challenges.

“Striving to become number one in the world, Honda will continue to take on challenges together with the Aston Martin Aramco Formula 1 Team.

“Today we also launch a new ‘H' mark with a refreshed design, which Honda has adopted as the new symbol representing its automobile business. This new H mark symbolises the transformation of Honda's automobile business so it is an important moment for us.”

In his on-stage speech, Domenicali said: “This is an exciting moment for the sport of F1, as Honda and the Aston Martin Aramco Formula 1 Team join together to fight for the biggest prize of F1.

“Formula 1 began racing in Japan in 1976 before moving to Suzuka in 1987, so there is a deep loyalty and connection to the country where a record 13 World Drivers' Championships have been decided over the years.

“The sport is growing in Japan where there are now nearly 17 million passionate and incredible F1 fans. The Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka last year welcomed 266,000 weekend attendees, and saw a +26% year-over-year increase in TV viewership in Japan. The return of Honda to F1 this year will further boost the potential for the sport here in the Japanese market.

“The exciting next generation of regulations for 2026 is one of the factors that has drawn Honda back to the sport. Those regulations will see both the chassis and PUs updated, in the biggest overhaul in the sport's history. There will be a simplified hybrid engine that runs on advanced sustainable fuel without impacting the performance.

“F1 echoes the commitment of Honda and Aston Martin Aramco Formula 1 Team to sustainability, and is on target to achieve the goal of Net Zero by 2030 having already delivered a 26% reduction in carbon emissions by year end 2024 compared to 2018.

“F1 welcomes the innovations that are to come and is working with partners such as Honda to push boundaries.”

Next up for the new Aston Martin-Honda alliance will be the Barcelona Shakedown week from January 26-30, before the team hold their official season launch at Ithra in Saudi Arabia on February 9.

The story of the 2025 season

Red Bull and Racing Bulls unveil new cars

John Owen will depart his role as Director of Car Design at Mercedes later this year, having been a part of the team since 2007.

Mercedes have announced that John Owen, their long-standing Director of Car Design, will leave the team later this year.

Owen has been with the Brackley-based outfit since 2007 – when they were still under the Honda name – and remained onboard through their subsequent guise as Brawn GP, when the squad memorably clinched both the Drivers' and Teams' Championship in 2009.

The team then became Mercedes in 2010 and went on to score a record-breaking eight consecutive teams' titles as well as seven drivers' crowns in the years that followed – and the Silver Arrows have credited Owen with playing a key role in this success.

A statement from the outfit reads: “We can confirm that John Owen, our Director of Car Design, has decided that now is the right time to take a break from F1 and that he will be leaving the team later this year to begin a period of gardening leave, after assuring the transition to his successor.

“John has been with our Brackley team since 2007 and played a considerable role in our success. He has been a key part of 9 Constructors' Championships across the time he has worked here and this year's W17 marks the 17th car for which he has had overall design responsibility.

“We wish John all the very best for the future and thank him for the considerable role he has played in the team's success.”

Mercedes went on to confirm that Owen's role will be filled by internal promotion, with Giacomo Tortora – who currently acts as Engineering Director – set to become the squad's new Director of Car Design, while Deputy Technical Director Simone Resta will oversee the group.

The Silver Arrows are set to reveal renders of their 2026 car, the W17, on January 22, before going on to hold a digital launch show on February 2.

The Oscar winner is recalling the terrifying encounter while filming 1972's 'Napoleon and Samantha.'


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Jodie Foster is looking back at her terrifying experience with a lion while filming the 1972 Disney movie, Napoleon and Samantha, as a child.


	The two-time Oscar winner recently shared during an interview with W Magazine that she has “many scars” after being attacked by the big cat on set at nine years old.




	“I was mauled by a lion when I was eight-and-a-half or nine,” she recalled. “The lion picked me up, shook me around, moved me horizontally, and then dropped me. I had two perfect punctures on one side and then two perfect punctures on the other, on my hip. But as the years have gone on and we get bigger, you know, who even knows where they are anymore. They kind of just move around.”

The A Private Life actress noted that the scary encounter wasn't filmed, as it happened “after the shot was over.”


	“I was in shock, so I don't really remember that much,” Foster said. “I remember the event. I saw his mane come forward and I had worked with the lions, but when he picked me up, he picked me up and then moved me sideways and shook me around. And so, as he turned me back and towards the whole camera crew, I saw the whole camera crew run — except sideways. So, I saw them running sideways, taking all their equipment with them, just like, running away from me.”


The Silence of the Lambs actress said the animal's trainer eventually got the situation under control, but that it was still one of the “scariest” things to happen to her while shooting a movie.


	“I guess the trainer said, ‘Drop it,' and the lion dropped me out of his mouth,” she recalled. “I think that was probably the scariest thing that ever happened to me when I was making a movie. I'm not sure I had time for fear, honestly.”

	











	After Foster recovered from the attack, the Taxi Driver star shared that she had to continue working with the same lion, which ended up leading to a “scarier moment” later while filming.


	“After I got out of the hospital, and it was deemed I was okay to work and everything, I went back to work with the same lion, but I was carrying a rooster,” Foster explained. “And the rooster was not used to working with this particular lion. And I saw the lion turn his head and kind of go like this, like maybe he was going to approach me or something, and I threw the rooster, and I ran. I think that's probably a scarier moment.”


Napoleon and Samantha also starred Johnny Whitaker and Michael Douglas, and followed two young children who embark on a journey with a lion rather than part ways with the animal, who was once a circus performer.

							By

Senior Entertainment Reporter


William Shatner had a fascinating response to Stephen Miller‘s suggestion that the star's insight was needed to improve the Star Trek franchise. 


	Last week, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy shared a post from the X account End Wokeness that featured a viral clip of new series Star Trek: Starfleet Academy. The clip showed castmembers Tricia Black (playing Lt. Rork), Gina Yashere (Lura Thok) and Holly Hunter (Nahla Ake), and the End Wokeness post added the message, “Star Trek 2026… Beyond parody…,” seemingly reflecting unhappiness over the performers' looks.

	Miller wrote, “Tragic. But it's not too late for @paramountplus to save the franchise. Step 1: Reconcile with @WilliamShatner and give him total creative control.”

	On Monday, Shatner responded by joking about the supposed problem with the scene, focusing on the fact that Hunter's character uses glasses. “I am so on the same page with you @StephenM !” the 94-year-old star wrote. “The fact that they have not cure Hyperopia by the 32rd Century is an abysmal oversight on the writers!”


	The actor known for playing the franchise's Captain Kirk continued in his cheeky response: “Also @paramountplus needs to up the budget because I'm sure that a well oiled organization like Starfleet in the distant future could afford more than one pair of glasses for at least this hyperopic bridge crew. Do they pass the glasses around while piloting the ship‽ Shame on the line producers! That is what you meant, right‽ I am ready to assume command of the series! Call me!”

	Miller, who also serves as President Donald Trump‘s homeland security advisor, responded to Shatner's reply by doubling down on his call for the actor to assume a leadership role in the franchise. Miller wrote that it's “not too late for Paramount to make amends with Shatner and save the franchise. Do it!”


	Although Miller did not specify his issue with the show's footage, other social media users responded with complaints suggesting that the casting appeared to be motivated by diversity efforts. 


	Earlier in the month, Elon Musk shared a post featuring the same clip and added, “Turns out they banned Ozempic and LASIK in the future lol.” This led Black to respond on Instagram with the message, “I've seen this exact same comment probably 100 times already so whatever but it's nuts that the richest man in [the world] felt the need to steal the joke. It doesn't get to me because I am comfortable in my skin most days but this one made me laugh.” 


	Shatner originated the role of Kirk on the original 1960s Star Trek series, which has been heralded for creator Gene Roddenberry's progressive values. Shatner, who directed the 1989 feature Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, last played Kirk in the 1994 film Star Trek: Generations, which included the character's death.


	Created by Gaia Violo, Star Trek: Starfleet Academy premiered last week on Paramount+ and has already been renewed for a second season. In her review for The Hollywood Reporter, critic Angie Han called the new project “admirable in its ambitions but shaky in its execution,” adding that it was “too full of charm and promise to dismiss outright.” 

	











	Shatner tends to eschew political commentary and has “not political” written in his X bio. But the Canadian actor has made headlines in the past with opinions related to the culture wars, including his remarks criticizing individuals who have used the term “cisgender” to describe him.


	“It's used as a slur & term of harassment,” Shatner posted in 2020 about the term. “I'm going to object to it because I cannot fathom any positive reason to use it on strangers online.”

Berlin stays in its lane with a 2026 lineup favoring arthouse core over Hollywood flash. 


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	The Berlin International Film Festival unveiled its 2026 lineup on Tuesday, revealing a program sure to delight the festival's many hardcore arthouse fans, but with little in the way of big Hollywood titles to draw in the undecided.


	Bar a last-minute addition, the 76th Berlinale (Feb. 12-22), will not feature any studio productions this year, something that could put a damper on the glam factor in the German capital. 




	But Berlinale festival director Trica Tuttle and her team, have pulled together an impressively diverse competition lineup, with 22 features across virtually every genre.

	“Satirical and formalist comedy, genre, a psychological thriller, a love story, a self-love story, anime, a western… these 22 films show off just how diverse great cinema is in 2026,” said Tuttle. “We are so confident in the charms of these 22 films that we say defiantly: If you don't find something here to love, you don't love cinema!!” 


	Among the higher-profile titles in competition for Golden Bear at the 76th edition of the Berlinale this year are At the Sea, from Piece of Woman director Kornél Mundruczo, featuring Amy Adams, and Dan Levy, about a freshly-sober woman who to her family's home to confront her buried trauma; Beth de Araújo's drama thriller Josephine, starring Channing Tatum and Gemma Chan; the dementia drama Queen at Sea starring Juliette Binoche and Tom Courtenay from Ballast director Lance Hammer; Rosebush Pruning, an English-language thriller from Brazilian director Karim Aïnouz, starring Callum Turner, Riley Keough, Jamie Bell, Elle Fanning, and Pamela Anderson; and Rose, from Austrian filmmaker Markus Schleinzer (Michael), a 17th century transgender drama featuring Oscar nominee Sandra Hüller (Anatomy of a Fall). All, except Josephine, which will head to Berlin straight from Sundance, are world premieres.

	











	Yoshitoshi Shinomiya, an assistant director on Makoto Shinkai's anime blockbuster Your Name, will premiere A New Dawn, his first feature as a director, in competition in Berlin.


	Award-watchers will have an eye on Yellow Letters, the new feature from German director İlker Çatak, whose previous film, The Teacher's Lounge, premiered in Berlin's Panorama sidebar in 2023 and went on to score an Oscar nomination for best international feature. And fans of Rupert Grint's serious, post-Harry Potter career will get to see the British star in the thriller Nightborn, from director Hanna Bergholm, playing a young father who moves with his partner back to her childhood home in the Finnish forest, only to see their dreams of a perfect family turn into a nightmare after their baby is born.


	Other competition stand-outs include Wolfram, a 1930s outback drama from Australian director Warwick Thornton (Samson & Delilah); Dao from Alain Gomis, winner of Berlin's 2017 Grand Jury Prize for Félicité; Flies, the latest from acclaimed Brazilian helmer Fernando Eimbcke, a 2008 Berlinale competition contender with Lake Tahoe; We Are All Strangers, by Cannes regular Anthony Chen (Ilo Ilo); and Grant Gee's Everybody Digs Bill Evans, featuring Norwegian star Anders Danielsen Lie (Sentimental Value, The Worst Person in the World) as legendary jazz pianist Bill Evans. 


	Tuttle also named the 13 features that will screen in Berlin's Perspectives sidebar for first features, noting that a 14th title may be announced later. The Perspectives lineup including several promising debuts, including A Prayer for the Dying, from U.S. director Dara Van Dusen, a Western featuring Johnny Flynn, John C. Reilly, and Kristine Kujath Thorp; Animol from Brit actor and rapper Ashley Walters (aka Asher D), a prison drama starring Tut Nyuot, Vladyslav Baliuk, Sekou Diaby, and Adolescent star Stephen Graham; and Take Me Home from Korean-American filmmaker Liz Sargent, which will premiere in Sundance. The latter stars Sargent's sister Anna Sargent as a 38-year-old Korean adoptee with a cognitive disability who is struggling to care for her aging adoptive parents.

	











	“Festivals have a hugely important role to play in enabling the discovery of the next generation of major talents, and we've been excited by the future when viewing the debuts in Perspectives,” said Tuttle. 


	Iconic German director Wim Wenders (Perfect Days, Paris Texas) heads up this year's Berlinale jury, which will pick the winners of the festival's Gold and Silver Bears.

Charlie Polinger is directing the re-imagining of the Edgar Allan Poe story for A24.


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


	French actress Léa Seydoux has joined Mikey Madison in The Masque of the Red Death, A24's re-imagining of the creepy Edgar Allan Poe story from filmmaker Charlie Polinger. 


	Julia Hammer and Erik Feig are producing for Picturestart with James Presson and Lucy McKendrick.




	While A24 is mum on the official plot but does describe the project as wildly revisionist and darkly comedic. Sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that Madison is playing twin sisters in a story that sees a mad prince take in the noble class into his castle while a plague devastates the peasantry. The story sees a long-lost twin, hidden among the lower class, enter the castle and into a decadent world of orgies, opium, power schemes, revenge and decapitations.

	Seydoux will play a scheming lady-in-waiting who is conniving her way to the top.


	A24 is distributing worldwide. Polinger is executive producing. Production is due to take place in Hungary  starting in February.


	A Palme d'or Cannes Film Festival winner and a five time Cesar Award nominee, Seydoux is known for ping-ponging between French cinema and Hollywood outings. The latter ranges from her first Hollywood production, Inglourious Basterds, to blockbusters Mission: Impossible: Ghost Protocol and Spectre, one of two Bond movies in which she appeared. Her last major Hollywood role was in Denis Villeneuve's Dune: Part Two, in which she played Lady Margot Fenring.


	This year, the actress is will be seen starring in Oscar-winning screenwriter Arthur Harari's The Unknown, Marie Kreutzer's Gentle Monster alongside Catherine Deneuve, and the Zellner Bros' Alpha Gang with Cate Blanchett and Dave Bautista. 

	











	Seydoux is repped by Agence Adequat and UTA.

The superstar earns his 10th No. 1, and first arrival at the apex.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Bruno Mars' “I Just Might” blasts onto the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 1. The song starts as his 10th career leader, and his first to debut at the summit.


	Mars ties for the 10th-most No. 1s in the Hot 100's history, which dates to the chart's Aug. 4, 1958, inception. He's just the fourth solo male with 10 or more No. 1s, joining Drake, Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder.


	The track — also Mars' fifth leader, and first No. 1 debut, on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart — previews his album The Romantic, his first solo set since 2016, due Feb. 27.


	Check out the full rundown of this week's Hot 100 top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Jan. 24, 2026) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Jan. 21 (a day later than usual, due to the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday Jan. 19). For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram. Plus, for all chart rules and explanations, click here.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.








Released Jan. 9 on Atlantic Records, “I Just Might” arrives with 23.5 million official streams and 32.6 million radio airplay audience impressions and sold 13,000 in the United States in its first week of release (ending Jan. 15).


	The single launches at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart, where it's Mars' fourth leader; at a personal-best No. 12 on Radio Songs — the highest start for a lead male artist since the chart became an all-format ranking in 1998; and at No. 1 on Digital Song Sales, becoming his 12th chart-topper.


	Here's an updated recap of Mars' 10 career Hot 100 No. 1s:




	Mars tops his prior highest Hot 100 debut, as “Die With a Smile” began at No. 3 in August 2024.


	Mars ties for the 10th-most Hot 100 No. 1s all-time. Here's a look at the leaderboard:




	Mars joins Drake, Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder as the only solo males with 10 or more Hot 100 No. 1s.


	Meanwhile, dating to 2010, when Mars earned his first Hot 100 leader, he Drake and Taylor Swift (13 each) are the only acts with double-digit No. 1 totals.


	Mars adds his 40th career week atop the Hot 100, via his 10 No. 1s. Here are the elite acts with the most weeks on top:




	Mars boasts the fourth-most frames at No. 1 on the Hot 100 since 2010, after Drake (56), Swift (46) and Rihanna (41).


	“I Just Might” premieres as the 1,185th Hot 100 No. 1 ever, and the 87th to debut in the top spot.


	While it's the 10th Hot 100 No. 1 with the word “just” in its title — Mars has two, following “Just the Way You Are” — it's the first with “might.” It zooms past the prior highest-peaking such song, The Cars' pop-rock classic “You Might Think” (No. 7, 1984).


	“I Just Might” enters as Mars' fifth No. 1 on the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and his first to debut at the pinnacle. His previous leaders: “Leave the Door Open” (for eight weeks in 2021); “Please Me” (three, 2019), “Finesse” (one week, 2018) — both with Cardi B; and “That's What I Like” (10, 2017).


	Mars' new single also starts as his fifth No. 1 on Hot R&B Songs. It follows Silk Sonic's “Smokin Out the Window” (11 weeks, 2021-22); “Leave the Door Open” (14, 2021); “Finesse” (12, 2018); and “That's What I Like” (20, 2017).


	Taylor Swift's “The Fate of Ophelia” falls to No. 2 on the Hot 100 after a career-best 10 weeks at No. 1.


	Notably, with Mars taking the baton from Swift, an act with 10 or more Hot 100 No. 1s again dethrones another. On the Jan. 10 chart, “The Fate of Ophelia” supplanted Mariah Carey's “All I Want for Christmas Is You.” (The latter replaced the former at No. 1 in December.) The first occurrence of such superstar turnover at the top? On the Nov. 30, 1968, chart, Diana Ross & The Supremes' “Love Child,” the group's 11th leader, swapped in for The Beatles' “Hey Jude,” their 16th.


	HUNTR/X's “Golden” holds at No. 3 on the Hot 100, after eight weeks at No. 1 beginning last August; Olivia Dean's “Man I Need” repeats at its No. 4 high; and Alex Warren's “Ordinary,” which reigned for 10 weeks starting last May, drops 2-5, as it claims a 26th week at No. 1 on Radio Songs (67.5 million, down 6%).


	Ella Langley's “Choosin' Texas” backtracks to No. 6 from its No. 5 Hot 100 best as it leads the Hot Country Songs chart for an eighth week.


	Djo's “End of Beginning” descends to No. 7 on the Hot 100 a week after it reached the top 10, at No. 6. It rules the multimetric Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart for a second week.


	Rounding out the Hot 100's top 10, sombr's “Back to Friends” is steady at No. 8 after hitting No. 7; Kehlani's “Folded” falls to No. 9 from its No. 7 high; and Swift's “Opalite” slips 9-10, after reaching No. 2.

	Leila Cobo and Jason Lipshutz have been promoted to co-chief content officers of Billboard, the global music brand announced Tuesday (Jan. 20).


	The pair will share oversight of Billboard's editorial content and newsroom operations, as well as marquee franchises including Women in Music, Latin Music Week, The Stage at SXSW and beyond.


	“I am so proud to recognize two incredibly deserving talents within the organization,” said Jay Penske, chairman and CEO of Penske Media Corporation, Billboard's parent company. “Leila is one of the most well-regarded voices and leaders in Latin American music today. She has brought unprecedented awareness to the genre, championing talent and building globally recognized franchises that celebrate it. Similarly, Jason is one of the most trusted voices in modern pop music and brings passion and creativity to his work. I look forward to watching Leila and Jason helm Billboard's editorial content and evolve it for the future.”

	Both are veterans of the brand, with Cobo previously serving as the chief content officer of Billboard Latin, while Lipshutz was Billboard's executive director of music. Cobo will continue to oversee Billboard's Latin music coverage while adding country music to her scope; Lipshutz will continue to oversee pop music while adding rock, hip-hop and dance to his role.


	Cobo and Lipshutz will report to Billboard CEO Mike Van, effective immediately.

	











	“We are thrilled to recognize such extraordinary leaders within our organization,” Van said. “What Leila has been able to create over the years through her commitment to excellence, deep relationships and passion for music is unprecedented. Additionally, watching Jason grow with Billboard over the years into such a respected and committed leader of the organization is incredible. Together, Leila and Jason bring unmatched expertise, enthusiasm balanced with vision, and business savvy to these roles, positioning Billboard's world-class editorial content and events for a bold and exciting future.”


	Cobo is heralded as one of the foremost authorities on Latin music, having been the first U.S.-based journalist to cover the genre extensively daily. Since joining Billboard, Cobo has transformed how Latin music is covered in the U.S. and spearheads Billboard Latin Music Week, the largest gathering in the Latin music industry. Born and raised in Colombia, Leila is a Fulbright scholar with degrees in classical piano performance from Manhattan School of Music and a master's in communications from the Annenberg School at USC.


	“It's an honor to steer the content of Billboard, the most respected, forward-looking music media brand in the world,” Cobo said. “It is also a privilege to do so alongside Jason, an absolute encyclopedia of musical knowledge. I am thankful to Jay Penske and Mike Van for their unwavering belief in my ability and giving me this opportunity. I look forward to continuing to elevate diverse voices and genres, expanding Billboard's storytelling, and shining a spotlight on the global music landscape.”


	Lipshutz, a fixture of modern music journalism for more than a decade, has covered iconic artists such as Taylor Swift, U2 and Lorde while guiding Billboard‘s editorial strategy across pop and rock music. His book It Starts With One: The Legend and Legacy of Linkin Park was published in 2024.

	











	“I'm thrilled to lead an extraordinary team alongside my friend and colleague Leila Cobo, and grateful to PMC leadership for this opportunity,” Lipshutz said. “As someone who has worked at every level of the Billboard editorial team, I know the beating heart of this brand, understand the talent on our staff, and see the potential for what we can accomplish in the coming years.”

	On Tuesday (Jan. 20), Billboard announced the promotions of four team members: Lyndsey Havens has been named executive editor; Dan Rys is executive editor, business; Shira Brown is SVP Video; and Mary Rooney is SVP, Experiences.


	Also on Tuesday, Leila Cobo and Jason Lipshutz were promoted to co-chief content officers of Billboard, while editorial director Hannah Karp will depart for Warner Music.


	Havens, previously a deputy editor at Billboard, takes on the title of executive editor. Since joining Billboard as an intern in 2016 and swiftly becoming a full-time staff member, Havens has grown into one of the publication's most trusted and respected voices in modern music journalism. Known for her detailed storytelling and passion for music, she has penned compelling cover stories on such artists as Billie Eilish, Post Malone and Lil Yachty, while also expertly overseeing The Sound, Billboard magazine's music-driven section. Her commitment to groundbreaking reporting, from tracking vinyl trends to introducing Billboard's Managers to Watch list, has been instrumental in elevating Billboard's editorial standards.

	











	Rys, formerly Billboard's director of business news, will now serve as executive editor, business. Rys has been a trusted authority on music business journalism for more than a decade, covering everything from major record labels and publishers to innovative streaming platforms and emerging trends in the industry. Renowned for his incisive reporting, he has interviewed leading figures such as Eminem, Lucian Grainge and the Marley family, and spearheaded detailed investigative pieces on companies including Universal Music Group, EMPIRE and Primary Wave. Rys also oversees Billboard‘s regular Executive of the Week column and key business-focused reporting packages.




	Both Havens and Rys will report to co-chief content officers Cobo and Lipshutz effective immediately.


	“Dan Rys has evolved from a tireless industry reporter to a leader of Billboard‘s overall news and music business coverage over the past decade, while Lyndsey Havens has established herself as one of the most thoughtful and trusted editors in modern music journalism,” said Cobo and Lipshutz.


	Brown, who has been integral to Billboard‘s video initiatives, has been promoted to senior vice president, video and off platform growth. In this new leadership role, Brown will oversee growing audience and revenue streams across video, podcasts, apps, FAST and CTV. She will enhance viewers' journeys across all touch points, improve quality and scale of Billboard's video production, and drive growth through intellectual property development for new shows.


	Rooney has been promoted to SVP, Experiences, cementing her critical position within Billboard's live consumer event strategy and thought leadership efforts. Previously serving as VP of Events, Rooney has masterminded high-profile initiatives such as Billboard‘s Women in Music, Latin Music Week and The Stage at SXSW. Moving forward, she will helm all of Billboard's signature business events while driving new consumer-facing programs and elevating the overall brand identity.


	Both Brown and Rooney will continue reporting to Dana Droppo, Billboard's chief brand officer.


	“Shira Brown's leadership has been critical to our growth. In the last few years, she has guided a talented team and amplified our ability to reach music fans and professionals through video,” Droppo said. “Mary Rooney's experiential expertise and razor sharp event execution has pushed Billboard to new heights. These promotions are a testament to their essential contributions, and we couldn't be prouder of our team.”

	











	As Billboard proudly celebrates these internal promotions, the company also bids farewell to longtime editor in chief Hannah Karp. During her successful tenure at Billboard, Karp elevated the publication's editorial voice and continued its legacy of excellence in music industry coverage.

The singer told the audience on Saturday's event that it's ""really hard to celebrate that when we no longer feel safe in our own homes or in our streets.""

	A week after a Trump administration spokesperson slammed Billie Eilish for what she deemed the singer's “garbage rhetoric” about aggressive ICE immigration operations in Minnesota that resulted in the killing of American citizen and mother of three Renee Nicole Good by ICE officer Jonathan Ross, the Oscar-winning star doubled-down on her criticism of the White House's enforcement tactics.

	On Saturday (Jan. 17), Eilish was at the Hyatt Regency in Atlanta to accept the 2026 MLK Jr. Beloved Community Award For Environmental Justice, where her Changemaker Program — which allowed fans on her Hit Me Hard and Soft world tour to buy tickets that raised money for non-profits addressing climate change, food insecurity and climate justice — was honored for its plans to donate more than $11.5 million to those efforts.

	











	But Eilish, 24, who in October called out the world's billionaires and told them they should “give your money away” to help those in need, had more to say than a simple thank you for the honor. “To be honest, I really don't feel deserving. And it's very strange to be celebrated for working towards environmental justice at a time where it feels less achievable than ever given the state of our country and the world right now,” said Eilish, according to The Hollywood Reporter. 




	The outspoken Eilish then took aim at what she deemed the turbulent, chaotic state of our nation in the midst of the Trump immigration crackdown and roll-back of President Biden's historic environmental initiatives in deference to big oil, adding, “We're seeing our neighbors being kidnapped, peaceful protesters being assaulted and murdered, our civil rights being stripped, resources to fight the climate crisis being cut for fossil fuels and animal agriculture destroying our planet, and people's access to food and healthcare becoming a privilege for the wealthy instead of a new basic human right for all Americans. It is very clear that protecting our planet and our communities is not a priority for this administration. And it's really hard to celebrate that when we no longer feel safe in our own homes or in our streets.”


	Following the Jan. 7 killing of Good, 37, who was shot three times at point-blank range by Ross while she appeared to be driving away from him, Eilish ripped into ICE on her Instagram Story, writing, “ICE is a federally funded and supported terrorist group under the department of homeland security that has done nothing to make our streets safer.”


	At Saturday's event that also featured a performance from Chance the Rapper, Eilish admitted that the words and deeds of the other honorees inspired her to keep using her platform to push for change. “I am so inspired by all the stories and the other honorees tonight and everyone in this room, and I'm grateful to everyone and for the huge community of people who are taking action centered on Dr. King's message,” Eilish said. “I just want to thank my mom, both my parents, for raising me the way they did. I wouldn't be doing any of this without you, Mom. I have this platform and I think it's my responsibility to use it, so I feel like I'm just doing what anyone in my position should be doing.” 

	











	The MLK Beloved Community Awards, co-hosted by Tony winner Anika Noni Rose (Princess and the Frog) and Aldis Hodge (Cross) will air on BET in February.

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: Irish actor Diarmaid Murtagh, known for roles in series Outlander, The Tourist and Vikings, will next be seen on screen this summer as one of the villains in DC's Supergirl.


	Murtagh will play Drom Baxton, second in command of The Brigands, which is led by Krem Of The Yellow Hills, the lead villain played by Matthias Schoenaerts. The ruthless space pirates and human traffickers are the main antagonists in the film.


Supergirl, which releases in June, charts the origin story of Superman's cousin Kara Zor-El (Milly Alcock) before she finally makes her way to Earth. Craig Gillespie directs with previously announced cast including Eve Ridley, Emily Beecham, David Corenswet, David Krumholtz and Jason Momoa.

	











	The film is based on the Tom King's 2022 comic book series Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, which Bilquis Evely illustrated, and Ana Nogueira adapted the comic book for the big screen. In the comic, Supergirl and young alien girl Ruthye Marye Knoll travel across the galaxy to hunt Krem of the Yellow Hill after he kills Knolle's father in cold blood. It has been billed among fans as being akin to the John Wayne classic, True Grit.


			Watch on Deadline		







	Murtagh plays series regular William Buck Mackenzie in Starz hit Outlander, Donal McDonnell in HBO Max drama The Tourist and Leif in Vikings. In post is movie action-thriller The Butler with Jean Reno.

International TV Co-Editor


Netflix has switched its agreement for Warner Bros. Discovery to an all-cash deal. The new offer still values Warners at $27.75 per share, but it removes the $4.50 Netflix stock element, which was part of the earthshaking agreement revealed last December.


	Discovery Global, the parent of cable networks CNN, TNT, Food Network and many others, is not part of Netflix's proposal. Prior to the M&A action, WBD had said it intends to split into two companies this year. Under the Netflix plan, the split would still happen within the next six to nine months, prior to Netflix taking over the studio and streaming side of the media giant.

	











	Bloomberg reported last week that Netflix was looking to switch its proposal to all-cash. 




			Watch on Deadline		







Paramount Skydance, meanwhile, has made a hostile bid for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, including the cable networks. The Larry Ellison-backed media company said last week it plans to mount a proxy fight in order to prevail in the M&A tug of war. Paramount has also sued WBD in Delaware Chancery Court, aiming to compel WBD to disclose more data about its dealmaking process.


	Both Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery said the agreement “provides enhanced certainty” to WBD shareholders by “eliminating market-based variability.” The new agreement, still worth the previous $82.7 billion, would also likely led to a faster pathway to a shareholder vote on the transaction, which is projected to happen by April 2026.


RELATED: Ted Sarandos Says Netflix Will Commit To 45-Day Window After WB Acquisition; Doesn't Want To “Overread” Donald Trump Comments About Merger












	The agreement also heaps the pressure back on the other WBD suitor, Paramount, which has been lobbying to get the Netflix deal quashed and allow for its own offer of $30 per share to be taken forward. Paramount's offer factors in the Discovery portion of the business, which Netflix is not buying.


	The amended, all-cash transaction was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both Netflix and WBD, and remains subject to completion of the Discovery Global spinoff, regulatory approvals, approval of WBD stockholders and other closing conditions. President Donald Trump has signaled both support and distrust for the deal, but his say will play a major factor in the deal going through.


	WBD today gave a price to the spinoff Discovery Global after advisors applied three different metrics. The first values the company at a low of $1.33 per share and a high of $3.24. Should Discovery Global become involved in a “potential future transaction,” this could rise to as much as $6.86, per a proxy filing made in the past few hours.


	“Today's revised merger agreement brings us even closer to combining two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world and with it even more people enjoying the entertainment they love to watch the most,” said David Zaslav, President and CEO of WBD.


	“By coming together with Netflix, we will combine the stories Warner Bros. has told that have captured the world's attention for more than a century and ensure audiences continue to enjoy them for generations to come.”


RELATED: Democratic Lawmaker Calls On Paramount To Voluntarily Submit A Warner Bros. Discovery Transaction To Federal Foreign Ownership Review


	“The WBD Board continues to support and unanimously recommend our transaction, and we are confident that it will deliver the best outcome for stockholders, consumers, creators and the broader entertainment community,” said Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix.


	“Our revised all-cash agreement will enable an expedited timeline to a stockholder vote and provide greater financial certainty at $27.75 per share in cash, plus the value from the planned separation of Discovery Global. Together, Netflix and Warner Bros. will deliver broader choice and greater value to audiences worldwide, enhancing access to world-class television and film both at home and in theaters. The acquisition will also significantly expand U.S. production capacity and investment in original programming, driving job creation and long-term industry growth.”


	Netflix is set to report fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday afternoon. Shares in the streaming giant perked up 1% in pre-market trading.

If the Netflix-WB deal was always “the best deal” for shareholders according to the WB board, then why is Netflix “improving” its own offer?

Netlix old deal was better because WB knew they would get it all, this deal is even better

It's go big or go home time for David. If you want it, up the offer to $35 and buy it.

Not worth it. WB has been a pariah company for more than two decades. This will be worse than the Fox/Disney merger.

Hurry up and close the deal before Paramount makes another offer with Saudis help. Plus Netflix doesn't have enough existing IP in their hands. Majority of their current content are licensed which the owner can take away for their own streaming. Example are shows saying “Netflix exclusive” yet don't own them.

Russell Brand was granted bail today on two further sexual offense charges as he appeared in court via videolink from his Florida home.


	Brand spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth, according to reports, before he was given bail. He will next appear at a plea hearing at London's Southwark Crown Court on February 17. 


	He appeared via videolink from Florida. He has a house in Oxfordshire, UK, but has been living in the U.S. full time of late and has been very much involved with the ‘MAGAsphere,' having been reported to have attended events at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. An extradition battle had been anticipated when he was initially charged with his first set of offenses although he has been to London for a plea hearing on these other charges.

	Brand was charged with two additional counts of rape and sexual assault in December last year. They are on top of previous charges, which were two of rape, one of indecent assault and two of sexual assault. For those, he has pleaded not guilty and his trial begins over the summer.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Detectives started investigating Brand more than two years ago following a high-profile Channel 4 and Sunday Times investigation. They then charged the former comedian and TV presenter with one count of rape, one count of indecent assault, one count of oral rape and two counts of sexual assault.


	The initial revelations on Channel 4 and in the Sunday Times led to much anger and introspection. Since then, the BBC, Channel 4 and Big Brother producer Banijay have all conducted internal investigations, having worked with Brand on shows up until late last decade. All these probes have led to apologies and further revelations. The most recent report from the BBC found that staff at the UK broadcaster's L.A. bureau had “joked about” an incident in which the star was alleged to have exposed himself to a woman in a bathroom. Channel 4's report unearthed “two new worrying allegations” against Brand, who had worked on that network's Celebrity Bake Off as recently as 2018. Brand was also accused in a lawsuit of sexually assaulting a film extra on the New York City set of the 2011 romantic comedy Arthur.

	Other directors in the mix with a strong festival pedigree include Indigenous Australian filmmaker Warwick Thornton with Wolfram, a period Western set in the 1930s about three Aboriginal children who escape brutal servitude in the wolfram mines and embark on a dangerous journey across Central Australia. Thornton won the Cannes Caméra d'Or for his first film, Samson and Delilah, in 2009 and was back at the festival in 2023 with The New Boy starring Cate Blanchett. 

	











	German-Turkish filmmaker İlker Çatak also returns to the festival fray with Turkey-set drama Yellow Letters. It is first feature since his Germany-set drama The Teacher's Lounge which enjoyed a buzzy awards-season run in 2024 after quietly premiering in Berlin's Panorama section in 2023.Germany has a strong showing in competition this year, with Eva Trobisch, who previously made waves with buzzy 2018 MeToo drama All Is Well, debuting her third feature Home Stories, and two-time Silver Bear-winning director Angela Schanelec unveiling My Wife Cries.


	World cinema is also represented with French-Senegalese director Alain Gomis' drama Dao, exploring family bonds and heritage through a wedding in France and a commemoration in Guinea Bissau, and Mahamat-Saleh Haroun's Soumsoum, the Night of the Stars.


	As previously revealed in Deadline's 2026 Films to Light Up Festivals list, Chadian director Haroun's new film follows a woman troubled by haunting visions whose friendship with a female outcast stirs up trouble in their village. One of Africa's most feted directors, Haroun's past films include A Dry Season, A Screaming Man and Lingui.

	A total of 13 films were unveiled for the Perspectives competition, launched by Tuttle last year with a focus on first features, with a possibility of a 14th being announced at a later date.


	Highlights include Animol, the feature directorial debut of veteran UK actor and musician Ashley Walters (Top Boy), which is produced by Joy Gharoro-Akpojotor, and Israeli director Assaf Machnes' Berlin-set Where To?, about a series of encounters between a reserved 55-year-old Palestinian Uber driver and a young, outspoken Israeli who keeps getting lost in the city.


	In her opening remarks today, Tuttle alluded to the battle currently underway for independent cinema.


	“It's a battle to keep independent cinemas open; to keep distributors and exhibitors who champion independent film thriving and making sure they can still take risks. It's a battle to ensure that cinema culture can retain its breadth,” she said.


	She welcomed the presence of stars in the line but also emphasized the festival's role in championing emerging voices.


	“We relish the role that we play in building anticipation for bold and new and unknown work, breaking new voices, and also enabling discovery of cinema.”

From what I understand, Rosebush Pruning is a remake of Fists in the Pocket. Looking forward to a twisted picture.

Brooklyn Beckham's wife, Nicola Peltz, looked uncomfortable when she posed with her beau's famous family in a resurfaced video.

During the 2023 red carpet premiere of the Netflix docuseries “Beckham,” David and Victoria Beckham posed together before the rest of the family joined them for photos. 

As Brooklyn, 26, walked over to join his relatives, he grabbed Peltz, 31, by the hand and led her to the left side of the group snap.

The stony-faced “Lola” star, who rocked a red leather mini dress and tights, stood at the end of the lineup as Brooklyn placed his hand around her waist. 

Peltz seemingly only interacted with her husband during the photo opp.

Several fans pointed out how “uncomfortable” the heiress looked in the photos.

“Could Victoria's shoulder be more cold?” said one user, per the Mirror.

“They look so uncomfortable here. Sad. You can cut the atmosphere with a knife,” added another.

“Well they all look happy…,” quipped a third person.

The resurfaced video comes after Brooklyn issued a scathing statement about his family, claiming his parents did everything they could to “ruin” his marriage.

“I do not want to reconcile with my family,” the former photographer wrote on his Instagram Stories Monday. 

“I'm not being controlled, I'm standing up for myself for the first time in my life. For my entire life, my parents have controlled narratives in the press about our family,” he added.

“For my entire life, my parents have controlled narratives in the press about our family [with] performative social media posts, family events and inauthentic relationships.”

Brooklyn claimed his mom, Victoria, 51, even caused issues during his 2022 wedding to Peltz.

“My mum cancelled making Nicola's dress in the eleventh hour despite how excited she was to wear her design, forcing her to urgently find a new dress.”

The former Spice Girls singer also allegedly hijacked her eldest son's first dance with the bride in a “deeply hurtful” stunt.

The “Cookin' With Brooklyn” star also claimed David, 50, and Victoria allegedly “repeatedly pressured and attempted to bribe” Brooklyn into “signing away the rights to” his name ahead of the Florida nuptials.

To erase the hurtful memories from their Palm Beach, Fla., nuptials, the “Bates Motel” alum and Brooklyn renewed their vows in August 2025 to “create new memories of our wedding day that bring us joy and happiness, not anxiety and embarrassment.”

The Beckhams have not responded to their son's claims.

Kyle Cooke took a dig at Amanda Batula in a commment on her social media, just days before the “Summer House” stars announced their official split. In an Instagram post on Jan. 14, Batula, 34, shared a carousel of photos from 2016, in keeping with a currently popular viral trend. Her husband, Cooke, 43, was notably not present in any of the shots. “I guess I was never in your camera roll,” Cooke wrote in the comments section, adding a laugh-crying emoji. Five days later, the pair jointly announced their split on an Instagram Story post.

“After much reflection, we have mutually and amicably decided to part ways as a couple,” they wrote. “We share this with a heavy heart and kindly ask for your grace and support while we focus on our personal growth and healing.”

“It feels ironic to ask for privacy at this time since we've always tried to be open and honest about our relationship,” they added. “But your kindness and respect will go a long way as we try to navigate our next chapter.”Fans flocked to the earlier post, with several noting “This didn't age well” to Cooke's comment about being left out.

The now ex-couple began dating in 2016 during the first season of “Summer House.” They tied the knot in September 2021 at her family's New Jersey home.

Viewers have witnessed many ups and downs for the pair, as Cooke previously admitted to cheating on Batula shortly before they got engaged in 2018. Infidelity rumors continued to plague the duo throughout their relationship, but the couple remained staunch in presenting a united front.

However, their marital problems took center stage in Bravo's “Summer House” Season 10 trailer, which was released Dec. 7, 2025. In one much-talked-about incident, Batula accused Cooke of sleeping at a fan's apartment and coming home “at like, 6:30 in the morning.”

Page Six previously reported in November 2025 that a source exclusively told us they could be heading for divorce, alleging that the pair were living separately while they work through the “challenging time” in their relationship.

The two also have notably been on different pages about where to live and when to start a family.

Moment of truth.

Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz's wedding guests set the record straight on the chef's claims that Victoria Beckham danced “inappropriately” with her son at his 2022 nuptials.

Stavros Agapiou — the partner of British DJ Fat Tony, who was asked to perform at Peltz and Brooklyn's wedding reception — backed the nepo baby in a now-deleted Instagram comment.

“I was there and she did he's telling the truth,” Agapiou wrote.

After deleting his response, Agapiou wrote: “Good on him for finally speaking out!”

Page Six has reached out to Agapiou for comment but did not immediately hear back.

After Agapiou's comment went viral, he took to his Instagram Stories Tuesday, sharing a mirror selfie and writing, “Keeping my mouth shut from now on.”

Additionally, Brooklyn claimed his famous parents allegedly “repeatedly pressured and attempted to bribe” him into “signing away the rights to” his name ahead of the Palm Beach, Fla., wedding ceremony.

After Brooklyn's comments made headlines, his and Peltz's resurfaced interview with Vogue proved there were some inconsistencies in his allegations.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Tori Amos announces new album 'In Times of Dragons'","https://www.avclub.com/tori-amos-announces-in-times-of-dragons","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:04:48 GMT","

Tori Amos has announced her 18th studio album, In Times of Dragons, due out May 1 via Universal/Fontana. True to form, it's not a quiet return: the record arrives framed as a sweeping, politically charged allegory, complete with dragons, tyrants, and a familiar Amos-ian fusion of the mythic and the painfully real.

In Times of Dragons follows a busy and unusually wide-ranging few years for Amos. After 2021's Ocean to Ocean, she released Tori and the Muses, the soundtrack to her New York Times-bestselling children's book of the same name, which earned a Grammy nomination in 2025. That project underscored her ongoing interest in mythmaking and storytelling—an impulse that now returns, sharpened and politicized, in her new studio work.

In a press release, Amos describes In Times of Dragons as “a metaphorical story about the fight for Democracy over Tyranny,” positioning the album as a response to what she calls the real-time erosion of democratic structures in the U.S. The project continues her decades-long practice of turning personal, political, and spiritual upheaval into narrative song cycles—less topical commentary than symbolic confrontation.

The album's newly unveiled cover art leans into that sense of ritual and timelessness. Created in collaboration with photographer Kasia Wozniak and stylist Karen Binns, the images were produced using a vintage RA-4 photographic process, with direct paper positives shot on a large-format camera. The result is tactile and deliberate, mirroring the album's themes of endurance, resistance, and transformation.

Amos will support In Times of Dragons with a 35-date U.S. summer tour beginning in July, with stops in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Nashville, Boston, Austin, Philadelphia, and a headlining performance at Red Rocks, among others. She'll be joined once again by longtime collaborators Jon Evans (bass, musical director) and Ash Soan (drums), along with backing vocalists Liv Gibson, Deni Hlavinka, and Hadley Kennary. An exclusive artist pre-sale begins January 21 at 10 a.m. local time via toriamos.com, followed by a general on-sale January 23.

The announcement follows a Grammy nomination for the soundtrack to Amos' children's book Tori and the Muses, and marks her first full-length studio album since 2021's Ocean to Ocean. With In Times of Dragons, Amos once again reaches for myth not as escape, but as a way of naming the moment—reminding us that when the language of politics fails, symbolism still knows how to bite.

While it's well established that some HGTV stars have become good friends off-camera, thanks to all the events they've attended and spin-off shows they've filmed together, many fans are just learning of the bond between two of the network's longtime stars — David Bromstad and Alison Victoria. 

On January 16, 2026, Victoria dove into the popular social media trend of posting throwback photos and memories from 2016. On Instagram and Facebook, she shared a series of decade-old images, including two of her with Bromstad, star of HGTV's hit series “My Lottery Dream Home.” Victoria wrote in her caption that 2016 was “the year I fell in love and in friendship with @bromco (look at our babyyyy faces),” and fans went wild over the pics and learning of their years-long connection. 

Victoria has regularly shared pics with other HGTV buddies, like her former “Battle on the Beach” co-stars Taniya Nayak and Ty Pennington, but many fans weren't aware that she's also such good friends with Bromstad. Her throwback post was flooded with comments from people swooning over the idea of them hanging out together. 

On Instagram, one exclaimed, “Oh [expletive] I'm in love with you both!!! 🔥🔥🔥” and another wrote, “Whaaaaaat I love these two!❤️🙌”

Someone else commented, “Love you both, and yet through it all still friends and you're both are thriving and kicking ass stronger than ever❤️❤️🙌❤️🙌❤️”

Another fan on Facebook admitted, ” I. AM. JEALOUS!! I want David to hang out with me! Actually, I want to hang with you BOTH!!” 

In 2024, Victoria told Realtor.com that her friendships with fellow HGTV stars are genuine, explaining, “They're my favorite people. When you see those connections, those are real friendships. Taniya Nayak is one of my best friends. Ty Pennington is like my brother. David Bromstad is like my other brother. Jonathan [Knight] and I, we clicked and connected. Sarah Baeumler is one of my really close friends, and Brian [Baeumler].”

“We just really love each other,” she continued, “and we really support each other, and that to me is a camaraderie that you just can't fake.”

Back in 2016, Victoria was the star of HGTV's “Kitchen Crashers,” a popular show that was the precursor to her series “Windy City Rehab” and 2025's “Sin City Rehab.” Ten years prior, in 2006, Bromstad was the first-ever winner of “HGTV Design Star” and landed his first show, “Color Splash,” which aired from 2007 to 2013. 

By 2016, he'd filmed one season of “My Lottery Dream Home,” but HGTV was struggling to find lottery winners who wanted to be on the show. It wasn't until season three that the series exploded in popularity. In 2015, he and Victoria appeared at a big HGTV event held in Nashville during the CMAs, but it wasn't until the following year that they really clicked, according to Victoria's post. 

Victoria wrote in her caption, “2016… you probably wouldn't have been as much if I stopped drinking back then. It was the year I fell in love and in friendship with @bromco (look at our babyyyy faces) and @guyfieri and @billycorgan, the year I went platinum blonde and all my hair broke off, the year I traveled more than a human should, but don't regret one.single.moment of doing so, the year I had my face plastered all over the streets of New York, the year I saved A LOT of dogs, the year I shot my 9th and final season of Kitchen Crashers…and the year that I clearly didn't stick to my resolutions. You're welcome.”

Interestingly, both Victoria and Bromstad shared their sober journeys with fans in 2025. In June, Victoria revealed on her podcast that she'd quit drinking eight months before, and Bromstad opened up in December about his struggles with substance abuse. 



I'm 1 of y'all biggest fans. I'll never be able to afford to have you decorate a house or help me purchase one, but you both decorate my life. Love you 🥰

Lori Loughlin's ex-husband Mossimo Giannulli, 62, still thinks highly of the “Full House” star despite their marriage ending after a college admissions scandal dubbed “Varsity Blues” ripped through the headlines in 2019.

In statements given to People from three separate sources, it was revealed that Giannulli is especially thankful for Loughlin's support of their two daughters, Isabella Rose, 27, and Olivia Jade, 26.

Despite wanting “everything resolved quietly,” according to a source, the fashion designer “thinks she's a lovely person and an incredible mom.”

Another insider stated that Loughlin, 61, “is still extremely angry with him,” while a third source shared that the former couple is living “separate lives” now that the dust has settled.

After having served a combined seven months in prison following their guilty plea to conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, Loughlin and Giannulli reportedly lost their romantic spark.

“Things have never been the same after weathering the college admission fallout and the prison sentences together,” a source told People shortly after the pair announced their divorce in October 2025.

Loughlin and Giannulli were married for 28 years before they decided to part ways. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the duo met at a Los Angeles restaurant in 1995.

When Loughlin began to open up about how she was coping following the widespread controversy, the “When Calls the Heart” actress felt compelled to discuss how forgiveness played a big part in her healing process.

“I try to be a forgiving person. I'm not one to hold onto stuff. Stuff happens to everyone,” she told First for Women in 2024. “We've all been in positions to ask for forgiveness, but to ask for it, you have to learn and know how to give forgiveness, too.”

The former couple's daughter Olivia, who, along with Isabella, was not charged in the University of Southern California bribery scandal, opened up on “Red Table Talk” in 2020, saying she didn't want to be “shamed” for the controversy.

“What happened was wrong, and I think every single person in my family can look at it and be like, ‘That was messed up; that was a big mistake,' but I think what's so important to me is to learn from the mistake,” she said. “Not to be shamed and punished and never given a second chance.”

Although Loughlin and Giannulli's romantic future is off the table, the beloved actress is still booked and busy and will make her anticipated return to Hallmark's “WCTH” season 14,” People reported.

One of the biggest wild cards heading to Park City with an eye to acquire films out of Sundance this year doesn't even have a name yet. 

In November, Warner Bros. hired three veterans from Neon — namely, the marketing guru behind “Longlegs,” Christian Parkes — to lead a new specialized division for films aimed at Gen Z. The label is so new it's likely to arrive on the ground without a formal name. It's anyone's guess what — or if — this to-be-named shingle will buy, but there's hope that it will provide a much-needed spark for the rest of the film market.

 










They're not the only ones. 

Paramount at the end of last year hired Lia Buman to head up acquisitions for its own specialized label Republic Pictures. Newly launched distributor Row K, which was just about the only distributor doing anything out of TIFF last year, could be positioned to be similarly aggressive at Sundance this year. Other new players like 1-2 Special, Black Bear, and WILLA will likewise be shopping and may be the difference between a healthy market and another slow one.

A year removed, last year's Sundance looks just fine. 

“Together” sold to Neon for eight figures, Netflix's “Train Dreams” is in the thick of the Oscar race, A24's “Sorry, Baby” just got a shout out from Julia Roberts on the Golden Globes stage, and acclaimed indies and even documentaries like “The Perfect Neighbor,” “Oh, Hi!,” “Predators,” “Come See Me in the Good Light,” “Rebuilding,” and “Twinless” all eventually found homes and good audiences. But almost nothing sold within the confines of the festival (though that's been increasingly less true for years), and a lot of other early buzz didn't pay off.

The hope among many heading to Park City (for the final time!) is that the new players this year can change that. More buyers is always good news for the health of the indie film business, even if the streaming tech giants and the traditional studio distributors aren't overspending but are instead being tactical with their dollars. 

As one sales agent told IndieWire, “They all want home runs now, but what constitutes a home run?”

Christopher Woodrow of Row K, which last fall launched and bought four movies out of TIFF including recent release “Dead Man's Wire,” said the market today is lacking a healthy number of independent distributors, and it opens the door for him to be aggressive. While Row K may not call its shot at Sundance but could wait for Berlin or Cannes to make a splash, he told IndieWire with assuredness that his company figures to be “one of the most active buyers” among indies this year.

 










“I think the fact that people are moving slowly, that sets an opportunity for a company like ours, because you can go in and — maybe not overpay — but get in there quicker than them, because their appetite can be maybe a little bit more, and you can get some really good titles,” he said.

The new Warner Bros. label and Paramount's Republic Pictures may be looking to make their own splash. For the WB label, its focus is lower-cost films that target digital natives and Gen Z audiences, and it's aiming for zeitgeist-driving fare utilizing highly efficient targeted marketing. All that corporate speak is a fancy way of saying that if there's another movie at Sundance like “Anora” or “Longlegs,” the former Neon folks are going to pounce.

“The major studios have their traditional forms of marketing, and the newer companies like Neon and A24 were using innovative ways to get the word out there, which is why Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy hired Christian, because he had done such an amazing job with what he did over at Neon for ‘Longlegs,' and I know that they like that,” said the mega genre-film producer Roy Lee, who is bringing his Fantasia Fest discovery “Undertone” to Sundance (A24 picked the film up out of that festival).

“I feel like a new leaf has turned over,” added Ben Ross, another producer on “Undertone.” “As much as everyone's talking about doom and gloom, when new well-capitalized companies are coming in, the people who capitalize those companies are smart, and they're getting into that business because they're smart people who know how to deploy their money.”

 










Sundance too seems to have acknowledged that shift in the market. Roughly only a dozen of the 94 features and episodic pilots have distributors coming into the festival, and whereas last year veered indie, 2026 is more well-rounded with genre films, sobering indies, commercial comedies, and international gems. 

Justin Lotrhop, a producer on the Olivia Colman film “Wicker,” said it the market is “starting to reward movies that feel left of center and a little bit different.” Good thing, too, because his movie is about a fisherwoman who crafts a husband out of a wicker basket.

“Whether that's ‘Everything Everywhere All at Once' or ‘Parasite,' those movies have been proving to do well for financiers, and seeing that Paramount and WB are creating these specialty labels to get involved in smaller movies, there's a reason to be optimistic that the indie film landscape is going to continue to be healthy,” Lothrop said.

That excitement aside, one agent acknowledged that when new players come into the market, it's because older buyers are starting to go out. Buyers might be wary of overpaying the way MUBI did for something like “Die My Love” at Cannes last year, and that's especially true for emerging companies. 

But the agents saw holes on the slates of a number of distributors that could lead to a few sales. Sony Pictures Classics is expected to need some films, the agent said, Focus Features is looking for a couple of titles to fill out a slate of 14 films in 2026, another source said, and even though they don't have the Pay-1 deals, distributors like 101 Studios, Magnolia, Vertical, Ketchup, and Roadside are all still in play. And whether Warner Bros.' new arm becomes something that can work with Netflix or become something that operates on its own, agents are waiting for those first few acquisitions before drawing conclusions. 

 










Because even the most acclaimed indies have struggled at the box office, it's incumbent on indie producers to have a core audience they're targeting and up to distributors on how to meet that targeted approach.

“It shouldn't be about squeezing every last dollar that you can to get the highest bidder. It is about what is the plan, what is the idea? Who do you connect to best? And what do you think is the right fit for you and your movie,” Row K president Megan Colligan said. “That is an important conversation that needs to take place and that filmmakers really understand that they're in the right home for their film, because for many filmmakers they're beginning a relationship that will last a very long time.”

Brad Becker-Parton, who produced the Will Poulter addiction drama “Union County,” said that if you can start by making a movie for a small amount of people first, “you have a shot.” 

“On this movie we were conscious of having, at the very least, a core audience who, this could be their favorite movie, that it could really speak to a core audience, and then a bigger relationship to the movie blossoms from there,” Becker-Parton said. “Those are really the only things you can control as a producer. I never want to make completely uncommercial movies for nobody.”

 










Producer Apoorva Charan's film “Take Me Home” is aimed squarely at the caregiving community and to those living with cognitive disabilities, and she's hopeful that when it comes to these new distributors, the playbook won't be the same but will instead create direct pathways and relationships with audiences. 

“They give me a lot of hope because I feel like they will understand what this film is and how to reach the audiences. Something that we're looking for when we're looking for distributors is, who is that partner, and who's going to engage with our audiences the way that we hope to,” Charan said. “Are they going to have significant box office results? I don't know that they're going to be breaking barriers there, but I do think they're going to be breaking barriers in which audiences they target.”

The Berlin Film Festival, happening February 12 – 22, has revealed the Competition and Perspectives lineups for it 76th edition.

On the competition side, 22 films will compete for prizes including the Golden and Silver Bears, with a first feature, animated film, and documentary among those titles, with 28 countries represented. Twenty are world premieres, nine are directed or co-directed by women, and 14 are festival alumni.

“We've found so much to fall in love with in this year's bumper Competition line-up. And we are so confident in the charms of these 22 films that we say defiantly, ‘If you don't find something here to love, you don't love cinema!' Satirical and formalist comedy, genre, a psychological thriller, a love story, a self-love story, anime, a Western… these 22 films show off just how diverse great cinema is in 2026. Each one is beautifully crafted and delivers on its own artistic promise. We can't wait to discover the films that will receive the Golden Bear and the Silver Bears from Wim Wenders' jury on February 21st,” said Tricia Tuttle, festival director.

The studio best-known for its beloved stop-motion features like “Coraline” and “ParaNorman,” Laika began the process of reintroducing itself to the world last summer. But one big question remained: Who would actually release the studio's films as they ramped back up after the disappointment of their last release, “Missing Link”?

The studio has worked before with everyone from Focus Features to Annapurna Pictures and United Artists Releasing, but as it readied to bring its latest stop-motion effort, “Wildwood,” to theaters, word on who would actually be responsible for its distribution was slim. Now, an answer: Fathom Entertainment will serve as the film's U.S. theatrical distributor, with FilmNation Entertainment on board for international sales.

Two answers, real quick: yes, Fathom Entertainment has been steadily edging into the wider distribution world beyond its bread-and-butter of one-off event screenings around everything from opera to sports events, and no, this is not the first time Laika has teamed up with the group. Fathom has recently been behind the theatrical re-releases of both “Coraline” (which picked up $56 million worldwide) and a limited engagement of “ParaNorman.”

Laika and Fathom film will open “Wildwood” in theaters nationwide on October 23, 2026. The film is billed as “a handcrafted epic fantasy that transports audiences into a secret, dangerously alive world.” It follows “a girl's desperate quest to save her baby brother becomes a high-stakes journey into a forbidden forest filled with enchanted creatures, unlikely allies, and formidable adversaries, where an entire hidden realm hangs in the balance.”

The film's voice cast includes Carey Mulligan, Peyton Elizabeth Lee, Jacob Tremblay, Mahershala Ali, Angela Bassett, Awkwafina, Jake Johnson, Charlie Day, Amandla Stenberg, Jemaine Clement, Maya Erskine, Tantoo Cardinal, Tom Waits, and Richard E. Grant.

“Wildwood is a testament to Laika walking its own path,” said David Burke, the studio's chief marketing and operations officer, in an official statement. “For ‘Wildwood,' we're taking a more customized approach to how we bring the film to audiences, matching partners to the specific needs and ambitions of the project. Partnering with Fathom's Denver-based team brings national perspective and operational strength to the U.S. release, while working with FilmNation internationally positions the film with scale, reach, and deep expertise in global markets. It's a strategy built specifically for ‘Wildwood,' preserving LAIKA's independence while aligning with world-class collaborators to support the film's ambition.”

 










Added Travis Knight, president and chief executive officer of Laika and director of “Wildwood,” “'Wildwood' is the biggest world Laika has ever built, and the most personal. It's a story about the pull of the unknown, the courage it takes to step into it, and who you become along the way. Our movie is a celebration of artistry over algorithms, and of the belief that films made by hand, with enormous care, can still feel bold, surprising, dangerous, and alive. We designed Wildwood to be seen the way movies first captured our imaginations: discovered in the dark, on a big screen, with a room full of fellow dreamers experiencing joy, silence, and wonder together.”

It's just one more step in Laika's big return to the movies. The studio's Live Action subsidiary also has a range of projects in development, including a feature film based on the action thriller novel “Seventeen” by screenwriter John Brownlow; the original script “Crumble,” written and directed by Brian Duffield with Phil Lord and Chris Miller producing; and an original project from Oscar-nominated screenwriter Jon Spaihts. 

“Captain Marvel” and “Half Nelson” filmmakers Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck are also on board to write and direct Laika's live-action adaptation of #1 New York Times bestselling author Taylor Jenkins Reid's novel “Atmosphere.” And Lucy Liu and Charles Melton will star in director Lulu Wang's film version of Katie Kitamura's bestselling novel “Audition,” which Laika is producing alongside Higher Ground Productions.

Beneath the pristine surface of a country club in the Philippines, a sinister buried truth.

One of the films ready to make a splash out of the Sundance Film Festival‘s 2026 World Cinema Dramatic Competition is first-time writer/director Rafael Manuel's “Filipiñana.” With a surreal visual language that hat-tips everyone from Jacques Tati to Michael Haneke and the filmmaker's longtime mentor Jia Zhangke, the film is a striking, startling class critique based on Manuel's own Silver Bear-winning 2020 short film (which you can watch now on the Criterion Channel, by the way). 

 










IndieWire debuts an exclusive teaser of the film below, an excerpted musical interlude in the movie that gives a sense of reality dislodging from itself at the stately, posh golf course.

Here's more of the film from its circulating synopsis: “Amid stifling heat and pervasive drought, Isabel, a 17-year-old Ilokana from the rural north works at the posh Alabang Country Club outside Manila, lining up golf balls for powerful men to drive into the verdant horizon. New to the job, she wanders the immaculate grounds sampling its luxuries as members, including an industrialist and his expatriate niece, the club president and his pampered wife, and a slew of Chinese tourists, engage in a complex dance with the club's doting and subservient staff. But something is rotting beneath the pristine fairways of the elite resort, as Isabel discovers when she tries to return a mislaid golf club to its patriarchal director, Dr. Palanca. The deeper she journeys into Alabang's most exclusive corners, the closer she gets to the violent truths of the club, her native Philippines, and her own past.”

 










As the Sundance programming staff shared in its official guide,” through a stylized, colorful approach lensed with care and precision by cinematographer Xenia Patricia, Manuel takes us into a world where violence and control are exerted with the subtle flick of a wrist or tip of a hat. Painting a scathing portrait of class disparities and post-colonial power structures in ways that are both quiet and unsettling, ‘Filipiñana' announces the arrival of an accomplished writer-director who unflinchingly confronts his country's past, present, and future.”

“Filipiñana” is currently seeking distributors at Sundance, with Magnify handling sales. The movie premieres at Sundance on Friday, January 23, though it looks for now like all screenings are sold out until it bows on the online streaming platform.

It's also playing the 2026 Berlin Film Festival in the perspectives section.

Snail Mail has announced her first album in five years. Ricochet is out March 27 via Matador. Lindsey Jordan co-directed the music video for lead single “Dead End” with Elsie Richter. Watch it below.

“We shot the video for ‘Dead End' in random places all around rural North Carolina between the hours of 5pm and 4am on one of the coldest nights of my life,” Jordan said in a press statement. “The goal was to be inconspicuous with the fireworks, but someone called the cops on us.”

Jordan's last album as Snail Mail, Valentine, came out in 2021. Since then, she's launched a music festival in her hometown of Baltimore, Maryland, appeared in Jane Schoenbrun's film I Saw the TV Glow, and covered songs by Superdrag, Pavement, Lou Reed, and This Is Lorelei.

Jordan will tour Ricochet across North America beginning in April. She'll be joined by Sharp Pins at almost all stops, with additional support coming from Avalon Emerson & the Charm, @, Swirlies, Armlock, and Rocket. Scroll down to check out all of Snail Mail's upcoming shows.

Pitchfork has been publishing album reviews almost every day for 30 years. Each one has a score on a 0.0 to 10 scale, and underneath is a thoughtful consideration of the album from one of our writers. This simple format has always been the foundation of our site.

We practice this obsessive ritual of publishing daily album reviews because we love music and want to deepen our readers' relationship to the artform. And since the beginning, Pitchfork's highly opinionated and carefully argued reviews have kick-started online conversations elsewhere on the internet: listservs, message boards, and later, social media.

Now, I am excited to announce that, for the first time, we are making it possible for that ongoing conversation to happen on Pitchfork.com.

Starting today, there is a new Pitchfork subscription that costs $5 a month, which allows readers to score albums themselves, comment on our reviews, and be in dialogue with our critics and each other. (Can't decide if an album is a 6.8 or a 7.2? Read our new Scoring Guidelines here.)

Once a review has more than five scores, the aggregate reader score will appear beneath Pitchfork's score on the review. We still believe in the authority and, to be honest, the primacy of Pitchfork's taste—but we want to publish our readers' taste and opinions, too. The comments section will be moderated by our editors and adhere to our new Community Guidelines. Subscribers will also have access to Pitchfork's full review archive, which now contains over 30,000 reviews.

For non-subscribers, the News, Features, and Columns sections of the site will continue to be free. And casual readers can continue to read four free reviews per month. But to read unlimited reviews, see the reader scores, and comment yourself or read the comments of others, you'll have to smash subscribe.

What we're emphasizing by evolving the site to capture the voices and taste of our readers is that music and music criticism are inherently social. The Pitchfork review has always been authoritative. It can sometimes feel like the final word, a monkey peeing in its own mouth etched into a stone slab. But we publish reviews to turn people onto new music we love (or to save them from music we don't) and to create critical discourse. We want our reviews to be generative, and we hope the comments section and other cool new tools on the site will deepen our readers' connection to music and each other.

Thanks to every one of you for reading Pitchfork, whether you've been here since Ryan Schreiber was publishing the site out of his parents' home, or you just found us because this letter is making the rounds on X. We believe the tools that we've packed into this new subscription are worth the $5—and the money you invest in us will continue to fund our dedication to the vital art of music criticism. You'd be hard-pressed to find a publication today with a more loyal and dedicated following. With your support, we've somehow found ourselves at year 30. Let's make it another 30.

There is a new Pitchfork subscription—only costs $5 a month—that gives readers the ability to score albums, comment on our reviews, and chop it up with our writers, editors, and one another. With the power to score albums now firmly in your hands, it's only fitting that we try to give you a better understanding of how we rate albums.

We have a saying here at the office: “6.8, good not great.” However, if you would like a more detailed breakdown on how to use the Pitchfork rating system, here is a scoring rubric we use to help guide our thinking behind scoring albums on a 101-point scale.

A masterpiece, one of the best albums of all time. Will be culturally and aesthetically important many years from now in some way.

A monument, an instant classic. Sounds ahead of its time, sounds timeless, immediately belongs in the canon. Entire genres could be created in its wake.

A major statement, worthy of your time and energy, no matter your taste. Transcends genre, claims new ground, a total and intentional work of art, possesses an aura that makes it vital to its genre, its era, or the artist's career.

Essential listening, among the best records of the year. Shows a mastery of craft or taps into the sublime, feels a part of the zeitgeist, steps out of its genre, takes big risks that pay off.

Excellent record, highly recommended. “Best in class” for its genre. Not a bad song on it.

Very good record, recommend checking it out. Hardly a dull moment, a great hang, maybe plays it safe but executes everything very well, maybe takes some risks but doesn't land everything perfectly.

Good record, a few issues, but worth your attention if you're into the band or genre. Maybe starts strong and fades a little by the end, includes a few songs that don't move the needle, but also has a handful of outstanding moments.

Pretty good, not great, some unavoidable issues, but interesting. Fans of the band or genre will get the most out of it.

Decent record, a few things going for it, but a handful of major issues overwhelm the experience.

Not very good, but not a total disaster.

Pretty bad.

Really bad. Incompetent and thoughtless.

Terrible.

Terrible and symptomatic of some kind of larger problem in music or the world.

Worthless.

For all the conspicuously expensive samples, the breathless reporting about a $3 million record deal, the Vogue shoots, the white women muttering slurs, the Spike Lee movies, the guns, the kids, the feuds with superstars, and the overtures from a president, A$AP Rocky has always been best when stripped down to core principles. The invocations of Houston rap on “Purple Swag” are secondary to how deliberate and direct Rocky is; this was true of “Peso,” of “Goldie,” of everything that made him click. All the supposed post-regionalism—the borrowing from Houston and Memphis and the jagged online underground—was simply the medium through which a new Harlem superstar had chosen to express himself, like Big L's glossy hypertechnique or Cam'ron's Giuliani-baiting absurdity.

Don't Be Dumb, Rocky's first album in almost eight years, arrives at a time and in a manner that seems to be staked entirely on celebrity meta-commentary. Yet while his media circus of a 2025 trial provided something of an organizing structure (last February, Rocky was acquitted in Los Angeles on two counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, a felony for which he potentially faced more than 20 years in prison), and while he includes a mostly tepid response to Drake's “Family Matters,” Rocky largely uses his fourth LP to narrow his focus. Though poorly sequenced and littered with duds, Don't Be Dumb contains enough moments of ingenuity to argue that Rocky is still an essential part of the rap ecosystem

In some ways, the “almost eight years” timeline is misleading: The last Rocky album that felt like an event was 2015's At.Long.Last.A$AP. Testing, his record from three years later, failed to make the same impact on the charts or in the world as all his work that came before. But while it's derailed almost immediately by its second song, the T.I.-, Kid Cudi-, and Moby-featuring “A$AP Forever” remix—a near-perfect encapsulation of the baroque overproduction and preciousness that often drowned Rocky on 2013's Long.Live.A$AP—Testing later reveals some of the rapper's most interesting instincts. Songs like “Tony Tone,” “Praise the Lord (Da Shine),” “OG Beeper,” and “Hun43rd” are minimal, strange, and occasionally intricate—all staked on a vocal control that had emerged in the A.L.L.A. sessions but was not foregrounded on that album. For those who hung around long enough to hear it, the middle of Testing exhibits an A$AP Rocky who is no longer content to be just one instrument among many.

Don't Be Dumb is not exactly Rocky's rage-rap album, but the production is certainly informed by the quicker tempos that have come into vogue during his hiatus. The mix on early single “Helicopter” is busy, but the song is sharp and unidirectional; the album's best beats (Kelvin Krash, KayCyy, and SpaceGhostPurrp's “Swat Team,” and Rocky's own “No Trespassing” and “Air Force (Black Demarco)”) are defined by palpitating drums and a relentless forward motion. These underline—and in some cases are only navigable due to—that new vocal acuity. It's difficult to imagine the Rocky from Live.Love.A$AP moving between modes as fluidly as he does on “Air Force,” or the Rocky from Long.Live being confident enough to treat his vocals like the song's anchor.

Unfortunately, the energy flags: “Punk Rocky” is trite, the jazzy “Robbery” is hampered by an over-theatrical Doechii, and the Drake diss “Stole Ya Flow” is somehow emptier than Drake's non-insults (You're beautiful, I love your wife) from nearly two years ago. (The flaccidity of “Stole Ya Flow” is mitigated somewhat by Rocky's inclusion of a truly show-stopping verse from Sauce Walka on “Stop Snitching,” author of one of the most scathing Drake disses ever.) But before too long, these blemishes are balanced out by irresistibly low-stakes records like “Whiskey (Release Me),” which makes as intuitive a use of Tennesseean triplicate flow as Rocky has since 2011. Don't Be Dumb is not a blockbuster, and it's all the better for it.

Ya Tseen's Stand on My Shoulders sounds like waking up disoriented in someone else's dream—voices drift in and out, shifting between languages, and the psych-rock haze never quite resolves into clarity. This is Nicholas Galanin's design. Led by the multidisciplinary Tlingit/Unangax̂ artist, the album's sound diffuses like smoke slipping through the grasp. Words on love and politics are whispered and rapped in English, Spanish, Yupik, and Tlingit, and a cast of guest vocalists rotate in and out, yet the mood never breaks. The effect recalls a piece of Galanin's visual art, The Imaginary Indian (Arts and Crafts): a totem pole papered over to match the wall, like it's starring in Garden State.

Where Ya Tseen's first album, Indian Yard, bore more pop and R&B influence—echoing with subdued drums and sultry vocals from serpentwithfeet and Kelela—Stand on My Shoulders commits to a uniform mid-tempo pulse. If it runs the risk of becoming background ambiance for listeners seeking Indigenous art without confrontation, its refusal to generate rhythmic catharsis can also be read as an argument for sustained reflection. In Galanin's mercifully direct lyrics, Native dream psychology layers over intimate portrayals of kinship. The driving rock guitars and layered vocal textures recall TV on the Radio's experimentation, and Galanin shares certain vocal and political affinities with Moses Sumney. But where Sumney's work finds refusal in queer aromantic isolation, Galanin employs kinship—particularly romance—as a bulwark against the settler state.

“Dei Kee Tla Tin” (“To be on a high point and look far out to sea”)—named for his father, blues guitarist Dave Galanin (1955-2021)—demonstrates the power of this technique. Over fingerpicked guitar and ethereal harmonies, Galanin places a recording of his father describing his own artistic lineage. The light instrumentation creates space for Dave's voice to reverberate across generations—kinship as a survival practice and a sacred obligation. With this song, Galanin makes his intent clear: Stand on My Shoulders is carrying forward what ancestors made possible. Other songs, like “Twilight” and “I've Known,” channel the melancholic intimacy of Sufjan Stevens or the rock sensibility of Blood Orange, but here some of Galanin's romantic language doesn't feel direct so much as generic. Lines like, “I don't want to wake up/How did we get here?” risk universalizing what should remain specific: love as Indigenous futurity.

The album's opener, “Ircenrraat,” borrows from Yupik legend—the term refers to little people living in another dimension, beings both amazing and scary. Galanin sings of dreamwalkers speaking unfettered, perhaps imagining Native people free to speak their minds: scary and amazing to settler colonists. “Ixwsiteen (I See You)” and “Katlian's Hammer” offer the album's most direct political confrontation: The former's “A pig that won't sleep/A pig that just eats” invokes Black Power Movement lexicon for police, while the latter reanimates the Tlingít war chief Katlian, who wielded a blacksmith's hammer against Russian colonial forces in the 1804 Battle of Sitka. This is protest music rooted in historical defiance, though Galanin's whispered vocals and the album's placid pace imply distance rather than the reckoning demanded by a song like Snotty Nose Rez Kids' “Long Hair Don't Care.” Perhaps this is a strategic refusal of the performance expected from Indigenous protest music, a rejection of the urgency that white audiences demand from political art. Or perhaps it's an unresolved tension in the work: How does one call to arms through a dream?

As Chicano Batman revere love, drugs, and land, Ya Tseen prioritizes atmosphere, but the varied voices of the collaborators on Stand on My Shoulders don't always clarify the vision. Portugal. the Man, one of Alaska's most prominent bands, is again a tentpole feature, lending their radio-ready pop-funk to “Taste on My Lips,” also featuring singers Meshell Ndegeocello and Sidibe—who probably didn't imagine they'd wind up in such comically Washed Out-in-Portlandia territory. Pink Siifu appears briefly, then dissipates into the album's dreamlike drift. The stronger collaborations lean into sensuality: Sidibe's R&B coo and *Jahon Mikal's sybaritic delivery accentuate the love songs, and Anel Figueroa's Spanish refrains add warmth and texture. These moments offer relief from anticolonial intensity, a better exchange of emotional stakes for atmosphere.

Stand on My Shoulders enacts resistance through relationality—its title gesturing toward Galanin's father, its collaborations insisting on collective voice. The unsparing lyrics of “Ixwsiteen” and “Katlian's Hammer” refuse the passivity their sanguine instrumentals might otherwise suggest, and “Dei Klee Tla Tim”'s mixture of the personal and political is compelling. Resistance doesn't always announce itself with a raised fist; sometimes it whispers, and when Galanin is whispering alone, it works. When everyone's whispering at once, though, it gets harder to hear. The features feel like wallpaper over substance—I keep wanting to peel them back to reveal Galanin's voice underneath, the way that totem pole demands to be seen through its camouflage. Whether it's strategic refusal or diffusion of purpose, Stand on My Shoulders is most interesting when it resists the impulse to universalize.

	Donald Trump's administration has been working diligently to halt efforts to fight climate change and protect the environment since the president retook office last year. It gutted the climate provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act. It has been attempting to cancel clean energy projects. It's shut down climate research. In recent weeks, it has seemed like the administration is trying to put the nail in the coffin of America's environmental protection efforts.


	The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reportedly is now planning to end the practice of assessing the number of lives saved by regulations meant to curb air pollution from fine particulate matter and ozone. The news of the move came a week after the administration pulled the U.S. out of numerous international climate and environmental organizations, including the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).


	Calculating the lives saved by regulating air pollution used to be a bipartisan issue. Marshall Burke, a professor of global environmental policy at Stanford University, says this has been done for a long time without a lot of opposition from lawmakers.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“For decades, the EPA and other agencies in the U.S. government have done careful cost-benefit analyses to understand the impact of regulations on the U.S. economy and on individuals in the U.S.,” Burke says. “It's been pretty bipartisan. … This push for a cost-benefit analysis was largely a Republican push early on, decades ago. … Basically what the administration is saying now is we're just going to ignore the benefits.”

	











	Getting rid of this analysis will make it easier to do away with regulations that are saving human lives — which will benefit the companies polluting the air — pertaining to coal-burning power plants, oil refineries, and other parts of the fossil fuel industry. The Biden administration had worked to increase these protections, estimating that reducing the amount of fine particulate matter that could be emitted would prevent 4,500 premature deaths and nearly 300,000 lost work hours in 2023, per The New York Times. The Trump administration is no longer going to factor health risks into its cost-benefit analyses, instead only estimating the costs to businesses who enact regulations.

	“E.P.A., like the agency always has, is still considering the impacts that [fine particulate matter] and ozone emissions have on human health,” an EPA spokesperson said in a statement to the Times. “Not monetizing does not equal not considering or not valuing the human health impact.”


	Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University, says the move is an attempt to “rip the heart out of the government's ability to regulate.” Roughly 135,000 Americans die prematurely every year due to air pollution. 


	Oppenheimer isn't surprised that the administration is withdrawing from international efforts to combat the climate crisis, on top of removing health risks from its cost-benefit analyses of pollution regulations, noting that it's been clear since Trump retook office that the U.S. doesn't have any interest in leading on the issue.


	“I think it is absolutely important, just from a leadership perspective,” Burke adds of America cooperating with other nations on climate. “That's a problem for the climate, but it's also likely a problem for us economically.”


	The list of international organizations the U.S. is pulling out of as of this month goes beyond climate organizations, but several of them are focused specifically on the climate and the environment. They include the 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Compact, the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, the IPCC, the International Renewable Energy Agency, the International Solar Alliance, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and other climate or climate-adjacent organizations or agreements. The White House says participation in these cooperatives are “contrary to the interests of the United States.”

	The more the U.S. gives up its leadership role in the climate space, the more other countries will fill that vacuum. Oppenheimer says China will become even more influential when it comes to setting the path forward, and it will continue to dominate the clean energy space internationally. 


	“China is making a lot of money developing and selling internationally the technologies that reduce greenhouse gasses,” Oppenheimer says. “They are the world's leading producer of solar photovoltaic modules. They are the leading producer of wind turbines. They are the leading producer of electric vehicles.”


	Oppenheimer adds that if China is leading climate efforts on the world stage, there will be less transparency in those efforts than if the U.S. was leading them. 


	As Burke puts it, America's abdication “gives up” an opportunity to set the terms of the energy transition. He notes that there are local and state governments within the U.S. stepping up on clean energy, but “the federal government is stepping back from international participation.” This means a worse climate future, unnecessary deaths, and a less competitive American economy. It's “crazy” for the U.S. to turn its back on the progress it has made on these fronts in recent years, Burke says.

	“We're on the road to becoming the last petro state,” Oppenheimer adds. “All of this is a picture of a country that not just isn't interested in fighting climate change but wants to cause more climate change. There's no rational excuse for it.”


	While the U.S. stays focused on the energy of the past, the rest of the world will continue to make progress focusing on the energy of the future. All that remains to be seen is if the U.S. will be able to catch up with the world if and when it realizes how much harm it has done to itself and the planet, and for no good reason.

Midnight Oil drummer Rob Hirst has passed away after a three-year battle with pancreatic cancer.


	The legendary Australian musician's death was confirmed in a statement by the band on Tuesday, Jan. 20.


	“After fighting heroically for almost three years, Rob is now free of pain – ‘a glimmer of tiny light in the wilderness,'” the post reads.


	“He died peacefully, surrounded by loved ones. The family asks that anyone wanting to honour Rob donate to Pankind, Pancreatic Cancer Australia or Support Act.”


	Hirst first revealed the news in April 2025 after being diagnosed in 2023, saying at the time: “I've had pretty much every treatment known to man – every scan, ultrasound, MRI. I've kind of had ‘the works.'”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Fellow Australian music icon Jimmy Barnes paid tribute to Hirst's passing in a social media statement.


	“He was the engine driving one of the greatest live bands of all time,” Barnes wrote.


	“RIP, dear Rob. You are irreplaceable, one of a kind, and myself, my family, and all the rest of this great country will miss you so much.”

	











	Hoodoo Gurus also paid tribute to Hirst, noting his close friendship with bassist Rick Grossman.


	“You left this world a far better place than the way you found it,” the band said in a post. “Your creativity, passion and joy has left its mark on all of us, and the strength of your spirit will be an inspiration forever. A life well lived.”

	











	Hirst formed the Oils in 1976 and, with Peter Garrett, then a young law student, taking frontman duties, the politically charged group would take on the world. By the time the Oils called it a day in 2022, the group had logged six ARIA No. 1 albums, including Resist, their first full-length studio album in two decades, and apparently their last as a unit.


	Per The Guardian, bandmate Jim Mognie called Hirst the “engine room, onstage and off” for Midnight Oil. “Rob was brash, funny and super intelligent, contrary to the clichéd view of drummers,” Moginie wrote in his 2024 memoir, The Silver River.


	The Oils also went to the top with Red Sails in the Sunset (November 1984), Diesel and Dust (August 1987), Blue Sky Mining (March 1990) and 20,000 Watt RSL – The Midnight Oil Collection (October 1997).


	Hirst has played, sung and written songs in The Ghostwriters, Backsliders, Hirst & Greene, The Angry Tradesmen and The Break. The latter instrumental lineup featured two of his fellow members of Midnight Oil (Jim Moginie and Martin Rotsey) as well as bass player Brian Ritchie from the Violent Femmes.


	One of the finest drummers produced by this country, Hirst also provided the dynamite intro for the early ‘80s ABC weekly youth program Beatbox. In 2020, Hirst and his daughter Jay O'Shea released a collaborative album.

C
harlie Puth's Whatever's Clever!, due March 27, is his fourth album, but in some ways, it feels more like a debut. The collection is his best work yet, built around an entirely new approach — airy, jazzy, live-instrument-driven production that tends to land somewhere between Bruce Hornsby's “The Way It Is” and Michael Jackson's “Human Nature.” Puth is 34 now, married, with a baby on the way, and he's finally found his full footing after making music that didn't always live up to his potential. His second album, 2018's Voicenotes, with its Quincy Jones-meets-Babyface R&B classicism, was a high point, but he had a habit of overthinking his music, dropping between-album trial-balloon singles that tended to fall short. Critics “panned my music for no consistency or whatever,” says Puth. “I admit, at points, they were right.” In jazz-club residencies in New York and L.A. last fall, Puth previewed songs from the new album, and recast old hits from “Attention” to “We Don't Talk Anymore” in arrangements that exploited his considerable skills as a keyboardist and bandleader. (He laughs off speculation that he was sending a message by singing the latter song, originally a duet with ex Selena Gomez, around the time of her wedding: “Why? Because I played it? I'm not gonna change the set list!”) A major tour, which will include his first headlining show at Madison Square Garden, will expand on those club dates.  “I want to take the experience I had at the Blue Note and make it built for arenas, but still intimate and small,” he says.

	











	As he prepared for the biggest year of his life —  with the tour, album, a performance of the national anthem at the Super Bowl, and the birth of his first child —  Puth sat down to talk about how he got here, including a certain shout-out from a pop superstar. 












Your new album feels like an artist really finding himself. One of the steps along the way was a very public moment, when Taylor Swift sang about you on The Tortured Poets Department: “We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist.”It was pretty shocking. I don't know if that was the moment where I realized that I needed to write a certain kind of music, but it was definitely affirming that one of the biggest stars in the world knows me. It's like, “I better write something good, 'cause maybe she, and some others, will hear it.”


Right after you heard about that, you decided to release “Hero,” which you described as the first single from your new album — but it's not on this album.Yeah. What the hell was I talking about? I think I sometimes just get a little ahead of myself. I wasn't ready to put out an album at that point.… I sat with myself and thought maybe I should, for the first time in my career, actually make an album. I'd never sat down and said, “Let's make an album and then release it.” It's always, “The song's doing well, we need to put it out. And while I'm doing radio promos and whatnot, going on TV, I'm going back to my hotel and making an album.” This album, Whatever's Clever!, is the first time where I just sat down and I had a lot of time. I just stayed with myself and [producer] BloodPop, and just made a full body of work. So I wasn't chasing my tail, but it's been almost a decade of chasing my tail.


So what was the sonic approach of the discarded album that had “Hero” on it?There was no sonic approach. It was just all over the place. It was a lot of consideration of other people: “I hope people like this.…” I had a collection of songs that sounded good, but were missing the gut punch.… I remember Max Martin called me and said in his very soft tone, “Do you know what I miss from a Charlie Puth record? I'm missing some of the emotion lately.” And I thought to myself, “Oh, my God, how could I let myself get to this point of where I feel like I have to be on a song conveyor belt and have to get things done for the sake of getting things done?”

Did the Taylor mention in fact put a bit of a fire under you to live up to the shout-out? I understood exactly what she meant, I think. To be a bigger artist, I think you have to let people in a little bit more, and I hadn't let people in as much as I should have in the beginnings of my career. It was more about making sure that people were happy. 


The first song you wrote for the album was “I Used to Be Cringe.” How did it come to you?I remember it was my wife Brooke's birthday. I was on my way to this wonderful restaurant in Sherman Oaks, and these songs will just pop into my head. And I heard this lyric called “I Used to Be Cringe.” And the title itself is cringey. It's like, “What do you mean?” You can smell the comments, as they say — “Used to be?” I'm like, “That's an interesting song title. What would that sound like?” And I'm just talking to myself while Brooke's on her phone. It's like a 30-minute drive down the hill, and I just start writing this whole song in F major. And it has a very flowy McCartney-esque chord progression. And it's all just because Taylor had said something about me. It gave me enough excitement to write another song in my head. And now we're ending the album with that.


It raises the question — when, in your opinion, were you the most cringe?I think when I dyed my hair blond just to get reactions — that's literally a lyric in the song. Saying things in interviews that weren't true, because I was told by higher-ups that I'm a white guy with brown hair. Literally, they said I need some excitement around my project. We need drama. And I didn't know what it meant to be an artist. I started out writing music for other artists. So I made tons of mistakes along the way. The blond hair was really bad. I don't know what I was thinking there.

	











You had a lip ring at one point.Yeah, man. It wasn't real either. I would talk differently in 2016.  I would go to a radio show and tell myself, “You're gonna put on a cool-guy accent because you have a big song out right now.” It was just so much inauthenticity.… I thought I had to be a certain way to be popular. And again, it's part of, I think, a young man growing up and not knowing himself and being very influenced by those around him. Comments that the higher-ups at the record label or former management would make were sometimes right. So if they're right about that, they must be right about making up a bullshit story, because it'll make the song more exciting. None of that was who I am. I can't even look at myself half the time from the years 2015 to 2022. I just didn't know what I was doing. I used to be very cringe.


At some point you realized you're not gonna try to be some super-cool version of yourself.Yeah. It's never gonna happen.

“I Got what taylor meant: To be a bigger artist, you have to let people in.”


When did you have the realization that you were gonna drop all of the pretending?I think when Brooke became a serious part of my life, it was weird to do that in front of her because it's someone I've known all my life. I never did it in front of my mom because my mom knows me so well. I'm not gonna do it in front of Brooke because Brooke's going to look at me like, “Who am I dating right now?” It stopped then. And then I really just think the male frontal lobe doesn't develop as quick. I really think scientifically it's that. It just took me a while to grow up.


Brooke is someone you've known since you were a kid. Marrying her, rather than someone from the showbiz world, says a lot about the life you've decided to have.I've always wanted that life that you speak of. I knew very early on that it was Brooke, as well.  Again, frontal lobe not developed. Twenty-four-year-old kid thinking to myself I need to enjoy the fruits of my labor: “I deserve all of this.” I'm very thankful for every experience, but I always knew what was best for me. I just pushed it away. 

	











Looking back at a song like “LA Girls,” from 2018, there was a lot of ambivalence about whether that was the world you wanted to be playing in. I thought to myself as a young kid that I had to be in constant turmoil in my life in order to write great music. Couldn't be furthest from the truth. It's when I was most comfortable and happy is when I wrote my best music. I don't know where this came from, where I had to … I don't know if that was people giving me bad advice. I think that was my own doing. My life had to be in constant disarray to come up with melodies, and so I resisted settling down for such a long time.


 So when you got married, did you have that lingering fear of “I'm happy — this is gonna screw everything up”?No, I just chemically knew that it was the right thing to do. It made me not wanna look at past interviews of myself anymore, but I knew I made the right decision.  I feel back to how I felt before I became a singer.


Was there a moment when this actually clicked in or was it more gradual?I was in New York, I was staying at the Greenwich, and I don't drink at all. I think it clouds my judgment. But it was right before the third album was about to come out, and I was like, “I'm just gonna have a rager.” And I woke up with the worst hangover I've ever felt in my life. It lasted for, I think, two days. And I saw pictures of myself with people I didn't even know. And I remember they all wanted to get coffee the next morning, in a scene-y part of town. I saw them all eating, and then I just turned the other way and walked back to the hotel and just stayed there by myself for a couple days. It's hard to describe, but after years of surrounding myself with the wrong things and saying the wrong things, it's profound when it just all comes to a screeching halt one day at 30 years old in New York City.


The song “Cry” is about your dad, and features Kenny G on saxophone. How did that come together? Me and BloodPop looked at each other while we were making that song and thought we need to put Kenny G on this, because it just felt like Sade, it felt like 1988. I texted him, and he sent [a solo] back right away because he was like, “I just love the record so much.”


	But I wrote “Cry” for my dad, and I really resisted [doing] that. BloodPop has a very unique way of making me feel uncomfortable yet comfortable. The first day he came in with a big whiteboard and said, “OK, we're gonna have some really tough conversations.” And I started getting acid reflux, and he was like, “Why haven't you written a song about your dad?” I got defensive: “I don't want to talk about my dad. I just wanna collaborate with you and make bops” is what I legitimately said to him. And he was like, “Your dad's gonna want a song one day.”


	Then a week later, [my dad's] mom passed away. The song's basically about not being afraid to show emotion. It's like Blood predicted the future. And as we were at the funeral, I thought to myself that we gotta finish that because, turns out, he does need it.

	











There's also a full-on yacht-rock song on this album written with Michael McDonald and Kenny Loggins. What did you take away from the experience of working with them?That I'm not alone. That there are musicians that have been doing it for much longer than I, that have a very similar approach to chords and implementing jazz into pop music. And I slapped myself on the head. I'm like, “Of course! You got all that stuff from the two legends that are sitting on your couch writing the song with you right now.” Michael McDonald writes music like a hit songwriter of today. He has the same approach as Amy Allen. And it just reminds me that all music really is the same.


You're doing the national anthem at the Super Bowl in February.The hardest song ever written.

“I thought i had to be in constant turmoil to write great music. couldn't be less true.”


And for some reason, Whitney Houston was brought into the conversation, and now you have to match the Whitney Houston performance?Because of New Jersey. She's from Newark. And I would be the second New Jersey native, as The Star-Ledger wrote, to sing the national anthem. It's a great honor. I'm going to be inspired by what Whitney did, but I can't ever touch what she did. That's the best one ever done — that and the Chris Stapleton one. That was raw. Made grown men cry. I just want to do my own thing with the hardest piece of music ever written. And I just wanna show people that I can do it. I feel like people don't really think of me as, like, a stand-alone vocalist at times…. I actually have always wanted to do this, and I recorded a little demo, just me singing with the Rhodes and sent it to Roc Nation. I've been told Jay-Z loved it, and it got to [NFL Commissioner Roger] Goodell and they all said that I could do it.


So you applied for the gig? I applied. I auditioned for it, but I made up my own audition because I've always wanted to do it ­— because I love it musically. It's the best song. Musically, it's so special.


The rumor has it they prerecord that because of the cold.They'll prerecord bits of it. It's impossible to mic an orchestra and expect that it's gonna sound good in a stadium that's filled with a hundred thousand people that are going to be cheering. 


But for you yourself—I'll be singing. The mic will be on.


 You've said that you had a certain amount of insecurity with your voice, and you perhaps compensated by using Auto-Tune too much in the past.Oh, yeah. Third album, I tuned my voice way too much. I just wanted people to like my music so much. And if I went off tune, I felt like that would piss people off or it would make them mad, and I want them to be happy. It's a very outdated way of thinking. And something that I speak out against a lot now. I'd always tell aspiring songwriters and artists to embrace the imperfections. 

	











Those concerns in your head about people being mad at you and stuff like that seem, frankly, more like psychological issues. I'm sure I'll need years of therapy. I always think people are mad at me. I'm always afraid of disappointing people, and I don't feel like that's ever gonna go away. 


When you wrote your breakthrough hit, “See You Again,” you were in a mode of writing for other people. You never thought you would sing the hook — people like Sam Smith were supposed to.And then I think Skylar Grey sang the hook, and I think Jason Derulo sang the hook. Chris Brown sang the hook. Suddenly all these A-list artists wanting to sing your song — it happened overnight for me. I had all this attention from all these record labels overnight, saying crazy things to me. That song was written because my friend who had passed two years prior always told me I would write that song. So I wrote it for him. And what's great is that people who were born 10 years ago are listening to it today, and it feels like a brand-new song for them. It's the gift that keeps on giving. It's the power of music.

“I wrote ‘cry' for my dad. I resisted it, but it Turned out he needed it.” 


People may not realize that the song really owes a lot to Bruce Springsteen. It has that chord progression that he used in “My City of Ruins” — and also the mournful approach to the lyrics seems inspired by The Rising in general, which I know was your first Bruce album.The reason why it was my first Bruce album was because my town that I lived in was a Wall Street sleeper town, and there were a lot of people who lost their lives in 9/11. He wrote that record pretty quickly. I remember going to Jack's Music Shoppe in Red Bank, New Jersey, and picking it up and hearing it and just being so blown away. I felt like he wrote something for me personally. And my friends who actually lost their moms and dads, they felt the same way. I felt close to him and like it was the first time I ever felt that with any artist.


You're an artist pondering one of the big questions right now, which is how the infinite supply of AI music will affect real music. One thought is maybe it makes artists  aim to be more human, more weird, more individual.That's what I did on this album. I had to lean into the human aspect. The vocals couldn't be tuned like they were on my last project. Not everything can be so perfect. It makes it feel like a human made it. That's also something BloodPop wanted me to lean into. He was like, “How many times can you sing about a relationship from seven, eight years ago? It's all starting to sound the same. Sing songs about family. You've never sung about that.” I think there's gonna be such a wave of all this artificial stuff, but it's gonna make the human stuff stand out even more. I refuse to believe an AI engine will make me cry the way I do when I hear a song like “I Can't Make You Love Me.”  


You have a big year ahead — both your baby and your album are due in March, and then touring. It's tough to tour with a new baby.I honestly can't even think about it right now because that's why my jaw tenses up. I always want to make sure that I'm there for baby. I wanna make sure that the baby has a normal life, and we'll have the big headphones onstage, behind stage, and hopefully I can wave to baby.


So they're coming with you?Not for everything. Because touring is a really unnatural thing. And I can just tell that's not gonna be sustainable. So we'll do it where it makes sense, but I just want the most normal life for my child possible. I don't want them to travel on airplanes constantly.


This album is probably the biggest pivot of your career. Do you see it as establishing a direction where you're gonna go forward, or do you want to leave it open?I think sonically, musically, things may change and pivot, but what remains the same is the nucleus of it. I'm always gonna remain myself and tell the truth from now on.


What does that mean?It means I'm not gonna embellish things anymore and be so concerned if people are gonna like me. Of course, I'm gonna always care about what my fans think and what people think of my music. I wouldn't be human if I didn't. But I'm not gonna let that consume my life so much that it makes me write music that I end up scrapping 'cause I was just so concerned about what people thought. I'm always just gonna remain true to myself, which is the most lame thing to say ever. But it's true. I'm gonna be me. Because that ended up being the coolest thing.

Ellen DeGeneres shared a rare political statement on social media over the weekend, reflecting on the death of Renee Nicole Good and the current situation in Minneapolis. 


	The comedian and former talk show host posted three clips on Instagram, one of Good, one of her speaking to the camera, and one of protestors in Minneapolis. “Hey everybody, I just wanted to say, I am so sorry for what is happening in Minneapolis and our country, really, but specifically Minneapolis right now because that's where I shot my last stand-up special and everybody there couldn't have been more lovely,” DeGeneres said. 


	“I shot it there because they say it's the happiest city in America, and I found that to be true,” she continued. “So my thoughts and my prayers are going out to everyone, and I'm proud of everyone who's protesting peacefully, and I am sorry for anyone who has been hurt just for protesting, for doing what you should be doing. Anyway, just sending love.”


	On the post of Good, which included a public statement made by Good's wife Becca Good, DeGeneres wrote in a caption, “I'm so sad, and so angry, and so worried.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	She added, on the video of protestors, “Hold on.” 


	DeGeneres filmed her 2024 Netflix special, Ellen DeGeneres: For Your Approval, at the Orpheum Theatre in Minneapolis. When the special was announced, DeGeneres alluded that she'd speak about the controversies she and her beloved Ellen Show were embroiled in back in 2020. “To answer the questions everyone is asking me — Yes, I'm going to talk about it,” she said. “Yes this is my last special. Yes, Portia really is that pretty in real life.”

	











	The comedian's image took a hit in 2020 following a series of reports by BuzzFeed News in which employees at her show alleged racism, sexual misconduct, and intimidation at the hands of executive producers. Three producers were fired because of it, and DeGeneres issued an on-air apology. In 2022, singer Greyson Chance, whom DeGeneres signed to her label, told Rolling Stone he had “never met someone more manipulative, more self-centered, and more blatantly opportunistic.”


	Since then, DeGeneres relocated to the U.K., citing Donald Trump as the main motivation for leaving her home country. Last year, DeGeneres told broadcaster Richard Bacon that Trump's election in November spurred her permanent relocation to the Cotswolds.

Green Day stood up for the people of Minnesota amid the ongoing ICE crackdown and called out Donald Trump's immigration enforcement mastermind, Stephen Miller, during a performance in California over the weekend.


	During a short instrumental break in the middle of American Idiot favorite “Holiday” — a song originally written about George W. Bush and the Iraq War — frontman Billie Joe Armstrong bellowed, “This song is anti-fascism. This song is anti-war. We stand up for our brothers and sisters in Minnesota.” 


	Then, before launching into the song's sycophantic and jingoistic interlude monologue, Armstrong sneered, “Ladies and gentlemen, Stephen Miller now has the floor.” (The speech, which is “delivered by” an unnamed representative of California in the original song, begins with the lines, “Sieg Heil to the President Gasman/Bombs away is your punishment.”)

	This is, of course, far from the first time Green Day have called out the Trump administration. They've consistently changed the “American Idiot” lyric “I'm not a part of a redneck agenda” to “I'm not part of a MAGA agenda.” And last year, the band changed the lyrics to “Jesus of Suburbia” to skewer Vice President at a gig in Australia. A few months later, in Belgium, Armstrong led a chant of “fuck Donald Trump” during “Holiday.” 

	











	Green Day's performance over the weekend was part of the iHeartRadio ALTer Ego festival in Los Angeles. After spending much of 2025 on the road in support of their 2024 album Saviors, the band has just a pair of gigs scheduled at the moment, both around Super Bowl 60, which is taking place outside San Francisco. They'll perform at the big game's opening ceremony on Feb. 8, while a couple of days prior, they'll play in San Francisco with Counting Crows.

A mysterious UFO has been allegedly stored at a little-known US Navy base on the East Coast for decades as the military continues to reverse-engineer its secrets. 

A new report has claimed that Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland, better known as Pax River, has kept an 'exotic vehicle of unknown origin' secretly housed there, possibly since the 1950s.

According to anonymous sources tied to Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), which is headquartered at Pax River, certain military programs at the base have been involved in analyzing and exploiting technology recovered from non-human craft for years.

NAVAIR is a major part of the US Navy, which handles everything related to naval aircraft, weapons, and aviation systems. It designs, builds, tests, buys, repairs, and keeps Navy and Marine Corps aircraft ready for use.

Speaking to the Liberation Times, the unnamed sources claimed that two types of aircraft have been trying to spy on what the US has at Pax River. One is allegedly drones from China, and the other are non-human UFOs.

Recently, this spying activity has allegedly increased and moved closer to land, including right around the Navy base on the Chesapeake Bay.

Although the claims could not be confirmed by the Daily Mail, UFO whistleblower Luis Elizondo stated in written testimony to Congress that a specially built hangar was constructed at Pax River specifically for the transfer of extraterrestrial technology.

Under oath, Elizondo described a plan where this hangar would help major defense contractor Lockheed Martin move non-human technology to another company called Bigelow Aerospace for further study and analysis.

The Daily Mail has reached out to Lockheed Martin for comment. Bigelow Aerospace went dormant as a company in 2020, laying off its entire workforce during the Covid pandemic. 

According to the sources who spoke to Liberation Times, the US government allegedly has a secret contingency plan for moving the unidentified craft if its specific location at Pax River becomes publicly known or is threatened by further spying.

The report added that some of the activity seen taking place near the base is believed to be linked advanced drones or aircraft that use technology that's been copied and developed from the supposed exotic materials.

Although Elizondo claimed that a new facility was built at Pax River just for these UFO transfers, the anonymous sources said none of them took place after the CIA's former director of science and technology blocked companies from gaining access.

Elizondo is a former senior intelligence official who worked at the Pentagon, where he led a secret government program called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP).

AATIP studied unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), the new name for UFOs, determining if they were a possible threat to national security.

Elizondo, a whistleblower since 2017, testified under oath in 2024 to Congresswoman Nancy Mace that the government maintains secret programs to recover crashed spacecraft. 

Additionally, Elizondo's testimony noted that these programs have successfully reverse-engineered some of this technology and that the US was now in possession of advanced non-human equipment, including at bases like Pax River.

Has the US Navy captured extraterrestrial technology?

'These facilities included locations in the Las Vegas area and a newly built hangar at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station (“PAX”),' Elizondo said in his testimony.

'Specifically, the PAX River hangar was designed to facilitate the transfer of future materials via air and river.'

The Maryland base has been home to the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) since 1992, a group that conducts research, development, testing, and evaluation of new aircraft and weapons, including advanced and experimental projects.

Although the US military has said there has never been any physical evidence of UFOs recovered, multiple former government employees and scientists have come forward to claim that several vehicles have been recovered since the 1940s.

Last year, Dr Hal Puthoff, a physicist and electrical engineer who worked on the government's psychic spy and UFO research programs, revealed on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast that the US military has recovered more than 10 spacecraft since the infamous Roswell incident.

Although there was no evidence to confirm it, Puthoff claimed that some of these craft were actually fully intact craft that had been 'gifted' to humans by extraterrestrials.

The unverified claims about Pax River and potential spying overhead come just one year after hundreds of unidentified drones and UFOs were spotted flying over the East Coast by both the military and the American public. 

The bizarre drone swarms appeared to focus on US military installations as well as other key sites, including President Trump's property in New Jersey.

Many Americans described them as 'car-sized drones', making no noise as they flew closely overhead of residential neighborhoods from November 2024 until early 2025. 

To this day, the origin of the drones, their targets over New Jersey and the rest of the East Coast, and their research remain a mystery.

However, an unnamed private firm contracted by the US military eventually took responsibility for the drone swarms, claiming they were conducting tests of their advanced aerial craft, according to off-the-record comments at an Army summit in August 2025.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

THE termination of jobs of two teachers of a private university amid student protests and without a credible investigation is concerning. The University of Asia Pacific on January 19 removed from job basic sciences and humanities teachers Layeqa Bashir and ASM Mohsin as students demanded their removal, alleging that Layeqa Bashir made remarks that may amount to Islamophobia. While ASM Mohsin says that he is not fully aware of the reasons for the termination of his job, Layeqa Bashir says that a group of former students began threatening her over a Facebook posting that she made on December 10 2025, after the murder of a woman and her daughter by a masked woman. She suspects that an influential section of the university was patronising the students and supporting this right-wing move. The pro-vice-chancellor also implicitly acknowledges that the decision on job termination was made in the face of student protests. In this context, the University Teachers' Network has rightly pointed to the move as being indicative of a growing threat to academic freedom.

This is, however, not the first such case of job termination in recent months. On August 26, 2025, Viqarunnisa Noon School and College suspended a teacher on allegations that she had expelled students for wearing a hijab. In March 2024, a group of Islamic studies students in the University of Rajshahi rallied, demanding exemplary punishment for an assistant professor who reportedly had forced female students to remove their hijab and uncover their faces. No student should face discrimination for a hijab or any other clothing choice. Yet, the series of such events points to a climate of fear within academia and illustrates how in these cases Islamophobia is weaponised, with teachers' pedagogical freedom being constrained on the grounds that their teaching style or subject matter allegedly offends a segment of students influenced by the right-wing ideology. Layeqa Bashir's posting that led to her job termination asked how a teacher would teach social history without talking about the history and practices of religion. She further asked how a teacher could assess a student's performance, particularly online, without asking the students to confirm their identity. These are valid policy issues that teachers would ask and the university should take them into account, instead of silencing teachers with job termination notices.

The University of Asia Pacific decision is an ominous sign of declining academic freedom. The education ministry should, therefore, look into the allegation that the series of job terminations of teachers on allegations of discriminatory remarks against students wearing hijab was made under the influence of right-wing organised forces. Stakeholders should also address the greater policy concern arising out of the issue of keeping the face covered or wearing a niqab during examinations.

The University of Asia Pacific (UAP) has dismissed two faculty members following student protests over allegations of “insulting religion” and has announced the indefinite closure of the campus a day later.



The university administration announced the decision through an emergency notice issued at around 3:00 pm on Monday (January 19) and via email to students.



Earlier, on Sunday (January 18) evening, separate notices signed by the university registrar confirmed the dismissal of Assistant Professor Layeka Bashir and Associate Professor Dr. ASM Mohsin from the Department of Basic Science and Humanities.



According to the university authorities, the allegations against the two teachers were longstanding, and given the recent situation, a swift decision was deemed necessary. However, both dismissed teachers have claimed they were subjected to harassment and were denied any opportunity to defend themselves.



The controversy began on December 10, when Assistant Professor Layeka Bashir shared a critical post on her personal Facebook account regarding the cultural practice of covering one's face with a veil. After the post circulated widely on social media, a section of current and former students labeled it “religiously offensive” and launched protests.



Layeka Bashir has alleged that following the post, she faced threats and abusive remarks.



Tensions escalated on the first day of the new semester at the University of Asia Pacific (UAP) as a section of current and former students held protests, press conferences, and sit-in demonstrations on campus. Shortly afterward, the university administration decided to dismiss two faculty members.



Protesting students claimed that the dismissed teachers made anti-Islamic statements and showed political bias. However, students opposing the dismissals argued that the move was a targeted campaign to “tag” one teacher and exert mob pressure.



The university said a committee was investigating the matter, but due to the sensitive nature of the situation, action was taken before the committee could release its final report.



Meanwhile, part of the academic community has criticized the decision, describing it as “arbitrary” and a “dangerous precedent.” The University Teachers' Network also condemned the dismissals and criticized the administration's role in the matter.

Summary: Opinion polls show the majority of the general public accepts that paranormal phenomena do occur. Such widespread experience of and belief in the paranormal can only mean one of two things. Either the paranormal is real, in which case this should be accepted by the wider scientific community which currently rejects such claims; or else belief in and experience of ostensibly paranormal phenomena can be fully explained in terms of psychological factors. This presentation will provide an introduction to the sub-discipline of anomalistic psychology, which may be defined as the study of extraordinary phenomena of behaviour and experience, in an attempt to provide non-paranormal explanations in terms of known psychological and physical factors. This approach will be illustrated with examples relating to a range of ostensibly paranormal phenomena.

Speaker: Chris French Emeritus Professor in the Department of Psychology, Goldsmiths, University of London Patron of Humanists UK He retired from Goldsmiths in 2020. Up until 2024, he was Head of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit. He is a Fellow of the British Psychological Society and of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.

He has published over 200 articles and chapters covering a wide range of topics within psychology. His main area of research is the psychology of paranormal beliefs and anomalous experiences. He writes for the Guardian and the Skeptic magazine. His most recent book is The Science of Weird Shit: Why Our Minds Conjure the Paranormal (2024, MIT Press).

Freelance Life Writer

The question of whether aliens exist is not a new one. In science fiction films and books, people have wondered if we're the only life in this universe and what that can imply for universes beyond ours. 

There has to be, right? It can't just be us?

Of course, ‘alien' can mean many things and the depiction of aliens that we've seen in films like E.T and Ridley Scott's Alien franchise probably won't translate to our potential galaxy companions, but isn't it exciting to wonder who is out there?

Not only is it exciting but it could actually be scientifically sound...

Well, when recently surveyed, 86.6 per cent of astrobiologists recently said they either agreed or strongly agreed that extraterrestrial life likely exists somewhere else in the Universe.

When asked the same question but for complex or intelligent life, the agreeing percentage only drops to 58.2 per cent. More believe than don't.

How bloody exciting.

BBC Science Focus explains: “Many who study extraterrestrial life believe that Earth's habitable state, combined with the development of diverse intelligent life, is a sign that the same is possible elsewhere.

“And given the sheer scale of the cosmos, some scientists argue the question isn't if aliens exist, but where.”

Additionally, The Planetary Society says: “To frame the question of whether alien life exists in another way, we might ask how likely it is that Earth is the only world in the Universe where life has developed.

The observable Universe may contain 2 trillion or more galaxies. Our Milky Way galaxy alone is thought to contain at least 100 billion stars. As exoplanet research continues to uncover the prevalence of planets around other stars, it looks increasingly likely that the vast majority of stars in the Universe have at least one planet around them.

“And as the exploration of our Solar System has shown us, moons can also be hospitable to life as we know it.”

 If this hasn't sent you into a bit of an existential spiral, they assure that it's unlikely that we are the only ones out here, saying: “Although there's no evidence yet that aliens are out there — let alone that they've come to visit us — the likelihood of extraterrestrial life is so high that we simply must keep searching.”

I agree. ","{'href': 'https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk', 'title': 'HuffPost UK'}","other"

Independent Film Company and Shudder have acquired Saccharine ahead of its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival this week, Variety has learned.

From writer-director Natalie Erika James (Relic, Apartment 7A), the supernatural body horror film will be released in North America and UK theaters before streaming on Shudder at some point in 2026.

The Australian production follows lovelorn medical student Hana, who becomes terrorized by a sinister force after taking part in an obscure weight loss craze: eating human ashes.

Midori Francis (“Grey's Anatomy”), Danielle Macdonald (Patti Cake$), and Madeleine Madden (“The Wheel of Time”) star.

James reunites with Relic producers Anna McLeish and Sarah Shaw on the project.

“I'm absolutely thrilled to be working with IFC and Shudder again after our experience releasing Relic together in 2020,” said James. “They're an incredible team with a deep understanding of genre and a real commitment to filmmakers.”

“Natalie announced herself as a singular force with her haunting debut Relic, a film that we were privileged to bring to audiences in 2020 via IFC Midnight,” added Emily Gotto, senior vice president of acquisitions and productions at Shudder. “With Saccharine, she returns with a chilling, utterly original vision that pierces our deepest obsessions with body image, reaffirming her work as a leading voice in genre cinema.”

Saccharine is produced by Carver Films and Thrum Films. It was financed by Screen Australia in conjunction with XYZ Films, IPR.VC, and Stan, in association with VicScreen.

													By Robert Scucci
						 | Published 1 hour ago 

2021's The Black Phone is one of my favorite recent horror films because of how seamlessly it tied supernatural occurrences to its serial killer plot. Now that its 2025 sequel, Black Phone 2, is available on streaming, I'm happy to report that it's one of the best horror sequels I've seen in a hot minute. Stylistically, it couldn't be further from its predecessor, but not in a jarring way. All the elements that made the first film special with its claustrophobic basement setting are still explored here, but the world being constructed has the potential to carry on as a long-running franchise not unlike the Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street, or Friday the 13th films.

Picking up four years after the 2021 film left off, Black Phone 2 is menacing thanks to its setting and cinematography, and Ethan Hawke's performance as the elusive and supernaturally dangerous Grabber is the stuff of nightmares. The film's influences are clear, but its willingness to stay in its own lane makes for a captivating watch that never feels like a ripoff or cheap carbon copy of what inspired its worldbuilding.

Black Phone 2 takes place four years after the events depicted in the first film. We're reintroduced to Finney (Mason Thames), who escaped the Grabber's (Ethan Hawke) clutches during his 1978 crime spree. Finney self-medicates to cope with the trauma of being the Grabber's only known survivor, but his issues aren't the primary point of focus here. Instead, the spotlight shifts to his younger sister Gwen (Madeleine McGraw), who is now experiencing sleepwalking episodes punctuated by disturbing visions of the Grabber.

Those visions lead Gwen, Finney, and their friend Ernesto (Miguel Mora) to Alpine Lake Camp, where the Grabber began abducting and killing children back in 1957. Ernesto's connection to the Grabber runs deeper than simple proximity, as his brother Robin was one of the killer's victims in 1978. When they arrive at the camp, a blizzard prevents them from leaving, forcing them to confront both their own unresolved trauma and the lingering presence of the Grabber, whose soul appears to be haunting the grounds after his death in the first film.

Channeling some serious Freddy Krueger energy, the Grabber targets Gwen in her dreams, where any physical harm she sustains while unconscious carries over into the real world. Realizing the danger they're in, Gwen, Finney, and Ernesto reach out to Armando (Demian Bichir) and Barbara (Maev Beaty), the camp's supervisors, who reveal their own unexpected connections to the three missing children tied to the camp's dark history. As the Grabber's grip over the location tightens, the kids are forced to take matters into their own hands to send him back to the hellish afterlife he refuses to stay in.

Though Black Phone 2 is technically a period piece, it benefits greatly from being set primarily in a cabin located deep in the wilderness. You don't need a lot of vintage cars to sell the era when trees, snow, and isolated cabins are effectively timeless. The only essential anchor to the premise is the payphone by the lake, which is how the Grabber continues to contact his victims from beyond the grave.

What truly elevates Black Phone 2 is its use of different cameras and image quality as visual shorthand. Gwen's dream sequences appear grainy and distorted, while scenes set in the waking world are presented with much higher clarity. This approach strips away any ambiguity and sets the film apart from A Nightmare on Elm Street. Grainy footage means nightmare. Clean footage means reality. Establishing this language early allows for sharp, effective cuts between realms that clearly show how the Grabber's influence crosses planes of existence.

What Gwen sees in her dreams becomes superimposed over the waking world around her, even when the people nearby can't perceive the threat. She can see the Grabber approaching in her dreams but has no way of warning anyone in real time. The tension doesn't come from the nightmares alone, but from the gap between what Gwen knows and what everyone else can't see.

While there's no real mystery driving Black Phone 2, its deliberate buildup, wide establishing shots of a brutal wilderness, and frantic crossover between the dream realm and waking life create several deeply unsettling sequences that linger long after the credits roll. Ethan Hawke is an absolute monster as the Grabber, fully committed to playing a modern analog to Freddy Krueger while still making the character his own. There are a couple of quick exposition dumps, but they feel earned, clearly motivated by pacing rather than a lack of trust in the audience.

Most importantly, the brother and sister dynamic between Finney and Gwen feels grounded and believable. Finney is still clearly haunted by his encounter with the Grabber, but he's smart enough to recognize that Gwen shouldn't face this alone as they work toward ending the nightmare once and for all.

Having earned $132 million at the box office against its reported $30 million production budget, it feels inevitable that the film series will continue. Everyone involved has expressed interest in returning, but only if quality remains the priority. Until a story worthy of further expansion takes shape, we're left waiting to see how, and when, the Grabber finds his way back for another rampage.

Luann de Lesseps‘ daughter, 31-year-old Victoria de Lesseps, opened up about her career as a psychic medium and healer during an interview last week, sharing that she once rid the Real Housewives of New York City alum's house of a ghost.

As she also reflected on an “extreme” meeting she had with a healer that left her “very, very scared and freaked out,” Victoria explained what led her to the trade as she recalled past interactions with the ghost living at her mother's vacation home and confirmed she helped him move on from the residence.

“Even [as] a young kid, I used to see some ghosts. I used to see some weird dark energy when I was probably 6, 7 [years old]. Again in my teens,” Victoria, who Luann shares with ex-husband Count Alexandre de Lesseps, 76, revealed during a January 16 interview with Page Six.

According to Victoria, her father's late mother was a “white witch” who practiced radiesthesia. However, her paranormal experiences didn't continue throughout her childhood. Instead, they “faded away” until about three or four years ago, when a “series of events,” including a split, “led to an upswing” that fueled her past trauma.

At that time, Victoria, who graduated from Pratt Institute, opened up to a gallery owner who was displaying some of her artwork.

“I was kind of talking really openly, and she was like, ‘You gotta go see my healer, Lisa,'” she revealed.

So Victoria did.

“I could see everything going on. She was ripping stuff out of me that wasn't mine. A lot of purging was going on. And I saw this very tall — now I know, spirit guide — standing next to me: big, kind of native, all in shadow with a big jaguar,” she recalled. “[I was] very, very scared and freaked out.”

While the session frightened Victoria, Lisa noticed something unique about her and told her she should pursue a career in the field.

“I always say I kicked and screamed my whole way through this process. Although I'm super grateful and absolutely love it, I didn't see it coming,” she admitted.

During one of her training sessions at Luann's house in the Hamptons, Victoria and another trainee came face-to-face with a ghost.

“The door didn't ‘open,' but it ethereally opened, and [the ghost] popped through. And [my classmate] was like, ‘Hey, there's a ghost in your house! Like, he just opened the door.' And I was like, ‘Yeah, he is here,'” she shared.

“My mom's actually engaged with it before,” she continued. “She was in her room, and she pushed a book, and the book pushed back, and she pushed it back in.”

Although the ghost “used to not be so nice” to her, Victoria was ultimately able to have a breakthrough with it.

“I used to walk up the stairs at night and look down and be like, ‘Ah! Like, I see something there,'” she explained. “I came home one day — and I wasn't living here [anymore] — and I came in at night, and I just heard a voice being like, ‘You don't live here anymore!' And I was like, ‘Ah! I'll come back in the morning!'”

Once she gained understanding from the ghost, he “warmed up” to her.

“As I was in the house more, I switched rooms. … It was a guest room, so no one was really in there. And I sensed there was something with [his] wife. Like, he used to live here. So he was kind of just chilling in the house,” she said, noting that they “spoke casually.”

“I was like, ‘Oh, do you want to leave? You ready to go?' And then I think he just [left] because he's not here anymore,” she reasoned.

After the ghost left Luann's home, Victoria helped other ghosts “move on.”

“Some ghosts get stuck when they have a traumatic death, like a murder, and then they can't really move on because sometimes they need someone to just — they need a witness. They need to share their story,” she explained.

In addition to psychic readings and healing sessions, Victoria also offers past-life readings and tarot card readings, and she is writing a fantasy trilogy series based on “shamanic characters,” “oracles,” and “healers” in an “alternate universe.”

Luann is also mom to Noel de Lesseps, 29.

	By David Harth

Marvel often has lower power levels than their distinguished competition, but one place where the House of Ideas win is in the mental powers department. This began with the first appearance of the X-Men, as the book introduced two of the most powerful telepaths in the world. Since then, the publisher has introduced more and more psychic talents, a full spectrum of heroes and villains with numerous mental powers. Mental skills have become much more important in the Marvel Universe because of this, and readers have gotten to witness some amazing feats of power from those whose brains are their strongest attribute.

Power-scaling has become a huge part of superhero comics, especially Marvel it seems, so we've constantly gotten more and more powerful psychics. We've also seen the ones that have always been powerful get even more power to fight against their foes. These ten psychics are the most powerful in the Marvel Universe, their powers allowing them to take on all comers.

So, there are two different Psylockes, and confusingly enough, they both used the same body for a long time. Betsy Braddock is the first, and created the name. She was body swapped with the ninja assassin Kwannon, and both of them have since gone back to their  own bodies. Of the two of them, Kwannon is almost certainly more powerful. Her body has shown the ability to manifest telekinesis, something Betsy was able to access several times, and Kwannon has been shown flying under her own power. She was trained from childhood to be a killer, and her skill with her telepathy has always been a cut above the rest.

The X-Men have always had powerful women, so when Emma Frost joined the team, she fit right in. Emma's power levels aren't nearly as high as they seem, but the thing about her is that she's mastered her powers to the extent that she can pull off mental feats that other more powerful psychics can. She's become one of the premiere members of the X-Men over the last 25 years (time flies, folks), and has only gotten more skilled as the years have gone. She can stand with the heavy hitters, despite being weaker than them, which is honestly very impressive.

Quentin Quire's basically the opposite of Emma Frost. He's one of the more powerful Omega-level mutants, but he's also young. He has an amazing power level, but he's not as well trained as he could be. One of the interesting things about Quentin is that he was rarely a member of an X-team with a high-level telepath to train him, so he mostly just tries to brute strength everyone he fights. It's been pretty successful over the years, but readers have also seen future versions of the young mutant with even more power and skill than he has in the present. Technically, he should probably be higher on the list because of his sheer potential, but his lower skill level means that weaker psychics can beat him.

Franklin Richards is basically a god. The son of Reed and Sue Richards, Franklin developed his powers at a younger age than most mutants, and can tap into reality altering energies that are basically limitless. He used his powers to rebuild the multiverse after the Incursions and has always been known for having extremely powerful telepathic abilities. An argument can be made that he should be higher on the list, but Franklin often holds himself back on purpose. He sets limits on his powers so that he can have something of a normal life. He also isn't the most well-trained psychic, so less powerful but more skilled telepaths can beat him. However, most of the time, very few people decide to attack him telepathically, just in case.

Xemnu first appeared in 1960, before the Marvel Universe as we now know it truly began. He starred in the old school monster comics, and then was used as a villain in the superhero comics that came after Fantastic Four #1. He's mountain of muscle, able to punch it out with the strongest foes imaginable, but his most useful abilities are his psychic ones. Xemnu has amazing mind control powers, to the extent that he can control the minds of numerous people at once, completely able to rewrite memories. In fact, he's so powerful he can do it on a wide scale — The Immortal Hulk showed him able to control minds through his appearances on TV (that weren't always live), which isn't something readers had really seen before. Xemnu is one of Marvel's greatest psychics, but he never gets the credit he deserves for his mental feats.

“Age of Apocalypse” is a legendary story, and it introduced readers to one of the most powerful psychics ever: Nate Grey. Grey was created from the DNA of Cyclops and Jean Grey by Mister Sinister as an “in case you're trying to kill Apocalypse, break glass” contingency plan. However, he escaped and was able to get out of the AoA universe. Nate was the Cable of his world without the techno-organic virus, meaning he can use the full extent of his powers. He has high level telepathy and telekinesis, and has even been able to create an entirely new universe (with the help of Legion). He has the mental powers of a god, which isn't always the best thing when you're a  genetically-engineered psychic weapon raised in a monstrous dystopia.

Legion is the son of Charles Xavier, and he has the power level to prove it. David Haller developed DID after his father left his mother Gabrielle, and eventually manifested mutant powers. He basically has every kind of mental power you can imagine. When he was younger, his various alters would each have a different power, but as he's learned to deal with his mental condition, he's taken control of all of his powers. Legion can basically do whatever he wants to mentally, and has shown the power to alter the universe to his liking. His skill level is lower than the top three, but he's still superlatively powerful.

The Shadow King is one of the most powerful telepathic beings in existence. It's existed for millennia, taking human hosts and doing its best to take over the minds of every being in existence. The Shadow King is most powerful in the Astral Realm, and has been able to defeat some of the most powerful telepaths in history, like Professor X, there. However, his powers in the physical realm aren't nearly as powerful, mostly because he can use his powers to control the make-up of the Astral Realm, but not the real world. Shadow King has beaten numerous times, but he's always come back ready for another try.

Professor X has changed a lot over the years, but one that hasn't changed is his power level. When readers were introduced to Xavier, we were told that he was the most powerful telepath on Earth, beginning psychic power-scaling into the mix.. He's an Omega-level mutant and is powerful enough to reach into every mind on the planet at once. During the Krakoa Era, he was able to constantly use his powers to copy the memories of thousands of mutants, all while doing other stuff with his powers. He's one of the most skilled telepaths ever, so even on the rare occasions that he faces someone stronger than him, he's able to defeat them. He's the ultimate mental talent in the Marvel Universe. 

Jean Grey has become a Marvel legend, and is one of the most important mutants in the publisher's history. She's usually considered to be the second most powerful telepath on Earth, but that all changed when it was revealed that she is bond with the Phoenix Force, giving her access to cosmic power-level telepathy. She worked with Xavier and was constantly training, which makes her even more powerful. She's a master of mental combat, and with the Phoenix Force backing up her power, there are few people out there who can beat her, let alone stand with her when it comes to power level.

Far-right conspiracy theories and misinformation about the Vondelkerk fire are being widely shared on social media, NOS reports based on research by the Justice for Prosperity Foundation. These claim that the fire was caused by an attack by “jihadists,” “Muslim terrorists,” and even the “left-wing elite.” The police and fire brigade are still investigating the fire in the Amsterdam church.

According to Jelle Postma, a former officer at the intelligence service AIVD and the director of Justice for Prosperity, these posts are part of a deliberate disinformation campaign. On January 1 and 2, 20 percent of all posts on X about the Vondelkerk linked the fire to Muslims. Similar stories also started circulating on other social media platforms.

“Within minutes of news of the fire, we saw the first false claims appear. Initially, they were mainly suggestions. It was then presented more as a question: ‘Could it be Muslims?” Postma said. After just an hour, the question changed to claims that it was an attack, without any evidence. 

That same night, far-right influencers like Eva Vlaardingerbroek and the British Tommy Robinson pick up the posts. From that moment on, the misinformation spread rapidly. “A snowball really turned into an avalanche here,” Postma said. The message was consistently that the church fire was an attack on Christians, and that Muslims and a “left-wing elite” were behind it. 

According to Postma, this was one of the first times in the Netherlands that right-wing misinformation so explicitly linked jihadism and the political left.

The Vondelkerk fire is not an isolated case when it comes to misinformation campaigns, Claes de Vreese, a professor of political communication at the University of Amsterdam, told the broadcaster. “You see anonymous accounts making suggestions about a local event. These aren't necessarily concerned citizens.” Often, these suggestions just fade away, but sometimes they're picked up. “It's then used to capitalize on anger and rage: it's called ragebait,” De Vreese said. “These kinds of influencers have a political and commercial interest in doing this.”

According to Postma, it is difficult to quantify exactly how much of an influence these campaigns have. “But you see that it has an impact on various levels. From a young Muslim being confronted on a football field about an incident, to right-wing parties adopting certain rhetoric.”

And what makes things even more complicated is that these kinds of claims are almost impossible to debunk. In the case of the Vondelkerk, it could take months for the investigation into the cause of the fire to be completed. And if the authorities come to a conclusion that doesn't match the misinformation spreaders' opinion, they could always create more uproar by claiming a cover-up. 

According to Postma, more research needs to be conducted into the people and networks that deliberately spread disinformation. “You can moderate content, but if there's an incentive to spread disinformation, it will continue to happen,” he said. “The defense is often that this is freedom of speech, but the fact is that it also undermines democracy.” 

“Sometimes you have to protect democracy for itself. It would be good if there were a political discussion about this,” Postma said.

The North Africa Post

First Independent Mena Newspaper

The 2025 Africa Cup of Nations has not only showcased Morocco's organizational success but also exposed a growing surge of conspiracy‑driven narratives among certain African football federations.

What began as made-up complaints escalated into a pattern of unverified accusations, particularly from Senegal, Egypt, and Algeria, even as Morocco received international praise for its hosting standards.

In the build‑up to the final, the Senegalese Football Federation issued a statement alleging inadequate security during the team's arrival by train in Rabat, claiming players were exposed to risks due to crowd congestion.

Independent reporting, however, showed that the players were surrounded largely by enthusiastic supporters seeking photos and greetings, with no documented security breaches or criminal incidents.

Firstpost noted that the scene involved excited fans pressing for selfies rather than any form of targeted threat. The federation also protested hotel arrangements and the proposed training venue, later confirming that a five‑star hotel was ultimately provided and CAF was reviewing the training‑site allocation after the team rejected the Mohammed VI Complex on grounds of “sporting fairness.”

Despite the sharply worded communiqués, Senegal's political leadership conveyed a markedly different tone. During an official visit to Rabat, Senegal's Minister of African Integration praised the strength of Moroccan‑Senegalese relations and urged sportsmanship.

This diplomatic alignment underscored the discrepancy between political relations and the rhetoric circulating within Senegal's football apparatus.

The situation escalated further during the AFCON final, when Senegal coach Pape Thiaw ordered his players off the pitch for more than ten minutes after a VAR‑awarded penalty to Morocco, creating an extraordinary and unprecedented stoppage on the continental stage.

Analysts observed that such actions reinforced the narrative of grievance and contributed to the perception of coordinated provocation claims rather than genuine competitive disputes.

Senegal was not the only federation to adopt this tone. After Egypt's elimination, coach Hossam Hassan repeatedly claimed unfair treatment, hinted at hidden agendas, and described rival nations as “jealous,” sparking backlash from Egyptian analysts who labelled the rhetoric as unfounded and harmful to the country's sporting image.

Algeria's reaction to its quarter‑final defeat to Nigeria followed a similar pattern, with a Spanish outlet characterizing Algerian media and political commentary as a “surreal wave” of conspiracy theories attempting to link Morocco to the team's exit despite match data clearly favoring Nigeria.

Morocco's response throughout the rising speculation focused firmly on defusing conspiratorial narratives. National team coach Walid Regragui dismissed allegations of referee favoritism and described such claims as a longstanding phenomenon in African football.

He emphasized that Morocco itself had multiple refereeing decisions go against it during the tournament and urged both journalists and fans to prioritize factual reporting and sporting analysis.

As Morocco raises the bar in infrastructure, logistics, and sporting delivery, tensions among rival federations appear to manifest more readily as accusations of unfairness rather than technical or performance‑based assessments.

The 2025 AFCON thus revealed not just football excellence on the pitch but a widening gap between evidence‑based analysis and emotionally charged conspiracy narratives circulating among some of the continent's football circles.

Natural gas prices soared Tuesday, as heating demand is expected to spike due to a blast of frigid weather across the U.S. 

Prices surged 25%, or 78 cents, to $3.89 per million British thermal units by 10 a.m. ET,  putting natural gas futures on pace for the best day in four years. Natural gas is used primarily for heating and electricity generation.

""Frigid weather is set to reshape the near-term natural gas outlook as Arctic air masses flash across the eastern US and the huge weather demand gain over the MLK weekend threatens severe market dislocation,"" EBW Analytics told clients in a Tuesday note. 

A big winter storm is forecast to dump heavy snow, sleet and treacherous freezing rain across the southern Rockies, the Plains and the South by Friday, according to the National Weather Service. The storm is then expected to shift toward the East Coast through the weekend. 

Much of the U.S. was already gripped by frigid temperatures Tuesday morning. The weather will threaten production freeze-offs, according to EBW Analytics. 

""The frigid weather pivot comes with speculator short positions at a 14-month high — suggesting further bullish risks as shorts are forced to buy back gas,"" the group told clients. 

""Volatility will stay high, however — and any weather model warming into mid-February could allow a near term price spike to eventually soften,"" the group said.

Finnish President Alexander Stubb has said he could invite US leader Donald Trump to a sauna to try to ease political tension over Greenland.

Stubb made the remark in an interview with the Washington Post on Monday during the World Economic Forum in Davos. He suggested employing a traditional Finnish approach to problem-solving, arguing that forging a relationship in an informal setting can be “quite useful diplomatically.” 

“Sometimes it's good to slow down, go to sauna, take a nice bath, and then find a solution,” he said. When asked if he could convince Trump to join him, Stubb quipped, “From golf diplomacy to sauna diplomacy, why not?” The mention of golf was a reference to his unofficial visit to Florida in March 2025, where he played a round with Trump.

Sauna diplomacy is an established tradition in Finnish statecraft, used to create a neutral and relaxing setting for frank discussions.

Stubb previously suggested in 2025 that Trump and Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky should “steam in the sauna” together days after a public spat between them, though it is unknown if they did.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, who is also in Davos, cast doubt on the notion. 

“Stubb's primitive approaches (golf, sauna…) do not work. Strategic thinking, partnerships and focus on peace do,” he wrote on X on Tuesday. Dmitriev arrived at the forum to meet the American delegation for talks on Ukraine and economic cooperation.

The suggestion comes amid a heightened transatlantic crisis. Trump has publicly pushed for the US to acquire Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark, citing national security. After European leaders uniformly rejected the idea, Trump threatened to impose major tariffs, starting February 1, on several EU nations, prompting preparations for countermeasures.

Judge rules homeland security can insist lawmakers provide week's notice of intention to inspect facilities 

The Trump administration won a legal victory on Monday that temporarily allows it to keep elected officials out of immigration detention camps, while it advanced two other court actions in support of its surge into Minnesota.

A federal judge in Washington DC ruled that the homeland security department (DHS) can continue to insist that lawmakers provide a week's notice of their intention to inspect immigration facilities, even though she blocked an identical policy last month.

Separately, justice department lawyers urged a district court judge in Minneapolis to allow the administration's immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota to continue, in response to a lawsuit filed by the state seeking to end what it called a “federal invasion”.

And in a related development, the justice department said it was appealing an injunction issued on Friday curbing aggressive tactics by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal agencies in dealing with protesters.

Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, backtracked on Sunday on her insistence that federal agents had not used chemical substances including pepper spray against crowds protesting ICE actions, and claimed instead they were necessary to “establish law and order”.

The Washington DC ruling on congressional oversight of federal immigration facilities comes after three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota, Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison, said DHS officials illegally blocked them from performing authorized congressional oversight when they tried to inspect an ICE detention center near Minneapolis earlier this month.

The Colorado congressman Joe Neguse and colleagues filed a lawsuit arguing that it violated district court judge Jia Cobb's December ruling blocking DHS from enforcing a seven-day notice period.

But in four-page ruling on Monday, Cobb said the fact that the DHS claimed it was now enforcing the seven-day requirement using funding from a different source, namely Trump's so-called “big, beautiful bill”, instead of existing appropriations, meant the policy “facially differs” from the one she blocked.

“If plaintiffs wish to challenge the legality of a new agency action, plaintiffs may seek leave to amend their complaint or file a supplemental pleading,” she wrote, adding that she would consider another temporary restraining order.

Neguse did not respond to Cobb's ruling, but in an earlier post on social media said no-notice inspections were essential.

“The law is crystal-clear: the administration can't block members of Congress from conducting real-time oversight of immigration detention facilities,” he wrote.

Meanwhile, the justice department responded on Monday to the lawsuit brought by Minnesota, and the cities of Minneapolis and St Paul, seeking an end to ICE activities, claiming the state was demanding an unprecedented veto over federal law enforcement.

At a press conference last week announcing the action, Keith Ellison, the Minnesota attorney general, said the cities were being terrorized by federal actions, including the shooting death of Renee Good, an unarmed US citizen, by an ICE agent.

“We allege that DHS's use of excessive and lethal force, their warrantless, racist arrests, their targeting of our courts, our churches, houses of worship and schools are a violation of the Administrative Procedures Act on arbitrary and capricious federal actions,” he said.

Justice department lawyers, however, called the lawsuit “an absurdity”, according to the New York Times. “It would render the supremacy of federal law an afterthought to local preferences,” they said, and an injunction blocking the operation “would constitute an unprecedented act of judicial overreach”, the newspaper reported.

Katherine Menendez, the Joe Biden-appointed district court judge hearing the case, made no immediate ruling but indicated she might hold another hearing before deciding on the lawsuit's merits.

Menendez is also the judge who issued the order on Friday curtailing ICE's tactics, including “retaliation” against protesters and “the drawing and pointing of weapons; the use of pepper spray and other non-lethal munitions; actual and threatened arrest and detainment of protesters and observers; and other intimidation tactics”.

The DHS told Menendez on Monday it had filed an appeal notice with the eighth district court of appeal, the New York Times reported, noting that the text of the document was not immediately available.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theglobeandmail.com","Carney stands behind Greenland, criticizes Trump without naming him in blunt Davos speech","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-eu-trump-greenland-tariff-threat/","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 12:31:03 GMT","

Prime Minister Mark Carney said Tuesday that middle powers must stop pretending the rules-based international order is still functioning, and instead build coalitions to survive in a new era where great powers prey on smaller countries to take what they want.

His blunt and wide-ranging speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos did not mention Donald Trump by name but it was clear Mr. Carney was placing the blame on the U.S. President for what he called a rupture in global relations.

“More recently, great powers began using economic integration as weapons. Tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited,” he said.

Mr. Carney urged countries to start publicly condemning economic coercion, even when practiced by an ally, in another clear reference to the United States.

The Prime Minister's speech on Tuesday follows an extraordinary threat by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on European allies and Britain until Washington is allowed to acquire Greenland for strategic purposes.

What are the EU's options to counter U.S. on Greenland?

“Canada strongly opposes tariffs over Greenland and calls for focused talks to achieve our shared objectives of security and prosperity in the Arctic,” Mr. Carney said.

The future of Greenland and the division Mr. Trump's threats have sown among Western allies is dominating talk in Davos.

While Mr. Carney's remarks were aimed at discussing the fallout from Mr. Trump's disruptive and protectionist tenure as president, he only named the United States once in the speech when he cited “American hegemony.”

He said there is strength in numbers in this new reality.

“Middle powers must act together, because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu.”

As one example of middle powers working together, Mr. Carney said Canada stands firmly committed to the collective defence of Greenland under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

“On Arctic sovereignty, we stand firmly with Greenland and Denmark and fully support their unique right to determine Greenland's future,” the Prime Minister said.

“Our commitment to NATO's Article Five is unwavering,” he said, referring to the collective defence section in the NATO treaty that states an armed attack against one or more members in Europe or North America is considered an attack against all.

Speaking at Davos, Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand declined to say whether Canada will send troops to Greenland in support of the Danish territory. 

“We regularly participate in NATO exercises, and we participate in exercises that the Canadian Armed Forces itself leads,” she said. “Regarding future deployments and future exercises, those are decisions that the Minister of National Defence makes, together with the chief of defence staff.”

The rules-based international order is the post-Second World War system of global governance built on international law, norms, treaties and institutions such as the United Nations and World Trade Organization. It calls for the respect of state sovereignty, peaceful dispute resolution, free trade, human rights and co-operation on challenges such as security and climate.

Mr. Carney invoked Czech writer Václav Havel, a dissident who later entered political life, to frame his argument about how middle powers are propping up the lie that the rules-based order still works.

“The rules-based order is fading,” he said.

For decades, he said, America as a superpower delivered benefits for many middle powers, such as open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security and support for dispute resolution frameworks.

Just as Mr. Havel described Soviet-era shopkeepers placing signs with Communist slogans in their windows to avoid trouble, participating in rituals they knew to be false, Mr. Carney argued that middle powers have similarly gone along with the fiction of a rules-based order that no longer protects them.

It is time for countries “to take their signs down,” the Prime Minister said. 

“Stop invoking the rules-based international order as though it still functions as advertised,” Mr. Carney said. “Call the system what it is: a period of intensifying great power rivalry where the most powerful pursue their interests using economic integration as a weapon of coercion.”

His sharpest words Tuesday were reserved for countries that only selectively criticize economic coercion.

“Apply the same standards to allies and rivals. When middle powers criticize economic intimidation from one direction but stay silent when it comes from another, we are keeping the sign in the window.”

Asked by the moderator after his speech whether NATO member countries are also pretending the transatlantic partnership is intact when it isn't, Mr. Carney said Greenland will be a test of the alliance. “I think clearly NATO is experiencing a test right now,” he said, adding the response should be to bolster the security of Greenland and the Arctic. 

On Tuesday, as he prepared to head to the World Economic Forum, Mr. Trump posted a photo of himself sitting in the Oval Office talking to European leaders, which had been altered to show a map of the Western Hemisphere with American flags covering not only the United States but also Greenland, Canada, Cuba and Venezuela.

Mr. Carney, who last week struck a new strategic partnership with China's authoritarian leadership, championed in his Davos speech what he called “values-based realism” – a term borrowed from Finnish President Alexander Stubb – which combines principled commitments to sovereignty and human rights with pragmatic engagement in a fragmented world. 

Mr. Carney's central argument was that middle powers must combine their strength rather than compete for favour with great powers. 

“When we only negotiate bilaterally with a hegemon, we negotiate from weakness. We accept what is offered. This is not sovereignty. It is the performance of sovereignty while accepting subordination.”

The Prime Minister said middle powers need to build new institutions between them, strengthen their domestic economies, diversify their trade internationally and work together in coalitions, not bilaterally, when dealing with great powers.

“Rather than waiting for a great power to restore an order it is dismantling, create institutions and agreements that function as described,” he said.

“This is not naive multilateralism. Nor is it relying on diminished institutions. It is building the coalitions that work, issue by issue, with partners who share enough common ground to act together,” he said.

Earlier in the day, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the World Economic Forum that the economic coercion Mr. Trump is threatening to acquire Greenland is a mistake and warned the European Union's response would be “unflinching, united and proportional.”

Ms. von der Leyen pushed back against Mr. Trump's threats of 10-per-cent tariffs on European allies and Britain until he is allowed to annex Greenland – and his warning that levies would rise to 25 per cent in June.

Mr. Trump, who has said there is “no going back” on taking Greenland is due to arrive at the World Economic Forum Wednesday. 

He has justified his demand to acquire Greenland by saying the strategically located island is vulnerable to takeover by China or Russia and that neither Denmark nor Greenlanders have the power to stop this.

Ms. von der Leyen said the EU shares the U.S. concern about safeguarding Greenland and is prepared to ramp up spending and protective measures there.

She said the “sovereignty and integrity” of Danish territory “is non-negotiable” and Brussels is working on a “massive European investment surge” in Greenland. 

“We will work with Greenland and Denmark hand in hand to see how we can further support the local economy and infrastructure,” she said. “We will work with the U.S. and all partners on wider Arctic security.”

            The world has entered “an era of global water bankruptcy” with irreversible consequences, according to a new United Nations report.
    


            Regions across the world are afflicted by severe water problems: Kabul may be on course to be the first modern city to run out of water. Mexico City is sinking at a rate of around 20 inches a year as the vast aquifer beneath its streets is over-pumped. In the US Southwest, states are locked in a continual battle over the how to share the shrinking water of the drought-stricken Colorado River.
    


            The global situation is so severe that terms like “water crisis” or “water stressed” fail to capture its magnitude, according to the report published Tuesday by the United Nations University and based on a study in the journal Water Resources.
    


            “If you keep calling this situation a crisis, you're implying that it's temporary. It's a shock. We can mitigate it,” said Kaveh Madani, director of the UN University's Institute for Water, Environment and Health, and the report's author.
    


            With bankruptcy, while it's still vital to fix and mitigate where possible, “you also need to adapt to a new reality… to new conditions that are more restrictive than before,” he told CNN.
    


            The concept of water bankruptcy works like this: Nature provides income in the form of rain and snow, but the world is spending more than it receives — extracting from its rivers, lakes, wetlands and underground aquifers at a much faster rate than they are replenished, putting us in debt. Climate change-fueled heat and drought are compounding the problem, reducing available water.
    


            The result is shrinking rivers and lakes, dried-up wetlands, declining aquifers, crumbling land and sinkholes, the creep of desertification, a dearth of snow and melting glaciers.
    


            The statistics in the report are stark: more than 50% of the planet's large lakes have lost water since 1990, 70% of major aquifers are in long-term decline, an area of wetlands almost the size of the European Union has been erased over the past 50 years, and glaciers have shrunk 30% since 1970. Even in places where water systems are less strained, pollution is reducing the amount available for drinking.
    


            “Many regions are living beyond their hydrological means” and it's impossible now to return to conditions that used to exist, Madani said.
    


            It brings human consequences: nearly 4 billion people face water scarcity for at least one month every year.
    


            Yet, instead of recognizing the problem and adjusting consumption, water is taken for granted and “credit lines keep increasing,” Madani said.
    


            He referred to cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Tehran, where expansion and development have been encouraged, despite limited water supplies. “Everything looks right until it's not,” and then it's too late, Madani said.
    


            Some regions are affected more severely, the report noted. The Middle East and North Africa grapple with high water stress and extreme climate vulnerability.
    


            Parts of South Asia are experiencing chronic declines in water due to groundwater-dependent farming and ballooning urban populations.
    


            The US Southwest is another a hotspot, according to the report. Madani pointed to the Colorado River, where water sharing agreements are based on an environmental situation that no longer exists. Drought has shrunk the river, but it's not a temporary crisis, he said, “it's a permanent new condition, and we have less water than before.”
    


            The findings are alarming, but recognizing water bankruptcy can help countries move from short term emergency thinking to long-term strategies to reduce irreversible damage, Madani said.
    


            The report calls for a series of actions, including transforming farming — by far the biggest global user of water — through shifting crops and more efficient irrigation; better water monitoring using AI and remote sensing; reducing pollution; and increasing protection for wetlands and groundwater.
    


            Water could also be a “bridge in a fragmented world,” as an issue able to transcend political differences, the report authors wrote. “We are seeing more and more countries appreciating the value of it and the importance of it, and that's what makes me hopeful,” Madani said.
    


            The report's call to action “rightly centres on long-term recovery as opposed to firefighting water crises,” wrote Richard Allen, a climate science professor at the University of Reading, who was not involved in the research. Limiting the climate change will also be vital to ensuring enough water for people and ecosystems, he told CNN.
    


            Jonathan Paul, associate professor in geoscience at Royal Holloway University, said the report “lays bare, in unambiguous terms, humankind's mistreatment of water.” But he said the concept of global water bankruptcy is “overstated,” even if many areas are expressing acute water stress.
    


            Madani wants the report to spur action. “By acknowledging the reality of water bankruptcy, we can finally make the hard choices that will protect people, economies, and ecosystems. The longer we delay, the deeper the deficit grows.”

Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky has canceled his trip this week to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, after the White House reportedly scrapped plans for him to meet with US President Donald Trump.

The meeting was reportedly intended to serve as a sign-off for the ‘prosperity plan' – an agreement regarding the rare-earths deal struck between Trump and Zelensky last year, which the US president has positioned as a way to recoup America's expenses in the Ukraine conflict. It is reportedly envisioned to attract $800 billion in Ukraine reconstruction loans, grants, and private sector investment over the next decade.

Speaking to journalists in Kiev on Tuesday, Zelensky said he will stay in Ukraine unless there are “security guarantee” or “prosperity plan” documents to sign with the US side.

Shortly afterward, Ukrainian opposition MP Aleksey Goncharenko wrote that the Ukrainian leader would not travel to the World Economic Forum, as “the meeting with Trump was canceled.”

“No agreement will be signed,” he said on Telegram.

According to Axios, a US official has denied that any date for signing the ‘prosperity agreement' was set, as it still needs work.

The Ukrainian leader had been “keen” on meeting with Trump, according to Politico. “The reluctance to have one is coming from the White House,” the outlet wrote on Tuesday, citing a Republican foreign policy expert.

The rare-earths deal was a key precondition for the US to “move forward” with a diplomatic push to end the conflict, Trump has said.

However, as of right now, Zelensky is the reason why the effort has not succeeded, the US president told Reuters last week. Russian President Vladimir Putin is “ready to make a deal… I think Ukraine is less ready to make a deal,” he said.

Moscow has accepted a number of conditions laid out by the US prior to the Alaska summit between Trump and Putin last year, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Tuesday. “We still hope that these understandings remain fully valid.”

MOSCOW, January 20. /TASS/. The US is the only Western country willing to address the root causes of the Ukrainian conflict, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during a news conference to review the results of Russian diplomacy in 2025.

He also noted that, while the West has the right to talk among themselves ""on the basis of their own rules,"" Moscow will conduct dialogue with its partners on the basis of equality and mutual respect.

TASS has compiled the top Russian diplomat's key statements.

It is the West's prerogative to speak among themselves ""on the basis of their own rules,"" while Russia will conduct dialogue with its partners ""on the basis of the principle of equality.""

Russia is ready to work with anyone willing to ""negotiate honestly, on an equal footing, without blackmail or pressure"": ""And this is well known to all.""

Despite what Western detractors may say, Moscow's ""notorious isolation"" has not been realized.

""Russia will consistently defend its interests without infringing on the legitimate rights of others, nor will it allow its own legitimate rights to be violated.""

Russia is ready to continue seeking a diplomatic settlement to the Ukrainian crisis and has always been open to doing so: ""If you look at the history of this crisis, starting in 2014 and especially since 2022, you will see that Russia has shown a great deal of goodwill when it comes to concluding political agreements. However, each time, our Western neighbors, primarily European, did everything they could to block these agreements.""

Ukraine is in a ""very bad situation"" both on the front lines and in political life.

In the West, only the US is ready to address the root causes of the Ukrainian conflict: ""The only Western country that is ready to address the task of eliminating the root causes of this conflict, which was largely created by Donald Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, and his administration.""

The US-proposed plan for a peaceful settlement of the Ukrainian crisis takes into account the elimination of the root causes of the conflict: ""We support this approach and consider it fully justified.""

Russia hopes that the understandings and agreements reached during the Alaska summit between Russia and the US ""will remain fully in force.""

Moscow cannot allow the West to rearm the Kiev regime so that it attacks Russia ""as a tool of the insane Western Europeans.""

The security guarantees Europe offers Ukraine are intended to preserve the Nazi regime in Kiev: ""We must not forget this.""

Russia does not accept proposals for a settlement in Ukraine that aim to preserve the Nazi regime in Kiev: ""Proposals for a settlement that are based on the task of preserving the Nazi regime in that part of Ukraine that will be so-called are, of course, absolutely unacceptable.""

The Russian side has not received any documents on the results of the meetings between the US, Europe, and Ukraine in recent weeks: ""We have not received any recent documents on the results of the negotiations between the US, Ukraine, and Europe over the past couple of weeks.""

The EU is again trying to come up with ""some kind of coalition"" against Russia, calling for the creation of a security system involving Ukraine.

Europe and the Kiev regime led by Vladimir Zelensky are ""hysterically"" trying to shift Washington's position, which was agreed upon with Moscow in Anchorage.

European leaders' goal of inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia ""remains in their plans and intentions.""

Against the backdrop of his anti-Russian statements, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz should be reminded of the consequences of the ""arrogance of the German leadership"" throughout history.

NATO is ""seriously preparing"" for war with Russia.

Many serious Western politicians now regret not paying attention to Russian President Vladimir Putin's speech at the 2007 Munich Security Conference: ""They regret not listening, not hearing, and taking it as just another piece of rhetoric.""

Statements by European leaders about the need for dialogue with Russia now sound insincere. If they are really interested in contacting Moscow, they ""just need to call.""

French President Emmanuel Macron has been rude and dismissive toward Russia, but Moscow is above such rhetoric: ""Well, if you're going to be rude, then ignore Russia. We are, of course, above that and treat such statements not even with contempt, but with disdainful disregard.""","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

A record number of tourists flocked to Japan last year, officials said yesterday, despite a steep fall in Chinese visitors last month as a diplomatic row between Beijing and Tokyo rumbled on.

Japan logged 42.7 million arrivals last year, the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism said, topping 2024's record of nearly 37 million as the weak yen boosted the appeal of the “bucket list” destination.

However, the number of tourists from China last month dropped about 45 percent from a year earlier to about 330,000.

Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's suggestion in November last year that Tokyo could intervene militarily in any attack on Taiwan triggered a sharp diplomatic backlash from China, which urged its citizens to avoid traveling to Japan.

The announcement yesterday showed that the warning had an impact on visitor numbers.

China has been the biggest source of tourists to Japan, with almost 7.5 million visitors in the first nine months of last year — one-quarter of all foreign tourists, official data showed.

Attracted by a weak yen, Chinese tourists splashed out the equivalent of US$3.7 billion in the third quarter of last year.

However, Japanese Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Yasushi Kaneko said it was a “significant achievement” that overall visitors numbers had topped 40 million people for the first time.

“While the number of Chinese tourists in December decreased, we attracted a sufficient number of people from many other countries and regions to offset that,” he said, adding that there had been a “steep” increase in tourists from Europe, the US and Australia.

“We also hope and want to make sure that Chinese visitors will return to us as soon as possible,” he added.

The overall increase is partly due to government policies to promote attractions from Mount Fuji's majestic slopes to shrines and sushi bars in more far-flung parts of the archipelago.

The Japanese government has set an ambitious target of reaching 60 million tourists annually by 2030.

However Japan's biggest travel agency JTB forecast that overall tourist numbers this year would be “slightly lower” compared with last year due to a decrease in demand from China and Hong Kong.

Nevertheless, tourism income was expected to increase due to rising prices of items such as lodging and strong spending among visitors.

It added that due to an uptick in repeat visitors to Japan, the places people want to visit are shifting from large cities to rural areas.

Trump lambasted Britain's deal to cede sovereignty of the Chagos Archipelago including an island with an important U.S.-UK air base as an act of 'total weakness' and 'great stupidity' underlining why he wants to acquire Greenland.

Reuters

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has spent months trying to appease Donald Trump, but he's now facing the wrath of the U.S. President over Greenland and Britain's decision to give up sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, a former colony in the Indian Ocean that's home to the Diego Garcia military base.

This week Mr. Trump singled out the U.K. and seven other NATO allies for participating in a military exercise in Greenland, threatening to slap a 10 per cent tariff on imports from those countries. He said the tariffs will go even higher if Mr. Starmer and leaders from the other countries continue to oppose his plan to take over Greenland, a semi-autonomous part of Denmark.

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump issued a withering criticism of Mr. Starmer's move to hand control of the Chagos Islands back to Mauritius, calling it an act of “great stupidity” even though the President previously supported the decision.

“Shockingly, our “brilliant” NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,” the President wrote on social media. He added that “The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.”

Under an agreement reached last May, Britain handed sovereignty of the islands back to Mauritius and signed a 99-year lease for the Diego Garcia base, which is jointly run by Britain and the U.S. The British government has also agreed to pay Mauritius around £101-million annually, or $188-million, in total costs.

The deal, which has yet to be ratified by the British Parliament, ended a long-running dispute over the Chagos Islands which dated back to colonial times. 

The islands were separated from Mauritius in 1965 when it was a British colony. Britain paid the Mauritian government £3-million and forced thousands of people to move to make way for the Diego Garcia military complex.

Earlier: U.K. hands sovereignty of Chagos Islands to Mauritius in a deal to secure U.S. base

Mauritius has long argued that it was forced into the deal in return for independence. In 2019, an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice said Britain should hand the islands back. 

When the deal was signed, Mr. Starmer argued there was no alternative and said it would ensure the continuation of the Diego Garcia facility. “If we did not agree to this deal the legal situation would mean that we would not be able to prevent China or any other nation setting up their own bases on the outer islands or carrying out joint exercises near our base,” he said at the time. 

Mr. Starmer also said “President Trump has welcomed the deal along with other allies, because they see the strategic importance of this base and that we cannot cede the ground to others who would seek to do us harm.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a statement at the time echoing Mr. Starmer. The agreement “reflects the enduring strength of the U.S.-U.K. relationship,” he said. Mr. Rubio added that Mr. Trump “expressed his support for this monumental achievement.”

That appeared to change on Monday with Mr. Trump's social media post blasting Mr. Starmer. 

Mr. Trump's comments appear to have more to do with justifying his obsession with acquiring Greenland. He is expected to meet European leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week to discuss his “need” for Greenland, which has been opposed by a host of NATO allies including Canada. 

By reopening the Chagos Island decision, Mr. Trump has dealt another blow to Mr. Starmer who has gone out of his way to flatter the President. He invited Mr. Trump to a lavish state visit last fall with King Charles III and spent months carefully negotiating a trade deal that brought U.S. tariffs on British imports down to 10 per cent. Those taxes could now rise to 20 per cent because of Mr. Starmer's stance on Greenland. 

Mr. Trump's comments were also seized upon by British critics of the Chagos deal including Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, who is a close friend of Mr. Trump's. He and others have said the agreement weakens security because Mauritius has close ties to China. 

“Thank goodness Trump has vetoed the surrender of the Chagos islands,” Mr. Farage wrote on X on Tuesday. 

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch also welcomed Mr. Trump's broadside. “Keir Starmer's plan to give away the Chagos Islands is a terrible policy that weakens UK security and hands away our sovereign territory,” she wrote on X. 

A spokesman for the British government said the agreement was struck because the Diego Garcia base was under legal threat after various court decisions undermined Britain's claim to the islands. The agreement secures the operations of the base for generations, the spokesman added, and it has been welcomed by the U.S., Australia, India, Japan and South Korea. 

Mr. Starmer has yet to comment but on Monday he tried to keep up a brave face. He ruled out imposing retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. and said the relationship with America was too important to “throw away.” 

“I think that this can be resolved, and should be resolved, through calm discussion,” he said referring to Greenland.

Gavin Newsom, the California governor, scolded “pathetic” European leaders for kowtowing to Donald Trump.

Mr Newsom said he “should have brought knee pads” to Davos for European leaders whom he implored to stand up to the US president following his renewed threat to take over Greenland.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, Mr Newsom said Britain, France and other nations needed to “have a backbone”, accusing them of “rolling over” for Mr Trump.

At the suggestion that European leaders were engaged in what they considered diplomacy, Mr Newsom was dismissive.

Mr Newsom did not say Europe had been eaten alive quite yet, but they will be “if they continue down this path”.

The president has ramped up his rhetoric on Greenland, and before flying to Davos shared an AI image of himself holding an American flag in the territory alongside a sign which read: “US Territory Est 2026”.

He again refused to rule out taking Greenland by force on Monday, even though an attack on the territory would amount to aggression against Denmark, a member of Nato.

A small number of British and European troops arrived on Jan 15 in Greenland's capital Nuuk in what was described as a reconnaissance mission.

It was the boldest move so far by the EU to protect Greenland, a self-governing territory of Denmark, which Mr Trump believes should belong to America because of the growing threat from China and Russia through the Arctic.

Mr Newsom made his comments after arriving at Davos, which has been thrown into disarray by Mr Trump's insistence that the US take ownership of the territory.

While Mr Newsom has not yet announced a presidential run, he is among the frontrunners for the Democrats in the 2028 election.

Asked by Sky News how the EU should handle Mr Trump, Mr Newsom did not hold back.

He said: “It's time to buck up. It's time to get serious and stop being complicit. It's time to stand tall and firm. Have a backbone.

“I've seen this in the United States, the supine Congress. It's time to stand tall and strong, stand united”.

Mr Newsom also took aim at the decision by Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Machado to hand her Nobel Peace Prize to Mr Trump.

He said: “I can't take this complicity, people rolling over. I should have brought a bunch of knee pads for all the world leaders. I mean, handing out crowns, this is pathetic, the Nobel prizes that are being given away. It's just pathetic.

“And I hope people understand how pathetic they look on the world stage. It's embarrassing”.

Mr Newsom said Europeans should “decide for themselves what to do, but one thing they can't do is what they've been doing, and they've been played.

“He's been playing you for fools, and it's embarrassing”.

Mr Newsom's comments followed further humiliation for Sir Keir Starmer after Mr Trump said that handing over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius was an “act of great stupidity”.

Mr Trump said that Sir Keir was giving away the territory which includes the island of Diego Garcia, the site of a key US military base, “for no reason whatsoever”.

Live Updates


• The Justice Department plans to subpoena Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison related to an investigation of possible obstruction of federal officers during recent protests, two sources said. The governor and Minneapolis' mayor, also Democrats, are expected to get subpoenas, too, as the Trump administration's turbocharged, coast-to-coast immigration enforcement crackdown targets the state.
    


• DOJ appealed a judge's ruling that federal agents in Minnesota can't arrest or use pepper spray on peaceful protesters or stop people in their cars without cause.
    


• DOJ launched a separate investigation after demonstrators interrupted Sunday service at a church where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent reportedly preaches.
    


• Critics are denouncing DOJ's handling of the fatal shooting this month of protester Renee Good in Minneapolis. While the FBI briefly opened a civil rights investigation into the ICE agent who shot Good, the probe pivoted to investigating Good and those around her, including her widow.
    


            Minneapolis-area police leadership say over the last two weeks especially, “endless reports” from community members of civil rights violations by ICE agents have flooded their jurisdictions – and now, reports from their own officers paint a similar story.
    


            In a joint news conference, St. Paul Police Chief Axel Henry, Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt, and Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley called for better supervision and accountability from federal partners and stressed the importance of respecting constitutional rights.
    


            In Brooklyn Park, Bruley alleged some of his off- duty officers — all people of color — have been targeted by ICE agents in recent weeks, without quantifying how many.
    


            CNN has reached out to DHS and ICE about the allegations.
    


            In one instance, a female off-duty officer was pulled over during a traffic stop and boxed in by ICE agents, Bruley alleged, and said ICE agents demanded to see her paperwork. While stopped, Bruley said his officer was held at gunpoint, her cellphone was knocked out of her hand and she wasn't permitted to record the interaction. To de-escalate the situation, Bruley's officer identified herself as a police officer and that's when agents “immediately left after hearing this, making no other comments, no other apologies.”
    


            “I wish I could tell you that this was an isolated incident,” he said.
    


            The Justice Department has delivered a subpoena to Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey over an investigation into possible obstruction of federal law enforcement, according to his office.
    


            CNN reported Friday that subpoenas were issued for both Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.
    


            President Donald Trump and his administration have been critical of state and local officials' response to unrest in Minnesota over the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, with the president suggesting he might invoke the Insurrection Act and deploy troops to the city to quell any violence.
    


            When protesters started chanting inside a church where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent reportedly preaches, supporters said the demonstrators were exercising their First Amendment right to freedom of speech.
    


            But critics also invoked the First Amendment – saying the protesters may have violated the FACE Act, which bans the obstruction of a person trying to “exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.” The Department of Justice is investigating.
    


            Freedom of speech “is not absolute,” the Congressional Research Service has explained.
    


            Americans generally have freedom of speech on public property – but not necessarily in private places, legal analysts say. The fact that a space, like a church, is open to visitors does not mean there is a constitutional entitlement to use that space for protest.
    


            While the First Amendment protects citizens from government censorship, freedom of speech “does not apply in private spaces or to private people or organizations,” the Freedom Forum said.
    


            “In fact, the First Amendment protects private people and companies' right to make their own decisions about speech in their spaces.”
    


            A group of Minnesota doctors are holding a news conference today to condemn ICE for creating violence and intimidation in healthcare settings, leading to disruptions in their ability to treat patients.
    


            Notable medical leaders who are expected to be present include Lisa Mattson, president of the Minnesota Medical Association; Erin Stevens of the Minnesota Chapter of American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; and Janna Gewirtz O'Brien, president-elect of the Minnesota Chapter of American Academy of Pediatrics.
    


            The news conference will begin at 11:30 a.m. local time. Minnesota Sens. Alice Mann and Matt Klein, both Democrats, are also expected to join the physicians.
    


            CNN's Erin Burnett spoke with Bishop Robert Hirschfeld of the Episcopal Church of New Hampshire about preparing for a “new era of martyrdom” following a wave of clashes across the US involving ICE.
    


            A video of Bishop Hirschfield speaking at a vigil honoring Renee Nicole Good earlier this month by an ICE officer, went viral.
    


            In his remarks, he urged his clergy to “get their wills written” and “have their affairs in order,” suggesting they may need to stand between the powers of the world and the most vulnerable with their bodies following the killing of Good.
    


            The bishop also addressed how the history of the church had a “sacrificial spirit” and how the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. embodied that aspect of the church.
    


            The Justice Department is planning to subpoena Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison in a criminal investigation of several state and local officials, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
    


            The planned subpoenas are related to an investigation into possible obstruction of federal officers in the state during recent protests, the sources said.
    


            CNN has previously reported Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey are also expected to receive federal criminal subpoenas from the US Attorney's Office in the state.
    


            The planned subpoenas are a significant escalation between the federal government and elected officials in Minnesota during an increase of immigration enforcement and following the shooting death of Minneapolis resident Renee Good by an ICE officer.
    


            A spokesperson for Ellison didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
    


            Walz and Frey have criticized the Justice Department's approach in their state.
    


This post has been updated with additional information from sources.



Correction: An earlier version of this post gave the wrong title for Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison.



            Attorney General Pam Bondi has landed in Minneapolis for an unannounced visit in a moment of immense tension following the shooting of Renee Good by a federal immigration officer.
    


            State and city officials in Minneapolis hadn't been advised of the attorney general's visit, further exacerbating a standoff between the state and the federal government, according to multiple people familiar with the situation.  It is not unusual for DOJ officials to travel without notifying state or local leaders.
    


            In recent days, Bondi and other top Justice Department officials have accused state and local leaders, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, of fueling protests, and CNN has reported the Justice Department is opening criminal investigations into Walz and Frey over possible obstruction of federal officials on the ground.
    


            The DOJ is also expected to subpoena Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, CNN reported. 



            Additionally, President Donald Trump has threatened to send a military presence to Minnesota under the Insurrection Act, an extreme possibility of the presidency that is likely to be met with challenges in court.
    


            Walz has accused the federal government of “weaponizing the justice system and threatening political opponents,” while Frey said he “will not be intimidated.”
    


            Tensions remain high after anti-ICE protesters interrupted a church service in St. Paul, Minnesota over the weekend chanting “ICE out” and Renee Good's name — the woman who was fatally shot by an ICE agent nearly two weeks ago.
    


Here's what else you should know today:



            The Department of Justice asked a federal judge Monday to reject a bid by Minnesota leaders to block President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown and to allow the surge of immigration agents in the state to move forward, after a lawsuit was brought by Minnesota and the Twin Cities claiming the move was unconstitutional.
    


                    “Minnesota wants a veto over federal law enforcement,” the new filing by the Trump administration said, describing the lawsuit brought by state and local officials as an “absurdity” that “would render the supremacy of federal law an afterthought to local preferences.”
                





            Officials in Minnesota filed the lawsuit last week in an effort to curb the administration's ongoing crackdown in their state, equating the surge of federal immigration agents to the state to “a federal invasion” and citing violations of the 10th Amendment. The suit was filed shortly after Illinois and the city of Chicago also sued the Trump administration, alleging the Department of Homeland Security has terrorized residents in “organized bombardment.”
    


            Trump and his administration have said the Constitution gives the federal government broad authority to enforce national immigration laws as the government sees fit.

            When a rogue House Democrat surprised his own party with an impeachment vote against President Donald Trump last month, drama quickly rippled through the rank-and-file.
    


            The party's staunchest Trump antagonists wanted to push forward with a showy rebuke of the commander-in-chief over recent violent threats to Democratic lawmakers, but many more feared the move distracted from the party's own agenda. Fellow Democrats waited for direction from their leadership. Then moments before the vote, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his deputies issued a statement declaring they wouldn't support or oppose the bill – instead they were voting “present.”
    


            Leadership's statement scrambled many members' plans. Several directly confronted Jeffries and his team on the floor, while others frantically phoned their staff about what they should do, according to a half dozen members and senior staffers who were on the floor or on the phone that day.
    


            The episode crystallized a much broader dilemma that Democrats face as they seek to flip control of the House, and possibly the Senate, for the second half of Trump's term. Democrats at all levels are grappling with how exactly to battle Trump if they win control of the House this November. If they take one or both chambers in the midterms, they'll have newfound oversight powers — and the ability to make Trump's life miserable. But they'll also face critical decisions about how to keep the government running, and try to get things done, with a man they despise and distrust.
    


            Then there's Democrats' fierce struggle for the future of their party. Ten years after he was first elected president and one year into his second term, Democrats still face deep ideological divisions about their party's broader identity beyond being a foil to the president.
    


            They believe they're succeeding in some key ways, such as exposing GOP divides, but that unity is fragile. Now, inside the Democratic caucus, lawmakers are privately beginning to talk about crafting a midterm message that can satiate their anti-Trump base — without overshadowing their economic and health care agenda that they hope can be taken up by the eventual face of the now leader-less party.
    


            “I think there's going to be, over the course of the next year, a great debate about the future of the country, and we're going to be leading that,” Rep. Greg Landsman of Ohio told CNN.
    


            Inside the US Capitol, Jeffries is quietly trying to steer his caucus away from bombastic, theatrical moves against the president or his Cabinet as he seeks to win back the House on a message of affordability. That includes in this month's emerging impeachment fight over Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in the wake of the deadly ICE shooting in Minnesota.
    


            While Jeffries' own committee leaders had planned to announce a cautious first step toward a possible impeachment into Noem last week, two rank-and-file Democrats in tough primary fights got ahead of leadership by announcing their own impeachment articles, according to a person familiar with the discussions.
    


            Jeffries told CNN that impeachment “is not an issue that often comes up” when he's out in the country. Instead, he said, people raise issues like higher costs of living and struggles to pay for housing, groceries and health and child care.
    


            Some of Jeffries' closest allies believe he has no interest in flipping the chamber with promises to impeach Trump for a third time and is realistic about the hurdles any impeachment faces in the Senate.
    


            “It's a waste of time,” one member close to Jeffries said of another Trump impeachment if Democrats flip the House. “He has been there, done that.”
    


            That member, like others interviewed for this story, was granted anonymity to freely discuss internal dynamics that they know are unpopular with the party's vocal base — especially during primary season. The issue remains potent for the base: One vocal group, Citizens' Impeachment, is organizing a mass protest at the Capitol on January 20, with removing Trump its demand.
    


            Another Democrat close to leadership warned that another impeachment vote would be a “huge mistake” and potentially risk the party's chances of winning back the White House in 2028. Recalling the last impeachment votes, the member noted: “We saw how that backfired.”
    


            Even some progressive Democrats agree.
    


            “I think he's a crook and I think he's a terrible human being. But at the same time, it's not gonna go anywhere,” Rep. Juan Vargas, who represents San Diego, said when asked about impeaching Trump next year. Noem, he said, is a different story: “She's one I think has to go, absolutely.
    


            Vargas is among many Democrats who believe their leadership would be much more likely to go after Trump's most contentious Cabinet member, such as Noem or Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth — hopeful that more Republicans will be willing to buck Trump in his final years in office.
    


            Jeffries, who called Noem “out of control” and emphasized accountability, said he hasn't “ruled anything in or anything out” – but that leaders in his caucus continue to discuss paths forward.
    


            Rep. Pete Aguilar, the No. 3 House Democrat, reinforced that impeachment is not the party's primary focus. The top priority, he said, is affordability.
    


            “The president is going to try to gin up his base and use this [impeachment] as a tool to get his folks out to vote. There's no basis behind it. It's not the priority of the Democratic caucus. But what he should be afraid of is the accountability and oversight that will come,” Aguilar said.
    


            Asked about leadership's decision not to take a clear position on the issue last month, Democratic Whip Katherine Clark said it was an acknowledgement that Democrats' simply can't force Trump from office right now.
    


            “The present vote was saying we know there have been impeachable offenses and we are clear-eyed about that,” she said. “We are also clear-eyed that we are in the minority.”
    


            Still, Democratic congressional leaders are confident they have a shot to retake the majority. “I predict Republicans will follow Trump over the cliff in the midterms and Democrats will win the Senate and House in 2026,” Schumer told CNN in a statement.
    


            From their perch in the minority, Democrats have successfully deployed their limited powers to cause major headaches for Trump and his GOP. Democrats won a major symbolic vote on health care this month, with 17 Republicans voting for Jeffries' bill to extend enhanced Obamacare subsidies for millions of Americans. Democrats helped sign into law a measure that forced Trump's Justice Department to release all of its Jeffrey Epstein files. They've come within two votes of a symbolic rebuke of Trump's war powers authority in Venezuela.
    


            For Democrats, those are significant wins that many of them did not expect a year ago after a worse-than-expected election that brought an emboldened Trump back to power.
    


            At the start of Trump's second term, multiple lawmakers recalled, many in the Democratic Party began with the attitude that they should take Trump and congressional Republicans seriously and respect the mandate they were given.
    


            That didn't last long.
    


            “For the first several months, everyone was looking for one neat trick or button to press to stop all the illegality. And what we've realized is that you just have to fight tooth and nail and find opportunities,” Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz said.
    


            The party, though, remains divided on how to use another key leverage point — their votes for government funding.
    


            Trump's ICE operations in Minnesota, which led to the fatal shooting of a protester earlier this month, and his subsequent threats to deploy the military to quell unrest in the state, have drawn fury from across the Democratic Party.
    


            Jeffries told CNN he expects his party to “be together” on the issue in the upcoming spending battle — and telegraphed that Democrats could demand some concessions on ICE.
    


            “There is no path forward for a significant number of Democrats to be supportive of spending legislation that does not include significant accountability measures so that ICE is forced to conduct itself, like every other law enforcement agency in the country,” he told said.
    


            But top Democrats have signaled they want to avoid another funding showdown with Trump — especially one over ICE and immigration — ahead of the next funding deadline on January 30.
    


            Asked about Trump's threats to invoke the Insurrection Act in response to Minnesota protests, the top Democrat on the House spending panel told CNN the party remained supportive of a Pentagon funding bill that would include no new restrictions on Trump.
    


            “That's a threat that comes every now and again. We're going to proceed on DOD,” Rep. Rosa DeLauro said.
    


            It's not yet clear how Democrats will confront funding issues if they do win back power in November — a major dilemma for a party that wants to see their leaders fight Trump, with little appetite for compromise.
    


            And for now, Hill Democrats are without a national leader to deliver marching orders on critical issues like how to balance governing with Trump accountability.
    


            In conversations with 15 Democrats in both chambers across the ideological spectrum, each member had a different answer as to who they see as the person to potentially lead Democrats out of the minority and back into power.
    


            Some think answers lie in the past.
    


            “I think Franklin D. Roosevelt may be the leader of our party,” Rep. Jamie Raskin said, after a long pause.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","American Battleground: The peace president's busy year of gunboat diplomacy","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/20/politics/american-battleground-trump-world","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 10:00:59 GMT","


            Before the stealth bombers streaked through the Middle Eastern night, or the missiles rained down on suspected terrorists in Africa, or commandos snatched a South American president from his bedroom, or the icy slopes of Greenland braced for the threat of invasion, there was an idea at the White House.
    


            It was a philosophy put into action by President Donald Trump but enunciated by top aide Stephen Miller.
    


            “We live in a world, in the real world, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power,” Miller told CNN's Jake Tapper. “These are the iron laws of the world that have existed since the beginning of time.”
    


            That is undoubtedly the kind of world the president has imagined ever since he stepped back into the Oval Office. While diplomats, global affairs analysts and foreign leaders stared open-mouthed, Trump spent his first year laying out a long list of demands and grievances he wants the world to answer for — or else, he's threatened, it will answer to the collected powers of the United States.
    


            His military inclinations have frequently led the way. Nodding heavily to the Department of Defense — which he calls the Department of War — Trump has routinely insinuated that the vast armaments under his command could be brought to bear on all sorts of foreign foes. It wasn't just bluster.
    


            In Nigeria, Somalia, Yemen, Iraq and Syria, Trump unleashed air attacks on groups identified as terrorists by intelligence forces. In Iran, he sent American planes to pound nuclear facilities with bunker-busting bombs. And after months of videos of alleged drug-running boats being blown out of the water in both the Caribbean and Pacific, Trump approved the huge raid that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
    


            What's more, Trump quickly declared the United States would effectively run the oil-rich nation for the foreseeable future. What did that mean? Sen. Tom Cotton had an idea. “When the president said the United States is going to be running Venezuela, it means that the new leaders of Venezuela need to meet our demands,” the Arkansas Republican told CNN's Dana Bash.
    


            But the details of such a plan remain a mystery and apparently a work in progress. And the debate about Venezuela's future was rapidly drowned out by yet another round of saber-rattling from Trump. Right after the move against Maduro, he threatened Cuba and another South American president: “Colombia is producing a lot of drugs … so he better wise up or he'll be next.”
    


            Early in his second term, Trump made noise about the United States reclaiming control of the Panama Canal, turning Canada into the 51st state and taking over Greenland. When both Greenland and Denmark, the country that oversees the self-governing Arctic territory, said, “No, thanks,” that issue faded.
    


            But with Maduro standing before a judge in New York accused of drug trafficking (never mind that Trump recently pardoned another Latin American leader sentenced to 45 years for — you guessed it — drug running), the US president resumed the drumbeat for America taking ownership of the world's largest island.
    


            “We are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not,” he said, insisting it is critical to US security, even as critics noted Greenland has hosted an American military base and shown broad agreement to meet US needs in the region for many decades.
    


            What's more, Trump's idea of taking Greenland is so unpopular with Americans — 75% opposed the move in a recent CNN poll — even some lawmakers in his own party are grumbling about a possible third impeachment if he goes ahead with the plan. It would be the “end of his presidency,” according to Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, who called the idea of taking over a NATO member “appalling.”
    


            While that drama plays out, Trump has also threatened fresh military strikes on Iran as protesters there rage against the long-standing clerical leadership. American warships have been sent to hover nearby, and once again — even as Trump backed off his rhetoric as he said executions of detained protesters had been halted — the world has eyed him warily.
    


            Until Trump's second term, US foreign policy did not seem to be heading in this direction.
    


            Near the end of Trump's first term, he told graduating cadets at West Point, “We are ending the era of endless wars.” In his campaign to retake the White House, MAGA fans cheered when Trump told them his focus would be on American jobs, the cost of groceries and gas, housing prices, and other domestic issues. On the stump, he accused then-President Joe Biden of carelessly and needlessly tangling the United States in foreign conflicts, and he laid the groundwork for the title he would soon bestow upon himself: the peace president.
    


            And after many fits and starts, even some of Trump's critics gave him credit when he secured an exchange of hostages and prisoners and a ceasefire to the brutal fighting between Israel and Hamas. Since then, each side has accused the other of violations, but the deal is progressing to what has been planned as a more secure second stage.
    


            Ukraine, however, has not made it that far. Although Trump is loath to say the war there was triggered by Russia's invasion in 2022, he boasted again and again in his campaign that he had the solution ready if only he were put back into office. “They're dying, Russians and Ukrainians,” he said in a 2023 CNN town hall. “I want them to stop dying. And I'll have that done — I'll have that done in 24 hours.”
    


            Instead, after a year of dealmaking, pleas, bluster, promises and insults — mostly aimed at Ukraine — Trump has virtually nothing to show for his bravado.
    


            None of that has kept him from endlessly bragging that he has solved or ended more than half a dozen wars since retaking the White House. Fact-checkers have exposed the claim as a wild exaggeration, but he has held to it. “I saved millions and millions of lives, and that's what really makes me feel good,” Trump told Fox News.
    


            Nor have his failures on the peace front blunted his naked desire for a specific recognition so far given to only four US presidents. “I can't think of anyone in history that should get the Nobel Prize more than me,” Trump has said, “and I don't want to be bragging but nobody else settled wars. (President Barack Obama) got it almost immediately upon attaining office and he didn't do anything, and he was a bad president.”
    


            Trump was stung when the 2025 Nobel went to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado. In an act of conciliation, Machado gave her medal to Trump when she visited the White House recently.
    


            “I thought it was a very nice gesture,” he said.
    


            The Nobel committee has noted that the award is not transferable, yet Norway — which does not control the committee — soon felt Trump's wrath too. As international apprehension rose over a possible military confrontation in Greenland, Trump wrote to the Norwegian prime minister, “Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.”
    


            Trump's clashes with the world are not all about military might. His budget cuts to US foreign aid programs rattled many nations that had come to depend on Uncle Sam's generosity to meet the food, medical and educational needs of their people. Diplomats and charity workers alike were stunned by the sudden abandonment of these “soft power” programs, which even some American military generals had long called effective in building international goodwill.
    


            Trump pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Human Rights Council and many more international agreements. With each withdrawal, his critics added up the expected cost to America's global reputation and influence, and analysts predicted that China would rapidly step into the gap by forming new partnerships that could cost the US for years.
    


            Still, one of Trump's most globe-shaking moments came not with the roar of a jet or the wail of an abandoned ally. It came with a chart. On the second morning of April, on the sunny lawn of the White House, Trump hoisted a board covered with names of countries and rows of numbers and launched what many critics would characterize as economic warfare on the entire planet.
    


            “It's our declaration of economic independence,” Trump said of the staggering tariffs he unveiled on his self-declared “Liberation Day.” He has long believed that charging countries more to sell their goods in the US is key to future American wealth. It did not seem to matter to him that economic analysts broadly saw the idea as regressive, dangerous and doomed from the start. Trump was beaming.
    


            “Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country, and you see it happening already,” he said.
    


            The president fiercely pushed the idea that foreign governments and businesses would bear the brunt of the much-higher rates he was imposing on their imports to the US. But economists insisted that Trump was ignoring a basic truth: Tariffs are taxes and consumers pay for them. Indeed, estimates soon predicted average American families would see their spending rise by thousands of dollars as Trump's tariffs settled in.
    


            Rates for specific countries — and their own retaliatory measures — have risen and fallen so often that only the most dedicated observers can keep track.
    


            But Trump insists his tariffs have produced an immense windfall for the US government. Between the direct income and associated investments, he has repeatedly said they've “helped us get $18 trillion brought into the country.” Other analysts put the sum for all tariffs collected in 2025 closer to $200 billion. Yet, at one point Trump said there was so much fresh cash, he might send a $2,000 check to every American. His Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, met the idea with reserve. “We will see,” he told Fox News. “We need legislation for that.”
    


            Trump has hinted more tariffs can be imposed at any time. And in a move that brings his imperialistic tendencies together, he's threatened them against several European nations unless there's a deal for the US to acquire Greenland. This would seem to be one reason Trump is fearful that the Supreme Court could nullify his tariffs on grounds that he did not invoke the proper authority to impose them. Posting on his Truth Social account, Trump wrote, “If the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza, WE'RE SCREWED!”
    


            More than once in the first year of Trump's second term, friends and foes alike have dusted off an age-old debate about the effectiveness of the Monroe Doctrine. Stemming from President James Monroe in 1823, it pushed the idea that the Americas — all of them — should be free from European influence and snugly under the thumb of the United States. Through time and the influence of other presidents, Theodore Roosevelt chief among them, it became more broadly a notion that the US should be the preeminent and unconstrained power of the Western Hemisphere, pole to pole.
    


            More than a year into Trump's return to office, some conservatives are winking at the president's first name, calling his view of international affairs “the Donroe Doctrine.” It's a turn of phrase he has repeated, and that was echoed in a new national security strategy released just before the holidays. “The United States must be preeminent in the Western Hemisphere,” it said, “as a condition of our security and prosperity—a condition that allows us to assert ourselves confidently where and when we need to in the region.”
    


How right-wing media inspired Trump's ‘Donroe Doctrine'



            Among his political critics, that kind of language is deeply worrisome. Trump's supporters, however, broadly say he has made the world respect the United States again and no longer take for granted its protection or generosity. His fans appreciate his ready use of military might to impose US ideals on other nations or to even seize land that might serve national interests. To bring it back to the ideas of Miller, some Trump supporters are delighted to have a powerful president unafraid to use that power despite custom, international norms or laws.
    


            When New York Times reporters asked Trump in a lengthy interview whether he saw any limit to his power, he could think of only a single possibility. “Yeah, there is one thing,” he said. “My own morality. My own mind. It's the only thing that can stop me.”
    


            But polls show that Americans who support Trump's global ambitions — militarily, economically and culturally — are a minority and shrinking. Proving even if the world really is all about power, holding on to it can be difficult.

Indiana achieved one more first to end its magical season full of firsts: The national champion Hoosiers are No. 1 in the final Associated Press Top 25 college football poll.

After beating Miami in the College Football Playoff title game to cap a 16-0 season that was unprecedented in the modern era, the Hoosiers on Tuesday became the third straight Big Ten team to finish on top of the rankings. Indiana's championship and No. 1 final ranking followed those of fellow Big Ten teams Ohio State in 2024 and Michigan in 2023.

No. 2 Miami (13-3) moved up eight spots and ended with its highest ranking since the 2002 season, when it was second behind Ohio State. The 2003 Miami team had been the most recent to finish in the top 10.

Mississippi (13-2), which lost to Miami in the CFP semifinals after it beat Tulane and Georgia following coach Lane Kiffin's departure for LSU, was No. 3, its highest final ranking since 1962.

No. 4 Oregon (13-2) finished in the top 10 for a third straight year and No. 5 Ohio State was in the final top 10 for the 12th straight year. The Big Ten had three teams in the final top five for the second straight year.

Georgia (12-2), Texas Tech (12-2), Texas A&M (11-2), Alabama (11-4) and Notre Dame (10-2) rounded out the top 10.

The Bulldogs were No. 6 in the final poll for the second straight season and have ended in the top 10 every since since 2017. Texas Tech is a season-ending top-10 team for the first time. Texas A&M hadn't been ranked in a final poll season since Jimbo Fisher's 2020 team was No. 4. Alabama, which had ended every season between 2008-23 in the top 10, was back after slipping to No. 17 last year.




Notre Dame won 10 straight games following an 0-2 start, was left out of the playoff and opted to not play in a bowl game. The Irish slipped one spot and were ranked in a ninth straight final poll.

The Hoosiers were No. 20 in the preseason poll after going 11-2 in Curt Cignetti's first season. They earned their then-highest ranking ever at No. 3 after they won at Oregon to go 6-0. They moved up to No. 2 the following week and stayed there for seven straight polls. Their 13-10 win over Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game pushed them to No. 1 heading into the playoff.

— No. 17 Iowa was ranked for the first time this season after winning three straight, including a bowl win over Vanderbilt. No. 22 Houston beat Baylor and LSU to end the season and was ranked for the first time in four polls. No. 25 TCU, which had been 18 spots out of the Top 25, was ranked for the first time since September after beating Houston, Cincinnati and USC.

— Arizona (21), Georgia Tech (24) and Missouri (25) dropped out.

— The SEC had seven teams in the final Top 25 for the second straight year. Last season was the first time that had happened since 2013.

— No. 15 Vanderbilt has its highest final ranking since the 1948 team was No. 12.

— No. 19 James Madison No. 24 North Texas are in the final poll for the first time.

SEC (7 ranked teams): No. 3 Mississippi, No. 6 Georgia, No. 8 Texas A&M, No. 9 Alabama, No. 12 Texas, No. 13 Oklahoma, No. 15 Vanderbilt.

Big Ten (6): No. 1 Indiana, No. 4 Oregon, No. 5 Ohio State, No. 17 Iowa, No. 20 Southern California, No. 21 Michigan.

Big 12 (5): No. 7 Texas Tech, No. 11 BYU, No. 14 Utah, No. 22 Houston, No. 25 TCU.

American (3): No. 18 Tulane, No. 23 Navy, No. 24 North Texas.

ACC (2): No. 2 Miami, No. 16 Virginia.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","The Brits still have a secret weapon to try on Trump in the war over Greenland","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/washington-secrets/4425399/british-secret-weapon-trump-war-greenland/","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:55:10 GMT","

British officials went to bed on Monday thinking they had averted a crisis. They woke up in the middle of an even deeper row over Greenland, tiny specks of rock in the Indian Ocean, and whether they should deploy their ultimate Trump card: King Charles.

Once again, President Donald Trump had upended everything with an early-hours Truth Social post.

It was all so different on Monday evening, when Secrets was chatting with sources. Crisis, the Brits believed, had been averted by the rational application of cool heads and a dose of logic.

A call from Sir Keir Starmer, the prime minister, to Trump had set things straight. It had all been a simple misunderstanding. 

The European troops sent to the rocky island were not there as an expeditionary force to lay claim to the territory and defend it from U.S. interests, Starmer explained over the weekend. It was, in fact, the first step in making good on a commitment to do exactly what Trump wanted.

So the French contingent that arrived in the capital, Nuuk, over the weekend was part of a recce. Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands and the U.K. were all involved in scoping out how NATO could better defend the strategic island against growing Russian and Chinese activity in the North Atlantic.

Trump had seen a red flag. The threat of sanctions followed, risking a rift in NATO.

Cue phone call from Starmer. He has been something of a Trump whisperer, deploying charm, flattery and an invitation from King Charles to get his way. He was the first foreign leader to secure a trade deal last year, for example.

On Monday, it looked as if it had worked again. Reports surfaced that the president told the prime minister during the call that he may have gotten “bad information” on the troop deployments.

The Brits quietly briefed that things were going in the right direction and urged their European counterparts not to panic. “Keep calm and carry on,” was the message, just so long as French President Emmanuel Macron could keep his trade “bazooka,” and the threat of massive financial retaliation, in his pants.

The result is an intriguing test of how to handle this most irascible of presidents. Take Trump seriously but not literally, and sweet-talk him down from the ledge of wrecking the trans-Atlantic alliance, or fight might with might, unleashing the European Union's full financial clout in a show of force that the president could not ignore.

The early verdict came in during the early hours of Tuesday. And it was not good for London.

Trump turned his fire on Starmer, slamming his decision to cede ownership of the Chagos Islands, a tiny archipelago in the Indian Ocean, which crucially includes the U.S. base at Diego Garcia.

Never mind that the deal to hand them to Mauritius lines up with international law and that it secures the base for a century.

And never mind that your Secrets scribe asked Trump about this on Air Force One a year ago. “It hasn't been No. 1 on my list, I'll be honest with you,” was his answer.

It was very much No. 1 on his list at 1:38 am. “Shockingly, our ‘brilliant' NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,” he posted.

It must have left British officials choking on their toast and marmalade.

They do still have one card up their sleeve. Trump may be prepared to slam the prime minister. Would he behave the same way to King Charles, for whom he clearly has a great deal of respect and with whom he bonded during the state visit to the U.K. last year?

Moreover, what if the king threatened to cancel his own state visit to Washington in April?

Starmer was asked twice about such a threat during an emergency news conference. Twice, he demurred.

“In relation to the King and other issues … I am focused on the pragmatic response here, not the suggestion of others, and my focus is what's in the national interest for our country,” he said.

NEWSOM RANTS ABOUT EUROPEAN LEADERS ‘ROLLING OVER' ON TRUMP: ‘HANDING OUT CROWNS'

We all know by now that the capital of Greenland is Nuuk. But look closely at those letters. There are no closed loops. None of its letters can be coloured in. You see what I'm saying — there are zero O's or capital R's with gaping holes that can be filled.

So which are the other four world capitals composed entirely of letters that cannot be colored in? There are no prizes, just a warm glow and a mention. You can send your answers to secrets @ washingtonexaminer.com.

A politician has quietly written an interesting book. Perhaps because Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) recognizes that much of politics is absurd, he has managed to deliver 216 pages of witticisms, putdowns, and aphorisms, while dwelling only briefly on his policy successes and high-school prowess. (My NOLA pal tells me there is good reason for only a brief mention of his successes.)

Some of the highlights are pen portraits of colleagues, including his description of Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), as, erm, unpredictable:

“Invite him to dinner, and you don't know if he'll sit down for an intelligent conversation or get drunk and vomit in the fish tank. But that's why I like him.”

“Bernie Sanders skipped every meeting for 18 years while serving on Holocaust Museum board” — “There are two large meetings every year where people fly in from all over the country for it. But Bernie Sanders couldn't be bothered to walk across the road in D.C.,” said fellow board member Robert Garson, president of the American Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists.

French President Emmanuel Macron texted President Donald Trump that he does “not understand” what the U.S. leader's goal in Greenland is, ahead of Trump's visit to speak in front of European leaders in Davos, Switzerland. 

The text, posted by Trump to Truth Social, detailed Macron's understanding of some of his recent geopolitical objectives. 

“My friend, We are totally in line on Syria. We can do great things on Iran. I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland,” Macron said in the posted message. “Let us try to build great things.”

“I can set up a G7 meeting after Davos in Paris on Thursday afternoon. I can invite the Ukrainians, the Danish, the Syrians, and the Russians, in the margins,” Macron added. “Let us have dinner together in Paris together on Thursday before you go back to the U.S.”

Macron's message comes as Trump heads to the World Economic Forum this week for the first time since 2020. Greenland is expected to be among the most discussed topics at Davos, as tensions have boiled over Trump's intentions to obtain the Arctic island for the U.S. and subsequent European objections against him doing so. It also comes on the heels of Trump's announcement last week of imposing 10% tariffs on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland after representatives from those countries “journeyed to Greenland for purposes unknown.”

The tariffs are to be “due and payable until such times as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” according to Trump's Truth Social post from Jan. 17.

It is believed that Trump will bring the largest delegation in U.S. history, according to the World Economic Forum. 

CONGRESS URGED TO STOP ‘MADNESS' OF TRUMP'S GREENLAND OBSESSION

Representatives from Denmark were invited to the WEF but opted not to attend due to the controversy surrounding Greenland, according to WEF.

“Any decisions on attendance are a matter for the government concerned. We can confirm that the Danish government will not be represented in Davos this week,” a Davos spokesperson said in a statement.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Supreme Court will hear another significant gun rights case on Tuesday when it weighs a challenge to a sweeping Hawaii gun law preemptively barring people from carrying guns on private property.

Hawaii's Act 52, enacted in 2023, bans handgun owners who have a concealed carry permit from bringing their weapon onto private property unless the owner or manager has given the person “express authorization to carry a firearm on the property.” Gun rights advocates have claimed the law is too sweeping and violates the Second Amendment, while anti-gun advocates frame the dispute as a matter of private property rights.

The Supreme Court's landmark June 2022 decision in New York Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen upheld the Second Amendment's right to bear arms by striking down a sweeping New York law that required a person to show “proper cause” to be given a permit to carry a concealed handgun in public. The holding in Bruen found that gun laws must conform with the history and tradition of the country's firearm regulations.

Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the 6-3 majority that “the constitutional right to bear arms in public for self-defense is not ‘a second-class right, subject to an entirely different body of rules than the other Bill of Rights guarantees.'”

With the Hawaii law at the center of the dispute in Wolford v. Lopez, the coalition of gunowners suing the state argues that Act 52 fails the Bruen test. Their brief to the high court said the lower appeals court cited two “outlier state laws separated by almost a century” to justify upholding the law at the center of the case.

“One law was limited to private lands closed to the public and was a racist statute enacted by a former Confederate state prior to being readmitted to the Union and was designed to strip former slaves of their right to bear arms. The second law was a single Founding era law that the court thought was a ‘dead ringer' but, in fact, was enacted as a hunting regulation to punish poaching on private land not held open to the public,” the brief said.

“Neither of these outlier laws is relevantly or distinctly comparable in the ‘how or why' to the Hawaii default rule. Even taken together, these two outlier laws do not amount to a well-established, representative or enduring national tradition that could justify Hawaii's default rule,” the brief continued.

The brief also warned that the law prohibits or creates “a presumption against carrying in 96.4% of the publicly accessible land in Hawaii,” and it pointed to the broad New York law overruled in Bruen as being similar to Act 52.

“Such a rule, the Court explained, swept ‘far too broadly' because it ‘would in effect exempt cities from the Second Amendment and would eviscerate the general right to publicly carry arms for self-defense.' Thus, the government may not ban arms simply because the public may ‘congregate' or gather in a location,” the brief said.

“Hawaii has gone much further, effectively banning firearms in public for the entire State,” the brief continued.

The lawsuit has garnered support from several gun rights groups, with various organizations filing briefs in support of the coalition of Hawaii gunowners seeking to strike down the Aloha State's Act 52. Many of the briefs argue that the sweeping nature of the law is what makes it plainly unconstitutional.

Michael Williams, general counsel for the pro-gun group American Suppressor Association, previously told the Washington Examiner the law at the center of the case makes it “basically impossible for anybody who wants to be law-abiding to actually exercise their constitutional right to bear arms outside the home.”

The coalition of gunowners also received backing from the Trump administration, with the Department of Justice filing a brief in support of striking down the law and receiving time to argue that position before the justices on Tuesday.

“Hawaii's restriction is blatantly unconstitutional as applied to private property open to the public. States cannot evade Bruen by banning public carry through indirect means. History establishes that firearms regulations are per se unconstitutional if they are designed to thwart the right to publicly carry arms, or if they effectively negate the right,” the DOJ's brief said.

The Justice Department explained in its brief how the law puts gun owners at risk in most publicly open places.

“In Hawaii, public-carry licensees who stop for gas with a pistol in the glove compartment risk a year in prison if they fail to obtain the gas-station owner's unambiguous consent. The same goes for licensees who run errands at grocery stores, dine at restaurants, or stop to buy coffee. A mere nod from the property owner—or an insufficiently conspicuous sign—puts license-holders at risk of prosecution even if the owner welcomes firearms but failed to express his approbation clearly enough,” the brief said.

While gun rights advocates have argued the law is plainly unconstitutional, Hawaii officials and anti-gun advocates have argued it falls in line with other laws restricting activities on private property.

“Hawai'i's law therefore respects the Second Amendment right of its citizens to bear arms, while vindicating their fundamental right to exclude unwanted entry onto private property,” Hawaii Attorney General Anne Lopez said in a brief to the high court.

Lopez argued in her brief to the Supreme Court that the state law aimed to balance “both the right to bear arms and property owners' undisputed right to choose whether to permit armed entry onto their property.”

“The resulting law requires a person to obtain consent to bring a gun onto private property. That consent can come from the property owner or one of his agents, and it can be oral or written,” Lopez said.

“The law therefore permits a person to bring a gun into any shop, convenience store, or other retail establishment so long as he gets an employee's on-the-spot okay. And if a property owner wants to dispense with the need for a conversation, he can post a sign or website notice reflecting his consent,” Lopez added.

Anti-gun groups have also defended the law as being more about setting default rules for private property, rather than an attempt to infringe on Second Amendment rights.

“At the core of this private property right is the right to exclude, to tell others to stay off your private property, or to limit what they can do there. Hawaii's law that's under attack here in the Supreme Court is part, an integral part, of the long history of laws supporting that right,” Douglas Letter, chief legal officer for the anti-gun group Brady, told reporters ahead of Tuesday's arguments.

“States have frequently set default rules, like Hawaii's, that require a private property owner's permission to do certain things on that private property, to hunt, for example, or graze cattle,” he added. “The basic principle is that private property owners are empowered to set the rules for their property, and the state can make it easier for those private property owners to do so.”

SUPREME COURT COULD LOAD UP ON GUN CASES THIS TERM

The Supreme Court will hear arguments in Lopez at 10 a.m. Tuesday, after the high court issues an order list at 9:30 a.m. and is expected to release at least one ruling ahead of the beginning of oral arguments.

A ruling in the case is expected by the end of June, when many of the other hotly contested cases of the Supreme Court's current term will also be decided.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump returned to the Oval Office one year ago, promising to clean house at the Justice Department and the FBI. But the administration's personnel overhaul is under scrutiny for a series of questionable holdovers.

Although data reveals a significant level of overall turnover across the DOJ since last year, a series of key career prosecutors and FBI officials tied to controversial investigations during former President Joe Biden‘s tenure remain employed by the department.

At DOJ, Jocelyn Ballantine, a longtime prosecutor who worked on several Jan. 6 Capitol riot defendants' cases, including those involving seditious conspiracy allegations surrounding the Proud Boys, was recently assigned as lead prosecutor in the Jan. 6 pipe bomber case. Critics have accused Ballantine of employing coercive plea tactics in earlier Jan. 6 matters and for her involvement in the criminal case of retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, making her a symbol for Trump allies concerned that the administration is not removing questionable career attorneys.

Speaking from the White House last month, Trump addressed Ballantine's status when asked by a LindellTV reporter about her tenure at the department.

“Did the Pipe Bomber Act Alone?” – @POTUS Responds to Explosive Question from LindellTVLindellTV's @CaraCastronuova asked President Trump at a roundtable:“What's your gut instinct? Did the alleged J6 pipe bomber act alone? And why is the same DOJ prosecutor from the Proud… pic.twitter.com/zeO9D4SccL

“I really appreciate that question,” Trump said. “Jocelyn is being looked at. They all have to be looked at. What they're doing is so bad. This was a whole Democrat hoax, the whole thing was a Democrat hoax. And it's being looked at.” Despite the president's comment, Ballantine continues to represent the Trump Justice Department in court.

Another holdover from previous administrations is Emily Miller, a 22-year veteran at the department who works in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, according to her LinkedIn account, and one who played a notable role in early Jan. 6 prosecutions. 

Miller was in charge of leading efforts to collect evidence from the day of the riot, writing in court filings that “footage displays approximately 1,000 events that may be characterized as assaults on federal officers,” according to a Sept. 1, 2021 status report in the case of Couy Griffin, who was later found guilty for “trespassing,” though her never stepped foot inside the U.S. Capitol.

Despite Trump's pardons of more than 1,500 defendants from the Jan. 6 riot prosecuted under former U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves, who was succeeded by Trump's nominee Jeanine Pirro, Miller remains at the department. Her continued tenure is just another example of career attorneys who handled Jan. 6-related cases who are still employed at the DOJ.

A similar pattern has emerged at U.S. attorneys' offices outside Washington. In 2022, the FBI carried out a highly publicized raid on the home of Catholic anti-abortion activist Mark Houck, leading to federal FACE Act charges that he was later acquitted of at trial in January 2023. Conservatives widely criticized the prosecution as an example of selective enforcement.

All three prosecutors who handled Houck's case — Anita Eve and Ashley Martin of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and Sanjay Patel of DOJ's Civil Rights Division — appear to remain employed at the department, according to a review of Eve and Martin's LinkedIn pages and calls to their EDPA office phone numbers, which indicates that they are active in the department. The Washington Examiner was unable to immediately locate a third-party career profile for Patel, though a DOJ press release from July listed him as a trial attorney.

Even lesser-known holdovers from the Biden administration remain at the DOJ in high-profile positions. Although they are less controversial, figures like Assistant Attorney General for Administration Jolene Ann Lauria at the Justice Management Division and Alicia Long, who remains the Principal Assistant United States under Pirro, have kept their positions without scrutiny.

Trump allies such as Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton pointed toward the data from the Office of Personnel Management, which, to him, exposed a much slimmer number of separations than he had expected from an administration that campaigned on fundamental change at the DOJ.

“The OPM numbers speak for themselves, and they are inconsistent with the serious reforms that are needed at the FBI,” Fitton told the Washington Examiner.

Mike Howell, executive director of the Oversight Project, offered a similar assessment.

“The numbers should be a lot higher in terms of who's fired,” Howell told the Washington Examiner. “And you look at those numbers, and it's really underwhelming.”

Despite their complaints, OPM data shows the DOJ has seen record levels of turnover, ranking among the top seven federal agencies for total separations since January last year, with roughly 9,000 employees who either quit, retired, were part of a reduction in force, or whose appointments expired or were listed as “other separation.” To the department's credit, the volume of separations represents the most removals in a single year over the past decade.

At the FBI, which employs about 35,300 people, there have been 3,063 separations since Trump returned to office. A closer analysis reveals that of those separations, 980 employees quit, 872 retired, and just 138 were classified as “other separations,” a category that includes firings and other involuntary removals.

Fitton suggested in a post on X that these figures are difficult to reconcile in light of the years of conservative voices levying allegations about politicized investigations and retaliation against whistleblowers.

Moreover, recent developments surrounding the FBI's Arctic Frost investigation, which served as the pretext for the two federal indictments against Trump and involved the unprecedented surveillance of several Republican lawmakers' phone records, have added to those concerns.

A November report by Reuters revealed the FBI initially fired four agents who worked on the team investigating Trump and his allies, which was later utilized by former special counsel Jack Smith to lay the groundwork for his 2020 election conspiracy case against Trump. However, the outlet noted that two of those terminations were later reversed.

Agents Blaire Toleman and David Geist were told they were being terminated, only to later be informed the decisions had been rescinded, according to several sources interviewed by the outlet. Tolman now works out of the Chicago Field Office, while Geist remains assigned to an FBI rapid-response unit.

Most notably, the walkback of Tolman and Geist's firings also appears to undercut recent public claims by FBI Director Kash Patel, who told Trump via a Truth Social Post that the FBI had already rooted out the “corrupt actors” involved in Arctic Frost after Trump retorted on his platform, demanding swift action.

The original architect of Arctic Frost, former Washington Field Office official Timothy Thibault, left the FBI in 2022 after his anti-Trump social media posts became public.

Adding to the dissonance surrounding department firings is a recurring dispute over whether high-profile departures were firings or resignations. For example, Trump said in September that he fired Erik Siebert, the former head of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, under pressure to bring indictments against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. But Siebert had also announced his voluntary resignation near-simultaneously.

A similar disagreement unfolded this month after five DOJ prosecutors departed from their roles rather than pursue an investigation against a Minneapolis protester in relation to a fatal ICE-related shooting. An initial report by the New York Times described the exits as resignations, while Attorney General Pam Bondi insisted she had fired them, according to Fox News.

In response to a request for comment, a DOJ spokesperson told the Washington Examiner that the past year of personnel shifts at the department has improved efficiency within the ranks, but declined to answer specific questions about the volume of formal firings versus voluntary resignations. A representative for the FBI did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

“After four years of bureaucratic weaponization under the Biden Administration, President Trump and Attorney General Bondi have created the most efficient Department of Justice in American history,” the DOJ spokesperson said.

It remains an open question whether some of these holdovers will survive the remainder of Trump's term in office, though the department has already seen 794 separations since the start of this year, according to OPM data.

HOUSE GOP REVISITS BIDEN HANDLING OF JAN. 6 WITH NEW PANEL

Additionally, DOJ protocols strictly limit the government from making specific comments about personnel separations due to the risk of litigation, making the task of tracking direct firings even more opaque.

The department is currently defending itself in federal court against a lawsuit filed by Brian Driscoll Jr. and two other fired FBI leaders, which alleges political appointees like Bondi and Patel are taking directives from the White House to execute a mass purge of ranking officials to keep their jobs, underscoring the tight rope officials walk when publicly discussing personnel decisions.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Washington got one right for a change. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's proposed new “One Challenge” rule may finally break Big Tech's stranglehold on innovation, revitalize our patent system, and supercharge America's growth.

The establishment of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board was billed as a fair and expeditious means of rooting out weak patents. In practice, it became a legal meat grinder, and large corporations quickly learned how to weaponize it. Small inventors found that a successful patent defense in district court would only be followed by successive rounds of costly review. When the same patent can be attacked repeatedly, patent rights turn into revocable permissions, and only the deepest pockets survive.

The USPTO's proposal is a long-overdue fix. Once a patent claim has run the gauntlet in court or at the PTAB and survived, its validity should be regarded as final. This simple principle restores what property is supposed to mean in a free economy. It tells investors, entrepreneurs, universities, and corporate labs that once their patent prevails, the government will not invite serial do-overs until the better-financed side wins by exhaustion.​

Reliable patent rights aren't a legal abstraction; they are the very heart of American innovation. It often takes a decade or more and huge sums of capital to take an inventor's dream from drawing board to global-scale production. Investors make those high-risk bets because patents can secure a return if the science works. But strip away patent reliability, and that equation breaks down. It means that promising technologies remain on the shelf while investment dollars flow to those who can afford to fund litigation as part of their cost of doing business.

Large tech firms are actively resisting efforts to reform the PTAB process under which they can lose in court and yet later prevail by slightly repackaging a challenge. Big Tech is not defending quality, but a process that is being used to kill ideas.​

As 2025's Nobel Prize in economics demonstrates, the fight goes deeper than patent procedure. Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion, and Peter Howitt were honored for explaining how innovation and creative destruction drive long-run prosperity. Mokyr's research into the Industrial Revolution shows that modern growth took off when societies created institutions that rewarded problem-solvers and allowed knowledge to accumulate, and that breakthrough technologies became self-reinforcing only when others could understand, replicate, and improve on them.​

Aghion and Howitt's theory of growth through creative destruction holds that progress comes when new firms and technologies leap ahead of established market leaders. Their research finds that innovation and diffusion of knowledge are the primary drivers of growth. Strong but time-limited property rights, especially patents, encourage risky research while forcing ideas into the open. But they also warn that incumbent interests will predictably try to block innovations that threaten their market position.​

A sound patent system sits at the center of the framework outlined by these Nobel-winning economists. Patents grant temporary, enforceable rights in exchange for public disclosure of how an invention works, which becomes fuel for the next generation of innovators. Periods of strong, predictable patent protection have led to leaps in productivity, rising real incomes, and greater social mobility as new firms with new technologies disrupted the status quo.

But the Nobel laureates also warn about institutional capture. When rules are bent into tools for rent seeking, protection becomes the goal, and growth sputters. That is exactly what happens when well-funded incumbents can pound the same patents with serial PTAB petitions long after those patents have been examined, issued, and upheld. The system ends up rewarding legal trench warfare instead of the best ideas.​

RESTORING AMERICA: DEMOCRATS CAN'T ESCAPE THE ‘WHAT IS A WOMAN' QUESTION

Critics claim the USPTO proposal would shield weak patents. That is a distraction. Weak patents already face tough scrutiny, and they should fail. The “one challenge” reform does not guarantee victory for anyone. It simply bars endless retries after a full and fair hearing. Real property rights in any healthy economy come with that kind of certainty. It is that clarity that keeps capital flowing to ambitious inventors instead of into safer, less productive uses.​

America's greatest economic leaps were driven by entrepreneurs and investors who trusted that genuine breakthroughs would be honored. The USPTO's One Challenge rule moves the system back toward that pro-growth equilibrium. If Washington truly wants to beat foreign competition, create jobs, and discover cures for diseases more quickly, it should not operate a system that allows legal gamesmanship to smother innovation. Adopt the rule, make patents reliable again, and let American ingenuity do the rest.​

Americans can't seem to keep up.

Among the greatest tricks Donald Trump ever pulled is convincing significant portions of the population that the slow erosion of their rights is not, actually, that big of a deal.

After all, do undocumented immigrants with purported gang tattoos truly deserve due process? Is it really so bad to urge citizens to turn on their neighbors and co-workers for saying something outrageous? And is it problematic to punish journalists for reporting facts that the government would rather keep hidden? (Yes, yes, and yes! come the emphatic cries of constitutional-law experts, civil-liberties advocates, and others who care about this sort of thing.)

A year into Trump's second term, the emboldened president's maximalist strategy—pushing every norm to its most elastic, and then a bit beyond, and from that new breaking point pushing yet again—conjures the boiling-frog theory, in which a frog placed in boiling water will immediately hop out, but a frog placed in cool water that is slowly heated will complacently boil to death. (And yes, I know that this amphibious metaphor for failing to notice incremental negative changes is apocryphal, but the lesson is still apt.)

Or, as the former Trump adviser Steve Bannon put it to me, the Overton window is moving so far, so quickly, that the more apt way to understand Trump's strategy is: “Fuck the Overton window.”

Bannon continued: “He's driving deep. Remember, our strategy—I say it every day—is maximalist, a maximalist strategy. You have to take it however deep you can take it and, quite frankly, until you meet resistance. And we haven't met any resistance.”

“We haven't met any resistance” is overstating the case, but it is astonishing just how far Trump has pushed the country over the past year. The list of actions Trump has taken that would have outraged even his base—in some cases, especially his base—had anyone else attempted such maneuvers is as long as it is audacious. Already, many Americans have grown accustomed to bands of National Guard troops patrolling their cities; the United States bombing other countries without congressional approval (or even notification); white-nationalist rhetoric filling government social-media feeds; federal funding disappearing from elite universities that are viewed as too “woke” and hostile to Trump's movement; hundreds of thousands of immigrants being arrested and deported, often with extreme force; the once-independent Justice Department taking orders from the White House; conservative influencers masquerading as journalists; government data losing their reliability; museums quietly whitewashing history; and the White House being physically and symbolically demolished and rebuilt in Trump's image.

Tellingly, the president told The New York Times this month that his powers in international affairs are checked only by himself: “My own morality. My own mind. It's the only thing that can stop me.”

Since Trump's return to power, I have had a recurring conversation—with diplomats, Democrats, and certain Republicans. They have all repeatedly told me a version of the same thing: During Trump's first term, they believed that his election was an aberration, an out-of-character mistake that would soon be corrected—but one year into his second term, they now think that Joe Biden's 2020 victory was the aberration, and that Trump's reelection is not a fever dream but rather a reflection of the country at this moment.

Maybe that's why so many Americans are shrugging as the temperature rises.

During the first Trump administration, resistance was often easy to identify. Sure, there were the hordes of women in pink pussyhats and the lawyers descending on airports as Trump announced a travel ban, but there was also the quiet resistance within the administration, the top advisers and deep-bowel bureaucrats who viewed themselves as guardrails or checks on power, and who relished that role.

Now Trump's administration is filled with true believers who ruthlessly enact his ideas, no matter how outlandish. (Earlier this year, someone close to Trump told me that his advisers have an unofficial rule: When he asks for something twice, they make it happen, regardless of the request.) Congressional Republicans have largely done as they are told, and Democrats, who don't control either chamber, often seem to have descended into learned helplessness.

Read: Does Congress even exist anymore? 

Governors and mayors—along with world leaders, corporate executives, and tech moguls—seem to have collectively concluded that it's often better to flatter Trump and offer small concessions than to risk his wrath and vengeance. Activists have been labeled domestic terrorists, accused of left-wing “street violence,” and threatened with “the power of law enforcement.” And even though a majority of Americans, including large swaths of Trump's own base, disagree with some of the things he is doing, the president seems impervious to his low poll numbers and to the fact that his party is careening nervously toward the midterm elections.

As many of my colleagues have repeatedly described, the dismantling of a democracy comes slowly, then all at once; rarely does it begin with armed, jackbooted men marching in the streets. It remains unclear just how far the president is willing to go, and what his endgame is. Less than a week after Trump lost the 2020 election, I wrote that Republicans were largely allowing him to pursue his baseless claims that the election had been stolen, despite privately reconciling themselves to a Biden victory. “What is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time?” a top Republican official told me at the time. “He went golfing this weekend. It's not like he's plotting how to prevent Joe Biden from taking power on January 20. He's tweeting about filing some lawsuits, those lawsuits will fail, then he'll tweet some more about how the election was stolen, and then he'll leave.” After the deadly January 6 attacks, that quote hit different, periodically resurfacing and going viral for its seeming naivete. But in the moment, when the top Republican uttered it, I will confess that the words seemed plausible to me; neither of us anticipated—could have even imagined—how Trump's first term would end.

And how will this term end? As Trump has adopted an unapologetic strongman stance, I have been struck by just how little meaningful resistance he's faced, from citizens and even from lawmakers who claim to find his actions appalling or terrifying. In his first term, he and his team ultimately abandoned some of their most chilling and controversial edicts—the travel ban, the family-separation policy—in the face of public backlash. And some of the other incidents that prompted outrage back then—Trump essentially firing his first chief of staff by tweet, the path of a hurricane being altered with a thick Sharpie squiggle—now seem positively quaint. Yet the level of agita generally on display now, for far bolder and more brazen norm-shattering, seems, if anything, more muted.

Trump Derangement Syndrome, in many ways, has been replaced by Trump Exhaustion Syndrome: The populace notes the latest indignity, and then returns to business as usual.

Many Americans awoke on the first Saturday of this year and were stunned to learn that, on Trump's orders, the U.S. military had executed a predawn capture of Nicolás Maduro and spirited the Nike-sweatsuit-clad Venezuelan leader to the United States to stand trial. But they should not have been so surprised.

After all, even if seizing Maduro was not Trump's initial goal, the president had slowly been desensitizing the country to such a possibility for months and setting Venezuela up as a dangerous enemy. The first bill Trump signed into law as the 47th president was the Laken Riley Act—in honor of a nursing student in Georgia who had been attacked and killed while jogging by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant—which mandates that undocumented immigrants who commit certain crimes inside the country face stricter punishments. (The bill felt so common sense that a dozen Senate Democrats and nearly four dozen House Democrats voted for it.) Two months later, in March, Trump creatively deployed the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, arguing that the U.S. was at war with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua—and using the long-dormant legislation to begin deporting alleged Venezuelan gang members to a notorious Salvadoran mega-prison. Then, under the continued guise of defeating these “narco-terrorists,” Trump ordered the Navy to strike suspect boats in the high seas off Venezuela. (As of last Friday, 123 people have been killed in 35 strikes in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean.)

By the time Trump seized Maduro, the capture felt less like an alarmingly broad interpretation of American might and more like the logical next step in a string of reasonable ones.

After all, a through line of Trump's presidential campaign was the denigration and dehumanization of immigrants; he would start with an archetype that sounded genuinely scary—“They are bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists,” he said in his 2015 campaign launch—and then tacitly apply it to all immigrants, or any other group that he deemed a threat.

Journalists and liberal activists have also been targeted. After the assassination of Charlie Kirk, Vice President Vance urged people to call out their neighbors and co-workers—including by reporting them to their employer—who exercised their right to free (if abhorrent) speech by celebrating Kirk's death. Trump also issued an executive order casting a wide range of liberal activists as potential domestic terrorists, the same label immediately placed on Renee Nicole Good, the Minnesota mother killed by a federal immigration officer this month. Trump's attacks on the media, which once were a somewhat playful campaign gimmick, have escalated. The White House now severely limits reporter access, and the Defense Department has swapped out the Pentagon press corps in favor of a new one that regurgitates administration propaganda. Last week, the FBI raided the home of a Washington Post journalist.

After six congressional Democrats with military or national-security backgrounds released a video advising members of the military to not follow illegal orders, Trump accused them of sedition—and shared a social-media post suggesting that they be hanged for treason. The president has abandoned the idea of an independent Justice Department, chiding his attorney general—in a private message that he accidentally posted publicly—for not doing more to prosecute his political opponents and enemies. Earlier this month, the DOJ launched a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whose biggest crime seems to be refusing to ignore economic indicators and lower interest rates just because the president says he should.

The bureaucratic and staid Powell responded in a rare video message, warning, in part: “This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.”

Read: ‘I run the country and the world'

Yet for all this (and more), Trump has faced little meaningful congressional opposition, although his approval rating has declined. And in some cases, the public has largely responded with a Gallic shrug. Even after the Maduro raid, Democrats en masse led with talking-point pablum—Maduro is a bad guy (true!)—rather than emphasizing the lack of congressional authorization and the possible violation of international law (also true!). Five Republican senators did join with Democrats to advance a bill forcing Trump to seek congressional approval before taking additional military action in Venezuela. But they soon backed down.

The Overton window gets moved with little consequence, Bannon told me, and the result is a further-emboldened Trump: “You move it, and you do it, and no one complains—or MSNBC and The Atlantic complain and nobody gives a fuck—and then you do it again, and push it again.”

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the word unprecedented has been used (dare I say) an unprecedented number of times a year into Trump's second term—up from the previously unprecedented number of times in his first term. I asked a senior White House official whether the lack of meaningful resistance has given the president even more faith in his ability to pursue his instincts as brazenly and brashly as possible. This person reframed my question, arguing that there has been little resistance because Trump's policies are broadly popular: “Most Americans, if you ask them, ‘Do you want a drug boat sailing to the United States blown up?' they'd say yes.”

Part of Trump's skill in shifting—or shattering—the Overton window is his instinctual ability to choose test cases that allow him to generate sympathy for his causes, even as he blows through boundaries and tramples on rights.

After his administration mistakenly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia—a Maryland father with a protected legal status—to a Salvadoran mega-prison, Trump and his team refused to reverse the decision, dismissing concerns of due process and highlighting Abrego Garcia's tattoos to paint him as a dangerous gang member. (Never mind that the photos that Trump showed of the tattoos had been digitally altered.) Trump's strikes on small vessels off the coast of Venezuela are said to be aimed at cartel bosses funneling huge loads of fentanyl into the country; in fact, fentanyl doesn't pass through the Caribbean, the boats aren't headed to the United States, and they're steered by the poorest and most expendable members of narco organizations. But who's going to bother sticking up for drug runners?

“Trump is a master at getting his enemies to defend things that are politically damaging to them,” a former senior administration official still close to the president told me. “So if you are going out and defending the principle of due process—or whatever high-minded legal and constitutional things—even if your constitutional argument is strong, you are still effectively defending a narco-terrorist.”

This person continued, admiringly: “It's interesting, the issues he picks. Even if his enemies have a legitimate beef—constitutional, legal, whatever—it still puts them in a position where they appear to be defending bad people.”

Read: The wrath of Stephen Miller 

Daniel Ziblatt, a co-author of How Democracies Die, told me that by demonizing people who are easy to demonize, Trump makes it harder for average citizens to feel comfortable publicly defending the broader principles. After all, who wants to speak up for someone celebrating the murder of Charlie Kirk? “It's harder to defend it, especially when there's some perceived cost to speaking out against the government,” Ziblatt said. “If you're going to get picked on in social media or have threats against you, you sort of think, Is this really what I want to spend my political capital on, defending an indefensible person? So you stay silent.”

In the case of Good, the 37-year-old mother who was shot and killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis after dropping off her 6-year-old son at school, the circumstances of her killing were nebulous at best, and she hardly fit the mold of an easily vilified lawbreaker; nevertheless, Trump and his allies began attacking her almost immediately. Trump's hard-line domestic-policy chief Stephen Miller dismissed her as an agent of “domestic terrorism,” the vice president called it “a tragedy of her own making,” and Trump falsely claimed that Good “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer”—despite video from the scene showing that, at worst, her car might have clipped him. Regardless of the reality, the implication was clear: Good had it coming.

I was eager to understand why so much of the public seems willing to accept actions that they claim in polls and interviews not to like, so I reached out to Conor Kilgore, who produces the podcast The Focus Group for The Bulwark, a center-right website critical of Trump, and who also moderates focus groups with voters who flipped from supporting Biden in 2020 to backing Trump four years later. When I asked Kilgore if these swing voters are now hopping, froglike, out of the water to raise concerns or if they are simply accepting the nation's gradually rising temperature, his response was unequivocal: “People have generally been less alarmed than we might like.”

“Every once in a while, you will hear people talk about authoritarian creep,” Kilgore told me. “But mainly it's: Well, maybe this is a little overkill some of the time, but generally, I think he's doing what needs to be done.”

He sent me some clips of Biden-Trump voters discussing Trump's use of the National Guard in American cities. One focus-group participant, a Black man in New York, said that he disagreed with Trump using the military to address urban crime and worried that the president was “opening the door” to something even worse. When asked to explain where Trump's actions might lead, he elaborated: “To where they have more of a choke hold on just the area or region they're looking over, to where it spreads—like, where does it spread to next? You know what I'm saying? Like, where does it spread to next?”

In a different group, a white man in Georgia named Adam wasn't yet ready to render a verdict on the deployment, which was then still fresh. But he seemed to accept Trump's absolute authority to do as he pleased. “I don't think it's egregious that he's doing it,” Adam said. “Because he can.”

That assessment—Trump is doing it because he can—reminded me of something Kilgore had explained during our phone call. “Broadly, people do not have the language for: We are going to descend fully into autocracy,” he'd told me. “As much as people think the political system is fundamentally broken and corrupt, they also think it's ultimately going to trudge along fine.”

Kilgore had continued, matter-of-factly if ominously: “They kind of have faith in people to rise up, and it's like, Oh, I don't think we would take that lying down. Even though they might, in fact, take that lying down.”

At least for now, a year into Trump's second term, the country seems to have settled for the illusory safety of the fetal crouch.

﻿Entertainment got too good.

In today's America, the less money a white voter has, the more likely they are to support Donald Trump.

Whites in the bottom 10 percent of America's income distribution broke for the GOP nominee in 2024 by landslide margins. Those in the top 5 percent largely backed Democrat Kamala Harris, according to American National Election Studies data.

For most of the past century, the opposite pattern prevailed: In every presidential election from 1948 to 2012, poor whites voted to the left of rich ones.

But that changed in 2016. Eight years later, the new, negative correlation between income and Republicanism among whites became unprecedentedly strong, as Ohio State University political scientist Tom Wood has shown:

This development surely reflects Trump's personal imprint on American life. Yet it was also made possible by long-term, structural shifts in our politics.

In the mid-20th century, Americans without college degrees voted sharply to the left of university graduates. But beginning in the late 1960s, this gap started to narrow before finally flipping in 2004. The relationship between socioeconomic status and partisanship in the United States therefore changed gradually — and then, with Trump's populist rebrand of the GOP, all at once.

This realignment had many causes. An indispensable factor, however, was the rising salience of “culture war” issues.

Over the past 50 years, debates over immigration, crime, abortion, religion, race, and gender became increasingly prominent in American politics. As this happened, voters began sorting themselves less on the basis of their economic attitudes and more on that of their cultural ones. And since college-educated voters lean left on most social issues — while less educated voters lean right — this eroded the lower classes' traditional attachment to the Democratic Party (and the upper classes' historic ties to the GOP).

Liberals often lament these developments — and not without reason. Some consequences of cultural polarization seem perverse. Many poor Americans today 1) express progressive views on health care and social welfare, 2) say that economic issues are their top concern, and 3) nonetheless vote for the party hellbent on cutting their Medicaid and food stamp benefits.

And of course, Democrats' flagging support with working-class voters has enabled Trump's electoral success — thereby imperiling American democracy.

For these reasons, the question of why the culture war gained such political prominence has long preoccupied Democrats. Some progressives blame their party's alleged abandonment of economic populism: By embracing “neooliberal” stances on trade and regulation, Democrats narrowed the gap between the parties on economic issues, thereby making their divisions on social matters more conspicuous.

Some moderates, meanwhile, suggest that the party made cultural controversies more salient by moving too far to the left in such debates. Others argue that the right's radicalization has made the culture war's primacy inevitable; it is hard to keep fiscal policy in the foreground when agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement are brutalizing US citizens and the president is demonizing all Somali-American-owned businesses.

But recent research points to another (potentially complementary) explanation for the decline of materialist voting: Americans' at-home entertainment options have gotten too good.

• In recent decades, culture war issues have become increasingly salient in American politics, triggering a realignment of the major party coalitions.

• A new study suggests that the rise of cable television fueled these trends: Facing heightened competition, news broadcasters realized that social issues were better at attracting viewers' attention than economic ones.

• Digital media has made the attention economy even more competitive — and thus, culture war controversies even more prominent.

At least, this is my takeaway from “The Business of the Culture War,” a new paper from a pair of economics graduate students at MIT and Harvard University, Shakked Noy and Akaash Rao, respectively.

Their study's basic story is simple: As the television business grew more competitive, news broadcasts began emphasizing culture war controversies, fueling a realignment of American politics in the process.

Noy and Rao note that, from the mid-1950s to mid-1980s, the three big networks — CBS, NBC, and ABC — dominated American television. Although cable TV existed, it had yet to fully penetrate American households and alternate channels were limited. Amid such scant competition, the major networks didn't worry too much about maximizing the entertainment value of their news broadcasts. Each had a nearly captive audience, who could be force-fed briefings on current affairs most evenings. The networks therefore viewed their news divisions as vehicles for earning prestige as much as revenue. And this led them to favor “hard” economic coverage over “soft” cultural stories.

As coaxial cables brought an ever-expanding array of channels into American homes, however, the TV business started to change. By 1997, three 24-hour cable news networks were competing for viewers' attention — against not merely each other, but upward of 40 other stations. Critically, Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC couldn't afford to treat their news broadcasts as “loss leaders” like the networks had; news was their entire business. And these competitive pressures led all three to emphasize cultural issues over economic ones.

Of course, the notion that cable news spotlights social controversies is hardly new (one can find that thesis eloquently elaborated in the 2013 cinematic masterpiece, Anchorman 2). But Noy and Rao prove it empirically.

Analyzing recordings and transcripts from the past six decades of TV news, they show that cable networks dedicate a large majority of their issue-based coverage to cultural issues, even as broadcast news networks had historically favored economic topics.

This editorial tendency appears to have been rational. Drawing on smart TV data that records when households change channels or turn off their televisions, Noy and Rao show that cultural topics are better at retaining viewers: When a network switches from an entirely cultural segment to a fully economic one, viewership falls by an average of 2.2 percent — about one-sixth of the click-away penalty associated with cutting to a commercial.

Notably, economic coverage was actually more effective at preventing a viewer from switching to a different news network. But households that ping-pong between CNN and Fox News comprise a small minority of the TV audience. And cultural topics are much more likely to retain the attention of viewers deciding between watching the news and flipping on a basketball game, reality show, video game console, or any other diversion.

In the 2010s, as such at-home entertainment options proliferated, broadcast news began emphasizing cultural topics over economic ones for the first time, in an apparent concession to competitive pressures.

Of course, it isn't self-evident that cable news networks' editorial decisions drive voter behavior. After all, only a small minority of the electorate watches such channels. And Americans still overwhelmingly say the economic issues are their top concern.

But Noy and Rao present evidence that cable news causes voters — and thus, politicians — to put a greater premium on social issues.

To isolate the impact of cable news channels, the researchers exploit a quirk in Americans' viewing habits: All else equal, we tend to watch channels with low numbers (e.g., channel 15) more than those with high numbers (e.g., channel 56). And since the channel number assigned to cable networks varies randomly across markets, one can gauge the broadcasters' political influence by comparing areas where MSNBC and Fox News are assigned low numbers to those where they're assigned high ones.

When Noy and Rao do this, they find that — controlling for a jurisdiction's demographics and partisanship — voters are more likely to tell Gallup that a social issue is the nation's “most important problem” if they live in places with high levels of cable-news exposure.

And this appears to cause politicians in such areas to emphasize culture war issues: In constituencies where voters watch more cable news, the study finds that campaign ads are more likely to focus on social issues.

Noy and Rao's paper is concerned with cable news, not digital media. But their findings suggest that online publications and influencers — whose audiences are perpetually a couple clicks away from virtually every movie, television show, book, and genre of pornography in existence — would have even stronger incentives to foreground culture war controversies.

In today's historically competitive market for human attention, news purveyors face strong incentives to emphasize whichever issues are most captivating for casual viewers. Noy and Rao's study strongly indicate that questions of identity, gender roles, and immigration tend to fit the bill better than debates over fiscal or regulatory policy. And most days, a perusal of TikTok, X, or Bluesky would seem to reinforce that impression.

None of this means that economic issues no longer matter. To the contrary, Noy and Rao's study actually indicates that candidates whose ads focus on bread-and-butter issues perform better than those whose ads center cultural topics. For voters in general — and swing voters in particular — material concerns remain paramount.

Yet whether a given voter has more faith in Democrats or Republicans to manage the economy depends, to a historically great degree, on their culture war allegiances. This helps explain why working-class white voters favored Trump — while college-educated ones backed Kamala Harris — even as both blocs deemed inflation the nation's top problem in 2024.

Even if shifting media dynamics have helped fuel the culture war, party positioning has surely also contributed. Democrats can plausibly reduce the salience of social issues by embracing more moderate stances on them — or by more effectively representing and advancing working people's material interests — or both.

But any effort to repolarize politics around economic issues will face strong headwinds. As influencers, video games, and AI slop proliferates, political media will face ever-stronger incentives to lean into attention-maximizing topics — and thus, culture war controversies.

Ugliness has more to do with the housing crisis than you think.

The root of America's housing affordability crisis isn't complicated in the abstract: We need to build more homes (4 million more, to be more or less precise). More sprawl isn't working — our dependence on it is part of what's gotten us into a housing crisis in the first place.

We're nowhere close to climbing out of this hole. Tariffs certainly aren't helping, and making things more challenging is, as ever, the vocal minority of residents across American cities and suburbs who oppose new apartments, duplexes, or anything denser than a detached single-family home being built near them.

Housing advocates and social scientists alike have long attributed NIMBYism to, at best, personal financial stakes (like property value) or logistic concerns (like traffic), at worst deeply rooted racism or classism. And all of those explanations are, to varying degrees, surely an important part of the picture.

But there might also be something more foundational at play here. People like neighborhoods with consistency and, it turns out, style.

Which may come as a surprise, given that for most of the last century, the US has been mostly building places that are ugly and a bit soul-deadening. You know the ones: sprawling subdivisions, giant strip malls and parking lots, 10-lane highways. It's a strange feature of our age that although we now have spectacular wealth and greater technological means to create anything we can imagine than at any point in human history, “all of our buildings look like boring squares and rectangles,” as journalist Derek Thompson said on a recent episode of his podcast.

Alicia Pederson, a Chicago-based researcher, writer, and advocate for beautiful, livable cities who founded the organization Courtyard Urbanist, put it even more bluntly: The way we build today has gone fundamentally wrong and swung out of alignment with human needs, she told me in an email. “That disorder expresses itself in buildings that are widely experienced as grotesque and alienating.” Her words surface something that pervades American life yet is rarely confronted so directly: Is this really how we want to live?

All of this points to a tantalizing possibility: If modern sprawl shoulders a lot of the blame for both our housing crisis and our epidemic of ugliness, then perhaps we could start to repair both at the same time, with the same tools. Maybe housing abundance should be not just about building more of what we already have, but also about transforming and beautifying the way we build for the future.

It might feel a bit frivolous to fixate on aesthetics at a time when we face an acute housing crisis and urgently need to build lots of housing in the high-opportunity places where people want to live. But beauty matters, even if it's harder to translate into wonk language than is something like floor area ratio. Our built environment is the physical container for our lives, shaping our entire daily existence and our interactions with our families and communities. A beautiful, humane habitat can be emotionally uplifting, inspire awe and lower the ambient stress of daily life; a bad one does the opposite. And NIMBYs are not wrong to feel that even if we are not the ones living in a new building, if it's in our neighborhood or broader daily environment, we still live with it.

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

There is empirical evidence that beauty matters for making housing abundance work, too. A recent working paper contributes to a growing body of research finding that aesthetic concerns play a meaningful role in driving public opposition to new housing. People seem to oppose buildings that break the mold of what's surrounding them, and they are less likely — a lot less likely — to support building new homes if they think they'll be visually distasteful.

Traditionally, as University of California Davis law professor Chris Elmendorf put it to me, social scientists have theorized that people oppose new housing construction out of economic self-interest (their property values rise when housing is scarce) or NIMBYism — a broad desire to avoid change in their neighborhoods because of whatever negative externalities that might come with it (like increased traffic congestion or demand for local schools). But there are limits to those explanations — for one thing, it's not obvious that making it legal to replace single-family houses with, say, small condo buildings lowers property values. A property in a desirable area can sell for more money if it's possible to redevelop it into multiple homes.

It might seem obvious that aesthetic tastes have something to do with attitudes toward new housing — “neighborhood character” is a watchword of NIMBYs everywhere, something I can witness every day in my local neighborhood Facebook group in Madison, Wisconsin. But it's hard to rigorously show whether these aesthetic preferences are, as Elmendorf put it, “real or just covering up for some other concern that people are reluctant to state directly.” Those might be racist or classist attitudes or antipathy toward renters, who are usually presumed to be the residents of multifamily homes.

Aesthetics is, of course, a complex concept that may not be fully disentangle-able from other things. It is in large part born out of one's cultural milieu and upbringing. And to some degree, people's aesthetic preferences are going to remain subjective, irreconcilable, and incomprehensible to one another. There are people in this country who will mourn the replacement of an empty parking lot with a set of what I think are pretty attractive new homes. There are even people who love brutalist architecture, and that's fine — we're a big, diverse polity that can accommodate many tastes.

In the new study (which hasn't yet been through peer review), Elmendorf, along with co-authors David Broockman, a political scientist at UC Berkeley, and Joshua Kalla, a political scientist at Yale, set out to understand how aesthetic tastes might be shaping public views on housing development.

To get at the heart of the aesthetics question scientifically, the researchers ran large-scale survey experiments (with 5,999 participants broadly representative of the US population, including people across the political spectrum as well as homeowners and renters) where they manipulated the design of buildings and neighborhood context. The findings, they argue, suggest that aesthetic preferences are sincerely held, rather than mere pretexts, and that support for new apartments is strongly predicted by aesthetic factors in a number of different ways. “Aesthetic tastes are typically far more predictive of support for developing new apartment buildings than measures of other beliefs, attitudes, and preferences, such as beliefs about the relationship between development and prices or racial attitudes,” the authors write.

Respondents were far more likely to support allowing the construction of five-story apartment buildings when they're located near buildings of a similar scale rather than near single-family houses. (Sometimes derisively called “gentrification buildings,” the wide, five-story buildings known as five-over-ones have become one of the most common building types for new apartments in the US.) That particular objection appears to be less about what apartment buildings look like than the fact people simply don't think apartments look harmonious next to houses. And in a country where the vast majority of residential land is zoned exclusively for detached single-family homes, the possibility that people don't like the look of apartments buildings near those houses seems like a big problem for addressing our housing crisis that calls for further investigation.

That finding was also true for people who live in the high-density areas that would be near the new apartments — in other words, mere NIMBYism doesn't seem to be what's going on here. Participants even judged the same photo of an apartment building as less attractive if it was to be located near a single-family home rather than another apartment building — a piece of evidence that helped convince Elmendorf that the aesthetic preferences are real, not just pretextual.

Respondents were also no less opposed to office buildings of similar size to the apartment buildings than they were to apartment buildings themselves, suggesting that these views had something to do with their opinions on larger buildings and their placement generally — and not just about the renters who would presumably live in those apartments.

The aesthetic qualities of individual buildings, regardless of their surroundings, also mattered a lot. Whether a building would be designed by an architect recognized for excellent design or an architect who received an “Aesthetic Atrocity Award” for bad design showed very large effects on participants' willingness to support it, as did showing the respondents photos of apartment buildings of varying aesthetic quality.

You might still suspect that something more complicated is going on than pure aesthetics. The researchers tested for some of the most obvious potential confounders: Respondents who indicated more negative racial attitudes (as measured by a commonly used metric in social science research) showed no preference for office buildings over apartments. Meanwhile, aesthetic distaste for apartments — holding the belief that “new apartments are ugly” or that cities look better without them — was more strongly predictive of opposition to new buildings than were racial attitudes.

The paper is part of a broader turn in research on the politics of housing that explains attitudes toward development in terms of gut-level preferences and identities — whether a person sees themselves as someone who likes cities and density, whether they think a proposed development looks nice — rather than intellectual factors like “how will this impact my property value?” The general public has “very weak intuitions,” Elmendorf said, about how new home construction will impact housing price levels (and they are often wrong about it), but beauty and ugliness are visceral.

Of course, it's one thing to call for right-scale, beautiful housing in just the right places. It's quite another to make it happen.

Americans have long ago stopped gracing our cities with anything like the majestic brownstones of New York City, the charming six-flats of Chicago, or the Spanish-tiled courtyard apartments of Los Angeles. But why?

It's hard to answer with certainty: There may be economic explanations, as well as cultural ones (put simply, modernist ideas in art and architecture have done a number on us). Organizing our society around cars has also created a lot of problems, aesthetic not least among them.

Perhaps the most important explanation for those trying to change things, however, is regulatory. The construction of pretty much everything in modern life — homes, as well as shops, offices, and other businesses — is subject to a degree of regulation far more extreme than in the days when we were actually building beautiful things. Over the last century and especially post-World War II, the complex bureaucratic regimes of zoning and building codes have made it illegal to build walkable districts and appealing buildings across much of the country.

That has had the effect not just of making it too hard to build enough housing overall, but also of making it extremely expensive to build anything, let alone anything with particularly thoughtful design. “It just costs SO MUCH more to build today that it really is not economically rational to invest in great materials and style,” Pederson wrote.

In a conversation last summer, M. Nolan Gray, an urban planner and senior director of legislation and research at the nonprofit California YIMBY, told me that the labyrinthine permitting procedures that govern housing in our cities in suburbs have squeezed out competition among homebuilders and rewarded developers for their ability to navigate red tape rather than for building the highest-quality, most visually pleasing homes.

“We've created a world where it's really large national and international companies that are heavily capitalized that can fight these fights to get their permits and deal with the crazy design reviews,” he said. “I want to live in a world where we have lots of people competing, and they're competing on the margin of building more beautiful buildings. And I think we get there by allowing for more flexibility.”

It can be much too easy for urbanists to wax nostalgic about the past, but nothing in this piece should be mistaken for a call to return to it. By today's standards, much of the prewar housing stock lacked the rudiments of habitability, like plumbing, flush toilets, and fire safety. And there may be a survivorship bias at work — it's primarily the highest-quality old homes that have survived into the present.

But aesthetics in the built environment matter to people — and there's far too little of it on offer in America. Our longing for elegance in our buildings finds expression today not in a flowering of lovely new building styles, but in dysfunctional regulation like historic preservation laws, which may safeguard beloved neighborhoods, but at the cost of worsening housing scarcity and unaffordability. These policies reflect a “strong feeling that we have a finite stock of beautiful things, and that every time we lose one, we're just losing something that is completely irreplaceable,” Samuel Hughes, an editor for Works in Progress magazine, recently said.

How might city governments and builders leverage all this to actually build more housing that the public will like? Among the policy ideas discussed by Elmendorf and his co-authors are reforms to make it easy to “incrementally” densify neighborhoods with homes that are not radically out of proportion from their surroundings. That could mean, for example, building duplexes or small apartment buildings rather than big buildings next to single-family homes. Another is passing policies to allow the redevelopment of entire blocks or neighborhoods at once, so they can be densified in an aesthetically cohesive manner and developers have an incentive to prioritize good design.

That idea harmonizes with what is maybe the most inspiring vision I've seen for housing abundance: courtyard blocks, a housing form that occupies an entire city block, with a perimeter of mid-rise buildings on the outside and interior green space. These are already widespread in Europe, and Pederson devotes herself to advocating for adapting courtyard blocks for an American context because they could solve so many of our housing problems at once. They can supply lots of dense new housing, but they are also, she points out, especially ideal for families because they have built-in semiprivate green space that functions like a backyard.

Their structure allows the residences to draw abundant natural light, and they can accommodate three- and four-bedroom apartments that, as Vox's Rachel Cohen Booth has written, are badly needed in American cities if they are to have any hope of retaining families with children. They “offer the functional equivalent of a ‘big house with a yard' while preserving the density and mixed-use character essential for walkable, affordable urban neighborhoods,” Pederson wrote on her Substack last year. And they are made up of relatively smaller individual buildings rather than very large ones that read to some people as bland and overbearing.

And they don't just have to be Copenhagen cosplay — they can be built with any architectural style. Here is one I generated inspired by the red-brick architecture of Boston (using an AI-powered visualization tool created by a collaboration between Courtyard Urbanist and the design technology company Treasury):

Accommodating beautiful new housing forms like these would require cities to scrap needlessly burdensome regulations. Widespread rules that often require apartment buildings to have multiple staircases, for example, make it more difficult to build small, multi-unit buildings while adding significantly to construction costs.

It also calls for pairing deregulation with carrots that encourage the kinds of buildings people want to live in and around — cities can, for instance, offer developers density bonuses in exchange for adding features like greenery, or create pre-approved design templates (Elmendorf and his co-authors point to the latter idea). Cities could re-legalize traditional architectural forms and create a catalog of blueprints for building them (old triple-deckers, for example, exist all over the Boston area, yet are strangely difficult to build new in the city today). The goal ought not to be to swap one gauntlet for another — YIMBYs are right to hate design-review purgatory — but rather to make building easier with a predictable, good-faith process.

Pederson is no fan of how we build in America today, so I was taken aback by what she said when I asked if she's hopeful about our ability to fix it. “I am SO optimistic!” she wrote to me. “It's going to be a perfect convergence of great new tech, great new visions and ‘vibes,' and regulatory reform. Prepare yourself for a fantastic chapter in American urbanism.”

I'm under no illusions that even the prettiest designs can overcome the formidable forces of NIMBYism in America overnight. Still, the moment seems right for a paradigm shift, away from the charmless, unaffordable status quo. Our housing crisis is a nightmare for millions of Americans, but it is also, perhaps, a rare invitation to rebuild the way we live.

﻿Why the nation's movies, video games, and toys went global in 2025.

To say that China had a successful 2025 would be an understatement.

According to President Donald Trump's campaign agenda and early months of his second administration, the United States was going to be tough on China. Trump went heavy on tariffs, limited chip exports, and tried to assert dominance over the country.

A year later, you'd have trouble finding evidence of it.

Instead, China has prospered by exercising hard economic power over the US — by wielding its newfound soft power. If you didn't catch the blockbuster Chinese movie Nhe Zha 2 or play Black Myth: Wukong, you likely caught wind of a Labubu.

But why did these cultural exports finally leave China now? And how might it impact China's growing hard power over the US?

To find out, Today, Explained senior producer and reporter Miles Bryan spoke with Don Weinland, a China business and finance editor for The Economist based in Shanghai.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

How would you define [China's] soft power?

The first thing to say is that China massively underpunches on its cultural exports. This is the world's second biggest economy, an incredible manufacturing power unparalleled elsewhere. And yet on cultural exports, it is really not doing very well on that front.

This is something that's actually changing. For many years, I don't think you would've known most of the movies or video games or toys that are being made in China, especially not by name. But China did much better on cultural exports in 2025 than it has in previous years.

I feel like we should start with Labubu. I don't have any Labubus, to be honest, but I do see them everywhere, and I was surprised to learn in researching for this story that they originated in China. Are you a Labubu guy?

I'm not really a Labubu guy per se, but I am very interested in Pop Mart, the company that makes Labubus. It really started getting a lot of attention in 2024, and then in '25, it just blew up. If you haven't seen one, they're often described as being “ugly cute.” And they come in these things called blind boxes. You don't know what Labubu you're going to get. They're collectors' items. It's kind of like baseball cards in a way. You don't know what baseball cards you're getting, and you might get a rare card.

So what else? You mentioned movies.

Nhe Zha 2 really blew up at the beginning of 2025. It's an animated film. It tells a traditional Chinese myth story. It's the highest grossing animated film ever. That's quite amazing in itself. And most of that happened domestically, but I know people in the US that have seen it as well.

Chinese films don't get a lot of screen time in the US traditionally, but this one seems like it did break through in some places. You would hear senior leaders citing Nhe Zha 2, which is very odd to hear them referencing this animated film. And really, they were pointing to what they see as a cultural success. So that tells you something about how important this movie was.

You also mentioned video games. I was looking into one game that looks like it broke through: Black Myth: Wukong. Can you tell me a bit about that?

Incredibly popular within China, but also overseas. I think it's one of the most popular video games of this style ever. It's also based on a traditional Chinese myth. It was so popular that the areas in China that it takes place in started getting a bunch of tourists visiting them. This type of cultural product can generate economic growth, not just in the selling of the product itself, but also in areas like tourism.

What do these products have in common that contributed to their breaking out of China as cultural exports in the past year? What do you think is happening here that's different?

I've kind of narrowed it down to two really important things. One is that a lot of the creators behind these things are in their late 30s or early 40s, and they are people that went to university in China just as the education system was changing. A lot more students were going to school at the time. It's a time when the internet was relatively free. It was quite easy to get online and look at foreign websites. I think they absorbed a lot of foreign culture.

Another thing is that these types of products are being funded quite a bit better than in the past. The Communist Party has its priorities. It wants to be strong in manufacturing; it wants to be strong in areas like electric vehicles and batteries, solar power. It hasn't really focused that much on its cultural products and its soft power, and we can kind of see that changing in areas like animated film or video games. It's a lot easier for these types of companies to get funding now, and that just means that it's going to reach a lot more people in China, but also overseas.

There's another factor that has really held back cultural exports in China, and that's just rules and regulations here that make it very, very difficult to make raunchy, sexy entertainment, the type of stuff that we're used to in the US. Sometimes even broaching the topic of divorce is difficult in sitcoms. You can't even really have haunted houses in Chinese entertainment, because the Communist Party doesn't like superstition.

What's your bet on the next big Chinese cultural export? Think we're getting a Labubu 2.0 in 2026? 

I don't think Labubu is going away anytime soon. Pop Mart is going to keep cranking out these strange, ugly, cute dolls. But I would say one area that American consumers might see in 2026 is they might see more Chinese products, well-made products, popping up in America. We've been talking about entertainment, but products have a big impact on soft power as well. If you start buying well-made Chinese products, it could change your mind about China.

It does seem like China's making progress on entertainment and cultural products that are more geared towards children. I think that's kind of a safe space for Chinese cultural exports. You don't need things like violence and sex and the raunchier bits of entertainment in this space. That might make it easier for more of these types of youth-focused things to reach people outside of China.

And how much has the Trump administration already accomplished from its playbook?

This story appeared in Today, Explained, a daily newsletter that helps you understand the most compelling news and stories of the day. Subscribe here.

When Donald Trump took office last year, he brought Project 2025 to the White House with him.

The Heritage Foundation plan lays out a sweeping conservative playbook for how to govern America, and the Trump administration quickly got to work. The US Agency for International Development was gutted, environmental regulations went up in smoke, and universities found themselves under attack.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

One year later, the administration is still working through its list. So what can Project 2025 tell us about where the Trump administration is going next? To answer that question, Today, Explained podcast host Noel King talked to David Graham, a staff writer at The Atlantic and the author of The Project: How Project 2025 Is Reshaping America.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity.

Project 2025 was 922 or so pages. How much of what's in there has the Trump administration accomplished?

There's a good tracker out there online that puts the number right above 50 percent. And I think that's useful, but you have to take it with a grain of salt, because some of these things are just hard to equate on a numerical level.

That tracker says Trump eliminated USAID, which is a goal. Project 2025 wanted to reform USAID in different ways, but not to abolish it. So, it doesn't always fit one-to-one.

The other thing that I would say is, so much of what they want to do depends on having this really powerful president — sort of an unfettered, no checks-and-balances situation. And they've made so much progress on that in the first year. I think that will enable more progress towards their goals in the future.

How did they get so much done, this administration?

A way that I've heard people talk about it is you don't get a lot of chances for a president to try things, leave office for four years, and then get another shot at it.

So many of the people involved were veterans of the first Trump administration or had been closely related to it, and they saw what went wrong and they had theories [as to why]. And they also learned a lot about how the government works.

And so, that meant that they could come in on the first day and be just so ready, so organized, and so energized. I think that gave them the chance to sort of conduct this blitzkrieg that took the courts by surprise. It seems to have taken Congress by surprise. And I think it took a lot of the public by surprise.

And I think I hear you telling me that there is still a lot in that big book of ideas and policies that they would like to get done.

Oh yes. You could spend years pushing a lot of these things, and the ambitions are pretty big. I mean, they really want to reshape society, and that is a project you can make some work on in a year. But I think they're on a timeframe of years or decades.

What did they fail to get done?

There are several areas where they haven't done much.

I think one is in this area of pro-family policy or socially conservative policy. We haven't seen a lot of encouraging higher birthrate stuff either.

We haven't seen the kind of labor policy that would bolster a more pro-family vision, like things that JD Vance was talking about in the campaign. And we haven't seen a sort of major shift of social welfare programs away from the government and towards religious organizations.

What do you think we're going to see more of in the year ahead? What maybe have we not been paying enough attention to that they've been banging the drum on and we should?

Something that I think is underappreciated even as it has gotten attention is the takeover of the independent regulatory agencies: the NLRB, the FEC, the FCC.

We're expecting a Supreme Court decision soon that seems likely to give the president control over all these agencies with the possible exception of the Federal Reserve. I think that's going to change the way everybody interacts with the government. The FCC, in particular, has gotten some attention. We saw the chair of the FCC basically try to get Disney to fire Jimmy Kimmel.

Now, imagine that in so many other areas of life: the way you work through labor protections, the way you interact with the Social Security Administration, the way you interact with any number of walks of your life. I think we're going to see the president controlling that and making it an arm of policy.

It's obvious that the Court isn't actually trying to come up with a legal rule that makes sense.

The Supreme Court's Republican majority spent much of Tuesday morning trying to figure out how two mutually exclusive principles can both be true at the same time. One principle is that all Second Amendment cases must be judged using a bespoke legal rule that only applies to the Second Amendment. The other principle is that the right to bear arms must not be treated differently than other constitutional rights.

Four years ago, in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022), the Republican justices struck down a century-old New York law that required anyone who wishes to carry a handgun in public to demonstrate “proper cause” before they could obtain a license allowing them to do so. On Tuesday, the Court heard Wolford v. Lopez, a challenge to a Hawaii state law that appears to have been designed intentionally to sabotage Bruen.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

While the law at issue in Bruen directly banned most people from carrying a gun in public, Hawaii's law tries to achieve this same goal indirectly by requiring gun owners to obtain explicit permission from a business's owner or manager before they can bring a gun into that business. Because few businesses are likely to grant such permission — and few gun owners are likely to go into a business unarmed, ask the manager for permission, and then return with their weapon — Hawaii's law is likely to operate as an effective ban on firearms in most public spaces.

But Bruen also announced a bizarre legal rule that applies only in Second Amendment cases. Under Bruen, a gun regulation is constitutional only if the government can “demonstrate that the regulation is consistent with this Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.” Thus, government lawyers must prove that consistency by comparing the modern-day law to “analogous regulations” from the time when the Constitution was framed. If the courts deem the old laws to be sufficiently similar to the new law, then the new law does not violate Bruen.

This bespoke rule for Second Amendment cases is so vague and ill-defined that judges from across the political spectrum have complained that it is impossible to apply. But, in Wolford, Hawaii's lawyers made a very strong argument that their law should survive Bruen. Their brief names an array of old laws that are very similar to the Hawaii law at issue in Wolford.

A 1771 New Jersey law, for example, barred people from bringing “any gun on any Lands not his own, and for which the owner pays taxes, or is in his lawful possession, unless he has license or permission in writing from the owner.” A similar 1763 New York law made it unlawful to carry a gun on “inclosed Land” without “License in Writing first had and obtained for that Purpose from such Owner, Proprietor, or Possessor.” And these are just two examples of the kinds of laws that existed in the 1700s that resemble Hawaii's law.

But it turns out that none of this history actually matters, as all six of the Court's Republicans — including Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who did have some tough questions for lawyers on both sides of the case — signaled Tuesday that they are likely to strike the law down.

One of the Republican justices' primary arguments against the Hawaii law was that the law would be unconstitutional if, instead of applying Bruen's historical test, the Court were to apply a more normal approach to constitutional interpretation.

Chief Justice John Roberts, for example, suggested that the First Amendment does not permit a state to forbid people from knocking on a private property owner's door and asking for their vote. So why should the Second Amendment be read to allow states to bar this person from carrying a gun? As Roberts argued, one of the “motivating concerns” behind decisions like Bruen is that the right to bear arms has historically been treated as a “disfavored right.” And thus there shouldn't be disparities between how the Court treats the First Amendment and how it treats the Second Amendment.

Similarly, Justice Samuel Alito accused Neal Katyal, the lawyer for Hawaii, of “just relegating the Second Amendment to second-class status.”

But if Roberts and Alito don't like the fact that Second Amendment cases are treated differently than First Amendment cases, they have no one but themselves to blame. Again, Bruen announced a bespoke legal test, which fetishizes history, and which applies to no other constitutional right. So a court that fairly applies the Bruen test will sometimes reach different results than they would if they applied the legal rules that apply in First Amendment cases.

If Roberts and Alito don't like this reality, the obvious solution is to overrule Bruen.

The Republican justices, in other words, appear to want a double standard to apply in gun cases. When a modern-day gun law is not similar to gun laws from the 1790s, the Republican justices can apply Bruen and strike down the modern-day law under Bruen's good-for-the-Second-Amendment-only legal standard. But when a modern-day gun law is similar to gun laws from the 1790s, then they can complain that the government's lawyers are treating the Second Amendment differently than other constitutional rights — and strike down the law.

One other sign that the Hawaii law is in trouble is that several of the Republican justices tried to embarrass Katyal, because one of the many examples of old laws cited in his brief was probably enacted for nefarious reasons. One of the old laws Katyal cites in his brief is a post-Reconstruction law, enacted by Louisiana, which allegedly was enacted in order to disarm Black people on private land.

Of course, laws that target people because of their race are unconstitutional, but not under the Second Amendment. They violate the 14th Amendment's guarantee that no one may be denied the equal protection of the laws.

In any event, if Louisiana were the only state to require gun owners to obtain a property owner's permission before bringing a gun onto their land, then that historical example would undercut Hawaii's legal argument significantly. But this allegedly racist law is but one example of an historical law similar to Hawaii's. And the fact that Louisiana may have enacted one racist gun law does not invalidate all of the other examples of similar laws in Katyal's brief.

The bottom line is that several states historically enacted laws similar to Hawaii's law, and all but one of those laws appear to have been enacted for benign reasons. If Bruen were applied honestly, this web of old laws seems to require courts to uphold Hawaii's law.

But the Court's Republican majority does not appear interested in applying Bruen when they do not like the outcome it produces. Again, when Bruen's unique test cuts against a gun law, they can strike that law down under Bruen. And when Bruen's historical test cuts in the other direction, the Republican justices appear to believe that they cannot apply Bruen, because that would mean treating the Second Amendment differently than other constitutional rights.

Just months ago, Elon Musk seemed to swear off major political spending. That seems to be over now.

The tech titan has poured $10 million into a super PAC backing GOP Senate candidate Nate Morris in Kentucky, according to Axios and The New York Times.

It would be Musk's largest publicly known single contribution to a political candidate since the 2024 election, when he spent nearly $300 million and emerged as the GOP's largest donor.

Morris, an entrepreneur and tech executive running on an ""America First"" platform, is running against two other candidates to succeed the retiring Sen. Mitch McConnell. He's been backed by a slew of MAGA-aligned politicians and figures, though President Donald Trump has yet to make an endorsement in the race.

On an episode of Donald Trump Jr's ""Triggered"" podcast on Monday, Morris said that the super PAC contribution came after he had a ""terrific meeting"" with Musk last week.

""He got excited about the race, and I think he was excited that I was a business guy and entrepreneur, and decided to make a big contribution to the super PAC that's going to be helping our campaign,"" Morris said. ""We're so delighted to have Elon's support, and for him to go all-in on us.""

Musk has not yet publicly commented on the reported contribution, and spokespeople for Musk and his companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The world's richest man has also reported to have made major contributions to super PACs tied to House and Senate GOP leadership. It comes as he's appeared to largely mend his relationship with Trump.

""America is toast if the radical left wins,"" Musk wrote on X earlier this month in response to reports of those contributions. ""They will open the floodgates to illegal immigration and fraud. Won't be America anymore.""

The details of Musk's contributions will be publicly disclosed to the Federal Election Commission at the end of January.

More broadly, Musk appears to be re-engaging with American politics, posting about hot-button topics including immigration and his support for legislation to require proof of citizenship for voting.

Musk spending big on an election would mark something of a reversal from the middle of last year.

Shortly before his feud with Trump erupted into public view, Musk declared that he was scaling back his political contributions.

""If I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it,"" Musk said at the Qatar Economic Forum in May. ""I do not currently see a reason.""

Those comments came a month after he spent millions to support a GOP candidate in a Supreme Court election in Wisconsin, only for that candidate to lose handily.

ServiceNow signed a three-year deal with OpenAI to use its artificial intelligence models to give businesses access to AI agents, the companies announced on Tuesday. 

As part of the deal, ServiceNow will integrate GPT-5.2 into its enterprise workflow platform and create AI voice technology harnessing these models.

Neither company disclosed the financial terms of the agreement. 

""Bringing together our engineering teams and our respective technologies will drive faster value for customers and more intuitive ways of working with AI,"" said Amit Zavery, president, chief operating officer, and chief product officer at ServiceNow.

The software sector is facing massive competitive pressures from AI technology disrupting their businesses and traditional revenue models. The move has forced many firms to ramp up AI integration and innovate. 

ServiceNow is also in the midst of a major deal blitz as it looks to position itself as an ""AI control tower"" in this new technological phase. 

Last month, the company announced plans to cybersecurity startup Armis for nearly $8 billion and identity security platform Veza. The company also made a bet on AI agents with a roughly $3 billion acquisition of Moveworks last year. 

OpenAI has amassed more deals with major software companies, including TurboTax maker Intuit. Databricks made a $100 million commitment to OpenAI in September.

The ""sell America"" trade is in full swing Tuesday morning after President Donald Trump and European leaders escalated tensions over Greenland. 

U.S. bond prices tumbled, sending yields spiking. The U.S. Dollar Index, which weighs the greenback against a basket of six foreign currencies, fell nearly 1%. The euro jumped 0.8% against the dollar.

""This is 'sell America' again within a much broader global risk off,"" Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central banking strategy at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients.

Precious metals gold and silver marched to fresh highs. Gold, which has long been viewed as a safe-haven investment during periods of geopolitical turmoil, was on track for its biggest one-day gain since October.

U.S. stocks tumbled as investors mitigated exposure to American assets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid more than 600 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each dropped more than 1%. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" spiked to a highs last seen in November.

The latest flare-up in so-called sell America positioning follows Trump's threats to impose 10% tariffs on eight European countries as part of his push to take over Greenland. Representatives from the 27-nation European Union gathered for an emergency meeting in response to Trump's tariff call, which he said would start Feb. 1 and then rise to 25% on June 1.

Greenland has repeatedly rejected Trump's request to purchase the arctic island, with Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen saying Monday that it would ""not be pressured"" and ""stand firm on dialogue, on respect and on international law."" European officials are reportedly considering using a salvo of counter-tariffs and other punitive economic measures against the U.S. in retaliation.

The ""sell America"" trade suggests that global investors will place higher risk premiums on U.S. investments amid fears that the U.S. is no longer a reliable trading partner. Following Trump's latest threats, some investors worry that European countries could dump U.S. assets in a show of power.

""On the other side of trade, deficits, and trade wars, there are capital and capital wars,"" Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""If you take the conflicts, you can't ignore the possibility of the capital wars. In other words, maybe there's not the same inclination to buy ... U.S. debt and so on.""

The drop in the U.S. Dollar Index was the largest since Trump's so-called Liberation Day rollout of sharply higher tariffs in April, many of which were subsequently pared back.

International markets continued to slide Tuesday after starting to retreat on Monday, when U.S. markets were closed for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday. Trump's latest threats to tariff French wine and other imported goods rattled investors who feared the U.S. would no longer act as an unwavering commercial ally of Europe. The pan-European Stoxx 600 extended its recent decline, following Asian markets into the red.

Evercore ISI's Guha said the dollar falling and the euro rising suggests that global investors are ""looking to reduce or hedge their exposure to a volatile and unreliable"" United States. Impacts on the dollar and other U.S. assets could be severe and long-term, if Trump does not walk back his plans — a trade known as ""TACO,"" or ""Trump Always Chickens Out,"" that was coined last spring — or find a compromise, Guha said.

""What remains to be determined is the magnitude and duration of these dynamics,"" Guha said.

More broadly, investors may be looking for ways to diversify away from U.S. stocks at a time when indexes are near all-time highs and American equities take up a majority of the world's total market capitalization, according to Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.

""Markets may already be pricing in full the concept of American exceptionalism, at least barring an epic, crack-up economic boom,"" Mould said. ""It may therefore not take too much to persuade investors to hedge their bets and diversify.""

Bank chiefs called for calm on Tuesday as stocks plummeted after President Donald Trump's threats of fresh tariffs.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 dropped about 1.2% in morning trade Tuesday — with the continent's major bourses and most sectors heavily selling off — after Trump floated a potential 200% levy on French wine and champagne. 

In the U.S., stock futures also retreated. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell almost 1.5%, the S&P 500 slid 1.6%, the Nasdaq was last seen almost 2% lower, while, earlier, markets in Asia also closed in negative territory.

With fears of a re-run of last April's ""Liberation Day"" tariff turmoil looming over the World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, bank CEOs in Europe called for cool heads around the prospect of a renewed trade war.

""It's important to stay calm,"" Commerzbank CEO Bettina Orlopp told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday.  ""If anything told us from last year's [tariff] event, it's best to stay calm and see what's really happening.""

European banks were among the hardest hit in Tuesday's reversal, with the Stoxx 600 Banks Index down 1.4% on Tuesday, while financial services slipped about 1.3%.

It came after markets were still reeling from the President's plan to hit European countries with tariffs of 10% from Feb. 1, rising to 25% from June 1, if they continue to push back against his bid to annex Greenland. 

Anthony Gutman, co-CEO of Goldman Sachs International, said that the current noise is creating volatility for investors, warning that ""this is the new normal.""

Speaking with CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" in Davos, Gutman said that while the bank is optimistic on Europe this year, the risk of tariffs will ""create complexity for our clients who are business leaders and have to make business decisions.""

Steven Van Rijswijk, CEO of ING Group, said that European markets had ultimately weathered last year's ""Liberation Day"" tariff turmoil, but the growing use of trade policies as a geopolitical weapon had provided a ""wake-up call"" for the continent.

He said the current ""back and forth"" rhetoric over tariffs and territory could have a lasting impact on the global economy.

""Clearly, things like geopolitics, trade disputes, supply chain challenges are not good for the stability of the economy,"" Van Rijswijk told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" in Davos.

""In the end, for economies and societies, and for banks, stability and long-term policies are good.""

He added: ""The question is: what will be the indirect impact? Do we see organizations change trade patterns or produce somewhere else? 

""Do we see investment held back? It's more the indirect effects that cause concern rather than the direct effect of an import tariff implementation.""

ByZennon Kapron,

Contributor.

When Europe enacted the world's first comprehensive stablecoin regulation in June 2024, it was a big deal. The MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation created a unified framework for cryptocurrency assets. No other large jurisdiction had anything like MiCA at the time.

MiCA established rules for issuers and service providers, aiming to protect consumers, ensure financial stability, and foster innovation by bringing clarity and consistent oversight across the EU for most digital assets.

At the time MiCA came into force, the United States federal government had yet to enact any digital asset regulation and was more focused on combating malfeasance in the sector. It was possible to imagine that Europe might outpace the U.S. as a cryptocurrency hub.

That didn't happen. Stablecoins have remained predominantly pegged to the USD. The American fintech firms Tether and Circle still issue the most stablecoins, and together, account for 85% of the market. None of the up-and-coming stablecoin issuers are European. First Digital Labs, for instance, is based in Hong Kong, while Ethena and World Liberty Financial Group are American.

The best-known native European stablecoin, Société Générale-FORGE's EURCV, has a market capitalization of $76.35 million, miniscule in the world of fiat-backed cryptocurrencies. Globally, EURCV ranks 332nd, well behind the Circle's euro coin EURC, which is 125th.

MiCA was conceived and promulgated based on the belief that comprehensively regulating crypto assets – in particular by protecting consumers – is key to their sustainable growth. That idea has merit, but we question the EU's premise that a compliance-first approach for cryptocurrency fosters innovation.

Regulations unto themselves are rarely a catalyst for innovation, especially in a sector like financial services. The most successful fintech firms, including European companies like Revolut, Klarna and N26 as well as Ireland-founded Stripe, have focused on addressing market gaps while challenging incumbents first, and sorting out compliance later.

Stablecoin users, whether institutional treasurers or retail crypto traders, focus on liquidity, interoperability, and ecosystem integration. They need stablecoins that work seamlessly across multiple blockchains, integrate with existing DeFi protocols, and maintain consistent availability.

However, European banks approached stablecoin development through their traditional risk management lens. Notably, MiCA requires that stablecoin issuers hold 30% of total reserves in bank deposits, which grows to 60% if the issuance amount is deemed to be “significant.” A study by Visa reckons that these reserve asset requirements regulation “could impair the ability of stablecoin issuers to maximize revenue from interest earned on assets, thus potentially hindering the growth of stablecoins in the region.”

At the same time, by deeming stablecoins safe and supervised, MiCA effectively gives them legitimacy to scale without providing the macro tools (like issuance limits, liquidity facilities, or resolution frameworks) to contain the fallout once they do, notes Daniele D'Alvia, Deputy Director of the Banking and Finance Law Institute at the Center for Commercial Law Studies at Queen Mary University London. With its focus on micro-prudential supervision, the EU risks overlooking macro-fragility and macro-prudential bottlenecks.

Further gumming up the works in Europe's approach to stablecoins is the confusing conversation about a digital euro. Europe is not unique in its almost reflexive attempt to edge aside decentralized cryptocurrencies with a digital fiat currency comfortably in control of central bankers. Countries like China and India – though both seem to be subtly adjusting their tone as stablecoins grow in market capitalization and use cases – have tread a similar path.

Some European officials seem to believe that they can use a digital euro to limit the influence of USD stablecoins on the European financial system. Chief among these arguments is that a digital euro would limit the likelihood of foreign currency stablecoins becoming widely used for retail payments within the euro area.

The digital euro could only slow the spread of USD stablecoins in Europe if it rendered their use unnecessary. That would require the digital euro to pursue comparable objectives and address the same use cases as American stablecoins.

But the digital euro is a different beast altogether. Unlike stablecoins, it is not focused on efficiency gains, technological innovation, or global scalability in payments. Instead, the digital euro aims to be the digital equivalent of cash.

Five years after the high tide of CBDC hype, with the exception of China, most countries are quietly dialing down their efforts to launch digital fiat currencies because the benefits of adoption are insufficient to justify the costs involved. Meanwhile, the ascendancy of dollar-denominated stablecoins is strengthening so-called “dollar hegemony” as the greenback appears poised to dominate the next generation of financial flows.

“The digital euro does nothing to counter this development and therefore misses the opportunity to position the euro as an attractive digital currency beyond Europe,” notes the Association of German Banks. 

It is not too late for Europe to accelerate stablecoin adoption and develop a viable European alternative to Tether, USDC and other American fiat-backed digital currencies. Despite its shortcomings, MiCA did establish important regulatory rules of the road that can be beneficial to the broader European cryptocurrency market if financial institutions are incentivized to take a more proactive approach to stablecoins.

A key development that may augur well for Europe's cryptocurrency market was the announcement in September 2025 that nine major European banks will collaborate to launch a euro-denominated stablecoin. The consortium, which includes ING, UniCredit, CaixaBank, Danske Bank, DekaBank, Banca Sella, KBC, SEB, and Raiffeisen Bank International, has formed a Netherlands-based company that intends to provide a feasible European alternative to USD stablecoins.

Time is of the essence. The next steps should be to accelerate regulatory engagement, build out tech infrastructure for compliance (AML/CFT, monitoring), and secure early enterprise use cases beyond crypto trading—such as faster cross-border payments and settlement of tokenized assets. The consortium should capitalize on the scale and reach of its members to distribute risk and boost liquidity.

If the consortium takes these steps, it could position its stablecoin as a trusted European-controlled option to reduce Europe's dependency on USD stablecoins. The result would be enhanced European payment autonomy.

On the other hand, if Europe slow-walks this initiative, it may have to resign itself to many more decades of dollar dominance in the global financial system.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

              Highlights            



                        While sending digital dollars across borders is fast and cheap, converting them into usable fiat (the “off-ramp”) is slow, complex and filled with regulatory and UX friction.                      


                        Off-ramping requires coordination with regulated banks, compliance checks and legacy systems, reflecting that stablecoins were built for crypto markets — not everyday payments.                      


                        FinTechs and financial firms are embedding stablecoins into cards, bank accounts and payment tools so conversion happens seamlessly, a shift that could turn stablecoins from a closed crypto loop into global payment infrastructure.                      

For millions of people paid in digital dollar stablecoins, the hardest part isn't getting the money. It's using it.

When a freelance designer in Buenos Aires invoices a U.S. client in stablecoins, or when a Nigerian importer settles a cross-border supplier payment in digital dollars, the transaction can feel close to miraculous. Funds arrive in minutes, not days. Fees are measured in cents, not percentages. No correspondent banks. No surprise FX spreads. No paperwork explaining why money is crossing borders.

But the magic can typically fade at a crucial moment: cashing out.

The real friction in the stablecoin economy is not sending value, but converting it back into something usable in the fiat world, whether that's local currency in a bank account, a debit card balance or money that can pay rent, suppliers and taxes.

This final step, known as off-ramping, is where stablecoins are confronting the limits of their real-world integration. The result is a paradox. Stablecoins are increasingly central to global payments, but they remain trapped in a circular cryptocurrency economy unless users can reliably exit into traditional financial systems.

In payments, the “last mile” is often the hardest. It's the same reason international wires move effortlessly between banks but stall at local clearing systems, or why mobile wallets thrive in-app but struggle with interoperability.

Stablecoins face a similar bottleneck. Moving a digital dollar across blockchains via bridging, while technically and compliantly complex, is trivial compared to moving it into a regulated bank account or onto a card that works at a grocery store. Off-ramping requires coordination between crypto-native systems and highly regulated financial institutions. Banks must comply with know-your-customer (KYC) rules, anti-money-laundering (AML) obligations, sanctions screening and local licensing regimes.

A freelancer may receive payment instantly on-chain, only to spend days navigating exchanges, identity checks and withdrawal limits. A merchant may hold digital dollars that cannot easily be converted into local currency at predictable rates.

The friction isn't accidental. It reflects the fact that stablecoins were originally designed to function inside crypto markets, not to integrate seamlessly with the global banking system.

That legacy still shapes today's infrastructure. Many of the largest stablecoin rails are optimized for exchange liquidity, arbitrage, and settlement between trading venues. Off-ramps, by contrast, are treated as an edge case rather than a core feature.

The off-ramp bottleneck has not gone unnoticed. A new wave of FinTech infrastructure is emerging to address what might be called stablecoins' identity crisis: are they speculative instruments, or are they payment money?

The most promising solutions focus on abstraction. Rather than forcing users to think about wallets, exchanges, and withdrawals, these platforms integrate stablecoins directly into familiar financial interfaces. Bank accounts, cards and payment APIs become the exit, not an afterthought.

“The biggest problem in crypto is not adoption; it's the user experience,” Mesh CEO and Co-founder Bam Azizi told PYMNTS in an interview posted in May. “You need to make payments so simple that even a grandmother will use it one day, maybe without even knowing that the mechanism behind the scenes is a stablecoin … to do that, you need to do a lot of heavy lifting.”

Visa, for example, last month announced the launch of its Stablecoins Advisory Practice that serves banks, FinTechs, merchants and businesses of all sizes.

Visa CEO Ryan McInerney also wrote in his annual letter to shareholders, released Dec. 9, that stablecoins are next-generation settlement infrastructure. Visa's roadmap includes stablecoin-linked cards, settlements in stablecoins such as USDC, stablecoin prefunding for cross-border payouts, and pilots that deliver payouts directly to stablecoin wallets.

If stablecoins can only move value within cryptocurrency, they will likely remain a niche financial instrument. But if they can move seamlessly into bank accounts and everyday commerce, they may become something far more consequential: a new layer of global money movement.

Citi Institute's Future of Finance think tank, for example, has projected that the stablecoin market could jump to at least $1.6 trillion by 2030, assuming regulatory support and institutional integration continue apace.

Card programs in particular are emerging as a particularly powerful bridge. By linking stablecoin balances to debit, prepaid, or other card formats, users can spend digital dollars anywhere traditional cards are accepted. Conversion happens in the background, at the point of sale, rather than as a separate, painful step.

It was reported last week (Jan. 14) that providers of stablecoin-linked cards are driving demand for Visa's stablecoin settlement, and global crypto card payment volume reached $1.5 billion per month in August, up from about $100 million per month in January 2023.

Other providers focus on direct bank off-ramps, embedding stablecoin conversion into treasury tools, payroll systems and invoicing platforms. For businesses, this means stablecoins can function as a settlement layer while accounting, compliance and cash management remain unchanged.

For example, Ramp last spring announced an expansion of its issuing partnership with Stripe to launch stablecoin-backed corporate cards designed to facilitate cross-border transactions. The integration will start with select Latin American markets and then expand to countries in Europe, Africa and Asia.

And findings in the January edition of the Blockchain and Digital Assets Tracker® Series, a collaboration between PYMNTS Intelligence and Citi, show that as regulatory postures clarify around the globe, the question of off-ramping is gaining urgency as the traditional financial sector comes to see a compliant way in which to integrate digital asset infrastructure.

After all, at the end of the day, payments that cannot complete their journey are not payments at all.

Can a severed brain remain conscious?

Consciousness researchers studying “islands of awareness” have found that disconnected brains likely sink into a strange form of deep sleep

What would it feel like to be a brain in a vat? If you had no body and no world in which to ground yourself, could you be conscious of anything at all?

Neuroscientists and philosophers have debated this thought experiment for decades as they have tried to understand how the three-pound organ in our heads can generate something as lofty as consciousness: an individual's feelings, thoughts and subjective sense of self. Your current conscious experience is likely dominated by the feeling of your body and the world around you—this is the case much of the time. But researchers like thinking about extreme cases to sharpen their theories about how consciousness works. So, they ask, can consciousness exist without these interactions with the outside world?

“Are they necessary in a deeper way? Are they necessary for any kind of consciousness at all?” asks Anil Seth, a neuroscientist at the University of Sussex in England. There are reasons to believe that consciousness could exist without a body and external world. Scientists know, for example, that some strange form of consciousness persists during dreaming despite the brain being mostly cut off from the world.

So why wouldn't a brain in a vat be conscious? In the past few years, scientists have attempted to put this thought experiment to the test by studying people who have had a rare brain surgery called a hemispherotomy. Children and adolescents who experience severe, largely untreatable epilepsy may undergo this procedure, which severs half of the brain, isolating it—and its seizures—from the rest of the brain and the outside world while keeping its blood flow and nutrient supply intact. Until recently researchers had little idea what happened to that severed part of the brain. Did it go dark entirely, or did it somehow maintain its own strange form of disconnected consciousness—an “island of awareness,” as scholars call it?

New studies now suggest that brain networks in the isolated hemisphere remain surprisingly intact, but it likely enters a strange form of deep sleep. Though these results can't prove whether or not this brain region is conscious, they offer clues about the importance of brain waves that arise when part of the brain is disconnected.

The two hemispheres of the human brain are mostly mirror images of each other. Each controls and receives signals from the opposite side of the body, and information constantly zings between the two halves.

But certain disorders, often brought on by brain injury in childhood, can cause dozens of seizures a day to arise in one of the hemispheres. These storms of electrical activity wreak havoc on both halves of the brain and can be devastating to people's lives. If they can't be treated with medication, the best course of action may be to remove the seizure-prone hemisphere from the picture—either by taking it out entirely (called a hemispherectomy) or by cutting its connections to the rest of the brain (called a hemispherotomy). In hemispherotomy, the disconnected hemisphere can no longer receive sensory input or send output to control the body. When the procedure is done early enough in life, people can make a good recovery thanks to the brain's phenomenal flexibility.

But there's “very little, if anything, known about what happens in the [disconnected] hemisphere itself,” Seth says. The possibilities fall on a spectrum with two extremes. Perhaps the isolated hemisphere goes silent or its neural activity devolves into randomness, without any meaningful communication between brain regions. Or maybe it remains entirely intact, separated from the other half of the brain and the rest of the body but still conscious. “Philosophically that would be the more problematic case,” says Tobias Bauer, who studies epilepsy at University Hospital Bonn in Germany. “You have two functioning brains, [and that] will include a second personality, a second experience, a second everything.” Any consciousness that might be maintained would be totally cut off from the world. “I always imagined that if there is something, then it would probably feel, maybe, like dreaming,” says Theodor Rüber, also of the University Hospital Bonn.

To peer inside these severed brain halves, researchers began by using an imaging technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which tracks blood flow to estimate which brain regions are consuming energy. In a 2020 study of two young people who had undergone hemispherotomies, researchers found something unexpected: Brain activity in the isolated hemisphere was still organized into the same brain networks that are present in a healthy hemisphere.

“The surprising part was the networks,” says Athena Demertzi, a researcher at the University of Liège in Belgium, who co-led the study. “It was like, how is that possible?” You would expect the isolated hemisphere to have no activity or random activity, she says. But whatever was happening on this isolated “island,” it was not random.

A more recent study, which was posted in 2024 as a preprint and has not yet undergone peer review, found similar results. Rüber and Brauer analyzed fMRI scans from 26 people who had undergone a hemispherotomy as many as 19 years prior. They found that all seven of the brain's core networks still appeared to be active in the isolated hemisphere. These networks are normally connected to each other and organized in a sort of hierarchy, moving from more specific tasks such as processing visual stimuli to higher-order, abstract ones. The default mode network, for example, is a higher-order network that is known to be active when someone is daydreaming, planning or thinking about themselves. The hierarchical organization between different networks was also preserved, the researchers found. “The very general interpretation would be that everything that we found is surprisingly normal in the isolated brain hemispheres,” Bauer says.

These preserved networks do not mean that the isolated hemisphere is an “island of awareness,” however. Brain networks don't disappear when we lose consciousness during deep sleep or while under anesthesia; their connectivity may change, but the networks are still broadly preserved. In addition, fMRI has an important limitation: it only measures blood flow. Although blood usually flows to areas where neurons are active, it still isn't a direct measure of the brain's electrical activity.

To measure such activity itself, researchers used electroencephalography (EEG): electrode caps that detect brain waves from outside of the scalp. In a study published in October 2025, researchers recruited 10 children who were about to undergo hemispherotomy. They measured the brain's background EEG activity in both hemispheres before and after surgery, with an average of 20 months in between.

What they found were isolated hemispheres dominated by slow waves—“the hallmark of deep sleep,” says Marcello Massimini, senior author of the study and a neurophysiologist at the University of Milan. These waves of electricity ripple across the brain a few times per second as neurons rhythmically cycle between two electric states. Slow waves tend to indicate unconsciousness, or dreamless sleep, which would suggest that the isolated hemisphere might be unconscious, too.

But this conclusion isn't entirely solid. “Slow waves can be used as a proxy for unconsciousness, but that's not watertight,” Massimini says. In the last five to 10 years, scientists have discovered that slow waves can also appear during consciousness, including during psychedelic trips, during sedation and deep sleep, as well as in a rare genetic condition called Angelman syndrome that causes developmental delays. Given that hemispherotomy is already exceptional, the presence of slow waves alone isn't enough to conclude the isolated hemisphere is unconscious.

This state is also unlike anything one would see in a healthy, connected brain. “You can't really say it's ‘sleep,'” says Seth, a co-author of the EEG study. “Sleep is not simple... It's very carefully orchestrated.” One of the main orchestrators of sleep is the thalamus, a deep-brain structure from which the isolated hemisphere is entirely cut off. This disconnect means that the isolated hemisphere's activity lacks important features of sleep, such as “spindles” generated by the thalamus that appear as quick bursts on EEG and promote memory processing during sleep.

The most sensible interpretation of these data, Seth says, is that the isolated hemisphere is in a state of absent or diminished consciousness. In other words, it's likely not an island of awareness. But neither does this part of the brain stop working entirely. “The brain could even go silent—we didn't know,” Massimini says. “But it keeps working, with this sleeplike regime.”

Massimini frequently studies sleep and slow waves, and he finds it fascinating that the brain seems to default to this pattern of activity in the absence of external stimulation. Similar patterns are sometimes seen after a stroke, when slow waves intrude upon damaged parts of the brain. “Every time the cortex is disconnected, that's what it does,” he says, calling it a “default state.”

It remains an open question whether a connection to the outside environment is required for consciousness. “I'm tempted by the idea that, in principle, you could perhaps get a brain that is a complete island of awareness,” says Timothy Bayne, a philosopher of mind at Monash University in Australia and a co-author of the EEG study. Yet many researchers believe that consciousness evolved to allow moving organisms to process and interact with their environment. “That suggests a deep, deep connection between consciousness and input and behavioral control,” Bayne says.

What about systems that didn't evolve like the human brain? Researchers are already growing tiny models of human brains out of neurons in the lab. These brain organoids are still quite rudimentary, but research on them is advancing at a rapid pace. Could a lab-grown organ that has never “seen” daylight or been connected to a body gain consciousness? What about artificial systems, such as AI models? While most scientists think brain organoids and AI are not nearing consciousness yet, researchers are still trying to agree on how to detect it in such strange systems.

For Massimini, the case of hemispherotomy illustrates the importance of having tests for consciousness that don't rely on external behaviors of a system—like an AI claiming it is sentient—but that peer under the hood to test how they operate. We cannot rely on external signals to determine consciousness of an isolated brain hemisphere; neither can we rely on it to tell whether someone who is unresponsive after a brain injury is conscious or to determine if an AI model that claims to be sentient actually has a sense of self. “You cannot judge consciousness by behavior. You cannot judge being by doing,” he says. “You need to go deeper.”

Looks like limestone's on the menu for some unknown creepy crawly.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

For most organisms on Earth, rocks are objects, not food. But for one oddball microbe, desert limestone seems to have been on the menu. Whether or not this mysterious form of life still exists or went extinct eons ago is, however, yet unknown.

Recently, geologist Cees Passchier from Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz came across what looked like tiny burrows in marble and limestone in the deserts of Namibia, Oman, and Saudi Arabia. Erosion had exposed the fossil burrows, and while nothing was crawling in there anymore, Passchier and his research team investigated further and found biological material inside.

“A biotic origin of the observed structures supposes the presence of liquid water, without which biological growth would be impossible,” the team said in a study published in the Geomicrobiology Journal. “The investigated areas are currently arid, but experience occasional rain showers and regular dense coastal fog, while wet periods occurred in the past.”

So, what type of microogranisms could have made the burrows? Bacteria, fungi and lichens have shown that they can survive extreme conditions, and some of them are endolithic, meaning they live inside rocks. Passchier wanted to see if the organisms that created the burrows could possibly belong to any of these groups. Fungi can bore through rocks and leave behind tubes, and some types of cyanobacteria also thrive off limestone or marble.

It is unlikely that the mystery organisms were cyanobacteria—they need sunlight for photosynthesis, so they don't bore nearly as deep into rock as the burrows that the team found. Fungi secrete digestive agents that were not present in the rock, and they also create a complex network of hyphae, or filaments, known as a mycelium. Mycelial networks tend to have order to them. The burrows were parallel and evenly spaced, which would be unusual for fungi, and there were no other patterns observed. So, they probably aren't the culprits, either.

Because the burrows were found to be too wide to have only been made by one organism at a time, and they showed growth rings, its was more likely that they were formed by colonies of microbes. Calcium carbonate dust found in the tunnels is also a common excretion from microbes that live in these types of rocks. However, no fossilized organisms have yet been found—just evidence of their existence.

These setbacks, however, did not rule out the idea of life. On the contrary—while weathering or abiotic chemical processes can create structures mistaken for signs of life, a thorough microscopic examination showed this was not the case. The chemical composition of rock samples from inside the burrows showed that whatever made them had to have been alive.

“As no known chemical or physical weathering mechanism can explain this phenomenon with the microstructural and geochemical observations presented here, and the micro-burrows form inside the host rock,” Passchier and his colleagues said in the same study, “we suggest that they are of biological origin.”

Whatever microbes carved out the tunnels have been long dead, though there are questions around whether the mystery species still exists. Maybe it's still creeping around somewhere, digging new tunnel systems for us to one day uncover.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A common painkiller may be quietly changing cancer risk","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260120000323.htm","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 08:49:17 GMT","

Ibuprofen is one of the most widely used pain relievers in the United States, commonly taken for headaches, muscle aches, and menstrual pain. New research suggests this familiar medication may have effects that go beyond pain relief. Scientists are now examining whether it could also play a role in lowering the risk of certain cancers.

As research continues to reveal how inflammation contributes to cancer development, ibuprofen has drawn growing attention. Its long-standing role as an anti-inflammatory drug has raised interest in whether a common over-the-counter medicine could offer unexpected protection against disease.

Ibuprofen belongs to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) family. The connection between NSAIDs and cancer prevention  isn't new: as far back as 1983, clinical evidence linked sulindac – an  older prescription NSAID similar to ibuprofen – to a reduced incidence  of colon cancer  in certain patients. Since then, researchers have been investigating  whether these drugs could help prevent or slow other cancers too.

NSAIDs work by blocking enzymes called cyclooxygenases (COX).  There are two main types. COX-1 helps protect the stomach lining,  maintains kidney function, and plays a role in blood clotting. COX-2, on  the other hand, drives inflammation.

Most NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, inhibit both, which is why doctors  recommend taking them with food rather than on an empty stomach.

A 2025 study  found that ibuprofen may lower the risk of endometrial cancer, the most  common type of womb cancer, which starts in the lining of the uterus  (the endometrium) and mainly affects women after menopause.

One of the biggest preventable risk factors  for endometrial cancer is being overweight or obese, since excess body  fat increases levels of estrogen – a hormone that can stimulate cancer  cell growth.

Other risk factors include older age, hormone replacement therapy (particularly estrogen-only HRT), diabetes, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Early onset of menstruation, late menopause, or not having children also increase risk. Symptoms can include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, and discomfort during sex.

In the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) study,  data from more than 42,000 women aged 55–74 was analyzed over 12 years.  Those who reported taking at least 30 ibuprofen tablets per month had a  25% lower risk of developing endometrial cancer than those taking fewer  than four tablets monthly. The protective effect appeared strongest  among women with heart disease.

Interestingly, aspirin – another common NSAID – did not show the same association with reduced risk in this or other studies. That said, aspirin may help prevent bowel cancer returning.

Other NSAIDs, such as naproxen, have been studied for preventing colon, bladder, and breast cancers. The effectiveness of these drugs seems to depend on cancer type, genetics, and underlying health conditions.

Evidence suggests that ibuprofen's possible benefits may extend beyond endometrial cancer. Research has linked its use to a lower risk of bowel, breast, lung, and prostate cancers.

For example, people who previously had bowel cancer and took ibuprofen were less likely to experience recurrence. It has also been shown to inhibit colon cancer growth and survival, and some evidence even suggests a protective effect against lung cancer in smokers.

Inflammation is a hallmark of cancer and ibuprofen is, at its core, anti-inflammatory. By blocking COX-2 enzyme activity, the drug reduces production of prostaglandins, chemical messengers that drive inflammation and cell growth – including cancer cell growth. Lower prostaglandin levels may slow or stop tumour development.

But that's only part of the story. Ibuprofen also appears to influence cancer-related genes such as HIF-1α, NFκB, and STAT3, which help tumor cells survive in low-oxygen conditions and resist treatment.

Ibuprofen seems to reduce the activity of these genes, making cancer cells more vulnerable. It can also alter how DNA is packaged within cells, potentially making cancer cells more sensitive to chemotherapy.

But not all research points in the same direction. A study  involving 7,751 patients found that taking aspirin after an endometrial  cancer diagnosis was linked to higher mortality, particularly among  those who had used aspirin before diagnosis. Other NSAIDs also appeared  to increase cancer-related death risk.

Conversely, a recent review  found that NSAIDs, especially aspirin, may reduce the risk of several  cancers – though regular use of other NSAIDs could raise the risk of  kidney cancer. These conflicting results show how complex the  interaction between inflammation, immunity, and cancer really is.

Despite the promise, experts warn against self-medicating with  ibuprofen for cancer prevention. Long-term or high-dose NSAID use can  cause serious side effects such as stomach ulcers, gut bleeding, and kidney damage.

Less commonly, they may trigger heart problems like heart attacks or strokes. NSAIDs also interact with several medications, including warfarin and certain antidepressants, increasing the risk of bleeding and other complications.

The idea that a humble painkiller could help prevent cancer is both  exciting and provocative. If future studies confirm these findings,  ibuprofen might one day form part of a broader strategy for reducing  cancer risk, especially in high-risk groups.

For now, experts agree it's wiser to focus on lifestyle-based prevention: eating anti-inflammatory foods, maintaining a healthy weight and staying physically active.

Everyday medicines may still hold unexpected potential, but until the science is settled, the most reliable advice remains simple: eat well, stay active, and talk with your doctor before relying on any medication for prevention.

While large language models (LLMs) achieve near-perfect scores on medical licensing exams, these evaluations inadequately reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world clinical practice. Here we introduce MedHELM, an extensible evaluation framework with three contributions. First, a clinician-validated taxonomy organizing medical AI applications into five categories that mirror real clinical tasks—clinical decision support (diagnostic decisions, treatment planning), clinical note generation (visit documentation, procedure reports), patient communication (education materials, care instructions), medical research (literature analysis, clinical data analysis) and administration (scheduling, workflow coordination). These encompass 22 subcategories and 121 specific tasks reflecting daily medical practice. Second, a comprehensive benchmark suite of 37 evaluations covering all subcategories. Third, systematic comparison of nine frontier LLMs—Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, DeepSeek R1, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Llama 3.3 and o3-mini—using an automated LLM-jury evaluation method. Our LLM-jury uses multiple AI evaluators to assess model outputs against expert-defined criteria. Advanced reasoning models (DeepSeek R1, o3-mini) demonstrated superior performance with win rates of 66%, although Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved comparable results at 15% lower computational cost. These results not only highlight current model capabilities but also demonstrate how MedHELM could enable evidence-based selection of medical AI systems for healthcare applications.

This study used 37 datasets with varying levels of accessibility. The minimum dataset necessary to interpret and verify the findings consists of all 37 datasets used in this study. The core model ranking trends can be partially validated using the 23 publicly accessible and gated datasets, although complete replication requires the full dataset including the 14 private datasets that cannot be shared due to institutional agreements and patient privacy protections. Sixteen datasets are publicly accessible without restrictions: MedCalc-Bench34, MTSamples35, Medec36, HeadQA37, Medbullets38, MedQA16, MedMCQA7, ACI-Bench39, MTSamples Procedures35, MedicationQA40, MedDialog41, MEDIQA-QA42, PubMedQA43, EHRSQL44, RaceBias45 and MedHallu46. Seven datasets require credentialed access due to protected health information: EHRSHOT47 via PhysioNet, MedAlign48 via Redivis, DischargeMe49 via PhysioNet, MIMIC-RRS50 via PhysioNet, MIMIC-BHC51 via PhysioNet, N2C2-CT52 via n2c2.org and MIMIC-IV Billing Code53 via PhysioNet. Fourteen datasets were developed through partnership with Stanford Healthcare or created specifically for this study and cannot be shared due to institutional data use agreements and patient privacy protections: CLEAR54, ADHD-Behavior55, ADHD-MedEffects56, NoteExtract, PatientInstruct, MedConfInfo57, MentalHealth, PrivacyDetection58, ProxySender58, BMT-Status, HospiceReferral, ClinicReferral, CDI-QA and ENT-Referral. Any further distribution of datasets is subject to the terms of use and data-sharing agreements stipulated by the original creators.

The MedHELM evaluation framework code is openly available at https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm/ with comprehensive documentation at https://crfm-helm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/medhelm/. This repository includes the complete codebase for reproducing all benchmarks, evaluation metrics and model assessments presented in this study. Additional scripts and code used for data analysis and figure generation are available at https://github.com/som-shahlab/medhelm/, enabling full reproduction of all plots and results presented in this paper. For researchers wishing to evaluate custom models on private datasets, models can be submitted via pull requests to the GitHub repository. Evaluations are performed within our secure environment with results shared on the public leaderboard at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/medhelm/latest/ while maintaining dataset privacy.

Vinylene-linked two-dimensional (2D) conjugated covalent organic frameworks, or 2D poly(arylene vinylene)s (2D PAVs), are promising polymer semiconductors for (opto-)electronics, photocatalysis and electrochemistry. However, conventional solvothermal synthesis often produces 2D PAVs that are poorly crystalline or difficult to access. Here we introduce a Mannich-elimination strategy that converts 8 2D imine-covalent organic frameworks into 11 highly crystalline 2D PAVs though a reversible C=C bond formation mechanism enabling precise crystallization control. This versatile approach affords robust 2D PAVs with honeycomb, square or kagome lattices, specific surface area up to ∼2,000 m2 g−1 and lattice-mismatch tolerance up to 3.5%. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and continuous rotation electron diffraction reveal molecular-level ordering in a 2-µm-sized triphenylbenzene-based single-crystalline 2D PAV. We demonstrate that crystallinity profoundly influences charge transport, with benzotrithiophene-based 2D PAVs exhibiting charge mobilities tenfold higher than their amorphous analogues or 2D polyimine precursors. This work establishes a general route to highly crystalline 2D conjugated polymer materials for robust applications.

Two-dimensional conjugated covalent organic frameworks (2D c-COFs)1,2,3,4, or layer-stacked5,6,7, crystalline 2D conjugated polymers8,9, represent a unique class of organic 2D crystals with extended in-plane π-conjugation10 and out-of-plane electronic couplings11. Typical 2D c-COFs are in-plane interconnected12,13 by conjugated linkages such as imine14,15,16,17 and pyrazine11. However, the polarized C=N bonds18,19 hinder efficient π-electron delocalization, often leading to large optical band gaps and inefficient charge carrier transport. Recent advances in vinylene- or sp2-carbon-linked 2D c-COFs20,21, that is, layered 2D poly(arylene vinylene)s (2D PAVs)22, have demonstrated significantly enhanced π-conjugation compared with imine-linked 2D c-COFs (also known as 2D polyimines, 2D PIs)23. Benefitting from their tunable topologies24,25, tailored electronic structures26, intrinsic charge carrier mobilities8,22 and abundant active sites27, these materials have attracted considerable attention in applications in (opto-)electronics10,28, photocatalysis23,26,29,30,31 and electrochemistry32.

Since the first report of crystalline 2D PAV via Knoevenagel 2D polycondensation20,21, various synthetic methodologies, including Aldol-type33,34,35, Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons36, Wittig37 or Claisen–Schmidt38 2D polycondensation reactions, have been developed to construct this class of materials. However, the achieved domain sizes via these methods are generally below 20 nm, limiting their potential in wide-scope applications. Moreover, unlike the excellent generality of the well-established Schiff-base 2D polycondensation39,40,41,42, only selected 2D PAVs are crystalline, owing to the considerably lower reversibility of C=C bond formation compared with C=N bond formation. In this context, it remains highly challenging to synthesize 2D PAVs with robust topologies and high crystallinity (for example, domain size >100 nm), which requires a deep understanding of reaction kinetics and precise control over reaction reversibility.

Here, we introduce a Mannich-elimination reaction strategy to synthesize 11 highly crystalline or single-crystalline 2D PAVs in honeycomb, square or kagome lattice structures from the 2D PI precursors. By contrast, the conventional Knoevenagel reaction approach only produces amorphous polymers for some of these systems. The cascade Mannich-elimination reaction mechanism is elucidated through model reactions at the (supra)molecular level and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The successful synthesis of 2D PAVs is demonstrated by various ex situ spectroscopic techniques, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The molecular-level structure of a 2-µm-sized single-crystalline honeycomb 2D PAV (2DPAV-DMP-TPB, where DMP is dimethoxybenzene and TPB is triphenylbenzene) is resolved by HR-TEM and continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED). It is noteworthy that the Mannich-elimination shows a certain lattice-mismatch tolerance (up to 3.5%) between 2D PAV and its 2D PI precursor. The specific surface areas of these 2D PAVs can be more than 100 times greater than those produced by the traditional Knoevenagel reaction. We further demonstrate that the crystallinity has a large impact on the charge transport properties, as exemplified by benzotrithiophene (BTT)-based honeycomb 2D PAVs, which exhibit charge mobilities ten times greater than the amorphous 2D PAV and their corresponding 2D PIs. This work opens an avenue for the efficient synthesis of highly crystalline 2D PAVs, suitable for robust applications.

The Mannich reaction has been widely utilized in the synthesis of bioactive compounds43. When combined with the elimination process, the Mannich-elimination reaction (also known as retro-Michael addition-elimination reaction) enables facile C=C bond formation using either a base (for example, KOH) or a Lewis acid (for example, In(OTf)3) as a catalyst44. To assess the feasibility of this reaction for synthesizing 2D PAVs, we investigated the reaction mechanism through a series of model reactions and DFT calculations. In a representative model reaction, the Mannich-elimination reaction between (E)-N,1-diphenylmethanimine (1) and 2-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)acetonitrile (2) involves a two-step process (Fig. 1a,b): C–C bond formation between the imine and the active methylene to generate the intermediate addition product 5, followed by the elimination process towards the formation of the cyano-vinylene bond in (Z)-2-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-3-phenylacrylonitrile (3) with aniline (4) as the by-product.

Aiming to optimize the reaction reactivity, we performed the model reaction in a mixed solvent of dimethylacetamide (DMAc)/H2O (v/v = 10/1) at 120 °C for 8 h under different catalytic conditions (2 equivalents of catalyst per C=N bond; see the synthetic details in the Supplementary Information). The results suggest that compound 3 can be obtained in 10–35% yield in the presence of mild bases such as NaOAc, KOAc, CsOAc, Na2CO3 and K2CO3. However, the yield significantly increases when using KOH (86%) or Cs2CO3 (98%) as a catalyst. By contrast, only hydrolysis of 1 occurs, and no product 3 was detected under acidic conditions (see the results for acids and other (in)organic bases in Supplementary Table 1). We further explored the role of the solvent under optimal conditions. The results reveal that mere DMAc (98%) and 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (91%) efficiently promote the reaction. At the same time, other polar solvents (for example, acetonitrile and dimethylformamide) provide yields ranging from 18% to 60%, while low-polar solvents (for example, dioxane and mesitylene) hinder the reaction with a yield less than 1%.

To clarify whether the reaction follows a Mannich-elimination mechanism or a pathway involving imine hydrolysis to an aldehyde and subsequent Knoevenagel condensation, we performed in situ 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis using Cs2CO3 as the catalyst and DMAc/H2O as the solvent. The spectra display a decreased intensity of the imine (1) and cyano-methylene (2) protons at 8.6 ppm and 3.9 ppm, respectively, as accompanied by the gradual appearance of the amine proton (4) at 5.0 ppm over 240 min (Supplementary Fig. 1; see also Fig. 1c). However, no aldehyde signal was observed, indicative of the cascade Mannich-elimination reaction pathway. This is further verified by the synthesis of compound 3 in 98% yield in DMAc without the addition of H2O, which excludes the hydrolysis of imine (Supplementary Table 1). The reaction is largely facilitated in DMAc compared with that in DMAc/H2O (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3), probably due to reduced reversibility of the C=C bond formation in the absence of water.

Moreover, the formation of the intermediate addition product 5 was detected by 1H NMR with characteristic cyano-C–H (ref. 45) proton signal at 4.06 ppm observed after 30 min of reaction, which fully disappeared after 120 min owing to the formation of product 3 (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2; the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of isolated 5 are shown in Supplementary Fig. 4). The intermediate 5 was further verified by various mass spectrometry analyses (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6), which supports our proposed reaction mechanism in Fig. 1b. This mechanism is further elucidated by DFT calculations on the relative Gibbs energy. When only DMAc is used as the solvent, the formation of 5 is energetically very favourable (Supplementary Fig. 7), while its transformation into the key transition state (TS2 in Fig. 1b) during the elimination process is the rate-determining step of the reaction. In comparison, the presence of water results in relatively sluggish reaction kinetics for the formation of the TS1 transition state in the Mannich step, accounting for the experimentally observed slower reactions. The presence of water is expected to improve the reversibility of C=C bond formation, which is essential for achieving high structural ordering in 2D PAVs. Meanwhile, water does not affect the calculated energy barriers for the formation of TS2 (Supplementary Fig. 7).

We thus envision that the Mannich-elimination reaction between crystalline 2D PIs and symmetric acetonitrile monomers would lead to 2D PAVs with a well-maintained structural order of the 2D PI precursors. To probe this hypothesis, we synthesized two F-labelled crystalline 2D PIs, that is, 2DPI-BTT-P(F) (P = phenyl; all polymers in this work are named A–B–C, where A is 2DPI or 2DPAV, B is the aldehyde building block and C is the amine or methylene building block) and 2DPI-TPB-P(F), via Schiff-base polycondensation in solvothermal syntheses. Then, we monitored their transformation with the C2-symmetric 1,4-phenylenediacetonitrile into 2DPAV-BTT-P(F) and 2DPAV-TPB-P(F) (Fig. 1d) by solid-state 19F/13C cross-polarization (CP) NMR and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopies. Taking 2DPAV-BTT-P(F) as an example, the ex situ 13C CP NMR spectra show peaks at 57 and 30 ppm for the isolated polymers after 1 day of synthesis, which correspond to the formation of the intermediate addition product (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 8). These peaks gradually vanish over 6 days, accompanied by the disappearance of the C=N signal at 157 ppm for 2DPI-BTT-P(F) and the appearance of a cyano-vinylene peak at 117 and 108 ppm. The solid-state 19F NMR spectra show no 19F peak in the resultant 2DPAV-BTT-P(F) (Supplementary Fig. 9), indicative of complete consumption of 2DPI-BTT-P(F) after the synthesis. Ex situ FT-IR spectra show that the stretching vibration of the imine bond at 1,597 cm−1 gradually shifts to 1,590 cm−1 (C=C) owing to the formation of cyano-vinylene linkages in 2DPAV-BTT-P(F) (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 10). In addition, the C≡N peak is observed at 2,214 cm−1. The solid-state 19F/13C CP NMR and FT-IR spectra of 2DPAV-TPB-P(F) are shown in Supplementary Figs. 9 and 11.

Encouraged by the above results, we synthesized the unlabelled powder-based 2DPI-BTT-P and 2DPI-TPB-P, which exhibit dark-yellow and light-yellow colours (Fig. 2), respectively. They display enhanced crystallinity compared with F-labelled 2D PIs (Supplementary Fig. 12) due to the high symmetry of the unlabelled building block, which would result in better layer stacking. Using the above Mannich-elimination approach, 2DPAV-BTT-P and 2DPAV-TPB-P were subsequently obtained as red and light-yellow powders, respectively (Fig. 2; see their FT-IR, Raman and ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra as well as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Supplementary Figs. 13–19; the PXRD pattern of 2DPAV-TPB-P, 2DPAV-TPB-P(F) and their 2D PIs is shown in Supplementary Fig. 20). PXRD analysis reveals the crystalline nature of 2DPAV-BTT-P with distinct 2θ signals at 3.45° (corresponding to 2.56 nm), 6.03°, 7.00°, 9.42°, 12.16° and 25.25° (Fig. 3a, red line), which we assign to the (100), (110), (200), (210), (220) and (001) crystallographic planes, respectively, for an AA stacking geometry (see the Pawley refinement in Supplementary Fig. 21). The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (001) peak is determined to be 0.39°. As expected, 2DPAV-BTT-P(F) exhibits similar PXRD signals but with a larger FWHM value of 0.55° (Fig. 3a, brown line), indicative of an inferior crystallinity in the material derived from the F-labelled 2D PI. In stark contrast, the directly synthesized sample, namely 2DPAV-BTT-P(Kn), through Knoevenagel polycondensation between benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′:5,6-b″]trithiophene-2,5,8-tricarbaldehyde and 1,4-phenylenediacetonitrile is amorphous. It is also noted that performing the Mannich-elimination reaction on 2DPI-TPB-P in the absence of water does not lead to the expected 2DPAV-TPB-P, further highlighting the critical role of water in enhancing the reaction reversibility towards crystalline materials.

HR-TEM imaging shows the well-defined honeycomb lattice of 2DPAV-BTT-P (Supplementary Fig. 22). N2 physisorption measurements were further performed to elucidate the pore characteristics of the polymer frameworks. Both 2DPI-BTT-P and 2DPAV-BTT-P show type I isotherms, with Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of 2,061 m2 g−1 and 1,844 m2 g−1, respectively. By contrast, the amorphous 2DPAV-BTT-P(Kn) exhibits a surface area as small as 16 m2 g−1 (Fig. 3b). The pore size distribution calculated by the non-local DFT method reveals a pore diameter reduction from 2.8 nm in 2DPI-BTT-P to 2.4 nm in 2DPAV-BTT-P attributable to the presence of cyano groups in the pore channels of the latter (Fig. 3c; see more details in Supplementary Figs. 23 and 24). These results support our strategy for constructing highly crystalline 2D PAVs, especially those that cannot be directly synthesized by Knoevenagel polycondensation, via the Mannich-elimination reaction on well-defined 2D PIs.

To explore the universality of this strategy, we first synthesized 2DPAV-BTT-DMP from 2DPI-BTT-P and 2,2′-(2,5-dimethoxy-1,4-phenylene)diacetonitrile (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 25). We further extended the approach to obtain 2DPI-BTT-BP (BP = biphenyl) and then 2DPAV-BTT-BP with an enlarged lattice parameter. More interestingly, by using 2,2′-([2,2′-bipyridine]-5,5′-diyl)diacetonitrile and 2,2′-([2,2′-bithiophene]-5,5′-diyl)diacetonitrile, which share a similar core length to 2,2′-([1,1′-biphenyl]-4,4′-diyl)diacetonitrile, we synthesize a series of BTT-based 2D PAVs with distinct electronic structures from 2DPI-BTT-BP (yellow powders) via the Mannich-elimination reaction: 2DPAV-BTT-BP (in light-orange colour), 2DPAV-BTT-BPY (in dark-orange colour; BPY = bipyridine) and 2DPAV-BTT-BT (in dark-brown colour; BT = bithiophene) as depicted in Fig. 2. The successful synthesis of materials is demonstrated by FT-IR and solid-state 13C CP NMR, as well as Raman spectroscopies (Supplementary Figs. 26–29). The experimental Raman spectra are nicely reproduced by theoretical calculations, which indicate a gradual shift of the C=C stretching vibration from 1,585 cm−1 in 2DPI-BTT-BP to 1,438–1,583 cm−1 for the 2D PAVs due to enhanced 2D conjugation (see more detailed discussion in Supplementary Fig. 29). DFT calculations reveal dihedral angles between the C2 building block and the vinylene linkage (Supplementary Figs. 30–32) following the sequence of 2DPI-BTT-BP (ca. 30°) > 2DPAV-BTT-BP > 2DPAV-BTT-BPY > 2DPAV-BTT-BT (smaller than 5°). These results highlight the high feasibility of finely tuning the chemical and electronic structures of 2D conjugated polymers using the Mannich-elimination synthetic strategy.

The lattice mismatch (LM) between 2DPI-BTT-BP and the 2D PAVs can be tolerated up to 3.5% (Fig. 2), and 2DPAV-BTT-BP, 2DPAV-BTT-BPY and 2DPAV-BTT-BT are highly crystalline, while the directly synthesized materials are amorphous (Supplementary Figs. 33–35). PXRD patterns display that the (100) peak of 2DPI-BTT-BP shifts from 2.80° (corresponding to 3.15 nm) to 2.79°, 2.76° and 2.90° for the BP/BPY/BT-bridged 2D PAVs, respectively (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 36); the FWHM value changes slightly from 0.25° to 0.27°, 0.26° and 0.28°, respectively. We further studied the role of LM by synthesizing 2DPAV-BTT-BP(LM) from 2DPI-BTT-P and 2DPAV-BTT-P(LM) from 2DPI-BTT-BP (LM degree of ca. 19%). The former vinylene-linked polymer is amorphous, while the latter shows considerably inferior crystallinity to that of 2DPAV-BTT-P (Supplementary Fig. 37). These results imply that, to achieve a high structural order in 2D PAV, the acetonitrile monomers need to penetrate the porous channels of the 2D PI, followed by the Mannich-elimination reaction at specific imine sites, without causing much lattice expansion or contraction.

The simulated PXRD pattern and SEM images of 2DPAV-BTT-BP, 2DPAV-BTT-BPY and 2DPAV-BTT-BT are shown in Supplementary Figs. 38–41. Their honeycomb polymer frameworks are resolved by HR-TEM images. The distances between adjacent pore centres are 3.1, 3.1 and 2.9 nm, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 42–44), which are consistent with the PXRD results. Their BET surface areas estimated from N2 physisorption isotherms are 1,985, 897 and 622 m2 g−1, respectively; 2DPI-BTT-BP shows a surface area of 2,134 m2 g−1 (Fig. 3e). It should be noted that the specific surface area of 1,985 m2 g−1 achieved for 2DPAV-BTT-BP represents the record value for the reported 2D PAVs, emphasizing the critical importance of crystallinity. Similar to the above BTT/P-based system, changing from 2DPI-BTT-BP (3.5 nm) to 2D PAVs also results in a pore size reduction to 3.1 (BP), 3.2 (BPY) and 2.9 (BT) nm (Fig. 3f).

As shown in Fig. 4a, the Mannich-elimination synthetic strategy is also powerful for the synthesis of three other highly crystalline 2D PAVs in honeycomb, square or kagome lattice based on C2-symmetric acetonitrile monomers, that is, 2DPAV-TPT-P (TPT = triphenyltriazine; in yellow colour), 2DPAV-TPPy-P (TPPy = tetraphenylpyrene; in orange colour) and 2DPAV-HATN-P (HATN = hexaazatrinaphthalene; in yellow colour). It is significant that their BET surface areas are nearly twice those of the 2D PAVs directly synthesized via the Knoevenagel approach (Supplementary Figs. 45 and 46). Our synthetic strategy can be further extended to construct 2D PAVs based on C3-symmetric acetonitrile building blocks46,47. For instance, honeycomb 2DPAV-P-TPB and 2DPAV-DMP-TPB were successfully synthesized as yellow and dark-orange powders, respectively, from 2,2′-(5′-(4-(cyanomethyl)phenyl)-[1,1′:3′,1″-terphenyl]-4,4″-diyl)diacetonitrile (Fig. 4b). However, transformation of a C3-symmetric building block is more challenging, requiring harsher synthetic conditions—specifically, 8 equivalents of base per C=N bond at 130 °C for 12 days—to achieve full conversion. The characterization of the above five materials by PXRD, solid-state 13C CP NMR, FT-IR and Raman, along with related theoretical calculations, is shown in Fig. 3d and Supplementary Figs. 47–52.

The pictures within each of the structures are photos of the powder obtained.

We further demonstrated the synthesis of single-crystalline 2DPI-DMP-TPB under solvothermal conditions48. Optical, SEM and TEM images reveal a flake-like morphology for the hexagonal 2D PI crystals, with domain sizes exceeding 2 μm (Supplementary Figs. 53–55). After the Mannich-elimination transformation, the resulting 2DPAV-DMP-TPB crystal can maintain the hexagonal morphology of the 2D PI precursor showing a domain size of approximately 2 μm (Supplementary Figs. 56 and 57) and a surface area of 1,901 m2 g−1 (Supplementary Fig. 58). HR-TEM images reveal its honeycomb polymer framework at the molecular level (Fig. 5a; see more details in Supplementary Fig. 59) with a lattice distance of 3 nm, which qualitatively agrees with the simulated structure (Fig. 5b). Supplementary Fig. 60 displays the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns throughout the crystal. Although slightly tilted from the 0001 zone axis, they exhibit the same orientation, indicative of their single-crystalline nature.

cRED collected in low-dose mode at 99 K (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 61) revealed a hexagonal unit cell with parameters a = b = 36.55 Å, c = 7.13 Å and β = 120° for 2DPAV-DMP-TPB. To validate the crystal structure, the PXRD pattern was simulated from the cRED-derived structural model and further refined by Rietveld analysis (Fig. 5d, Supplementary Fig. 62 and Supplementary Table 2). The refined unit cell parameters are a = b = 36.505(4) Å, c = 7.094(8) Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120°, with convergence at Rwp = 3.66% (weighted profile residual factor) and Rp = 2.47% (profile residual factor). Collectively, these results establish 2DPAV-DMP-TPB as a honeycomb-structured material adopting an AA-serrated stacking arrangement in the P6/mcc space group (Fig. 5e).

To elucidate the enhanced conjugation in 2D PAV compared with that in 2D PI, we calculated the electronic band structures of monolayer 2DPI-BTT-P, 2DPI-BTT-BP, 2DPAV-BTT-P and 2DPAV-BTT-BP. The 2D PAVs show band gaps nearly 0.2 eV smaller than those of 2D PIs (Supplementary Fig. 63). All monolayers present relatively flat conduction band minima and valence band maxima (Supplementary Fig. 64) due to ineffective cross-conjugation associated with the honeycomb lattice. As shown in the zoom-in band structure (Supplementary Figs. 65 and 66) and partial charge distribution (Supplementary Fig. 67), 2DPAV-BTT-BP and 2DPAV-BTT-P present π-delocalized frontier orbitals and band dispersion intensities more than three times higher than those of the corresponding 2D PIs. UV–vis absorption spectra reveal an optical band gap reduction by approximately 0.05 and 0.2 eV for the above crystalline 2D PAVs compared with the amorphous 2D PAVs synthesized via the Knoevenagel reaction (labelled by Kn) and corresponding 2D PIs, respectively (see details in Fig. 6a and Supplementary Figs. 68 and 69).

To elucidate the charge transport properties of 2D PAVs associated with conjugation and crystallinity, we measured the time-resolved photoconductivity of crystalline and amorphous 2D PAVs as well as related 2D PIs by optical-pump terahertz probe spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 6b, 2DPAV-BTT-BP shows a photoconductivity intensity at least ten times higher than that of amorphous 2DPAV-BTT-BP(Kn), indicating that the intrinsic charge carrier mobility of crystalline 2D PAVs is at least one order of magnitude higher than their amorphous counterparts (a similar trend is observed for 2DPAV-BTT-P system). Moreover, frequency-resolved photoconductivity measurements reveal an intrinsic charge carrier mobility of approximately 10 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 2DPAV-BTT-BP, which is nearly ten times that of 2DPI-BTT-BP (the charge carrier scattering time is 56 fs for the former and 17 fs for the latter; see more details in Figs. 5f and 6c and Supplementary Figs. 70 and 71). Characterizing pellet samples using the four-probe method further demonstrates an electrical conductivity of 2DPAV-BTT-BP three times greater than that of 2DPAV-BTT-BP(Kn) (Fig. 6d). These results underscore the crucial role of π-conjugation and crystallinity in enhancing the charge transport properties of 2D c-COFs.

In conclusion, we have developed a Mannich-elimination synthetic strategy that efficiently forms C=C bonds, as demonstrated through multiple model reactions and theoretical calculations. This approach is general to the synthesis of highly crystalline 2D PAVs in diverse lattice structures, such as honeycomb, square and kagome, derived from the 2D PI precursors. The specific surface areas of these 2D PAVs can be more than 100 times greater than those produced by the traditional Knoevenagel reaction. We resolve the honeycomb crystal structure of a single-crystalline 2D PAV at the molecular level. Our results further reveal that the crystallinity and π-conjugation of 2D PAVs significantly impact the charge carrier transport properties of 2D PAVs. This work not only deepens our understanding of 2D PAVs but also opens new avenues for crafting well-defined, conjugated, highly porous crystalline polymer materials for robust applications.

A mixture of 1 (50 mg, 275.88 µmol), 2 (57.36 mg, 331.06 µmol), Cs2CO3 (179.77 mg, 551.76 µmol), DMAc (3 ml) and water (0.3 ml) was added to a Schlenk tube. The Schlenk tube was sealed under an inert environment and heated at 120 °C for 8 h. After the reaction, 50 ml water was added into the reaction mixture, which was then extracted with dichloromethane. The crude product was purified by silica gel chromatography using hexane/ethyl acetate = 97/3 as eluent to give 3 as a light-yellow solid in 98% yield (70 mg).

A glass ampoule was charged with 2DPI-BTT-BP (7 mg), 2,2′-([1,1′-biphenyl]-4,4′-diyl)diacetonitrile (14 mg, 2 equivalents per C=N bond), Cs2CO3 (50 mg, 4 equivalents per C=N bond) and a mixture of DMAc/H2O (0.7/0.3 ml). Afterwards, the mixture was sonicated for 10 min at room temperature, and the ampoule was degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw cycles, sealed under vacuum and heated at 130 °C for 6 days. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting powders were filtered and sequentially washed with dimethylformamide, H2O, ethanol and acetone. After Soxhlet extraction with tetrahydrofuran for 18 h, the sample was collected and dried under vacuum at 100 °C overnight, yielding 2DPAV-BTT-BP (7.4 mg) as a light-orange solid with a 96% yield. Following the same conditions, 2,2′-([2,2′-bipyridine]-5,5′-diyl)diacetonitrile (14 mg) or 2,2′-([2,2′-bithiophene]-5,5′-diyl)diacetonitrile (14 mg) was used to synthesize 2DPAV-BTT-BPY (7.4 mg, red solid) and 2DPAV-BTT-BT (7 mg, dark-brown solid) in 95% and 91% yield, respectively.

A glass ampoule was charged with single-crystalline 2DPI-DMP-TPB (5 mg), 2,2′-(5′-(4-(cyanomethyl)phenyl)-[1,1′:3′,1′′-terphenyl]-4,4′′-diyl)diacetonitrile (10 mg, 1.2 equivalents per C=N bond), Cs2CO3 (50 mg, 8 equivalents per C=N bond) and a mixture of DMAc/H2O (0.5/0.1 ml). Afterwards, the mixture was sonicated for 10 min at room temperature, and the ampoule was degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw cycles, sealed under vacuum and heated at 130 °C for 12 days. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting powders were filtered and sequentially washed with dimethylformamide, H2O, ethanol and acetone. After Soxhlet extraction with acetone for 18 h, the sample was collected and dried under vacuum at 100 °C overnight to give 2DPAV-DMP-TPB (2.6 mg) as a dark-orange solid in 48% yield.

Experiments were performed on an image-side spherical aberration-corrected FEI Titan 80-300 operated at 300 kV. The FEI Titan is equipped with a CEOS hexapole spherical aberration coefficient (Cs) corrector, capable of correcting geometrical axial aberrations up to the third order. The images were acquired using a Gatan UltraScan1000 CCD camera. HR-TEM image simulations were performed with the abTEM package49 using the Quantum Expresso plane-wave DFT code by using the GGA-PBE relaxed multilayer 2DPAV-DMP-TPB.

When DeepSeek burst onto the global stage in January 2025, it seemed to appear out of nowhere. But the large language model was just one of the thousands of generative AI tools that have been released in China since 2023—and there's a public archive of every single one of them.

Here are 23 ways China is rewiring the future.

The country's top internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), requires that any company launching an AI tool with “public opinion properties or social mobilization capabilities"" first file it in a public database: the algorithm registry. In a submission, developers must show how their products avoid 31 categories of risk, from age and gender discrimination to psychological harm to “violating core socialist values.”

Applicants submit their filing to their local CAC (say, the Shanghai CAC for Shanghai-registered firms), which forwards applications to the central CAC for final approval. Only then is a tool publicly listed in the algorithm registry. While the European Union is pursuing a single, comprehensive AI Act, notes Matt Sheehan, a research scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, China's approach to regulation is more ad hoc, targeting specific algorithms and building up iterative standards. (The US has no comparable registration system or centralized regulatory agency.)

Over time, the CAC has inadvertently created the most detailed map of a nation's AI ecosystem anywhere in the world.

*Data current as of April 2025, includes both “generative AI” and “deep synthesis” algorithms

Open the CAC's update from August 2024 and you'll find DeepSeek listed as entry 152, a single row in a neatly packed table. Scroll through the table and you'll find an AI that manages homestays and an AI that drafts patents. One assists ob-gyns in a Shanghai maternity ward; another helps manage state power grids. Kendra Schaefer and her colleagues at Trivium China, a Beijing-based policy consultancy, have been compiling the CAC's updates into a comprehensive database, enriched with their own research.

Nearly 80 percent of China's generative AI registrations are clustered in and around its top tech hubs—Beijing, Shenzhen, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. Each city has its strengths: Beijing's elite universities, national labs, and political strength give it an edge in large-scale innovation; Shenzhen (in Guangdong) is home to a dense hardware supply chain and vast pool of engineering talent; Shanghai, close to multinationals, excels at commercialization; and Hangzhou (in Zhejiang) is fueled by Alibaba's ecommerce empire.

But innovation spreads far beyond the coasts. Chongqing is positioning itself as an AI manufacturing and logistics node; and heavy state investment has helped Hefei, in Anhui Province, become known as “China's speech valley” for its cluster of speech-recognition firms, including iFlyTek. Filings also originate in less obvious regions like Guizhou, China's “Big Data Valley,” where massive data centers power Huawei's Pangu model, and Inner Mongolia, where state enterprises are integrating AI into mining and agriculture.

*Data current as of April 2025

In the Trivium dataset, state-linked listings—from state-owned enterprises to government-backed research institutes—make up 22 percent of filings. Many state-linked firms partner with Big Tech to build their AI: PetroChina, for example, teamed up with Huawei and iFlyTek to create oil and gas applications; State Grid used DeepSeek to build a model optimizing power grids.

Foreign firms make up just 0.5 percent of filings. Ikea, for example, has a smart shopper algorithm that generates product recommendations. Yum China, the parent company that operates Kentucky Fried Chicken in China, listed a model that generates menus and promotional material.

*Data current as of April 2025

More than half of the listings in the algorithm registry are for what Schaefer calls cross-sector technologies. These range from foundational models to “general purpose” text generators to a wide array of multimedia tools—voice swappers, 3D renderers, image makers. “Nobody wants to be caught in a situation where they depend on a competitor's technology,” Schaefer says. Unlike in the US, where OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind dominate the market, China's competition to build foundational AI remains diverse and contested. But building these models is costly, and the market is beginning to consolidate. China's six “AI tigers”—Moonshot, Minimax, Zhipu, Baichuan, 0.1AI, and Stepfun—are all backed by Alibaba or Tencent. ByteDance's Doubao surpassed DeepSeek as China's most popular chatbot, but its spot at the top is not assured.

While the giants duke it out for chatbot supremacy, startups are hard at work in every sector imaginable.

Founder Derek Li says his 12-year-old company is leaps beyond the ed-tech competition. They “put wheels on a horse,” he says, bolting AI onto their existing stale software. Squirrel claims to diagnose knowledge gaps, measure progress, and adjust lessons in real time.

When China banned for-profit tutoring in 2021, the company's revenues collapsed overnight. It pivoted to licensing its platform to franchisees who also sold the company's AI-powered tablets. Squirrel's network includes more than 3,000 centers across China, serving 1.2 million students. Now, the company is eyeing expansion to the US.

Li, who withdrew his sons from a private school in Shanghai so that they could be home-schooled on Squirrel's platform, says that “in the future, teachers won't teach knowledge.” Instead, he says, “they'll become data analysts, understanding learning reports and students' ability, and psychologists, understanding emotions and shaping their personalities.”

AI Kanshe (translated as “AI Sees Tongue”) is a traditional Chinese medicine startup that analyzes health through images of the tongue, palms, and face. The company was founded by Li Wenhua, a former employee of Yaoshi Bang, one of China's earliest online pharmaceutical platforms. A longtime student of tongue and hand diagnosis, Li wanted to combine the diagnostic methods of traditional Chinese medicine with modern machine vision. The company serves both consumers and health practitioners across clinics, pharmacies, and some hospitals, offering tools to support diagnosis and decisionmaking. Its model is trained on more than 100,000 annotated images of tongues, hands, and faces.

Founded in 2024 by Wu Song, a former Wall Street quant trader, Zhongtan Puhui Cloud Technology develops AI-driven tools for carbon accounting. The green transition, Wu says, still relies on cumbersome human labor that could be automated.

Zhongtan Puhui builds AI agents that handle a number of carbon accounting tasks, including carbon footprinting and emissions audits. Its clients range from China Minmetals Group and DHL to small and medium-sized exporters in the Yangtze River Delta.

According to the company, its AI agents can pull real-time data directly from power plants, allowing them to complete a task that once took up to 30 days in 15 minutes—for a tenth of the price.

Zhongtan Puhui plans to expand into European countries. It has recently added English, French, Portuguese, and German versions and plans to sell the product on Amazon Cloud and Microsoft Azure.

Inspired after seeing Honda's Asimo robot at a tech fair in Japan, Zhou Jian founded UBtech in 2012. He spent six years perfecting the robot's servo actuators—the “joints” that enable movement—before unveiling the company's first robot, Alpha. In 2023, UBtech became the first humanoid company to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

Based in Shenzhen, the company now produces robots for factories, schools, health care facilities, and homes. Its flagship Walker S series, designed for industrial and logistics work, is used by automakers like BYD and Zeekr; its Jimu and uKIT robotics kits teach students coding and AI; Alpha Mini, its child-friendly humanoid, is in nursery schools in Seoul. The company also develops robots for elder care and companionship, as well as consumer devices like smart vacuums and lawn mowers.

UBtech retrains existing foundational models, first through simulated environments, then in mock factory environments, before deployment in real production lines. The company currently sells to more than 40 countries, with roughly a third of its revenue coming from overseas markets.

XVerse is building lifelike virtual worlds for entertainment. The company was founded by former Tencent vice president Yao Xing. After leading Tencent to develop a Go-playing AI, Yao concluded that AGI progresses fastest when its goals are clear and measurable—as in the game of Go—but that most real-world challenges are open-ended. So in 2020, he left Tencent to found XVerse, aiming to build complex, simulated worlds where AI could learn, act, and evolve.

In 2024, the company launched its flagship product, Saylo, which turns chat conversations into immersive AI-driven story videos. Users create personalized virtual characters and explore branching plots in real time. The app has 20 million users worldwide. The company also built its own large-language model, XVerse MoE, trained on diverse data sources including news, code, literature, and academic papers.

The company is also developing an AI-driven game, Zhaoyang Legend, set in a fantasy realm where players must ascend to the throne as a young crown prince and manage a kingdom. The game evolves dynamically based on players' decisions, creating endless possible plots and endings.

BubblePal, a golf-ball-sized orb, transforms children's toys into chatty companions. Clip it onto a stuffed Peppa Pig and the toy will talk back in Peppa's voice. The device can switch between more than 40 personalities, from Disney's Buzz Lightyear to the Monkey King, and speak in multiple languages and dialects, including French, German, Cantonese, and Sichuanese. A companion app lets parents set learning goals, such as encouraging more English conversation, and track weekly “growth reports” that analyze a child's conversations, emotions, and interests. Since its launch last summer, more than 300,000 units have been sold.

The toy is made by Haivivi, a Chinese company founded in 2021 by Li Yong, a former Alibaba executive who helped develop the company's smart speaker. Realizing that many of the smart speaker's users were children, Li decided to make children's toys, and in 2023 pivoted to AI companions. He relocated from Beijing to Shenzhen to tap into the city's electronics supply chain.

According to the company, its models undergo strict data reviews and monitoring to prevent inappropriate speech. In addition to going through the rigorous algorithm registry vetting process, it follows the CAC rules for protecting minors' data. BubblePal is also available in the US, Canada, and the UK, with plans for further expansion. Haivivi aims to add more popular characters such as Lucky Cat and develop product lines for young adults, like AI-powered tarot cards.

In recent years, the term chuhai—“to go overseas”—has become a buzzword as Chinese firms look abroad to escape slowing consumption and weak capital markets back home. China produces about a quarter of the world's top 100 AI products by revenue, and most of them target overseas markets. A top earner for the Hangzhou company Glority, for example, is a plant-identification app called PictureThis, which is popular outside China.

To avoid geopolitical trip wires, some Chinese tech companies have been distancing themselves from their roots by hiring foreign staff, setting up headquarters in Singapore or California, or leaving China altogether. A company called Butterfly Effect, for example, was founded in China and built a general-purpose AI agent called Manus. Shortly after the US established export controls on Nvidia chips, the company relocated to Singapore, laid off most of its Chinese staff, and scrubbed all of its content from Chinese social media.

Butterfly Effect's ambiguous identity raises a deeper question: What does it mean to be a “Chinese” AI company?

The launch of the AI lab that would redefine Microsoft caught the tech giant by surprise.

“Did we get called to participate?” Satya Nadella wrote to his team on Dec. 12, 2015, hours after OpenAI announced its founding. “AWS seems to have sneaked in there.”

Nadella had been Microsoft CEO for less than two years. Azure, the company's cloud platform, was five years old and chasing Amazon Web Services for market share. And now AWS had been listed as a donor in the “Introducing OpenAI” post. Microsoft wasn't in the mix. 

In the internal message, which hasn't been previously reported, Nadella wondered how the new AI nonprofit could remain truly “open” if it was tied only to Amazon's cloud.

Within months, Microsoft was courting OpenAI. Within four years, it would invest $1 billion, adding more than $12 billion in subsequent rounds. Within a decade, the relationship would culminate in a $250 billion spending commitment for Microsoft's cloud and a 27% equity stake in one of the most valuable startups in history.

New court filings offer an inside look at one of the most consequential relationships in tech. Previously undisclosed emails, messages, slide decks, reports, and deposition transcripts reveal how Microsoft pursued, rebuffed and backed OpenAI at various moments over the past decade, ultimately shaping the course of the lab that launched the generative AI era.

More broadly, they show how Nadella and Microsoft's senior leadership team rally in a crisis, maneuver against rivals such as Google and Amazon, and talk about deals in private.

For this story, GeekWire dug through more than 200 documents, many of them made public Friday in Elon Musk's ongoing suit accusing OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman of abandoning the nonprofit mission. Microsoft is also a defendant. Musk, who was an OpenAI co-founder, is seeking up to $134 billion in damages. A jury trial is scheduled for this spring.

OpenAI has disputed Musk's account of the company's origins. In a blog post last week, the company said Musk agreed in 2017 that a for-profit structure was necessary, and that negotiations ended only when OpenAI refused to give him full control. 

The recently disclosed records show that Microsoft's own leadership anticipated the possibility of such a dispute. In March 2018, after learning of OpenAI's plans to launch a commercial arm, Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott sent Nadella and others an email offering his thoughts.

“I wonder if the big OpenAI donors are aware of these plans?” Scott wrote. “Ideologically, I can't imagine that they funded an open effort to concentrate ML [machine learning] talent so that they could then go build a closed, for profit thing on its back.”

The latest round of documents, filed as exhibits in Musk's lawsuit, represents a partial record selected to support his claims in the case. Microsoft declined to comment. 

Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI has been one of its key strategic advantages in the cloud. But the behind-the-scenes emails make it clear that Amazon was actually there first.

According to an internal Microsoft slide deck from August 2016, included in recent filings, OpenAI was running its research on AWS as part of a deal that gave it $50 million in computing for $10 million in committed funds. The contract was up for renewal in September 2016. 

Microsoft wanted in. Nadella reached out to Altman, looking for a way to work together. 

In late August, the filings show, Altman emailed Musk about a new deal with Microsoft: “I have negotiated a $50 million compute donation from them over the next 3 years!” he wrote. “Do you have any reason not to like them, or care about us switching over from Amazon?” 

Musk, co-chair of OpenAI at the time, gave his blessing to the Microsoft deal in his unique way, starting with a swipe at Amazon founder Jeff Bezos: “I think Jeff is a bit of a tool and Satya is not, so I slightly prefer Microsoft, but I hate their marketing dept,” Musk wrote. 

He asked Altman what happened to Amazon.

Altman responded, “Amazon started really dicking us around on the T+C [terms and conditions], especially on marketing commits. … And their offering wasn't that good technically anyway.”

Microsoft and OpenAI announced their partnership in November 2016 with a blog post highlighting their plans to “democratize artificial intelligence,” and noting that OpenAI would use Azure as its primary cloud platform going forward.

Internally, Microsoft saw multiple benefits. The August 2016 slide deck, titled “OpenAI on Azure Big Compute,” described it as a prime opportunity to flip a high-profile customer to Azure. 

The presentation also emphasized bigger goals: “thought leadership” in AI, a “halo effect” for Azure's GPU launch, and the chance to recruit a “net-new audience” of developers and startups. It noted that OpenAI was a nonprofit “unconstrained by a need to generate financial return” — an organization whose research could burnish Microsoft's reputation in AI.

But as the ambition grew, so did the bill.

In June 2017, Musk spoke with Nadella directly to pitch a major expansion. OpenAI wanted to train AI systems to beat the best human players at competitive esports, Valve's Dota 2. The computing requirements were massive: 10,000 servers equipped with the latest Nvidia GPUs.

“This would obviously be a major opportunity for Microsoft to promote Azure relative to other cloud systems,” Musk wrote in an email to OpenAI colleagues after the call.

Nadella said he'd talk about it internally with his Microsoft cloud team, according to the email. “Sounds like there is a good chance they will do it,” Musk wrote.

Two months later, Altman followed up with a formal pitch. “I think it will be the most impressive thing yet in the history of AI,” he wrote to Nadella that August.

Microsoft's cloud executives ran the numbers and balked. In an August 2017 email thread, Microsoft executive Jason Zander told Nadella the deal would cost so much it “frankly makes it a non-starter.” The numbers are redacted from the public version of the email. 

“I do believe the pop from someone like Sam and Elon will help build momentum for Azure,” Zander wrote. “The scale is also a good forcing function for the fleet and we can drive scale into the supply chain. But I won't take a complete bath to do it.”

Ultimately, Microsoft passed. OpenAI contracted with Google for the Dota 2 project instead.

Microsoft's broader relationship with OpenAI was starting to fray, as well. By January 2018, according to internal emails, Microsoft executive Brett Tanzer had told Altman that he was having a hard time finding internal sponsors at Microsoft for an expanded OpenAI deal. 

Altman started shopping for alternatives. Around that time, Tanzer noted in an email to Nadella and other senior executives that OpenAI's people “have been up in the area recently across the lake” — a reference to Amazon's Seattle headquarters.

The internal debate at Microsoft was blunt. 

Scott wrote that OpenAI was treating Microsoft “like a bucket of undifferentiated GPUs, which isn't interesting for us at all.” Harry Shum, who led Microsoft's AI research, said he'd visited OpenAI a year earlier and “was not able to see any immediate breakthrough in AGI.” 

Eric Horvitz, Microsoft's chief scientist, chimed in to say he had tried a different approach. After a Skype call with OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, he pitched the idea of collaboration focused on “extending human intellect with AI — versus beating humans.” 

The conversation was friendly, Horvitz wrote, but he didn't sense much interest. He suspected OpenAI's Dota work was “motivated by a need to show how AI can crush humans, as part of Elon Musk's interest in demonstrating why we should all be concerned about the power of AI.”

Scott summed up the risk of walking away: OpenAI might “storm off to Amazon in a huff and shit-talk us and Azure on the way out.”

“They are building credibility in the AI community very fast,” the Microsoft CTO and Silicon Valley veteran wrote. “All things equal, I'd love to have them be a Microsoft and Azure net promoter. Not sure that alone is worth what they're asking.”

But by the following year, Microsoft had found a reason to double down.

In 2019, OpenAI restructured. The nonprofit would remain, but a new “capped profit” entity would sit beneath it — a hybrid that could raise capital from investors while limiting their returns. 

Microsoft agreed to invest $1 billion, with an option for a second billion, in exchange for exclusive cloud computing rights and a commercial license to OpenAI's technology.

The companies announced the deal in July 2019 with a joint press release. “The creation of AGI will be the most important technological development in human history, with the potential to shape the trajectory of humanity,” Altman said. Nadella echoed that sentiment, emphasizing the companies' ambition to “democratize AI” while keeping safety at the center.

So what changed for Microsoft between 2018 and 2019?

In a June 2019 email to Nadella and Bill Gates, previously disclosed in the Google antitrust case, Scott cited the search giant's AI progress as one reason for Microsoft to invest in OpenAI. He “got very, very worried,” he explained, when he “dug in to try to understand where all of the capability gaps were between Google and us for model training.”

Nadella forwarded Scott's email to Amy Hood, Microsoft's CFO. “Very good email that explains why I want us to do this,” Nadella wrote, referring to the larger OpenAI investment, “and also why we will then ensure our infra folks execute.”

Gates wasn't so sure. According to Nadella's deposition testimony, the Microsoft co-founder was clear in “wanting us to just do our own” — arguing that the company should focus on building AI capabilities in-house rather than placing such a large bet on OpenAI.

Nadella explained that the decision to invest was eventually driven by him and Scott, who concluded that OpenAI's specific research direction into transformers and large language models (the GPT class) was more promising than other approaches at the time.

Hood, meanwhile, offered some blunt commentary on OpenAI's cap on profits — the centerpiece of its new structure, meant to limit investor returns and preserve the nonprofit's mission. The caps were so high, she wrote, that they were almost meaningless.

“Given the cap is actually larger than 90% of public companies, I am not sure it is terribly constraining nor terribly altruistic but that is Sam's call on his cap,” Hood wrote in a July 14, 2019, email to Nadella, Scott, and other executives. 

If OpenAI succeeded, she noted, the real money for Microsoft would come from Azure revenue — far exceeding any capped return on the investment itself.

But the deal gave Microsoft more than cloud revenue.

According to an internal OpenAI memo dated June 2019, Microsoft's investment came with approval rights over “Major Decisions” — including changes to the company's structure, distributions to partners, and any merger or dissolution.

Microsoft's $1 billion made it the dominant investor. Under the partnership agreement, major decisions required approval from a majority of limited partners based on how much they had contributed. At 85% of the total, Microsoft had an effective veto, a position of power that would give the company a pivotal role in defining the future of the company.

In September 2020, Musk responded to reports that Microsoft had exclusively licensed OpenAI's GPT-3. “This does seem like the opposite of open,” he tweeted. “OpenAI is essentially captured by Microsoft.”

Nadella seemed to take the criticism seriously. 

In an October 2020 meeting, according to internal notes cited in a recent court order, Microsoft executives discussed the perception that the company was “effectively owning” OpenAI, with Nadella saying they needed to give thought to Musk's perspective.

In February 2021, as Microsoft and OpenAI negotiated a new investment, Altman emailed Microsoft's team: “We want to do everything we can to make you all commercially successful and are happy to move significantly from the term sheet.” 

His preference, Altman told the Microsoft execs, was “to make you all a bunch of money as quickly as we can and for you to be enthusiastic about making this additional investment soon.”

They closed the deal in March 2021, for up to $2 billion. This was not disclosed publicly until January 2023, when Microsoft revealed it as part of a larger investment announcement.

By 2022, the pressure to commercialize was explicit. 

According to a transcript of her deposition, Mira Murati, then OpenAI's vice president of applied AI and partnerships, had written in contemporaneous notes that the most-cited goal inside the company that year was a $100 million revenue target. Altman had told employees that Nadella and Scott said this needed to be hit to justify the next investment, as much as $10 billion.

Murati testified that Altman told her “it was important to achieve this goal to receive Microsoft's continued investments.” OpenAI responded by expanding its go-to-market team and building out its enterprise business.

Then everything changed.

On Nov. 30, 2022, OpenAI announced ChatGPT. The chatbot became the fastest-growing consumer application in history, reaching 100 million users within two months. It was the moment that turned OpenAI from an AI research lab into a household name.

Microsoft's bet was suddenly looking very different.

OpenAI's board learned about the launch on Twitter. According to deposition testimony, board members Helen Toner and Tasha McCauley received no advance notice and discovered ChatGPT by seeing screenshots on social media. 

McCauley described the fact that a “major release” could happen without the board knowing as “extremely concerning.” Toner testified that she wasn't surprised — she was “used to the board not being very informed” — but believed it demonstrated that the company's processes for decisions with “material impact on the mission were inadequate.”

Altman, according to one filing, characterized the release as a “research preview” using existing technology. He said the board “had been talking for months” about building a chat product, but acknowledged that he probably did not send the board an email about the specific release.

As its biggest investor, Microsoft pushed OpenAI to monetize the product's success.

In mid-January 2023, Nadella texted Altman asking when they planned to activate a paid subscription. 

Altman said they were “hoping to be ready by end of jan, but we can be flexible beyond that. the only real reason for rushing it is we are just so out of capacity and delivering a bad user experience.”

He asked Nadella for his input: “any preference on when we do it?”

“Overall getting this in place sooner is best,” the Microsoft CEO responded, in part.

Two weeks later, Nadella checked in again: “Btw …how many subs have you guys added to chatGPT?”

Altman's answer revealed what they were dealing with. OpenAI had 6 million daily active users — their capacity limit — and had turned away 50 million people who tried to sign up. “Had to delay charging due to legal issues,” he wrote, “but it should go out this coming week.”

ChatGPT Plus launched on Feb. 1, 2023, at $20 a month.

Microsoft invested $10 billion in OpenAI. The companies had begun negotiating the previous summer, when OpenAI was still building ChatGPT. The product's viral success validated Microsoft's bet and foreshadowed a new era of demand for its cloud platform.

Ten months later, it nearly collapsed.

On Friday afternoon, Nov. 17, 2023, OpenAI's nonprofit board fired Altman as CEO, issuing a terse statement that he had not been “consistently candid in his communications with the board.” Greg Brockman, the company's president and cofounder, was removed from the board the same day. He quit hours later.

Microsoft, OpenAI's largest investor, was not consulted. Murati, then OpenAI's chief technology officer and the board's choice for interim CEO, called Nadella and Kevin Scott to warn them just 10 to 15 minutes before Altman himself was told.

“Mira sounded like she had been run over by a truck as she tells me,” Scott wrote in an email to colleagues that weekend.

The board — Ilya Sutskever, Tasha McCauley, Helen Toner, and Adam D'Angelo — had informed Murati the night before. They had given her less than 24 hours to prepare.

At noon Pacific time, the board delivered the news to Altman. The blog post went live immediately. An all-hands meeting followed at 2 p.m. By Friday night, Brockman had resigned. So had Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI's head of research, along with a handful of other researchers. 

A “whole horde” of employees, Scott wrote, had reached out to Altman and Brockman “expressing loyalty to them, and saying they will resign.”

Microsoft didn't have a seat on the board. But text messages between Nadella and Altman, revealed in the latest filings, show just how influential it was in the ultimate outcome.

At 7:42 a.m. Pacific on Saturday, Nov. 18, Nadella texted Altman asking if he was free to talk. Altman replied that he was on a board call.

“Good,” Nadella wrote. “Call when done. I have one idea.”

That evening, at 8:25 p.m., Nadella followed up with a detailed message from Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and top lawyer. In a matter of hours, the trillion-dollar corporation had turned on a dime, establishing a new subsidiary from scratch — legal work done, papers ready to file as soon as the Washington Secretary of State opened Monday morning.

They called it Microsoft RAI Inc., using the acronym for Responsible Artificial Intelligence.

“We can then capitalize the subsidiary and take all the other steps needed to operationalize this and support Sam in whatever way is needed,” Smith wrote. Microsoft was “ready to go if that's the direction we need to head.”

Altman's reply: “kk.”

The company calculated the cost of absorbing the OpenAI team at roughly $25 billion, Nadella later confirmed in a deposition — enough to match the compensation and unvested equity of employees who had been promised stakes in a company that now seemed on the verge of collapse.

By Sunday, Emmett Shear, the Twitch co-founder, had replaced Murati as interim CEO. That night, when the board still hadn't reinstated Altman, Nadella announced publicly that Microsoft was prepared to hire the OpenAI CEO and key members of his team.

“In a world of bad choices,” Nadella said in his deposition, the move “was definitely not my preferred thing.” But it was preferable to the alternative, he added. “The worst outcome would have been all these people leave and they go to our competition.”

On Tuesday, Nov. 21, the outcome was still uncertain. Altman messaged Nadella and Scott that morning, “can we talk soon? have a positive update, ish.” Later, he said the situation looked “reasonably positive” for a five-member board. Shear was talking to the remaining directors.

Nadella asked about the composition, according to the newly public transcript of the message thread, which redacts the names of people who ultimately weren't chosen.

“Is this Larry Summers and [redacted] and you three? Is that still the plan?”

Summers was confirmed, Altman replied. The other slots were “still up in air.”

Altman asked, “would [redacted] be ok with you?”

“No,” Nadella wrote.

Scott was more emphatic, giving one unnamed person a “strong no,” and following up for emphasis: “Strong strong no.”

The vetting continued, as Nadella and Scott offered suggestions, all of them redacted in the public version of the thread. 

Nadella added Smith to the thread. One candidate, the Microsoft president wrote, was “Solid, thoughtful, calm.” Another was “Incredibly smart, firm, practical, while also a good listener.”

At one point, Scott floated a joke: “I can quit for six months and do it.” He added a grinning emoji and commented, “Ready to be downvoted by Satya on this one, and not really serious.”

Nadella gave that a thumbs down.

The back-and-forth reflected a delicate position. Microsoft had no board seat at OpenAI. Nadella had said publicly that the company didn't want one. But the texts showed something closer to a shadow veto — a real-time screening of the people who would oversee the nonprofit's mission.

By evening, a framework emerged. Altman proposed Bret Taylor, Larry Summers, and Adam D'Angelo as the board, with himself restored as CEO. Taylor would handle the investigation into his firing.

Smith raised a concern. “Your future would be decided by Larry [Summers],” he wrote. “He's smart but so mercurial.” He called it “too risky.” (Summers resigned from the OpenAI board in November 2025, following revelations about his correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein.)

Altman wrote, “id accept it given my conversations with him and where we are right now.” He added, “it's bullshit but i want to save this … can you guys live with it?”

Nadella asked for Summers' cell number.

At  2:38 p.m., Altman texted the group: “thank you guys for the partnership and trust. excited to get this all sorted to a long-term configuration you can really depend on.”

Nadella loved the message.

Two minutes later, Smith replied: “Thank you! A tough several days. Let's build on this and regain momentum.”

Altman loved that one.

Nadella had the last word: “Really looking forward to getting back to building….”

Later that night, OpenAI announced Altman's return with the newly constituted board.

“We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Nadella posted on X. “We believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.”

The crisis was resolved, but the underlying tensions remained.

On December 27, 2024, OpenAI announced it would unwind its capped-profit structure. Internally, this initiative was called “Project Watershed,” the documents reveal.

The mechanics played out through 2025. On September 11, Microsoft and OpenAI executed a memorandum of understanding with a 45-day timeline to finalize terms.

Microsoft's role was straightforward but powerful. Its approval rights over “Major Decisions” including changes to OpenAI's structure. Asked in a deposition whether those rights covered a recapitalization of OpenAI's for‑profit entity into a public benefit corporation, Microsoft corporate development executive Michael Wetter testified that they did.

The company had no board seat. “Zero voting rights,” Wetter testified. “We have no role, to be super clear.” But under the 2019 agreement, the conversion couldn't happen without them.

The timing mattered. A SoftBank-led financing — internally called Project Sakura — was contingent on the recapitalization closing by year-end. Without the conversion, the funding could not proceed. Without Microsoft's approval, the conversion could not proceed.

Valuation became a key focus of negotiations. Morgan Stanley, working for Microsoft, estimated OpenAI's value at $122 billion to $177 billion, according to court filings. Goldman Sachs, advising OpenAI, put it at $353 billion. The MOU set Microsoft's stake at 32.5 percent. By the time the deal closed after the SoftBank round, dilution brought it to 27 percent. 

OpenAI's implied valuation was $500 billion — a record at the time (until it was surpassed in December by Musk's SpaceX). As Altman put it in his deposition, “That was the willing buyer-willing seller market price, so I won't argue with it.”

For Microsoft, it was a give-and-take deal: the tech giant lost its right of first refusal on new cloud workloads, even as OpenAI committed to the $250 billion in future Azure purchases.

At the same time, the agreement defused the clause that had loomed over the partnership: under prior terms, a declaration of artificial general intelligence by OpenAI's board would have cut Microsoft off from future models. Now any such declaration needs to be made by an independent panel, and Microsoft's IP rights run through 2032 regardless. 

The transaction closed on Oct. 28, 2025. The nonprofit remained (renamed the OpenAI Foundation) but as a minority shareholder in the company it had once controlled.

Six days later, OpenAI signed a seven-year, $38 billion infrastructure deal with Amazon Web Services. The company that had “sneaked in there” at the founding, as Nadella put it in 2015, was back — this time as a major cloud provider for Microsoft's flagship AI partner.

In a post this weekend, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar made the shift explicit: “Three years ago, we relied on a single compute provider,” she wrote. “Today, we are working with providers across a diversified ecosystem. That shift gives us resilience and, critically, compute certainty.”

Revenue is up from $2 billion in 2023 to more than $20 billion in 2025. OpenAI is no longer a research lab dependent on Microsoft's cloud. It's a platform company with leverage. 

In December 2015, Nadella had to ask whether Microsoft had been called to participate in the OpenAI launch. A decade later, nothing could happen without the Redmond tech giant. 

But OpenAI will no longer be theirs alone.

Andréa Mallard, who spent the past seven years leading marketing at Pinterest, joined Microsoft AI as its new chief marketing officer. 

Mallard started in her new role two weeks ago. She said she was drawn to Microsoft's AI group “to help build a technology that truly earns the trust needed to serve human potential.”

“AI is already the most consequential technological shift of my lifetime,” she wrote on LinkedIn. “It will shape our children's lives in ways that are difficult to predict.”

Before joining Pinterest in 2018, Mallard was CMO at Athleta and Omada Health. She's currently a board director at Hydrow, Kajabi, and TwentyFirstCenturyBrand.

Microsoft AI, led by Mustafa Suleyman, launched in 2024 and focuses on consumer products and research. 

— Claudine Cheever, vice president of global brand and marketing at Amazon, is replacing Mallard as the new CMO at Pinterest. 

Cheever spent nearly a decade at Amazon in global marketing roles, where she oversaw various functions and campaigns. 

“What really hooked me is how Pinterest stands apart from other social and search platforms,” Cheever wrote on LinkedIn. “The platform is rooted in intention, not reaction. People come to Pinterest to save, curate, evolve their interests, and shop. That's not just inspiring. It's fundamentally different.”

Jo Shoesmith, global chief creative officer at Amazon, will replace Cheever on an interim basis as the company searches for a permanent replacement. 

“Claudine has been a creative leader, building durable global brand architecture and sophisticated creative systems that operate at scale across our Stores business,” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. “We're grateful for her impact on our brand and teams, and we wish her all the best in her next chapter.”

San Francisco-based Pinterest also hired former DoorDash and Spotify exec Lee Brown as its new chief business officer.

— Irina Ghose was named managing director for Anthropic's India operations. Ghose spent 24 years at Microsoft, most recently as managing director for Microsoft India. 

India represents the second-largest user base for Anthropic's Claude product, Ghose wrote on LinkedIn. 

“From digital natives and software firms to large enterprises and public-sector institutions, India is entering a phase of scaled deployment that will enhance competitive advantage and shape the future,” she wrote. “AI tuned to local languages will be a force multiplier across society – from education and healthcare to workforce development and job skills.”

— Trisha Berard, a longtime Seattle-area HR leader, joined Evergreen Goodwill as senior vice president of people and culture. 

Berard was most recently a senior director at McKinstry and vice president of HR at Eddie Bauer. She also spent 12 years at Amazon, where she was a global strategic HR leader, along with stints at Starbucks and RealNetworks. 

Evergreen Goodwill employs more than 2,000 people across the Seattle region and operates 23 nonprofit thrift stores. 

“Evergreen Goodwill's mission of empowering individuals, supporting communities, and creating sustainable training and employment inspires me,” Berard said in a statement. 

Libby Johnson McKee, a former customer returns leader at Amazon, joined Evergreen Goodwill as CEO in 2024. Shelley Salomon, vice president of global business for Amazon, sits on the nonprofit's board.

In an effort to sweeten the pot for Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) shareholders, Netflix is now offering cash for shares of the company, revising the cash-and-stock deal it had struck with WBD's board earlier. 

However, the streaming giant is still offering the same $27.75 the companies had agreed on for WBD's movie studio and streaming assets, and the deal continues to value the company at $82.7 billion.

The new offer serves to simplify the deal structure, the companies said in a statement on Tuesday, and “provides greater certainty of value,” and speeds up the timeline for a shareholder vote. Netflix said it would finance the deal with cash, debt, and “committed financing.”

The change-up comes as rival suitor Paramount Skydance has intensified efforts to win over WBD's shareholders with its all-cash, $30-per-share offer for the entirety of the company, including securing a $40 billion guarantee from its CEO David Ellison's billionaire dad, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.

Paramount, which has been trying to buy Warner Bros. Discovery for months, last week sued the company for more information on Netflix's offer and said it would nominate new members to Warner Bros.' board, after WBD rebuffed its offer. The company also sought to expedite the lawsuit, but the court rejected that effort.

Netflix, for its part, had until now stuck to its original cash-and-share offer, enjoying the full backing of WBD's board, which has resolutely rejected Paramount's bids. WBD has argued that selling to Netflix would make for a better deal because the streaming giant has the capital to pay, and has said that Paramount's deal poses “materially more risk,” as it would saddle the combined company with $87 billion in debt.

Warner Bros. has also called into question Paramount's ability to function after the deal goes through, arguing that raising such amounts of debt would further worsen Paramount's current “junk” credit rating, and has raised concerns about Paramount's negative free cash flow, which would be exacerbated by the acquisition.

WBD said in October that it was exploring a sale after receiving unsolicited interest from multiple parties. The company, valued at over $45 billion at the time but burdened with billions in debt, has struggled amid declining cable viewership and intensifying competition from streaming rivals like Netflix. The streaming giant soon after came out on top after winning a bidding war against Paramount and Comcast.

String theory usually prefers universes that want to crunch inwards (Anti-de Sitter space). Our universe, however, is accelerating outwards (Dark Energy).To fix this, the authors are essentially creating a force balance. They have magnetic flux pushing the universe's extra dimensions outward (like inflating a tire), and they use the Casimir effect (quantum vacuum pressure) to pull them back inward.When you balance those two opposing pressures, you get a stable system with a tiny bit of leftover energy. That ""leftover"" is the Dark Energy we observe.You start with 11 dimensions (M-theory) and roll up 6 of them to get this 5D model. It sounds abstract, but for my engineer brain, it's helpful to think of that extra 5th dimension not as a ""place"" you can visit, but as a hidden control loop. The forces fighting it out inside that 5th dimension are what generate the energy potential we perceive as Dark Energy in our 4D world. The authors stop at 5D here, but getting that control loop stable is the hardest partThe big observatiom here is that this balance isn't static -- it suggests Dark Energy gets weaker over time (""quintessence""). If the recent DESI data holds up, this specific string theory solution might actually fit the observational curve better than the standard model.[0] https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-821-string-theory-and-holograp...

When you balance those two opposing pressures, you get a stable system with a tiny bit of leftover energy. That ""leftover"" is the Dark Energy we observe.You start with 11 dimensions (M-theory) and roll up 6 of them to get this 5D model. It sounds abstract, but for my engineer brain, it's helpful to think of that extra 5th dimension not as a ""place"" you can visit, but as a hidden control loop.

This is a bit of a technicality, but we don't live in a 4D world, we live in a 3+1D world - the 3 spacial dimensions are interchangeable, but the 1 time-related dimension is not interchangeable with the other three (the metric is not commutative).I'm bringing this up because a lot of people seem to think that time and space are completely unified in modern physics, and this is very much not the case.

Equally, cause always precedes effect. If time were exactly like space, you could bypass a cause to get to an effect, which would break the fundamental laws of physics as we know them.There's obviously a lot more, but that's a couple of examples to hopefully help someone.

Even worse, the weak force breaks another symmetry as well, parity symmetry (which basically means that moving backward in time, weak force particles ""look"" like their mirror image, instead of looking the same).

Why is a major question, but any understanding of our universe must assume this fact.

It seems like it would be hard to distinguish from the point of view of a 4D unit vector XYZT if T was massively larger.   Is it distinguished because it's special or is it just distinguished just because the ratio to the other values is large.Imagine if at the big bang there was stuff that went off in Z and XY and T were  tiny in comparison?   What would that look like?    Part of me says relativity would say there's no difference, but I only have a slightly clever layman's grasp of relativity.

However, this is NOT the case in Special Relativity (or in QM or QFT). Instead, the distance between two points (""events"") is (cT1-cT2)^2 - (X1-X2)^2 - (Y1-Y2)^2 - (Z1-Z2)^2. Note that this means that the distance between two different events can be positive, negative, or 0. These are typically called ""time-like separated"" (for example, two events with the same X,Y,Z coordinates but different T coordinates, such as events happening in the same place on different days); ""space-like separated"" (for example, two events with the same T coordinate but different X,Y,Z coordinates, such as events happening at the same time in two different places on Earth); or light-like separated (for example, if (cT1-cT2) = (X1 - X2), and Y, Z are the same; these are events that could be connected by a light beam). Here c is the maximum speed limit, what we typically call the speed of light.This difference in metric has many mathematical consequences in how different points can interact, compared to a regular 4D space. But even beyond those, it makes it very clear that walking to the left or right is not the same as walking forwards or backwards in time.Edit to add a small note: what I called ""the distance"" is not exactly that - it's a measure of the vector that connects the two points (specifically, it is the result of its scalar product with itself, v . v). Distance would be the square root of that, with special handling for the negative cases in 3+1D space, but I didn't want to go into these complications.

For example:Every continuous symmetry of action in a physical system with conservative forces has a corresponding conservation law.

But otherwise, there is nothing special about positive or negative statements. You can express any positive statement as the negation of a negative statement, so to the extent that science can ""disprove negatives"", it can equivalently ""prove positives"".

Now, if by ""string theory is dead in the water"" someone means that ""working on a generalization of string theory is a bad idea"", then they are wrong, Leonard Susskind doesn't believe that.But if by ""string theory is dead in the water"" they mean ""there is no point in studying String Theory deeper, with its general mathematical properties, maybe with a slight tweaks, as it is right now it can't describe the real world"", then  this is quite clearly professor Susskind's position.

After the failures of the first two Dojo supercomputers, fingers crossed that Dojo3 will be the first truly successful variant.

Elon Musk has confirmed on X that Tesla has restarted work on the Dojo3 supercomputer following the new success of its AI5 chip design. The billionaire stated in a recent X post that the AI5 chip design is now in ""good shape"", enabling Tesla to shuffle resources back to the Dojo 3 project. Musk also added that he is hiring more people to help build the chips that will inevitably be used in Tesla's next-gen supercomputer.

This news follows Tesla's decision that it was cancelling Dojo's wafer-level processor initiative in late 2025. Dojo 3 has gone through several iterations since Elon Musk first chimed in on the project, but according to Musk's latest thoughts on it, Dojo 3 will be the first Tesla-built supercomputer to take advantage of purely in-house hardware only. Previous iterations, such as Dojo2, took advantage of a mixture of in-house chips and Nvidia AI GPUs.

Now that the AI5 chip design is in good shape, Tesla will restart work on Dojo3. If you're interested in working on what will be the highest volume chips in the world, send a note to AI_Chips@Tesla.com with 3 bullet points on the toughest technical problems you've solved.January 18, 2026

Tesla's chip game is no joke. AI5 chip will be roughly comparable to a Nvidia Hopper Chip in a single SoC, and Blackwell class when you run two of them together.Those AI chips from Nvidia run ~$25K-$50K each. AI5 will run at ~250W compared to H100's 700W or Blackwell's… pic.twitter.com/KAWtwQQC2KJanuary 19, 2026

According to Musk, the Dojo3 will use AI5/AI6 or AI7, the latter two being part of Musk's new 9-month cadence roadmap. AI5 is AI5 is almost ready for deployment and is Tesla's most competitive chip yet, yielding Hopper-class performance on a single chip and Blackwell-class performance with two chips working together using ""much less power"". Work on Dojo 3 coincides directly with Musk's new nine-month release cycle, where Tesla will start producing new chips every nine months, starting with its AI6 chip. AI7, we believe, will likely be an iterative upgrade to AI6; building a brand new architecture every 9 months would be extremely difficult, if not impossible.

It will be interesting to see whether or not Dojo3 will prove to be successful. Dojo 1 was supposed to be one of the most powerful supercomputers when it was built, but competition from Nvidia prevented that from happening, among other problems. Dojo 2 was cancelled mid-way through development. If Tesla can deliver competitive performance with Nvidia GPUs consistently, Dojo 3 has the potential to be Tesla's first truly successful supercomputer. Elon also hinted that Dojo 3 will be used for ""space-based AI compute"".

AI4 by itself will achieve self-driving safety levels very far above human. AI5 will make the cars almost perfect and greatly enhance Optimus.AI6 will be for Optimus and data centers. AI7/Dojo3 will be space-based AI compute.January 18, 2026

Human-bear encounters are up 163% since 2021, with more than 12 human deaths recorded in 2025.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A Japanese city is rolling out an anti-bear drone system in response to “record levels of bear casualties and sightings.” Terra Drone has announced (machine translation) that its bear-repelling drones will be deployed around Ishinomaki City in Miyagi Prefecture to address concerns regarding a “bear infestation.”

Terra Drone quotes Japanese Ministry of the Environment figures as part of the explanation as to the current wave of ursine issues in the land of the rising sun. Its press release states that the number of human-bear encounters “has increased by 163% since 2021, with 20,792 cases nationwide, 100 injuries since April, and more than 12 deaths.” These are the worst official stats ever, says the firm.

A number of factors are thought to have resulted in the current situation. For example, Japan has seen the number of people with hunting licenses decline from over half a million in 1975 to around 220,000 in 2020. Moreover, 60% of holders are now over 60 years old. Meanwhile, city developers increasingly move nearer to bear habitats, closing the circle on their free roaming areas. It is also claimed that the police and similar agencies face constraints on lethal training to address wild animals.

 




Last year, Terra Drone adapted its devices to respond quickly to bear sightings and carry bear repellent sprays. The resulting drone system can “combine speed, safety, and immediate effectiveness.”

In action, the drones are operated from up to a kilometer (~1,100 yards) away, ensuring operator safety. A drone can deliver its capsaicin spray on target at distances between 5 and 10 meters (up to ~11 yards) from the bear. This has a temporary, non-lethal impact on the bear(s), and makes sure they can't sense humans in their vicinity.

Terra Drone has previously demonstrated a similar pesticide packing drone for farms. It is claimed to be accurate enough to spray areas with an accuracy of within a 10cm radius.

Ishinomaki City is far from the only area in Japan affected by bears.

Nancy A. Melville

 January 20, 2026  

Emergency department (ED) visits related to cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), characterized by recurrent nausea and vomiting in chronic cannabis users, have steadily increased amid legalization, expanding formulations, and higher-potency products. The trend is placing pressure on clinicians to recognize and accurately diagnose the condition.

“CHS now accounts for a growing share of emesis-related ED presentations,” reported James A. Swartz, PhD, of the University of Illinois, Chicago, and colleagues in one of the latest studies documenting the increasing prevalence.

“Given frequent misdiagnosis and costly, unnecessary testing, greater clinical awareness is needed,” they wrote.

CHS is a subtype of cyclical vomiting syndrome (CVS) that, as detailed in Rome IV criteria, presents with recurrent severe nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, with the defining feature of chronic cannabis use. Although patients with CHS may report compulsive, prolonged hot bathing, such behavior is also observed in CVS.

Recent epidemiologic data suggest that increasing CHS prevalence corresponds with the legalization of recreational cannabis across the US over the past 15 years, with notable upswings during the COVID pandemic and persistently elevated rates thereafter.

In their cross-sectional analysis of data from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample, Swartz and colleagues observed that CHS prevalence increased from 4.4 reports per 100,000 visits in 2016 to 33.1 per 100,000 visits in the second quarter of 2020, with rates remaining elevated at 22.3 per 100,000 visits in 2022.

Notably, the study also showed a marked decline in CVS-only diagnoses, from 300 to 186 cases per 100,000 visits over the same period. This inverse trend may reflect improvement in diagnostic differentiation between CVS and CHS.

“The decline in CVS-only cases shown in our paper supports the notion that a portion of cases previously diagnosed as CVS with no clear underlying cause are now being correctly attributed to cannabis use,” Swartz told Medscape Medical News.

In the analysis, CVS cases with likely causes other than CHS were excluded, he noted.

Additional studies published in the past year have similarly documented rising CHS rates in Massachusetts, Northern California, and elsewhere in the US.

Although most studies show the highest CHS rates among young adults in their twenties and thirties, the demographic group most closely associated with cannabis use, CHS is increasing being reported in adolescents.

In a nationwide retrospective analysis of adolescents aged 13-21 years, researchers observed a 49% increase in CHS-related ED visits between 2016 and 2023, rising from 160.4 cases per 1 million ED visits in 2016 to as many as 1968 in 2023.

Importantly, although CHS-related ED visits were more common in states with legalized recreational cannabis than in nonlegalized states (1909 vs 834 per million), the rate of increase was actually higher in states without legalization (49.3% vs 32.5%).

The increasing range of higher-potency cannabis products (eg, vapes, tinctures, and edibles) appear to be a key contributor to CHS risk, explained Michael Shalaby, MD, an assistant professor of emergency medicine with the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, whose team has also published research on CVS and CHS.

“Many chronic cannabis users, defined as use for 4 days or more per week, are not traditional smokers anymore, [and] potency is certainly a causative factor,” Shalaby told Medscape Medical News.

“One can only smoke so much cannabis before becoming altered, which is a natural stop-point for ingestion,” he explained. “However, even a single drink can contain hundreds to thousands of mg of THC [tetrahydrocannabinol].”

“Combine this with chronic use, and we are seeing worse and more frequent cases of CHS.”

Still, CHS appears to affect only a small percentage of overall cannabis users, Swartz noted.

“If we could subset cannabis users to those who use the more potent products and those who use them more frequently and for an extended time, we could get a better idea of risk for CHS among this sub-population of high-risk cannabis users,” he said.

The specific etiology of CHS is unclear. Proposed mechanisms include downregulation of high cannabinoid 1 receptors, disrupted hypothalamic thermoregulation, or even possible genetic susceptibility, Swartz said.

What is clear, Shalaby added, is the upswing in cases and the frequency with which CHS is missed.

“We are definitely seeing a lot more frequent cases of CHS,” he said. “However, they are frequently missed because emergency physicians often either forget to ask about social history and drug use or do not correlate symptoms of nausea and vomiting with cannabis use.”

Although cannabis cessation remains the standard recommendation in CHS management, there are currently no treatments approved by the FDA for the condition.

Ondansetron is the most commonly used antiemetic in CHS, however, Shalaby said the data do not support it being the most effective, and when used alone it is often insufficient.

Instead, “a combination of antipsychotic medications such as droperidol or haloperidol, benzodiazepines such as lorazepam or diazepam, and analgesics such as ketorolac, make for the most effective combination of medications to treat CHS,” he said.

The medications address not just nausea but also retching and abdominal pain, the hallmarks of CHS as well as CVS, Shalaby added.

Studies supporting this approach include the randomized Haloperidol vs Ondansetron for Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome trial, which demonstrated the superiority of haloperidol over ondansetron for CHS, with improvements in nausea, reduced pain, and shorter ED stays.

On a more anecdotal level, Shalaby and his team have also reported success with regional anesthesia in CHS that is refractory to treatment. They administered anesthesia via a thoracic erector spinae plane block, a technique previously used for other conditions of gastric neurodysmotility accompanied by intractable vomiting.

“We have only performed this block on this patient [in the case study], but given how efficacious it was for her as well as for other disorders of gut-brain interaction, such as gastroparesis, or sources of visceral pain [gastritis, gastrointestinal malignancy, etc.], we would offer it to any patient with refractory pain,” Shalaby said.

Such novel treatments “are viable options for patients with intractable symptoms,” he added. “This can be the difference between intractable symptoms and complete relief, and between admission and discharge.”

Richard J. Gawel, MD, first author on the case reporting describing the use of a thoracic erector spinae plane block and an emergency physician at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, noted that symptom improvement typically occurred within 20-30 minutes, “consistent with the onset of the medication we administer when doing the block.”

Gawel said his group probably performs such blocks for this indication of any ED. He and his research team are currently conducting larger studies to further assess the effectiveness of this approach.

For clinicians, the take-home message is the need to do a better job at recognizing CHS, Shalaby concluded.

“Any patient with intractable vomiting and abdominal pain should have a social history taken,” he said. “And any patient who uses cannabis for at least 4 days a week should be suspected of having CHS.”

Swartz, Shalaby, and Gawel had no disclosures to report.

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a mast cell-mediated disease characterized by the development of wheals (hives), angioedema, or both for a duration of more than 6 weeks. The management of CSU follows a structured, evidence-based “treat-to-target” approach, aiming for complete symptom control and a return to a normal quality of life.

Standard-dose second-generation antihistamines are usually recommended as the initial therapy for patients with CSU. They are considered more effective than first-generation antihistamines and they lack the sedative and anticholinergic side effects of older medications.

Long-term systemic steroids are not recommended for initial management due to their extensive side-effect profile.

Topical corticosteroid creams are considered ineffective for preventing or treating hives and angioedema in CSU.

Learn more about CSU treatment and management.

For patients who are still symptomatic after 4 weeks of initial antihistamine treatment, guidelines suggest up-dosing the current second-generation antihistamines up to four times the standard dose. Additionally, 4 weeks is not considered too soon to determine treatment inefficacy; guidelines state that if symptoms are still present after 2-4 weeks, increasing antihistamine dose is recommended.

While individual responses vary, there is limited evidence that switching between different second-generation antihistamines at the same dose provides a significant therapeutic advantage.

Adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist to antihistamine therapy is generally not recommended in this setting. Further, leukotriene receptor antagonists are more often used in patients with asthma.

Learn more about CSU management.

IgE inhibitors are humanized monoclonal antibodies that bind to free IgE, preventing it from activating mast cells and basophils. Omalizumab, an IgE inhibitor, is approved as a third-line treatment for refractory CSU. The BTK inhibitor remibrutinib is also approved for this setting.

Dupilumab, a IL-4/13 inhibitor, was recently approved for the third-line treatment in patients aged 12 and older with CSU that is refractory to high-dose antihistamines.

IL-5 inhibitors, such as mepolizumab and benralizumab, have not demonstrated the same consistent efficacy; they are not approved third-line treatments in this setting.

TNF inhibitors and IL-12/23 inhibitors are not approved for patients with CSU; they are usually recommended for other conditions such as plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.

Learn more about CSU treatments.

Calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine A, are immunosuppressants that inhibit the release of mast cell mediators and are reserved for severe, resistant cases due to their potential side effects. Cyclosporine A is recommended for patients with severe, refractory cases of CSU who have not responded to both high-dose antihistamines and an IgE inhibitor.

The risk of multi-organ toxicity makes long-term steroid use unacceptable for a chronic condition such as CSU.

Methotrexate, a folate antagonist, is an older immunosuppressant that has been used off-label in urticaria; it is generally not recommended in this setting, as evidence for its efficacy in CSU is generally weaker than that for calcineurin inhibitors and other options.

Intravenous immunoglobulin has demonstrated variable efficacy (eg, improved urticaria activity scores) in CSU, but it is generally not recommended in this setting.

Learn more about CSU management.

The primary goal of treatment is to achieve complete symptom control, which is clinically defined as a UAS7 of 0. This scoring system captures the fluctuating nature of urticaria, ensuring that treatment decisions are based on a weekly average rather than just a single snapshot of the patient's skin on the day of their appointment.

While IgE, D-dimer, and CRP levels play a role in CSU and treatment response, they alone are not primary clinical tools used to define the “target” in a treat-to-target strategy in this setting.

Damian McNamara, MA

 January 20, 2026  

It's been a challenging time for the novel factor XIa inhibitor class of anticoagulants as clinical trials failed for milvexian in acute coronary syndrome and asundexian in atrial fibrillation (AF). But the third time might be the cardiovascular charm, with the announcement of positive top-line results of the OCEANIC-STROKE trial of asundexian.

More details are embargoed until the phase 3 trial of secondary stroke prevention after a noncardioembolic stroke is presented at the upcoming International Stroke Congress.

“What I can tell you is this study met both the efficacy and safety outcomes, so that has a potential to really change how we approach stroke prevention,” said principal investigator Mike Sharma, MD, of the Population Health Research Institute.

“I think this changes things for secondary stroke prevention, offering a whole new direction and long-term therapy,” agreed Clay Johnston, MD, PhD, MPH, co-founder and chief medical officer at Harbor Health in Austin, Texas, and co-chair of the Executive Committee for the ongoing LIBREXIA-STROKE trial of milvexian.

Both asundexian and milvexian are investigational, oral, small molecule factor XIa inhibitors. Most currently prescribed direct oral anticoagulants block factor Xa and while highly efficacious, they still carry a significant risk for bleeding. Hence the continued pursuit of a potentially safer anticoagulant.

The positive and negative OCEANIC trials used the same dose of asundexian: 50 mg daily.

“What I think is ironic is that that dose failed in OCEANIC-AF but looks like it's a hit in OCEANIC-STROKE,” Jeff Weitz, MD, professor of medicine and biochemistry and biomedical sciences at McMaster University and executive director of the Thrombosis and Atherosclerosis Research Institute in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, told Medscape Medical News.

A suboptimal dose of asundexian could be partially responsible for the failure of the OCEANIC-AF study, Robert A. Harrington, MD, Stephen and Suzanne Weiss Dean at Weill Cornell Medicine and Provost for Medical Affairs, Cornell University, New York City, told Medscape Medical News. “That is certainly a hypothesis that is worth considering as the asundexian AF study was halted due to harm — worse outcomes compared with apixaban — while the milvexian study in AF continues.”

Librexia-AF is testing 100 mg milvexian twice a day. Administering milvexian twice daily could lower any disparity in peak to trough concentration differences, Weitz said.

The risk for hemorrhage was lower with asundexian compared with apixaban in OCEANIC-AF. Sharma, who is also director of the Stroke Program at McMaster University and Hamilton Health Sciences in Canada said that if asundexian had demonstrated similar efficacy to apixaban, “that would have been a very attractive option for physicians and patients.”

Extrapolating the dose from AF or deep vein thrombosis studies to other conditions may not be the optimal strategy. Sharma said, “One of the biggest learnings for us was stroke is different: noncardioembolic stroke is different from AF which is different from DVT [deep vein thrombosis].”

“Certainly, it is possible that factor XI/XIa inhibition works in some conditions but not others,” said Harrington, who is involved in studies with milvexian.

Another major trial stopped early was the phase 3 LIBREXIA-ACS, after an interim analysis determined that it was unlikely to meet its primary efficacy endpoint. In that trial, milvexian was dosed at 25 mg twice daily.

No new safety concerns emerged which is why LIBREXIA-STROKE and LIBREXIA-AF are continuing. Results are expected in late 2026, Johnston said.

The disparate findings raise the question of whether the comparator — placebo in the stroke trial and apixaban in AF — made a difference in the OCEANIC studies.

Apixaban is very efficacious in AF, noted Harrington. “So the challenge in developing a new anticoagulant is that the new agent has to be at least as good as a very good stroke prevention anticoagulant.”

Apixaban is the number one medication for AF worldwide, Sharma said. It also could be available as a less expensive generic soon. Two generic forms were FDA approved in 2019, but availability has been delayed due to patent litigation.

Apixaban is a “relatively inexpensive, very effective and safe anticoagulant, so pushing that off the perch is not going to be trivial,” Weitz said. “It's much tougher to go head-to-head with apixaban, and I think in OCEANIC-AF we saw that.”

Even if a factor XI/Xia inhibitor emerges with greater efficacy and/or safety, there is still clinical acceptance, cost, and insurance reimbursement to consider.

If an agent is more effective and safer, Weitz said, “I think that would be one that would get reimbursement, but if it's just noninferior for efficacy and safer, then how much safer does it have to be before the payers say: I'm going to pay 10 times more for this drug than for apixaban?”

Based on the anticipated primary results from OCEANIC-STROKE, asundexian will be “ground-breaking,” Johnston predicted. “It will either be groundbreaking slowly because of a high price or it'll be groundbreaking very quickly in the secondary store prevention world.”

The failure of OCEANIC-AF and LIBREXIA-ACS had coagulation experts very concerned about the factor XI/XIa inhibitor class. “But then boom, OCEANIC-STROKE comes out and it's positive,” Johnston said. “So it does change your whole thinking about what the future might look like.”

Other factor XIa inhibitors in development include the injectable monoclonal antibodies, abelacimab, and REGN7508. The problem with the antibodies Weitz said “it's like a light switch. It's either on or off. And to be on you have to have enough antibody in the circulation to really saturate all the factor 11”. To achieve that, they're given monthly. “If you have a small molecule that could be given once or twice a day, it might be preferable to an injectable,” he said.

Additionally, there are antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNAs that lower factor XI levels.

Abelacimab is being investigated in the LILAC trial of high risk patients with AF deemed unsuitable for oral anticoagulation. “If abelacimab does not reduce the risk of stroke compared with placebo, then they're kind of out of the game,” Weitz said. “So far the independent data monitoring committee hasn't closed down that study.”

Johnston predicted factor XI/Xia inhibitors could eventually prove useful beyond secondary stroke prevention noting that for those with a contraindication for direct oral anticoagulants, “If that risk of hemorrhage goes away, there is a large group of people who could benefit.”

Regarding any additional clinical indications for these inhibitors, Johnston added, “We will only begin to understand in the next year to year and a half.”

Meanwhile, the primary results of the OCEANIC-STROKE trial will be presented at 11:15-11:27 AM central time on February 5, 2026, at the ISC in New Orleans. The methods paper is published online in the European Stroke Journal.

The OCEANIC trials were funded by Bayer HealthCare. The LIBREXIA studies were funded by Bristol Myers Squibb Company. Sharma disclosed consulting for Bayer, Regeneron, and Anthos, research funding for the current study from Bayer paid to his institution, and research funding from BMS and Janssen. Weitz disclosed that he has served as an advisor or consultant for Bayer HealthCare, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Janssen Pharmaceuticals and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. As the Executive Committee Chair for the milvexian research, Harrington's professional effort is covered in a research contract between Janssen and Stanford and a subcontract from Stanford to Weill Cornell. Johnston reported receiving compensation as co-chair of the Executive Committee for the LIBREXIA-STROKE trial.

Women's National Team Will Take Center Stage on Historically Hallowed Ground

Next Tuesday, January 27, the U.S. Women's National Team (USWNT) will play a soccer match against Chile on historically hallowed ground.

UCSB's Harder Stadium was the launch pad for the champions of the first Super Bowl and the first FIFA Women's World Cup.

In 1967, the Green Bay Packers spent a week running drills on the unfrozen turf of UCSB's recently built football stadium before decamping to Los Angeles, where they demolished the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl I.

In 1991, after UCSB had dropped football and Harder Stadium was on its way to becoming “Soccer Heaven,” the USWNT held a training camp and played a game on the West Coast for the first time. On October 19, they dazzled a crowd of 3,274 — one of the largest in the national team's first six years of existence — by scoring a 10-0 victory over the UCSB women's team. 

“It was an awesome event,” said Aaron Heifetz, then a UCSB assistant coach — and a publicist for the program — after watching such legendary players as Carin Jennings, Michelle Akers, April Heinrichs, and Mia Hamm ring up the goals.

A month later, the Americans went to China and fought their way past Sweden, Brazil, Japan, Germany, and Norway to become world champions. Their achievement was not widely known at the time, as U.S. television ignored the tournament. Fans like Heifetz had to scour newspapers to read that Jennings, who had scored 102 goals as a UCSB player from 1983-86, received the Golden Ball award as the outstanding player of the first Women's World Cup.

In 1994, Heifetz landed a job with U.S. Soccer Communications, preparing for the prestigious men's FIFA World Cup. It was a heady time for the 1989 UCSB graduate. He had led a frugal life with Gaucho women's head coach Tad Bobak, who often slept in the office because his year-round home was in Santa Monica.

“I went from UCSB, making $3,000 a year, directly to the World Cup men's team in a World Cup year that we're hosting,” Heifetz said.

A year later, he became press officer for the women's national team. It was a contract job at first, with modest expectations. “Amazingly, in 1995, we set a record for largest domestic attendance for a USWNT match at 6,145 at a high school stadium in Texas,” Heifetz recalled. At the 1995 Women's World Cup, hosted by Sweden, the Americans finished in third place behind Norway and Germany.

There was a change in the outlook after Atlanta hosted the first Olympic women's soccer tournament in 1996. The attendance at the University of Georgia for the gold-medal match — a thrilling 2-1 U.S. victory over China — was 76,481. 

“The Atlanta crowd inspired US Soccer to redo the bid for the 1999 World Cup,” Heifetz said. “We decided to use larger stadiums.”

That led to the iconic 1999 Women's World Cup final at the Rose Bowl — 90,000 spectators, the U.S. and China exchanging forays into overtime, Brianna Scurry's save, and Brandi Chastain's winning penalty kick.

“It was on front pages across the country,” said Heifetz, who was director of communications for the tournament. “It changed women's sports in America forever.”

Every time since, when an Olympics or World Cup comes along, America turns its eyes to the soccer women. They finished as champions in the Games of 2004 (Athens), 2008 (Beijing), 2012 (London), and 2024 (Paris); and the World Cups of 2015 (Canada) and 2019 (France).

That brought their haul to nine global championships. Heifetz has been with the team for eight of them, often visible among the players as they celebrate on the field.

“Germany is next with three [world titles],” Heifetz said. “All the wins are special because it's so freaking hard to do. It takes so many people behind the scenes, so many things that have to go right. It's the championship of the freaking world.”

The Paris Olympics title was remarkable, Heifetz said, coming as it did after the 2023 World Cup in New Zealand, where an aging USWNT was knocked out in the Round of 16. With a young roster and a new coach, Emma Hayes, the Americans went 6-0 and outscored their opponents, 12-2.

“That was one of the most incredible achievements in women's soccer history,” Heifetz said. “Not only was the team down emotionally and soccer-wise, Emma came in, and in her 10th game won the Olympic gold medal.”

With the 10th FIFA Women's World Cup coming in 2027 in Brazil, this is a significant year of preparation for the USWNT. While training in Southern California, they will face off against Paraguay on Saturday in Carson before coming to Santa Barbara for their first match here since 1991. The friendly against Chile will also be their first international match here. 

Heifetz will not have to stir up interest as urgently as he did 35 years ago. The USWNT roster includes Trinity Rodman, a star in Paris, and many stars-in-the-making. “They want to show Emma, hey, when you name your top 26, I should be there,” Heifetz said.

Watching from across the country (the match will be televised on TBS) will be Carin Jennings-Gabarra, who would have become a household name for her performance in the 1991 World Cup if women's soccer had the notoriety it does now.

The former Gaucho has coached women's soccer at the U.S. Naval Academy for the past 33 years. Her journey started as an unstoppable youth player in Southern California and reached maturity in college. In a recent telephone interview, Jennings-Gabarra said, “The basis for my future success, skills, leadership, character was all that I learned on and off the soccer field at UCSB.”

As a member of the national team during its early years, she said, “I was just fighting to get a jersey to fit me, to get there safely when we go on trips. Today, things are different, the styles of coaching, strength coaches, nutritionists, technological stuff.

“We had high expectations for ourselves as a team,” she continued. “That's what drove us. We had to show you. I don't believe in comparing teams, but one thing about our national team [is that] our mentality never wavers. It cares deeply.”

She was excited to return to Harder Stadium in 1991, Jennings-Gabarra said, and next week, “I know the crowd will be fantastic and the players will enjoy being there.”

Mic'd Up: The former USMNT striker talked about the pre-World Cup mindset, the U.S. striker situation and why Mexico will always be the team under the most pressure.

There was a debate going around on social media recently, and, if you know Herculez Gomez, you know he's not one to shy away from debate. The discussion centered around Weston McKennie and his place among the U.S. men's national team's all-time great midfielders. In some ways, it was bigger than that; it was about where this USMNT group currently stands when compared to their predecessors, and where they might stand when all of this is said and done.

Gomez, of course, has his thoughts. A former USMNT player himself, Gomez played alongside some of the biggest names in American soccer history. He grew up idolizing some and, in this post-playing career phase, he's covered some, too, as the USMNT have tried to take things to new heights. Have they, though? Right now, heading into the 2026 World Cup, Gomez has some thoughts about where they stand.

""Now, I'm not trying to be unfair, because let it unfold and let's see what they do,"" he tells GOAL. ""When their career is finished, it's easier to gauge. I'm not talking club career, because Michael Bradley didn't have 200 games for Juventus, right? Like Weston McKennie, that's very different. These players today, in my opinion, have already surpassed them in their club career-wise. But when we talk about U.S. Men's National team careers? We do have to separate the two. Christian [Pulisic] is an exception to the rule, so I try not to include him but, the rest of the lot, I'm sorry, but if you remove Mexico [in the 2021 and 2024 Nations League Finals] from the equation, what do we have?""

It's why the 2026 World Cup is so vital. For the current generation of USMNT stars, legacies will be defined by this World Cup. Fairly or unfairly, this is the chance for players like Pulisic, McKennie and Tyler Adams to earn their places among the very best American soccer has ever seen. Their predecessors all had moments; this is theirs to seize, and Gomez is eager to see them seize it.

But that's not the only thing on Gomez's mind. The former striker, who now works for ESPN, talked about his own World Cup experience, the state of the USMNT striker pool and the pressure on the three host nations in the latest edition of Mic'd Up, a recurring feature in which GOAL taps into the perspective of analysts, announcers, and other pundits on the state of soccer in the U.S. and abroad. 

NOTE: This interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.

GOAL: We're just a few months out from the World Cup, and you're someone who knows exactly what that's like as a player. You were not someone whose spot was ever guaranteed with the USMNT. What were those weeks and months leading up to the World Cup like? How did you approach it, knowing what was on the horizon?

GOMEZ: I've been on both ends of the spectrum because, in 2010, I wasn't part of a single camp, so I didn't play a single minute in the lead-up to that World Cup. I did well with Puebla six months before the World Cup and won a goal-scoring title. Then I was invited to the 30-man camp and eventually earned my place there. My whole mantra or mindset was ""house money"". It was just have fun, do your best, and what will be will be, because I'm already further than I should have been. That's your mindset, and then you play free.

When the last seven were cut from that camp, I kind of felt like I didn't belong, but I just had to have fun and prove that I belonged, and what would happen, would happen. 

Then in 2014, I had a string of like 14 games where I was starting for Jurgen [Klinsmann], and then I had a knee injury, which derailed not only my season at my new club team, but probably my career. I was out of the picture, but there was always this thing on the back of my mind where I wanted to get back to the national team. Time was against me, and I needed to prove something. It was a much different pressure, so I understand both mindsets, both sides, and how one could maybe deal with it. But the first go around, there was no pressure, and the second go around, there was pressure because I knew that I could. If I were fit, I could get it back there because the coach had confidence in me, but I could just never prove my fitness.

GOAL: There's been this debate recently about how this U.S. generation stacks up with prior ones. 'Are these players the best at their positions?' 'Is Weston McKennie better than Tab Ramos because he's starred at Juventus?' Obviously, things have changed for the better. These players are earning chances to play at the best clubs, which wasn't always the case previously. Christian Pulisic is the face of Milan, which, for anyone who grew up in a certain era, is crazy to say. Has there been a big step forward, though? What does it mean to have these guys playing at that level, and what does that mean when you put it through the lens of American soccer's past and future?

GOMEZ: Things definitely have changed. I'll take Mexico into consideration. Mexican players have had more success at the world level than American players. Hugo Sanchez, Rafa Marquez, and Chicharito at Manchester United - they've had more of those players. Costa Rica has had more of those players, like Keylor Navas. El Salvador had El Magico Gonzalez. The U.S. has never had that type of player until Christian Pulisic, so that's great, but all of Mexico's previous players opened the door and it doesn't mean that more players come through it. 

We see more American players coming through it now because of the Christian Pulisics and the Weston McKennies, because these players have proven that they can do it and also the market is more viable for the American player than it is maybe for the Mexican player, for lots of reasons. There are players now who are abroad and ply their trade consistently, and that is an amazing feat. It is no small thing that Christian Pulisic is the face of one of the biggest global footballing brands in the history of the game.

That is one thing. The national team is another. Weston McKennie is being labeled in Doug McIntyre's tweet as the best U.S. midfielder of all time. We have to separate a club career from the national team. Christian, I think, is in a league of his own, and is the exception to the rule because I firmly believe that, when it's all said and done, we will consider him the best American player, club and country, ever, but he's got a long way to go to catch Clint Dempsey and Landon Donovan in goals [with the national team] and he's got an even longer way to go to catch Landon Donovan in assists. He also hasn't had the moments in multiple World Cups and Confederation Cups and big wins. For this generation of players, if you take Mexico out of the equation, the worst generation of Mexican footballers that I've ever seen, and I know because I've been part of that world and I cover that world. If you take these guys away from the equation, their crowning moment was a draw versus England at a World Cup? 

Tab Ramos was your favorite American footballer's favorite footballer. He and Claudio Reyna, who still has the best run the U.S. has ever had in the modern era. He was labeled as one of the best 16 players at the World Cup! You can go back to Michael Bradley and the 160 games that he played for his country, him captaining his country, playing at a World Cup, scoring at the Azteca. There are players of the past with big-time moments that this generation just hasn't had yet. 

GOAL: You know better than most that a striker's spot can fickle. One run of goals can get you right into the picture, and one dry spell could be the end of your USMNT hopes. Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi seem to be at the top of that, with guys like Haji Wright, Patrick Agyemang and Josh Sargent behind them, but even someone like Brandon Vazquez could get back into it if he can prove his fitness. Having had your own experience in that spot, how do you look at the striker position? 

Gomez: I don't think Ricardo Pepi is safe. This is very much like Jozy Altidore in 2010 where he was the only clear-cut nine. You had other guys in the picture in that camp, like a Brian Ching or Eddie Johnson, I believe Jeff Cunningham was there as well. Then you had Edson Buddle, myself, Robbie Findley in that cycle, so there is no clear-cut nine.

You're talking about a player [in Pepi] who, in my mind, has done well and has earned equity within the USMNT over the last seven years, but he didn't go to the last World Cup, and he had major equity then, too! He saved Gregg Berhalter's job and, besides Christian Pulisic, was the leading scorer of the team. I'm not talking about, he didn't start at the World Cup; he didn't even go! It was Josh Sargent, Haji Wright, and Jesus Ferreira. He's kind of there again because there's some equity that he's proven, but the only clear-cut nine right now, I believe, in the eyes of Mauricio Pochettino is Folarin Balogun.

Wright, Pepi, Agyemang - that's, right now, the core striker group. I think there is no clear pecking order now. If you want to include a Brandon Vasquez, who's been nowhere near the picture, or a Darrell Dike or a Josh Sargent - those are guys who are very much so on the outside looking in, but it's the World Cup, and we've seen crazy things happen. 

I think we've seen this in the past, that you have to have certain profiles when it comes to players and you have to have a player that could be multifunctional, offer something different, a player that can play different positions, because there are so many games and it's a reduced tournament and injuries can happen....Pochettino is going to think they're not going to always be on the front foot, or maybe they'll be down in a game and maybe you need somebody that could either create something by himself or be able to handle something in a moment of panic, like a ball into the box. Maybe the intangibles of size and presence come into play.

GOAL: All of the World Cup hosts are under pressure, right? There's always pressure on Mexico. The U.S. wants to take the sport a step further. Canada wants to prove it's a soccer country to the rest of the world. Who is under the most pressure to perform, though?

Gomez: It's not a debate: it's Mexico. Listen, I work at least five days a week for ESPN and I'm on a show that's got a two-hour window Monday to Friday. If Mexico bows out of the 2026 World Cup in the group stage, we're going to be talking about it for almost a month every single day, and that's just us. In Mexico, it'll be every walk of life. Every content creator will be talking about this failure. These players will not be able to go out. They will be labeled a national humiliation and a failure. People will lose jobs, the economy will take a hit. Their football will be taken aback in development, not one generation, but maybe more. It would be a collision course that Mexico would never want to see and it would be trajectory-altering for them.

If the U.S. bows out of the group phase here, we'll talk about it for a while. I'll talk about it on my podcast. Maybe it makes a SportsCenter...A couple weeks later, it's done. The NFL comes back. Christian Pulisic is back with Milan. Maybe there's a move or two from one of these players, and that's it. We saw it with the 2018 World Cup. 

This is a footballing country. I repeat: the U.S. is a massive footballing country. That's why these countries and why these teams from different countries come and participate in the United States. That's why there's all this money to bring soccer to the United States. We really consume it in this country, and we are a footballing country; we're just not necessarily a U.S. Men's National Team country, and that is the difference. There is no debate. It will be Mexico, yep.

GOAL: We've recently seen a new wave of American players try their hand at Liga MX and, while that has happened before, it has been different this time around. You've seen younger Mexican-American players head to Mexico to really kickstart their careers, and you've also seen Americans get the chance at Chivas, which has never happened before. What do you make of all of it? As someone who went to Liga MX, how valuable can that leap be?

Gomez: Times have changed a bit. The one constant is, especially for a club like Chivas, that those players are valuable because of their self-imposed regulations of Mexican players only. The lack of opportunities or development in Mexico as a whole today give these players on the other side, the US side, a distinct advantage. There's also the money factor. You're talking to a guy that by the time I came to Mexico, when I was 26 or 27, I had won three titles in the States, two MLS cups and an Open Cup. I played, I think, in five finals and had debuted for the national team in a Copa America. I think the most I made was $52,000 in a calendar year. Then I go to Mexico, and 2010 was a year that changed my life because you break seven figures. It's different, very different. 

Yes, the amount of money but the attention is, too, and it just, if anything, opened my eyes to football and the rest of the world. These players are in a situation where that attention is going to bring growth in a good way or a bad way. You learn the good way, or you learn the bad way. I think there is a development that comes with it, so I think it's beneficial to these players. 

Now you can say they're getting a chance, but they have gotten their chance at the club level, but maybe they're not being taken seriously enough or earning their place on the national team level. This could be a stepping stone for them, because I could tell you the tug and pull as a dual national, the love and appreciation for two different countries, maybe they represent Mexico at a bigger stage. That, to me, is one of the most beautiful things I've ever done: representing my country at a World Cup, experiencing a World Cup. So if these players can achieve something like that, where they're maybe valued more on the other side, it's fair game.

Mic'd Up: The former USMNT striker talked about the pre-World Cup mindset, the U.S. striker situation and why Mexico will always be the team under the most pressure.

There was a debate going around on social media recently, and, if you know Herculez Gomez, you know he's not one to shy away from debate. The discussion centered around Weston McKennie and his place among the U.S. men's national team's all-time great midfielders. In some ways, it was bigger than that; it was about where this USMNT group currently stands when compared to their predecessors, and where they might stand when all of this is said and done.

Gomez, of course, has his thoughts. A former USMNT player himself, Gomez played alongside some of the biggest names in American soccer history. He grew up idolizing some and, in this post-playing career phase, he's covered some, too, as the USMNT have tried to take things to new heights. Have they, though? Right now, heading into the 2026 World Cup, Gomez has some thoughts about where they stand.

""Now, I'm not trying to be unfair, because let it unfold and let's see what they do,"" he tells GOAL. ""When their career is finished, it's easier to gauge. I'm not talking club career, because Michael Bradley didn't have 200 games for Juventus, right? Like Weston McKennie, that's very different. These players today, in my opinion, have already surpassed them in their club career-wise. But when we talk about U.S. Men's National team careers? We do have to separate the two. Christian [Pulisic] is an exception to the rule, so I try not to include him but, the rest of the lot, I'm sorry, but if you remove Mexico [in the 2021 and 2024 Nations League Finals] from the equation, what do we have?""

It's why the 2026 World Cup is so vital. For the current generation of USMNT stars, legacies will be defined by this World Cup. Fairly or unfairly, this is the chance for players like Pulisic, McKennie and Tyler Adams to earn their places among the very best American soccer has ever seen. Their predecessors all had moments; this is theirs to seize, and Gomez is eager to see them seize it.

But that's not the only thing on Gomez's mind. The former striker, who now works for ESPN, talked about his own World Cup experience, the state of the USMNT striker pool and the pressure on the three host nations in the latest edition of Mic'd Up, a recurring feature in which GOAL taps into the perspective of analysts, announcers, and other pundits on the state of soccer in the U.S. and abroad. 

NOTE: This interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.

GOAL: We're just a few months out from the World Cup, and you're someone who knows exactly what that's like as a player. You were not someone whose spot was ever guaranteed with the USMNT. What were those weeks and months leading up to the World Cup like? How did you approach it, knowing what was on the horizon?

GOMEZ: I've been on both ends of the spectrum because, in 2010, I wasn't part of a single camp, so I didn't play a single minute in the lead-up to that World Cup. I did well with Puebla six months before the World Cup and won a goal-scoring title. Then I was invited to the 30-man camp and eventually earned my place there. My whole mantra or mindset was ""house money"". It was just have fun, do your best, and what will be will be, because I'm already further than I should have been. That's your mindset, and then you play free.

When the last seven were cut from that camp, I kind of felt like I didn't belong, but I just had to have fun and prove that I belonged, and what would happen, would happen. 

Then in 2014, I had a string of like 14 games where I was starting for Jurgen [Klinsmann], and then I had a knee injury, which derailed not only my season at my new club team, but probably my career. I was out of the picture, but there was always this thing on the back of my mind where I wanted to get back to the national team. Time was against me, and I needed to prove something. It was a much different pressure, so I understand both mindsets, both sides, and how one could maybe deal with it. But the first go around, there was no pressure, and the second go around, there was pressure because I knew that I could. If I were fit, I could get it back there because the coach had confidence in me, but I could just never prove my fitness.

GOAL: There's been this debate recently about how this U.S. generation stacks up with prior ones. 'Are these players the best at their positions?' 'Is Weston McKennie better than Tab Ramos because he's starred at Juventus?' Obviously, things have changed for the better. These players are earning chances to play at the best clubs, which wasn't always the case previously. Christian Pulisic is the face of Milan, which, for anyone who grew up in a certain era, is crazy to say. Has there been a big step forward, though? What does it mean to have these guys playing at that level, and what does that mean when you put it through the lens of American soccer's past and future?

GOMEZ: Things definitely have changed. I'll take Mexico into consideration. Mexican players have had more success at the world level than American players. Hugo Sanchez, Rafa Marquez, and Chicharito at Manchester United - they've had more of those players. Costa Rica has had more of those players, like Keylor Navas. El Salvador had El Magico Gonzalez. The U.S. has never had that type of player until Christian Pulisic, so that's great, but all of Mexico's previous players opened the door and it doesn't mean that more players come through it. 

We see more American players coming through it now because of the Christian Pulisics and the Weston McKennies, because these players have proven that they can do it and also the market is more viable for the American player than it is maybe for the Mexican player, for lots of reasons. There are players now who are abroad and ply their trade consistently, and that is an amazing feat. It is no small thing that Christian Pulisic is the face of one of the biggest global footballing brands in the history of the game.

That is one thing. The national team is another. Weston McKennie is being labeled in Doug McIntyre's tweet as the best U.S. midfielder of all time. We have to separate a club career from the national team. Christian, I think, is in a league of his own, and is the exception to the rule because I firmly believe that, when it's all said and done, we will consider him the best American player, club and country, ever, but he's got a long way to go to catch Clint Dempsey and Landon Donovan in goals [with the national team] and he's got an even longer way to go to catch Landon Donovan in assists. He also hasn't had the moments in multiple World Cups and Confederation Cups and big wins. For this generation of players, if you take Mexico out of the equation, the worst generation of Mexican footballers that I've ever seen, and I know because I've been part of that world and I cover that world. If you take these guys away from the equation, their crowning moment was a draw versus England at a World Cup? 

Tab Ramos was your favorite American footballer's favorite footballer. He and Claudio Reyna, who still has the best run the U.S. has ever had in the modern era. He was labeled as one of the best 16 players at the World Cup! You can go back to Michael Bradley and the 160 games that he played for his country, him captaining his country, playing at a World Cup, scoring at the Azteca. There are players of the past with big-time moments that this generation just hasn't had yet. 

GOAL: You know better than most that a striker's spot can fickle. One run of goals can get you right into the picture, and one dry spell could be the end of your USMNT hopes. Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi seem to be at the top of that, with guys like Haji Wright, Patrick Agyemang and Josh Sargent behind them, but even someone like Brandon Vazquez could get back into it if he can prove his fitness. Having had your own experience in that spot, how do you look at the striker position? 

Gomez: I don't think Ricardo Pepi is safe. This is very much like Jozy Altidore in 2010 where he was the only clear-cut nine. You had other guys in the picture in that camp, like a Brian Ching or Eddie Johnson, I believe Jeff Cunningham was there as well. Then you had Edson Buddle, myself, Robbie Findley in that cycle, so there is no clear-cut nine.

You're talking about a player [in Pepi] who, in my mind, has done well and has earned equity within the USMNT over the last seven years, but he didn't go to the last World Cup, and he had major equity then, too! He saved Gregg Berhalter's job and, besides Christian Pulisic, was the leading scorer of the team. I'm not talking about, he didn't start at the World Cup; he didn't even go! It was Josh Sargent, Haji Wright, and Jesus Ferreira. He's kind of there again because there's some equity that he's proven, but the only clear-cut nine right now, I believe, in the eyes of Mauricio Pochettino is Folarin Balogun.

Wright, Pepi, Agyemang - that's, right now, the core striker group. I think there is no clear pecking order now. If you want to include a Brandon Vasquez, who's been nowhere near the picture, or a Darrell Dike or a Josh Sargent - those are guys who are very much so on the outside looking in, but it's the World Cup, and we've seen crazy things happen. 

I think we've seen this in the past, that you have to have certain profiles when it comes to players and you have to have a player that could be multifunctional, offer something different, a player that can play different positions, because there are so many games and it's a reduced tournament and injuries can happen....Pochettino is going to think they're not going to always be on the front foot, or maybe they'll be down in a game and maybe you need somebody that could either create something by himself or be able to handle something in a moment of panic, like a ball into the box. Maybe the intangibles of size and presence come into play.

GOAL: All of the World Cup hosts are under pressure, right? There's always pressure on Mexico. The U.S. wants to take the sport a step further. Canada wants to prove it's a soccer country to the rest of the world. Who is under the most pressure to perform, though?

It would be a collision course that Mexico would never want to see and it would be trajectory-altering for them.

If the U.S. bows out of the group phase here, we'll talk about it for a while. I'll talk about it on my podcast. Maybe it makes a SportsCenter...A couple weeks later, it's done. The NFL comes back.

You've seen younger Mexican-American players head to Mexico to really kickstart their careers, and you've also seen Americans get the chance at Chivas, which has never happened before. What do you make of all of it? As someone who went to Liga MX, how valuable can that leap be?

Gomez: Times have changed a bit. The one constant is, especially for a club like Chivas, that those players are valuable because of their self-imposed regulations of Mexican players only. The lack of opportunities or development in Mexico as a whole today give these players on the other side, the US side, a distinct advantage. There's also the money factor. You're talking to a guy that by the time I came to Mexico, when I was 26 or 27, I had won three titles in the States, two MLS cups and an Open Cup. I played, I think, in five finals and had debuted for the national team in a Copa America. I think the most I made was $52,000 in a calendar year. Then I go to Mexico, and 2010 was a year that changed my life because you break seven figures. It's different, very different. 

Yes, the amount of money but the attention is, too, and it just, if anything, opened my eyes to football and the rest of the world. These players are in a situation where that attention is going to bring growth in a good way or a bad way. You learn the good way, or you learn the bad way. I think there is a development that comes with it, so I think it's beneficial to these players. 

Now you can say they're getting a chance, but they have gotten their chance at the club level, but maybe they're not being taken seriously enough or earning their place on the national team level. This could be a stepping stone for them, because I could tell you the tug and pull as a dual national, the love and appreciation for two different countries, maybe they represent Mexico at a bigger stage. That, to me, is one of the most beautiful things I've ever done: representing my country at a World Cup, experiencing a World Cup. So if these players can achieve something like that, where they're maybe valued more on the other side, it's fair game.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","How did David Luiz end up at Pafos? The story of Chelsea cult hero's surprise late career foray in Cyprus ahead of return to Stamford Bridge in the Champions League","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/how-david-luiz-pafos-chelsea-cult-hero-surprise-late-career-cyprus-return-stamford-bridge-champions-league/blta0998bcb352a87e5","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 08:00:00 GMT","

Before last season, very few casual fans would have been aware of Pafos FC's existence. The Cypriot outfit played in Europe for the first time in their 11-year history, reaching the last 16 of the Conference League, and followed up that impressive run by clinching their maiden league title. The latter achievement earned Pafos a spot in the Champions League qualifying rounds, and helped attract one of the most famous footballers of his generation.

David Luiz joined the club at the start of August on a two-year contract, sealing his return to European football after four years back in his home country, Brazil. It was an unexpected late-career move for the 38-year-old, who Pafos described as a ""true titan of modern football"" in their official transfer announcement, and he is now looking forward to an even more unlikely homecoming at Chelsea.

Pafos will travel to Stamford Bridge to take on the Blues in the Champions League on Wednesday, and Luiz is sure to receive a hero's welcome if he is able to prove his fitness after suffering an injury at the weekend. The defender is a beloved figure among the Chelsea faithful, despite his move to London rivals Arsenal in 2019, having helped the club win six trophies, including the Premier League and Champions League, across two spells.

Regardless of the final result, it promises to be a memorable occasion for both Luiz and Pafos, whose rapid rise from complete anonymity to club football's elite stage has been nothing short of remarkable. Certainly, no one would have predicted it when AEK Kouklia and AEP Paphos initially merged to create Pafos FC back in 2014, and they were entered into Cyprus' second tier.

Pafos have been a fixture in the top-flight since being taken over by Russian businessman and former Portsmouth owner Roman Dubov in 2017, and have gone through a host of different managers, including Real Madrid icon Michel Salgado and ex-Manchester United man Henning Berg. But their real success began after the appointment of Juan Carlos Carcedo in 2023.

The Spanish coach, who once served as Unai Emery's assistant at Arsenal, delivered Pafos' first piece of silverware, the Cypriot Cup, in his debut season, and has since turned them into the country's No.1 team. With Luiz now helping to boost their profile even further, the future looks bright. However, one question lingers: how on earth did he end up at Pafos in the first place?

Luiz won the third FA Cup of his career at Arsenal, and became a key player early in Mikel Arteta's tenure, racking up 73 appearances across all competitions. However, a hamstring injury cut short his 2020-21 campaign, and the Gunners decided not to renew the then-34-year-old's contract, instead seeking to strengthen the heart of the defence with younger alternatives.

The former Benfica and Paris Saint-Germain star eventually found a new club in September 2021, with Flamengo snapping him up on a free transfer. Luiz turned down other offers to join the Brazilian giants, as he revealed at his presentation.

""I had a few different scenarios where I could have picked a quieter, more peaceful life, but I like to follow my heart,"" he explained. ""This is another big challenge in my life. I felt during my tour that this is what I always wanted, it gives me the air I breathe. If the voice of the people is the voice of God, then the country called out to me and here I am.""

In typical fashion, Luiz rose to that ""big challenge"", quickly nailing down a starting role despite his late-season arrival. Flamengo did, however, endure a heartbreaking end to the campaign, finishing second in the Brazilian Serie A before suffering a painful 2-1 defeat to Palmeiras after extra-time in the Copa Libertadores final, with Luiz playing the full 120 minutes.

Flamengo dropped to fifth in the league table the following season, but won the Copa do Brasil and went one better in the Copa Libertadores, beating Athletico Paranaense 1-0 in the final. Luiz was the driving force behind their success, and became only the 14th player ever to win the Copa Libertadores and Champions League, earning a contract extension in the process.

""Flamengo is the pinnacle of emotions! It's living life on the edge. Always wondering 'what's going to happen?' But it's also the fulfilment of most Brazilians,"" Luiz said in a subsequent interview with Globo Esporte. ""It's one of the best chapters of my life, one of the best things football has to offer. Did I imagine it? I don't know. Maybe I didn't imagine it would be so special and affect me as much as it does today. It gives me pleasure to say that it's a club that's in my heart!""

Luiz got the chance to compete in the Club World Cup again at the start of the 2023 campaign, as the 2022 tournament was pushed to February so it wouldn't clash with the international World Cup in Qatar. Flamengo failed to set up a blockbuster final clash with Real Madrid, though, falling to a shock 3-2 loss against Al-Hilal in the semis.

Disappointment ended up being the theme of their season as Flamengo fell short in all the major competitions, but Luiz did finally net his first goal for the club in a 3-2 league win over Bahia.

There were also real signs that Luiz's body was starting to fail him during the 2023 campaign. Indeed, he missed Flamengo's final 11 league fixtures after suffering a severely sprained ankle during the team's 2-0 win away at Cruzeiro, with a buggy used to safely transfer the ex-Chelsea star from the field as he broke down in tears. 

However, Flamengo still decided to renew Luiz's contract for one more year, and were vindicated in the early stages of the 2024 season. Luiz played a part in Flamengo's run to the Campeonato Carioca crown, and though persistent struggles with his ankle forced then-manager Tite to keep him on the bench for Flamengo's opening Serie A games, the veteran defender proved his worth upon returning to full fitness.

He was among the scorers in his first game back in the starting XI, a 6-1 league rout of Vasco da Gama, and it was a goal to put right up there with the very best of his career: Luiz pulled away from his marker during a corner delivery before firing a first-time volley into the net, prompting wild celebrations involving the majority of his team-mates. The superb strike capped a colossal overall display from Luiz, who also won five of his six aerial duels while posting a 95 percent pass completion rate.

Luiz became a regular again after that, but consistency proved elusive for Flamengo, and ex-Brazil boss Tite was sacked in September after they were knocked out of the Copa Libertadores by Penarol at the quarter-final stage. The club then turned to Filipe Luis, another former Chelsea star who finished his playing career at Flamengo - an appointment which spelled the beginning of the end for Luiz's spell at the Maracana.

Flamengo went on to win the Copa do Brasil again under Luis, but Luiz was an unused substitute in their semi-final victory over Corinthians, and only played one minute across the two legs of their final triumph against Atletico Mineiro. Luiz did start four of Flamengo's final league matches in 2024, but his Achilles was still causing him pain, which left the club in a bind regarding his future.

On December 22, 2024, Luiz's departure was officially announced on social media, but he did not take kindly to the news, claiming he had been blindsided in an explosive outburst to the press. 

""If I didn't have Instagram, social media, maybe I wouldn't even know today (about the non-renewal),"" he said. ""So, I think it wasn't good, and then I stop to think, there are only two ways: either it was intentional or it was amateurish.""

Luiz was only a free agent for a month, though. Fortaleza handed him a two-year deal at the end of the winter transfer window, prolonging his stay in the Brazilian top flight. He was subsequently mobbed by fans upon his arrival, and said the club had ""captured my heart"", before immediately targeting silverware at the Ceara-based club. 

""The foundation is here. Everything is here. The cake is almost ready,"" Luiz said at his official unveiling. ""All that's missing is the whipped cream and the cherry on top.""

Fortaleza finished the 2024 Serie A season in fourth, just one place behind Flamengo, to qualify for the Copa Libertadores for the first time ever. They were not able to build on that success with Luiz on the books, though.

It quickly became obvious that Luiz was a club signing, not one that head coach Juan Pablo Vojvoda had pushed for, and he found himself in and out of the team, despite Fortaleza's form falling off a cliff. When Luiz picked up a thigh injury in early July, the writing was on the wall.

On August 1, the defender's contract was terminated by mutual consent, at which stage he had already reached an agreement to join Pafos. After the free transfer went through, Luiz explained why his seven-month spell at Fortaleza went so badly, hinting at a rift with Vojvoda.

""Unfortunately, it didn't happen the way I wanted,"" he said in an interview with Lance. ""There were some things, but it wasn't the way I envisioned, which is also part of football. I played very little, but I understood that the best way to respect the club was to move on to another challenge, because it hadn't worked out the way we expected. I still have the same respect for Vojvoda, even though we think about football in different ways.""

Luiz avoided the indignation of relegation by abandoning Fortaleza early, as they slumped to 18th in the table, but still made unwanted headlines due to off-field legal issues. The centre-back, who is engaged to long-time partner Bruna Loureiro, was accused of threatening a Brazilian social worker with whom he was alleged to be having an affair. Luiz denied all of the allegations, and Ceara police decided not to indict him after an investigation, as per Globo.

Luiz has found happiness again in Cyprus, and is on course to end his glittering career with a bang. Against all the odds, the Cypriot champions dispatched Maccabi Tel-Aviv, Dynamo Kyiv and Red Star Belgrade in Champions League qualifying to reach the league phase, and were rewarded with a dream fixtures against Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Juventus, Villarreal and Monaco, with fellow newcomers Kairat Almaty, Olympiacos and Slavia Prague completing their list of opponents. Luiz wasn't fit enough to play in qualifying, but he was present for the celebrations after the win over Red Star.

""Everybody was in ecstasy,"" Luiz told BBC Sport. ""Nobody expected us to be in the Champions League this season. I'm very happy to be here because I can see this feeling, with everybody's hunger, to do something great.""

He has since become a mainstay in Carcedo's team, aiding Pafos's latest tilt at the Cypriot title, but they have fallen short of greatness on Europe's elite stage. Pafos have only amassed six points from their opening six Champions League fixtures, losing 5-1 at home to Bayern and 2-0 away at Juventus. They were also held to disappointing stalemates on the road at Olympiacos and Kairat, but all hope is not lost just yet.

On matchday four, Pafos pulled off one of the upsets of the tournament, beating La Liga high-flyers Villarreal 1-0 at the Stelios Kyriakides Stadium, and followed that up with a hard-fought 2-2 draw against Monaco at the Stade Louis II. The Cypriot champions twice battled back from a deficit, and Luiz bagged the pick of the goals, brilliantly heading into the top corner after rising highest to meet an in-swinging set-piece.

That was his first Champions League goal since 2017, and made him the second-oldest scorer in the competition's history behind Real Madrid icon Pepe. Luiz has lost much of his mobility, but still has a penchant for the spectacular, and will be highly motivated to deliver more heroics against his old club, Chelsea.

""I'm going to play against Chelsea with my heart totally full of energy,"" he vowed to the BBC. Pafos can still make the knockouts if they get a positive result at the Bridge and in their final league-phase match against Slavia, and if Luiz is true to his word, anything is possible.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Palestinian children playing soccer at the Aida Refugee Camp's football pitch in the West Bank in December Aida Youth Center

FIFA president Gianni Infantino and his UEFA counterpart Aleksandr Ceferin have intervened to save a local soccer pitch in the West Bank from destruction, according to multiple sources briefed on the discussions.

The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) had been scheduled to demolish the pitch this week, telling local residents of the Aida refugee camp that it was “illegally” constructed alongside a security fence. Local campaigners said that 250 children use the pitch each week.

However, sources confirmed that the planned demolition has now been suspended by the IDF after negotiations, with the final decision now resting with the Israeli government. The IDF and Israeli government did not respond to a request for comment.

Sources said Infantino's personal office raised the issue with the Swiss government and the Israel Football Association (IFA), with widespread international protests against the planned demolition taking place over the past month. These sources described how negotiations involving Swiss MPs resulted in Simon Geisbuhler, the Swiss ambassador to Israel, petitioning the Israeli government directly to save the pitch.

FIFA has been approached for comment.

Concurrently, UEFA president Ceferin held several meetings with the IFA. The first of these took place last Monday, on January 12, with a follow-up call scheduled for three days later.

A UEFA spokesperson told The Athletic: “We can confirm that the UEFA President has been in contact with the IFA regarding the preservation of a football pitch in a refugee camp in the West Bank. We take the opportunity to thank the president of the (Israeli) Federation, Moshe Zuares, for his efforts to help protect the site from demolition.

“We hope the pitch can continue to serve the local community as a safe space for children and youth.”

“This is a huge success for the campaign,” Mohammad Abusrour, director of the youth centre at the Aida pitch, told The Athletic. “But we are still concerned about what could be the final political decision of the matter. We still haven't received official confirmation from the army.

“This is the only public space for the children and the refugees in the area to play. It's a great opportunity for us to exercise, to train, to meet with each other. You can't imagine the influence of this place — it offers the possibility of a normal, healthy life.

“I'm glad that Ceferin and Infantino helped, I'm happy about that, but I'd like to see more action from their side — to confirm that it is saved.”

Though Infantino has previously avoided directly intervening in the region, stating that FIFA “cannot solve political problems”, Ceferin himself has taken a more active role in the conflict.

The Athletic reported in December that senior figures at UEFA had held meetings with the leaders of a pro-Palestinian campaign to discuss the circumstances around a potential ban of Israel from international competition.

According to people briefed on the governing body's internal decision-making, Ceferin also personally pushed for a UEFA banner to be displayed at August's Super Cup final which read: “Stop killing children; Stop killing civilians”. Two Gazan refugee children were also involved in the medal ceremony. Ceferin also explored the prospect of meeting with Richard Falk, a former UN special rapporteur in the Palestinian territories, and a key advisor of the Game Over Israel campaign.

Separately, Swiss MPs were due to vote on Tuesday over whether to revoke UEFA's tax exemption in the country, with the motion accusing the body of “continu(ing) to recognise clubs in illegally occupied territories (in the West Bank).” That vote has now been delayed until January 27.

Zohran Mamdani and U.S. President Donald Trump shake hands during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House Yuri Gripas / Abaca / Bloomberg via Getty Images

The Athletic has live coverage of the latest news for the 2026 World Cup. 

The New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani, said he intends to raise the impact of travel bans on this summer's FIFA World Cup with U.S. President Donald Trump, saying it is “something (he) hopes will change” ahead of the tournament.

On Sunday, Mamdani hosted a Manhattan watch party for the Africa Cup of Nations final between Morocco and Senegal, taking over New York City Surrogate's Court for fans to congregate and watch the game, which was eventually won in controversial circumstances by Senegal.

Since Trump returned to power last January, the U.S. has imposed a string of travel bans on nationals from designated countries, including four countries (Senegal, Ivory Coast, Iran, and Haiti) that have qualified for the 48-team World Cup. The tournament will take place across the U.S., Canada and Mexico this summer.

A December proclamation by Trump suspended entry into the U.S. for nationals of Ivory Coast and Senegal, both as immigrants and non-immigrants, including in the visitor category for business and tourism, with the administration citing overstay rates from nationals from the two countries. Exemptions are carved out for players, coaching teams, federation officials, and immediate relatives of players, but not for fans.

In June, Trump signed off on another travel ban in which Haiti and Iran were among 12 countries impacted, a step Trump described as essential to “protect the national security and national interest of the United States and its people.”

In November, the Trump administration took a step towards facilitating global access for fans when it announced the creation of the FIFA PASS. However, the FIFA PASS is not a visa in itself; it merely provides a prioritized visa appointment system for those who have purchased tickets to attend the tournament. Applicants will still face the same rigorous security and screening processes, and there has been no indication that nationals of countries facing travel bans will be able to enter by buying a FIFA ticket.

On Sunday, members of New York City's Senegalese diaspora were brought together by Mamdani in one of the city's most iconic courthouses, which was built 119 years ago.

In an interview with The Athletic, Mamdani said: “For a long time, a love of this game, of these countries, of this tournament, is one that New Yorkers only got to experience in their own homes or in specific neighborhoods. It hasn't been one that's been recognized by the city at large. And this is a chance to not only look at the incredible Senegalese community, the Moroccan community, and the larger African community we have in the city, but also as a chance to say that this is the city of the world and this is the world's game.

“It's time for those two things to be linked. And just five months away from bringing the World Cup to New York City, this is a chance for us to show what it can look like to repurpose the spaces of the city into ones where we celebrate the game.”

Eight World Cup matches will take place at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, including the final, but FIFA's host-city agreement is with both New York City and New Jersey, lending Mamdani a seat at the table.

While the Senegalese diaspora brought the noise to a Manhattan courthouse, those in their home country may be unable to travel to the tournament.

“It's something that I hope will change,” Mamdani told The Athletic, in an interview which took place just as the final began. “And I will always make the case not only for our city as the world's city, but also a city that the world can visit.

“I think that for this tournament to be the experience that we want it to be for so many, we have to think about the previous World Cups that came before it. One of them, I was lucky enough to go to (in 2010), South Africa. We have to allow the world to be here in order to fully experience the world. We also appreciate the fact that we have such incredibly strong diaspora communities in the city as well.”

Asked if it is something he can raise with Trump, Mamdani said: “I think it's part of a number of things that I will make clear about what the city is hopeful for.”

Mamdani, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, came under significant fire from Trump during his campaign to win the New York City mayoralty, but the pair had an unexpectedly warm first public meeting in the Oval Office in November, in which Trump described Mamdani as a “rational person” and added that he would be “cheering” for him.

During his campaign to become mayor, Mamdani also turned his ire on the World Cup organizers, FIFA, over its ticketing strategy. Mamdani launched a “Game Over Greed” petition that called on FIFA to abandon its plan to use dynamic pricing for the 2026 World Cup, impose a cap on ticket resales, and set aside 15 percent of tickets for local residents at a discount.

Mamdani previously told The Athletic he had received complaints from New Yorkers over the cost of World Cup tickets and the “mess” of a ticketing system, as well as “absurd” resale prices. Since then, FIFA has rolled out prices for the World Cup that brought condemnation from supporter groups and some federations, but the governing body also claims it has received 500 million ticket requests for the competition.

On Sunday afternoon, Mamdani reiterated his concerns about FIFA's approach, saying: “I continue to think that the right approach here is to end dynamic pricing, cap resale prices, and to have 15 per cent of tickets set aside at a discount for local residents. This is in keeping with prior World Cups. We are only asking for what we have seen (before), and I will continue to make that case now as the mayor of New York City, as opposed to just a candidate.”

Mamdani said he has started to hold conversations on the matter with the New York/New Jersey host committee, but he has not yet met directly with the FIFA officials who are overseeing the ticketing process.

Mamdani is also in the process of hiring a World Cup czar to streamline local services ahead of the competition, with a focus on promoting tourism, encouraging access and affordability, and ensuring that public services scale capacity to accommodate the games and the arrival of tourists.

Mamdani said: “There are a number of different factors that would make the person who holds that position successful. They need to obviously have a passion for the game, a fluency in the different government agencies that you have to engage with and interact with to make events like this possible. What we want to do is to ensure that this is a seamless experience that is sensational, and that requires logistics, passion, ambition, imagination, all in equal parts.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","How did David Luiz end up at Pafos? The story of Chelsea cult hero's surprise late career foray in Cyprus ahead of return to Stamford Bridge in the Champions League","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/how-david-luiz-pafos-chelsea-cult-hero-surprise-late-career-cyprus-return-stamford-bridge-champions-league/blta0998bcb352a87e5","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 08:00:00 GMT","

Before last season, very few casual fans would have been aware of Pafos FC's existence. The Cypriot outfit played in Europe for the first time in their 11-year history, reaching the last 16 of the Conference League, and followed up that impressive run by clinching their maiden league title. The latter achievement earned Pafos a spot in the Champions League qualifying rounds, and helped attract one of the most famous footballers of his generation.

David Luiz joined the club at the start of August on a two-year contract, sealing his return to European football after four years back in his home country, Brazil. It was an unexpected late-career move for the 38-year-old, who Pafos described as a ""true titan of modern football"" in their official transfer announcement, and he is now looking forward to an even more unlikely homecoming at Chelsea.

Pafos will travel to Stamford Bridge to take on the Blues in the Champions League on Wednesday, and Luiz is sure to receive a hero's welcome if he is able to prove his fitness after suffering an injury at the weekend. The defender is a beloved figure among the Chelsea faithful, despite his move to London rivals Arsenal in 2019, having helped the club win six trophies, including the Premier League and Champions League, across two spells.

Regardless of the final result, it promises to be a memorable occasion for both Luiz and Pafos, whose rapid rise from complete anonymity to club football's elite stage has been nothing short of remarkable. Certainly, no one would have predicted it when AEK Kouklia and AEP Paphos initially merged to create Pafos FC back in 2014, and they were entered into Cyprus' second tier.

Pafos have been a fixture in the top-flight since being taken over by Russian businessman and former Portsmouth owner Roman Dubov in 2017, and have gone through a host of different managers, including Real Madrid icon Michel Salgado and ex-Manchester United man Henning Berg. But their real success began after the appointment of Juan Carlos Carcedo in 2023.

The Spanish coach, who once served as Unai Emery's assistant at Arsenal, delivered Pafos' first piece of silverware, the Cypriot Cup, in his debut season, and has since turned them into the country's No.1 team. With Luiz now helping to boost their profile even further, the future looks bright. However, one question lingers: how on earth did he end up at Pafos in the first place?

Luiz won the third FA Cup of his career at Arsenal, and became a key player early in Mikel Arteta's tenure, racking up 73 appearances across all competitions. However, a hamstring injury cut short his 2020-21 campaign, and the Gunners decided not to renew the then-34-year-old's contract, instead seeking to strengthen the heart of the defence with younger alternatives.

The former Benfica and Paris Saint-Germain star eventually found a new club in September 2021, with Flamengo snapping him up on a free transfer. Luiz turned down other offers to join the Brazilian giants, as he revealed at his presentation.

""I had a few different scenarios where I could have picked a quieter, more peaceful life, but I like to follow my heart,"" he explained. ""This is another big challenge in my life. I felt during my tour that this is what I always wanted, it gives me the air I breathe. If the voice of the people is the voice of God, then the country called out to me and here I am.""

In typical fashion, Luiz rose to that ""big challenge"", quickly nailing down a starting role despite his late-season arrival. Flamengo did, however, endure a heartbreaking end to the campaign, finishing second in the Brazilian Serie A before suffering a painful 2-1 defeat to Palmeiras after extra-time in the Copa Libertadores final, with Luiz playing the full 120 minutes.

Flamengo dropped to fifth in the league table the following season, but won the Copa do Brasil and went one better in the Copa Libertadores, beating Athletico Paranaense 1-0 in the final. Luiz was the driving force behind their success, and became only the 14th player ever to win the Copa Libertadores and Champions League, earning a contract extension in the process.

""Flamengo is the pinnacle of emotions! It's living life on the edge. Always wondering 'what's going to happen?' But it's also the fulfilment of most Brazilians,"" Luiz said in a subsequent interview with Globo Esporte. ""It's one of the best chapters of my life, one of the best things football has to offer. Did I imagine it? I don't know. Maybe I didn't imagine it would be so special and affect me as much as it does today. It gives me pleasure to say that it's a club that's in my heart!""

Luiz got the chance to compete in the Club World Cup again at the start of the 2023 campaign, as the 2022 tournament was pushed to February so it wouldn't clash with the international World Cup in Qatar. Flamengo failed to set up a blockbuster final clash with Real Madrid, though, falling to a shock 3-2 loss against Al-Hilal in the semis.

Disappointment ended up being the theme of their season as Flamengo fell short in all the major competitions, but Luiz did finally net his first goal for the club in a 3-2 league win over Bahia.

There were also real signs that Luiz's body was starting to fail him during the 2023 campaign. Indeed, he missed Flamengo's final 11 league fixtures after suffering a severely sprained ankle during the team's 2-0 win away at Cruzeiro, with a buggy used to safely transfer the ex-Chelsea star from the field as he broke down in tears. 

However, Flamengo still decided to renew Luiz's contract for one more year, and were vindicated in the early stages of the 2024 season. Luiz played a part in Flamengo's run to the Campeonato Carioca crown, and though persistent struggles with his ankle forced then-manager Tite to keep him on the bench for Flamengo's opening Serie A games, the veteran defender proved his worth upon returning to full fitness.

He was among the scorers in his first game back in the starting XI, a 6-1 league rout of Vasco da Gama, and it was a goal to put right up there with the very best of his career: Luiz pulled away from his marker during a corner delivery before firing a first-time volley into the net, prompting wild celebrations involving the majority of his team-mates. The superb strike capped a colossal overall display from Luiz, who also won five of his six aerial duels while posting a 95 percent pass completion rate.

Luiz became a regular again after that, but consistency proved elusive for Flamengo, and ex-Brazil boss Tite was sacked in September after they were knocked out of the Copa Libertadores by Penarol at the quarter-final stage. The club then turned to Filipe Luis, another former Chelsea star who finished his playing career at Flamengo - an appointment which spelled the beginning of the end for Luiz's spell at the Maracana.

Flamengo went on to win the Copa do Brasil again under Luis, but Luiz was an unused substitute in their semi-final victory over Corinthians, and only played one minute across the two legs of their final triumph against Atletico Mineiro. Luiz did start four of Flamengo's final league matches in 2024, but his Achilles was still causing him pain, which left the club in a bind regarding his future.

On December 22, 2024, Luiz's departure was officially announced on social media, but he did not take kindly to the news, claiming he had been blindsided in an explosive outburst to the press. 

""If I didn't have Instagram, social media, maybe I wouldn't even know today (about the non-renewal),"" he said. ""So, I think it wasn't good, and then I stop to think, there are only two ways: either it was intentional or it was amateurish.""

Luiz was only a free agent for a month, though. Fortaleza handed him a two-year deal at the end of the winter transfer window, prolonging his stay in the Brazilian top flight. He was subsequently mobbed by fans upon his arrival, and said the club had ""captured my heart"", before immediately targeting silverware at the Ceara-based club. 

""The foundation is here. Everything is here. The cake is almost ready,"" Luiz said at his official unveiling. ""All that's missing is the whipped cream and the cherry on top.""

Fortaleza finished the 2024 Serie A season in fourth, just one place behind Flamengo, to qualify for the Copa Libertadores for the first time ever. They were not able to build on that success with Luiz on the books, though.

It quickly became obvious that Luiz was a club signing, not one that head coach Juan Pablo Vojvoda had pushed for, and he found himself in and out of the team, despite Fortaleza's form falling off a cliff. When Luiz picked up a thigh injury in early July, the writing was on the wall.

On August 1, the defender's contract was terminated by mutual consent, at which stage he had already reached an agreement to join Pafos. After the free transfer went through, Luiz explained why his seven-month spell at Fortaleza went so badly, hinting at a rift with Vojvoda.

""Unfortunately, it didn't happen the way I wanted,"" he said in an interview with Lance. ""There were some things, but it wasn't the way I envisioned, which is also part of football. I played very little, but I understood that the best way to respect the club was to move on to another challenge, because it hadn't worked out the way we expected. I still have the same respect for Vojvoda, even though we think about football in different ways.""

Luiz avoided the indignation of relegation by abandoning Fortaleza early, as they slumped to 18th in the table, but still made unwanted headlines due to off-field legal issues. The centre-back, who is engaged to long-time partner Bruna Loureiro, was accused of threatening a Brazilian social worker with whom he was alleged to be having an affair. Luiz denied all of the allegations, and Ceara police decided not to indict him after an investigation, as per Globo.

Luiz has found happiness again in Cyprus, and is on course to end his glittering career with a bang. Against all the odds, the Cypriot champions dispatched Maccabi Tel-Aviv, Dynamo Kyiv and Red Star Belgrade in Champions League qualifying to reach the league phase, and were rewarded with a dream fixtures against Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Juventus, Villarreal and Monaco, with fellow newcomers Kairat Almaty, Olympiacos and Slavia Prague completing their list of opponents. Luiz wasn't fit enough to play in qualifying, but he was present for the celebrations after the win over Red Star.

""Everybody was in ecstasy,"" Luiz told BBC Sport. ""Nobody expected us to be in the Champions League this season. I'm very happy to be here because I can see this feeling, with everybody's hunger, to do something great.""

He has since become a mainstay in Carcedo's team, aiding Pafos's latest tilt at the Cypriot title, but they have fallen short of greatness on Europe's elite stage. Pafos have only amassed six points from their opening six Champions League fixtures, losing 5-1 at home to Bayern and 2-0 away at Juventus. They were also held to disappointing stalemates on the road at Olympiacos and Kairat, but all hope is not lost just yet.

On matchday four, Pafos pulled off one of the upsets of the tournament, beating La Liga high-flyers Villarreal 1-0 at the Stelios Kyriakides Stadium, and followed that up with a hard-fought 2-2 draw against Monaco at the Stade Louis II. The Cypriot champions twice battled back from a deficit, and Luiz bagged the pick of the goals, brilliantly heading into the top corner after rising highest to meet an in-swinging set-piece.

That was his first Champions League goal since 2017, and made him the second-oldest scorer in the competition's history behind Real Madrid icon Pepe. Luiz has lost much of his mobility, but still has a penchant for the spectacular, and will be highly motivated to deliver more heroics against his old club, Chelsea.

""I'm going to play against Chelsea with my heart totally full of energy,"" he vowed to the BBC. Pafos can still make the knockouts if they get a positive result at the Bridge and in their final league-phase match against Slavia, and if Luiz is true to his word, anything is possible.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

German Berterame has been warned that a move to join Lionel Messi at MLS Cup winners Inter Miami would be a “step backwards”. The Mexico international forward is said to be the subject of a transfer bid from South Florida, with discussions now taking place. He has, however, been advised to remain at Monterrey and make a decision on his future after the World Cup.

Various reports across North and South America have indicated that Inter Miami are prepared to trigger the $15 million (£11m) release clause in Berterame's contract. It has been revealed that talks regarding a move are ongoing.

Monterrey's sporting director, Jose Antonio Noriega, has acknowledged the move from Miami and conceded that the proposal is appealing to all parties. He has said: “I can tell you and confirm that there has been an approach and a proposal that is interesting to Berterame.

“It interests German, and it could be interesting for us. If we decide that the offer is interesting and that German leaves, we will do everything possible, and we are already working on it to replace him.”

Herons co-owner Jorge Mas has also validated the reports, with the current kings of MLS eager to continue reinforcing their squad around eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi. He has said: “Well, first of all, German Berterame is a great player. He's a great player, and we're aiming to have a great squad.

“I know I confirmed this morning that there's an offer from Inter Miami. There is an offer from Inter Miami for German Berterame, we'll see how that develops in the next 24 to 36 hours… we're aiming to give Javier Mascherano the tools to attack technically as he sees fit.”

With Liga MX enjoying a winter break through to January 30, the timing of Inter Miami's approach is considered to be perfect. Monterrey head coach Domenec Torrent has acknowledged a raid for one of his most prized assets, while maintaining that there is no guarantee of a deal being done.

He has said: “Berterame gets offers every year. This is something the board handles. If he leaves, they would have to leave us a lot of money to sign another player. The team that wants him knows Rayados won't make it easy… He has a price and clauses. I'm happy with him, he's committed and I'm focused on improving the team.”

Several other prominent voices from inside Mexican football have urged Berterame to delay any move to the United States in a World Cup year. Fellow countryman and former national team star Paul Aguilar has told La Ultima Palabra on Fox Sports: “If I had to decide that, I would stay at Rayados and after the World Cup I would go to another team. For me, going to MLS is a step backwards, even if it is a league that has improved.”

Aguilar believes that Liga MX remains more competitive than MLS and remaining on home soil would give Berterame the best possible chance of earning a place in Javier Aguirre's World Cup squad.

Berterame has remained silent when it comes to his future, with the 27-year-old refusing to discuss that subject in public. He told reporters that tried to quiz him on a possible move to the States: “They won't let me talk.”

The expectation is that, despite receiving advice urging him to reconsider his options, a transfer to Inter Miami will be completed at some stage in the not too distant future. The Herons remain confident that they will get their man.

The MLS Cup winners have lost former Barcelona stars Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba to retirement, but have seen veteran Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez commit to a new one-year deal. They have also drafted in reinforcements at left-back and in the goalkeeping department, while talismanic club captain Messi has ended any speculation regarding his future by signing a three-year contract extension through 2028.

The project, which took two years to develop and carried with it a $100 million price tag, now looks to be a template for how Hollywood can adapt classic IP.


							By 

	Erik Hayden


Executive Editor, Business


	As mogul James Dolan plots an expansion for the Sphere concept to the nation's capital, his unique Las Vegas-based entertainment venue has disclosed a new milestone for its blockbuster Wizard of Oz experience.


	The reimagining of the 1939 classic has now sold 2 million tickets since it bowed on Aug. 28 of last year, totaling more than $260 million in ticket sales, the company said on Tuesday. While its apples-and-oranges as far as the box office goes — an Oz at the Sphere ticket could be $200 while a movie ticket at a normal theater showing may be more like $15 — $260 million in ticket sales would rank at No. 9 domestically in theaters last year, basically tied with Universal's live-action How to Train Your Dragon ($262 million stateside).

Oz at the Sphere had passed the 1 million ticket sale milestone and $130 million in sales as of mid-October at its sole 18,600-seat Las Vegas venue. The project, which took two years to develop and carried with it a $100 million price tag, now looks to be a template for how Hollywood can adapt classic IP for new experiences (think: Jurassic Park, Avengers, Harry Potter or Star Wars at the Sphere etc.)


	The reimagining of the classic MGM/Warner Bros. movie marked a major bet that audiences would be interested in seeing feature-like experiences at the venue, which had bowed with concert experiences from the likes of U2, the Eagles and Dead & Company. (Phish, No Doubt, Kenney Chesney and more are on-deck for 2026.)


	During a November earnings call, the Sphere CEO (and AMC Networks mogul and Knicks owner) said that the company is planning an Oz 2.0 experience to bow on the first anniversary of the show this upcoming summer. “This is likely going to include some new features to the film such as we might just take you for a ride on a witch's broom during the show,” the exec said. Creatives who worked on the Oz project included producer Jane Rosenthal, VFX expert Ben Grossmann and Oppenheimer editor Jennifer Lame.

	











	And, like other long-running Vegas staples including Cirque Du Soleil, Dolan has said that he sees a long lifespan for Oz showings. “What's the lifespan of Wizard of Oz? It wouldn't surprise me if we were we were showing Wizard of Oz ten years from now,” Dolan said to Wall Street analysts on that earnings call.


	The success of the show's opening also breathed new life into plans to expand the Sphere concept to other major cities. On Jan. 19, the company said it inked a deal to develop a smaller-scale Sphere in the Washington, D.C. metro area with the state of Maryland at a National Harbor location. The state's governor, Wes Moore, described the deal as “one of the largest economic development projects in Prince George's County history.”


	Up next at the Sphere is feature From the Edge, from Free Solo duo E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, chronicling extreme sports athletes. “It's got a ways to go,” Dolan said of that project on the November earnings call. “I expect that it will be ready by the end of the summer. But that doesn't mean that we'll launch it at the end of the summer. It can, it will stay fresh. And we plan on basically running Wizard of Oz until we see the demand to start to fall off. That could be a lot longer than a year.”

The song comes ahead of Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally's release later this winter.

	Kiss all the time. Disco, occasionally. “Aperture” later this week. Shortly after announcing his fourth studio album, Harry Styles has revealed when the first single is set to drop — and it's coming in just a few days.


	On Tuesday (Jan. 20), the pop star surprised fans by revealing that “Aperture” — the first taste of upcoming LP Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally — will hit streaming services on Thursday (Jan. 22). Posting a photo of himself looking jubilant in a recording studio, Styles simply wrote in his caption, “Aperture. Jan 23, 00:00 UK.” (That translates to 7 p.m. ET the day before in the U.S.)

	











	The website Styles used to tease his new album ahead of its announcement earlier in January, WeBelongTogether.co, has also updated with the single news. The page now shows a photo of the singer and several other parkgoers sitting on a grassy space while sketching something out of view on canvases. At the center, a clock with both hands pointed to “Disco” — which is displayed where the 9 o'clock position should be — seemingly teases that the first song from HS4 will have a disco/dance theme.


	It's been years since Styles last dropped new music, with Billboard 200-topper Harry's House turning 4 years old this year. The full-length won album of the year at the Grammys, while lead single “As It Was” spent 15 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.

	











	The single announcement comes just a little more than a week after Styles first started teasing Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally with the launch of WeBelongTogether.co, after which he sent a voice note to fans of himself singing the phrase, “We belong together.” On Jan. 15, he formally announced the LP, unveiling its title and eccentric cover art on social media, as well as its March 6 release date.

EXCLUSIVE: Ramin Bahrani, the Oscar-nominated Iranian-American filmmaker behind titles like The White Tiger, 99 Homes and Chop Shop, has entered production today in Las Vegas on Vegas: A Love Story, a sensual romance with thriller elements that boasts an all-star cast including Maika Monroe (Longlegs), Brandon Sklenar (The Housemaid), Paul Dano (The Batman), Michael Shannon (Nuremberg), and Judy Greer (Ant-Man).


	Directed by Bahrani from a script written with Bahareh Azimi, Vegas: A Love Story unfolds beneath the glow of the Las Vegas Strip, where Dillon (Monroe), a gifted graphic designer hustling for work, falls into a passionate, unexpected romance with Freddy (Sklenar), a welder and single father struggling to rebuild his life. As Dillon hides the fact that she's living out of her car, Freddy's wary in-laws (Shannon and Greer) step in to protect their grandson. The return of Ryder (Dano), Dillon's charming but self-destructive ex, threatens to unravel everything.

A/Vantage Pictures, Sugar Rush Pictures, and Noruz Films are producing, with lead financing from Juniper Productions. Described by producers as Bahrani's most commercial film to date, the project marks the first on which A/Vantage has taken the lead since the label's launch.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Producers include Berman — whose past credits include Highest 2 Lowest, Air, Rock Springs, Nine Days, and The Birth of a Nation — as well as Jordan Moldo of A/Vantage Pictures, Andrea Bucko of Sugar Rush Pictures, Matthew Lindner of Juniper Productions, Bahrani and Azimi of Noruz Films, and Monroe.

	











	Also starring Beau Foxx, Maximilliana, Dylan Flashner, and Natasha Yi, the film was written with Monroe in mind, sources said. Bahrani and his producer, A/Vantage Pictures' Berman, came to connect here after forging a relationship through a close mutual friend, the late, beloved producer Kevin Turen. Berman previously produced The Birth of a Nation with Turen, who also produced Bahrani's 99 Homes, starring Shannon, and At Any Price, which Monroe starred in after Bahrani discovered her. Berman and Lindner also previously worked with Monroe as the producers of her short-film directorial debut The Yellow, which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival.


	Producer Bucko of Sugar Rush Pictures comes to this project after serving an executive producer on Monroe's box office hit Longlegs. Other credits as producer include Gus Van Sant's Dead Man's Wire, the upcoming sci-fi comedy Alpha Gang, and Werner Herzog's upcoming Bucking Fastard.


	“I've spent over a year in Las Vegas to write and prepare this film, a story about people living close to the edge, who don't believe they deserve love, and find it anyway,” said Bahrani. “My leads; Maika Monroe and Brandon Sklenar supported by Paul Dano, Michael Shannon, and Judy Greer. When you have an ensemble this extraordinary then the film can grow from the inside out, revealing itself through the process. And, a bittersweet thanks to my friend and former producer, the late Kevin Turen for connecting me with producer Jason Michael Berman, who has believed in my vision from the very start, and to Andrea Bucko and all my incredible producers and executive producers for supporting me.”


	Soon to premiere the dramatic thriller Rock Springs in the Midnight section of the Sundance Film Festival, A/Vantage Pictures' Berman said, “We could not be more thrilled to launch our new production company A/Vantage Pictures with Ramin Bahrani's urgent, emotional, socially and culturally relevant film Vegas: A Love Story. Ramin is a once in a generation storyteller and has put together an extraordinary cast with Maika Monroe, Brandon Sklenar, Paul Dano, Michael Shannon and Judy Greer. Andrea Bucko, Matthew Lindner, Jordan Moldo, and I cannot wait to share this film with audiences later this year.”


	Producer Bucko added, “I hope our film will entrance audiences with the hope of broken characters finding love. I'll never look at people on the margins the same way again.”


	WME Independent is selling worldwide rights to Vegas: A Love Story, whose EPs include Sklenar, Rodney Propp, Thomas Pierce, Motoko Kimura, Scott Lambert, Grant Rose, Frida Torresblanco, Tomer Shmulevich, Kaoru Fukutomi, Sophie Lane Curtis, Luke Daniels, Richie Walls, Brando Eaton, Lee Broda, Jeff Rice, Renee Tab, Amman Abbasi, Jeffrey E. Stern, Joe Torsella, Giovanni J. Guidotti, Mark Korshak, Pejman Nozad, Caroline Connor, Mark C. Stevens, and Farhad Massoudi.


	Recently seen starring opposite Nicolas Cage in Osgood Perkins' horror pic Longlegs, which passed Parasite to become the highest-grossing film in Neon's history, Monroe's upcoming slate also includes Kornél Mundruczó's Place to Be, opposite Pamela Anderson and Taika Waititi, as well as the Bleecker Street horror film, Victorian Psycho, and Universal's Colleen Hoover adaptation, Reminders of Him. She is represented by WME, Entertainment 360, and Felker Toczek Suddleson.


	Coming off of The Housemaid, the psychological thriller with Amanda Seyfried and Sydney Sweeney that has spawned a sequel after grossing more than $200M worldwide, Sklenar will next be seen starring in the Warner Bros. action thriller F.A.S.T. penned by Taylor Sheridan, who previously cast him in his Paramount+ series 1923. He is repped by WME, Neon Kite, and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman.

	











	Dano's upcoming slate includes Olivier Assayas' political thriller The Wizard of the Kremlin, which premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival, as well as the upcoming A24 flick The Chaperones with Cooper Hoffman and David Jonsson, and Florian Zeller's psychological thriller Bunker. He is repped by WME, Anonymous Content, and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman.


	Coming off of Sony Pictures Classics' Nuremberg and Netflix's Death by Lightning, Shannon will next be seen in the horror pic Buddy, premiering at Sundance 2026. He is repped CAA, Range Media Partners, and Yorn Levine.


	Coming off of roles in Lionsgate's The Long Walk and Apple TV's Stick, with roles up ahead in Peacock's The Five-Star Weekend, Season 2 of Apple TV's The Last Thing He Told Me, the Marc Maron comedy In Memoriam and more, Greer is repped by CAA, Artists First, and Felker Toczek Suddleson.


	Bahrani earned Oscar, BAFTA, and WGA Award nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay for Netflix's The White Tiger (2021) and, following Vegas: A Love Story, will get behind the camera on Last Meals with Mads Mikkelsen and Boyd Holbrook. He is repped by WME, Untitled Entertainment, Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole, and Ziffren Brittenham.

Senior Film Reporter


	Palme d'Or-winning French actress Léa Seydoux (Dune: Part Two) is set to star opposite Academy Award winner Mikey Madison in The Masque of the Red Death, the new film from A24 and Picturestart, billed as a revisionist and darkly comedic take on the short story of the same name by Edgar Allen Poe.


	No word on the role to be played by Seydoux. Published in 1842, Poe's story follows Prince Prospero, who retreats with a group of nobles into a fortified abbey as a deadly plague ravages the countryside. To distract themselves, the elites host an elaborate masked ball, but as the night progresses, an unsettling presence disrupts the celebration, forcing the guests to confront the reality they believed they had shut out.

	The project hails from Charlie Polinger, a writer-director coming off his Cannes-premiering directorial debut with a psychological drama ironically titled The Plague, which is nonetheless an entirely different sort of story. Julia Hammer and Erik Feig will produce for Picturestart, alongside James Presson and Lucy McKendrick, with Polinger exec producing. A24 will distribute the film worldwide. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Known for her work with auteurs ranging from Wes Anderson and Yorgos Lanthimos to David Cronenberg, Bertrand Bonello, and Mia Hansen-Løve, Seydoux has recently been seen in Denis Villeneuve's Dune: Part Two for Legendary/Warner Bros., as well as the Bond films Spectre and No Time to Die, playing Bond girl Madeleine Swann. In 2013, she was awarded the Palme d'Or for Blue Is the Warmest Colour, the romantic drama from filmmaker Abdellatif Kechiche. Upcoming, Seydoux will be seen starring in Oscar-winning Anatomy of a Fall co-writer Arthur Harari's The Unknown, Marie Kreutzer's Gentle Monster alongside Catherine Deneuve, and the Zellner Brothers' Alpha Gang with Cate Blanchett and Dave Bautista. She is represented by Agence Adequat and UTA.

Bravo's “Below Deck Mediterranean” season 10 is officially sailing toward its finale, but before Captain Sandy Yawn and her crew head back to shore, they're hosting one last unforgettable charter. The final guests, a lively group from New Jersey with zero filter, arrive ready to turn up the energy and close out the season in true party style.

Among them is a familiar face that reality TV fans will instantly recognize. Viewers of VH1's “Mob Wives” will spot Karen Gravano in the mix, best known as the outspoken daughter of infamous mob boss Sammy “The Bull” Gravano.

“Below Deck Med” season 10 is coming to an end, but one last charter includes a lively group of New Jersey residents. Among the charter guests is former reality TV star Karen Gravano, who became known for stirring up drama on VH1's “Mob Wives.”

In a clip of the Jan. 19 episode, Captain Sandy Yawn is seen having a preference sheet meeting with her deck crew; meanwhile, chief stew Aesha Scott informs her interior crew about the new guests. 

Scott shares that the primary charter guest is named Jennifer, a New Jersey resident who owns a few MedSpas. Then we hear Captain Sandy sharing more information on Gravano: 

“Karen is a New York Times best-selling author who has written about being a daughter of mob boss Sammy “The Bull” Gravano,” she shares, adding, “We better behave ourselves.”

As Captain Sandy and Scott review the group's preferred activities for their yacht stay, the group wants a beachside lunch on their second day. However, with a storm brewing, the plan may be in jeopardy. Viewers have seen time and again how unhappy guests can get when they're unable to leave the dock, and with this high-energy group, it could spell trouble.

Gravano appeared on the very first season of “Mob Wives” when it premiered in 2011. She went on to star on the VH1 reality series for five seasons, with its sixth and final season airing in 2016.

Gravano didn't step away from reality TV for good after the show. She and her then-boyfriend, Giovan “Storm,” appeared on Wetv's “Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars 6,” which aired in 2016.

Gravano continued to lean into her mafia background, appearing on MTV's two-season series “Families of the Mafia,” which also featured her daughter, Karina Seabrook, and her father, Sammy Gravano.

According to her Instagram bio, Gravano works as a licensed aesthetician at The Body Depot in Hazlet, New Jersey.

							By 

	Simon Vozick-Levinson



	“Hello, hello,” a familiar voice called out from behind the red velvet curtain hiding the stage at the Ridgewood, Queens, venue TV Eye last night around 11 p.m. It was a familiar voice, that is, if you've been paying any attention to rock music in the past year or two. Millions more people will get a chance to hear that distinctive soulful yawp next weekend, when his band plays Saturday Night Live. Because the man behind the curtain was none other than New York's homegrown indie hero, Geese's Cameron Winter.


	Few bands are hotter right now than Geese, and they could sell out a 250-capacity room like TV Eye many times over without trying. So could Winter on his own; his most recent solo performance in the city was a star-studded affair at the 10-times-grander Carnegie Hall last month. Maybe that's part of why he booked this show under a false name, “Chet Chomsky,” complete with a fanciful backstory identifying him as a troubadour from Tucson, Arizona. (“It's his first time in the Big Apple and the congestion pricing worries him.”) It's probably the only way he could easily play a venue this tiny now. Surprisingly little chatter got out in advance about this secret Cameron Winter show. If you nabbed a ticket before they sold out, though, you got an experience you'll be telling people about for years.

	











	There were about 50 people milling around the bar at the announced start time of 7 p.m. The show — which raised funds for the Olive Grove Initiative, a mutual aid group that supports families in Gaza — began a few minutes later with a solo set from Winter's bandmate Emily Green. Her set was the first big surprise of the night: She's a killer lead guitarist in Geese, but it turns out she's also an excellent singer-songwriter working in a style of her own. “A lot of what I've got tonight I wrote for the show,” Green said, introducing five new songs full of melancholy jangle, bittersweet twang, and sincere vocals. “Is everyone excited to see Chet Chomsky in, like, three hours?” she teased the crowd. “He came all the way from New Mexico.” (A crowd member reminded her that the fake bio said “Chet” was from Arizona.) She added that she'd finished writing one of her songs just that day — “work with me here” — but there was no apology needed. By the end of her set, Green sounded like a new star in the making.

	Next came Leo Paterniti, a Chicago artist who led a large band including saxophone and six-string bass through slow-building waves of noise and emotion. He had plenty of charm, and an impressive falsetto that helped him keep the crowd on board through some technical difficulties.


	A packed and enthusiastic room greeted the next performer, Fantasy of a Broken Heart, who put on the best full-band rock show of the night. The duo of Al Nardo and Bailey Wollowitz are better known for playing a supporting role in the live lineups of two of New York's most original indie acts, This Is Lorelei and Water From Your Eyes. On their own, joined by a bass player and a drummer, they make funhouse-mirror pop music that translates very well onstage. “Road Song” and “We Confront the Demon in Mysterious Ways,” both from their 2025 EP Chaos Practitioner, were among the insistently melodic highlights of their set. After Wollowitz promised the crowd that we'd get to enjoy “the tropical delights of Chomp Chimpanzee” soon, they closed out with their 2024 fan favorite “Ur Heart Stops,” drawing rapturous applause.


	Philadelphia's ungoogleable @ were up next, with a quiet, folky vibe that quickly grew eerie. “I'm going through the objects in your home,” Stone Filipczak sang on “Major Blue Empty,” from the duo's 2023 album Mind Palace Music. This band's powerful, unsettling songs were enhanced by touches of cello, flute, and oboe (the latter played by @'s other singer, Victoria Rose). The gentle instrumentation just made the dark lyrics feel more striking.

	After some interstitial selections from Neil Young's underrated 1983 album Trans over the PA, it was time for Chet, er, Cameron. The room was very full by now, with plenty of whispers circulating about the secret headliner. The curtain parted, and there he was, sitting at a small keyboard, draped in a promotional baseball cap and hoodie for Tame Impala's 2025 album Deadbeat. (We're not sure why; maybe he's just a fan of those sweet Australian beats.)


	“I'm very nervous,” Winter told the crowd, though he seemed to be joking about the fake persona he'd invented for the show. He asked us to be gentle, “because of my crippling stage fright and my checkered past.”


	He played the keyboard with a spiritual intensity, and he sang like he really meant every word, no matter how puckish or surreal. The lights went off after his third song, and he played the rest of the set in complete darkness — not even too many phones were out to interrupt the hushed appreciation of this singularly talented musician. Winter writes the kind of songs you can listen to in the dark in a crowded room and still feel incredibly moved.

	











	Songs from his 2024 solo album Heavy Metal made up about half the set, including spare and deconstructed takes on “The Rolling Stones,” “Love Takes Miles,” and “$0.” These are songs that came from somewhere deep within Winter, and seeing him perform them in such a small room with so little distance between him and the crowd, or between him and the music, was stunning.


	He played some new songs, too, from the batch of recent live debuts that devoted Geeseheads have already assembled into a fan-canon solo follow-up they're calling CW2. “The fool in the corner is dead,” he sang on one song tentatively known as “Serious World.” “I don't like what happened to Jesus, but I sure do like Saturday morning,” he sang on another that's been identified as “Emperor XIII in Shades.” God and the devil were mentioned. The spell was strong.


	Winter famously pushed to release Heavy Metal even though his own label wasn't entirely sure about it. Now his songs have connected with an audience that's growing by the minute and celebrating him as a legend in his own time. There's still time to hop on the bandwagon in 2026 if you haven't yet, though be warned, it will likely happen in a much bigger space than the one he played last night.

January 20, 2026, Mountain View, CA and Houston, TX  — The SETI Institute announced that alliant Global CEO, Dhaval Jadav, joined its Board of Directors. Dhaval brings a deep lifelong passion for space science, a strong commitment to STEM education, and a shared belief in the SETI Institute's mission to explore one of humanity's most profound questions: Are we alone in the universe? 

This marks the beginning of a strategic partnership that gives the SETI Institute the ability to leverage alliant's resources and AI capabilities in the search for extraterrestrial life. 

“As a kid nothing got me more excited to learn about space than the thought of extraterrestrials being out there,” said Dhaval. “I think we've lost some of that sense of wonder, the curiosity that drives people to look beyond their screens and ask big questions about the universe. I wholeheartedly believe in the SETI Institute's mission, and I hope alliant can help the SETI Institute be a beacon that rekindles that curiosity and inspires people to seek answers to life's biggest mysteries.”

Dhaval was elected to the board in part due to his longstanding leadership in promoting STEM education and space science. Through alliant's Blue Heart Fund, he has funded millions of dollars in STEM scholarships for students and supported local science educators through alliant's SPARK Awards. He also serves on the Space Center Houston Board of Directors and was honored by NASA's Johnson Space Center with the naming of the Dhaval R. Jadav Learning Innovation Center in recognition of his contributions.

“Dhaval has an incredible passion for the Institute's mission that evokes an infectious degree of excitement. His business acumen and commitment to science and STEM education are ideal attributes as the Institute embarks on a bold new era of space exploration and pursuit of the discovery of life and intelligence beyond Earth,"" said SETI Institute President and CEO Bill Diamond. 

“Dhaval understands that both science research and commercial activity are extremely complementary and often work in tandem to accelerate new discoveries and advancements. He is the ideal visionary to help us leverage the positive interaction between these two approaches,” said SETI Institute Board Member Amaresh Kollipara.

About the SETI InstituteFounded in 1984, the SETI Institute is a non-profit, multi-disciplinary research and education organization whose mission is to lead humanity's quest to understand the origins and prevalence of life and intelligence in the Universe and share that knowledge with the world.

""Supernatural"" creator Eric Kripke has said he always wanted the Winchesters' 1967 Chevy Impala to be a third character on the show. After all, it's essentially a home for Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) while they cruise America's haunted highways, saving people and hunting things. Kripke has credited a neighbor with steering him toward the vehicle that would become known as Baby.

""When I told my neighbor in Venice [California], who was a mechanic, that I wanted a bada** car and was thinking of a '65 Mustang, he said, 'Yeah, a Mustang is the perfect car if you're a p**sy,'"" Kripke recalled in an interview with TV Insider. ""And without missing a beat, he said, 'You want a '67 Impala because you can put a body in that trunk.' I ran to my computer to look it up, and it was perfect.""

The rest is history. The Impala became a constant presence in the show and made an impact — one ""Supernatural"" Season 15 episode even tells the story from Baby's perspective. It was fitting, then, that Ackles and Padalecki were each gifted their own Impalas after filming the final episode.

""The first song I listened to when I got in [my] Impala was 'Carry On Wayward Son,'"" Padalecki told TV Insider, referencing the Kansas track that accompanies many scenes of Sam and Dean driving around in episodes of ""Supernatural."" ""I see it in my garage and I already feel nostalgic about how many hours of my life I probably spent in that vehicle.""

Casting a Mustang in the role of Baby isn't the only unused idea Eric Kripke had for the main car on ""Supernatural."" Recalling his work on the series during a Reddit AMA, the creator recalled wanting to kit the vehicle out with unique gadgets that could have made the Winchester brothers take cues from classic pop culture spy stories — but he opted not to follow through with it.

""In the pilot, we explored adding James Bond-style switches to the Impala dash — to release oil, or salt. We might have even shot it. But then we realized that was stupid.""

While salt could have been useful in the Winchesters' battles with demons and spirits, the idea was nixed quite quickly. In the end, Baby didn't need hidden gadgets or spy tricks, because its real power came from becoming an emotional anchor — a symbol of home, brotherhood, and the road that defined ""Supernatural"" for 15 seasons.","{'href': 'https://www.tvline.com', 'title': 'TVLine'}","other"

Fernando Mendoza's brother made his decision about his playing future after the Indiana Hoosiers secured the national championship in a win over the Miami Hurricanes.

Alberto Mendoza, who was Fernando's backup during the 2025 season, will enter the NCAA transfer portal. He shared a post from On3, confirming the decision. He appeared in nine games this season for the national champions, making 18 completions for 286 yards and five touchdowns.

He joined Indiana in 2024 when head coach Curt Cignetti took over the team. He only appeared in one game in 2024. Kurtis Rourke was the Hoosiers' quarterback at the time.

Fernando Mendoza transferred to Indiana from Cal before the start of the 2025 season. It proved to be one of the best moves of the college football offseason. Alberto Mendoza played a major role in the transfer, according to The Athletic.

Rich Edson reports on President Trump's upcoming trip to Davos, Switzerland, highlighting his economic agenda and the controversial push to acquire Greenland. Bill Hemmer breaks down Greenland's strategic importance.

The European Union's top official did not hold back in her warnings about President Donald Trump's threat to impose fresh tariffs on countries opposing his push for the U.S. to acquire Greenland, a semiautonomous Danish territory.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called Trump's threats ""a mistake"" and questioned U.S. trustworthiness, saying that the EU-U.S. trade deal from July had to ""mean something.""

""Arctic security can only be achieved together. This is why the proposed additional tariffs are a mistake, especially between long-standing allies. The EU and U.S. have agreed to a trade deal last July. And in politics as in business — a deal is a deal. And when friends shake hands, it must mean something,"" Von der Leyen said.

""We consider the people of the United States not just our allies, but our friends. And plunging us into a dangerous downward spiral would only aid the very adversaries we are both so committed to keeping out of the strategic landscape,"" she added, vowing the EU's response would be ""unflinching, united and proportional.""

French President Emmanuel Macron also addressed the issue at Davos, saying the tariffs could force the EU to use its anti-coercion mechanism against the U.S. ""for the very first time,"" The Associated Press reported. The outlet noted that he argued that allied countries should be focused on bringing peace to Ukraine and ending the nearly four-year war with Russia.

Trump announced on Saturday that starting on Feb. 1, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the U.K., the Netherlands and Finland would face a 10% tariff on all goods imported to the U.S. The rate will then increase to 25% on June 1. The president added that ""this tariff will be due and payable until such time as a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase of Greenland.""

The president doubled down on his argument that U.S. control of Greenland was necessary to protect national security and American interests, saying that the acquisition would be key to developing the Golden Dome, a cutting-edge missile defense system meant to intercept threats targeting the American homeland.

US CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION VISITS DENMARK AMID BACKLASH OVER TRUMP'S PUSH TO ACQUIRE GREENLAND

The Trump administration's rhetoric about Greenland has caused friction between the U.S. and several allies, who warn that annexing the territory could burn diplomatic bridges. However, on Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said U.S. relations with Europe remain strong and encouraged trading partners to ""take a deep breath,"" the AP reported.

Leaders from Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the U.K. issued a joint statement on Tuesday, affirming their commitment as NATO members to ""strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest."" They also expressed their solidarity with Denmark and Greenland.

""Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response. We are committed to upholding our sovereignty,"" the statement read.

Some European nations recently tried to flex their muscles with a brief troop deployment to Greenland. France, Germany, Sweden and Norway participated in a two-day exercise to bolster the Danish territory's defenses amid Trump's threats. Germany deployed a reconnaissance team of 13 personnel, France sent 15 mountain specialists and Sweden, Norway and Britain sent three, two and one officers, respectively, according to Reuters.

In text messages that Trump published on Truth Social, Macron suggested a meeting of the Group of Seven (G-7) nations in Paris after the conference in Davos. The AP reported that an official close to Macron confirmed the authenticity of the text exchange. As of Jan. 20, no such meeting had been announced.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Danish pension fund to sell $100 million in Treasuries, citing 'poor' U.S. government finances","https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/20/akademikerpension-us-treasury-greenland-trump.html","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:10:54 GMT","



Danish pension operator AkademikerPension said it is exiting U.S. Treasurys because of finance concerns as Denmark spars with President Donald Trump over his threats to take over Greenland.

Anders Schelde, AkademikerPension's investing chief, said the decision was driven by what it sees as ""poor [U.S.] government finances"" amid America's debt crisis. But it also comes as tensions escalate between the U.S. and Denmark after Trump's latest threats to tariff European countries if Greenland, an arctic territory of Denmark, isn't sold to the U.S.

""It is not directly related to the ongoing rift between the [U.S.] and Europe, but of course that didn't make it more difficult to take the decision,"" Schelde said in a statement to CNBC.

The fund currently has a position of around $100 million in U.S. Treasurys, an AkademikerPension spokesperson confirmed to CNBC. The academics-focused fund plans to have exited that holding by the end of the month.

Schelde chiefly cited the ballooning debt bill facing the U.S. after decades of government overspending. The U.S. recorded a budget shortfall of $1.78 trillion last year, down just over 2% from 2024's fiscal year as Trump's broad and steep tariffs took effect.

Moody's Ratings cut the United States' sovereign credit rating down to Aa1 from Aaa in May, citing the budget deficit and high borrowing costs associated with rolling over debt at lofty interest rates.

The U.S.' finances made ""us think that we need to make an effort to find an alternative way of conducting our liquidity and risk management,"" Schelde said. ""Now we have found such a way and we [are] executing on that.""

Denmark has grown increasingly hostile toward the U.S. as Trump has ratcheted up his calls for control of Greenland to be given to the U.S. Trump said over the weekend that he would institute tariffs on several European nations beginning Feb. 1 if the U.S. did not take control of Greenland and that those levies could rise to 25% on June 1.

European leaders have reportedly considered using counter-tariffs and other punitive economic measures as a result. Some investors have worried that European countries could dump their U.S. asset holdings in response to Trump's new tariffs.

Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said Monday that it would ""not be pressured"" and ""stand firm on dialogue, on respect and on international law.""

Treasury yields in the U.S. and abroad surged Tuesday, a sign of investors feeling geopolitical turmoil rising. The U.S. dollar and stocks fell, and gold rose to new all-time highs in a session defined by the ""sell America"" trade.

Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio told CNBC on Tuesday that sovereign funds could start to dump U.S. investments if they stop seeing the U.S. as a stable trading partner.

""On the other side of trade, deficits, and trade wars, there are capital and capital wars,"" Dalio told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""If you take the conflicts, you can't ignore the possibility of the capital wars. In other words, maybe there's not the same inclination to buy ... U.S. debt and so on.""

Reuters first reported the Danish pension fund's Treasury exit.

There's a particular kind of sci-fi nerd who equates fusion tech with utopia. If we could only harness the engine of the stars, it would uncork near limitless energy and neatly sweep away a whole mess of humanity's problems. But how would that work exactly? What would the transition look like?

You don't have to wonder. It's happening now. Solar panels and wind turbines capture the fusion of the sun and convert it to electricity. And at the scale and pace that China is producing them, plenty of things stand to be swept away—including, quite possibly, the once seemingly intractable problems of energy poverty and fossil-fuel dependence. In 2024, the total installed electricity capacity of the planet—every coal, gas, hydro, and nuclear plant and all of the renewables—was about 10 terawatts. The Chinese solar supply chain can now pump out 1 terawatt of panels every year.

In China itself, vast energy megabases combining solar and wind stretch for miles in the country's western deserts and Tibetan highlands, each producing the power of multiple nuclear plants and connecting to population centers in the country's east via ultrahigh-voltage power lines. At the smaller end of the scale, panels have sprouted on rooftops all over the more populated eastern half of the country, thanks to policies that standardize the process and paperwork required to install and tie them into the grid. Huge factories, urban apartment buildings, and humble village homes are plastered with panels. In Europe, Chinese-made photovoltaic panels are so cheap that they cost less than fencing materials. Globally, the glut of solar has lowered the average cost of generating electricity to 4 cents a kilowatt hour—perhaps the cheapest form of energy ever.

By now, major headlines have begun to catch on to the reality that China's renewable energy revolution is one of the biggest stories in the world, while Donald Trump's anti-renewable vision of American energy dominance is a backward sideshow by comparison. But chroniclers of this green tech revolution almost always understate its chaos. At this point, it is far less a tightly managed, top-down creation of state subsidies than a runaway train of competition. The resulting, onrushing utopia is anything but neat. It is a panorama of coal communities decimated, price wars sweeping across one market after another, and electrical grids destabilizing as they become more central to the energy system. And absolutely no one—least of all some monolithic “China” at the control switch—knows how to deal with its repercussions.

In the United States, 2024 was a record-breaking year for solar. Across the entire country, those 12 months saw some 50 gigawatts of new solar capacity added. (Solar projects are typically measured by their power output, not their square footage.)

Here are 23 ways China is rewiring the future.

Now consider some different numbers, for scale and contrast. In China, the first three months of 2025 alone saw 60 gigawatts of new solar capacity added to the national grid. Then April packed in 45 more gigawatts. Finally, May added an eye-watering 92 gigawatts of new capacity, or 3 gigawatts every day.

The reason for this brain-warping mad dash of solar development? At the start of 2025—in an attempt to rein in the renewables sector—Beijing announced that it would discontinue a long-standing policy that had effectively propped up renewable energy prices, pegging them to that of the “baseline” coal power in each province. Any solar capacity that went in after May 2025, Beijing declared, would no longer get this deal. So the all-out solar installation frenzy was simply a mass attempt to get in under the old terms.

After May, sure enough, new solar deployments plummeted. The ensuing four months each added just 10 gigawatts of new solar on average, half of the prior year's pace—but that's still considerably faster than America at its peak.

In China, one problem with all this burgeoning, majestic new solar is that it's completely overwhelming the national electrical grid, technically and economically. For electricity markets to work, grid managers must constantly balance supply and demand—but the former can't always be throttled back when it exceeds the latter. Nuclear power plants can't just be switched on and off whenever solar power floods the grid. And some Chinese coal plants provide heat to communities through steam—so they need to run even if the electricity they generate is superfluous.

One perverse result of all this energetic over-supply is that a lot of solar power simply gets wasted, or “curtailed,” to make way for dirty forms of energy that are harder to turn off. Another is that the inherently intermittent power of renewables simply makes it more challenging for managers to keep the grid stable. In August 2024, in China's far western region of Xinjiang—where the renewables build-out is at its most grandiose—poorly handled voltage fluctuations from solar and wind caused a regional blackout and even threatened the national electrical system, according to the South China Morning Post.

As challenging as the glut is to manage at the technical level, its economics are even more vexing. As Econ 101 teaches, prices go down when supply rises faster than demand. But in most markets, there's an end point to this process: free. Electricity markets are different. Some power-generating entities (like the aforementioned coal and nuclear plants) are so loath to ramp down their production that they offer to pay for the privilege of continuing to generate power. This, combined with the absolute imperative to keep the grid balanced, can create negative prices, which have become common in China's heavily populated Shandong Province. It's an untenable situation, but energy-hungry industrial firms are happy to milk it. Decades ago, the metals giant Weiqiao Aluminum left the Shandong grid in favor of running its own captive coal fleet to power its smelters; this past year it plugged back into the grid to take advantage of cheaper rates coming from green tech.

What's more, Chinese solar manufacturers—who, if you'll remember, might just be saving the world—are not even making money for their troubles. They're struggling to survive a gauntlet of competition. At the root of the solar supply chain are makers of polysilicon, the purified silicon substrate base of panels. Oversupply of this product has caused prices and profits to collapse. The Chinese government has tried to get supply under control by pushing the strongest polysilicon firms to form a cartel and squeeze out lesser players who refuse to exit the market. But so far, this seems to be a long shot.

Workers in Zhejiang Province manufacture solar infrastructure to be exported to Southeast Asia.

The story is similar higher up the supply chain: Manufacturing capacity to produce solar ingots, wafers, and panels exceeds demand, sparking profit-killing price wars as firms try to keep their market share. Meanwhile, rapid technological innovation keeps forcing firms to invest in expansion with the latest and greatest designs, lest they get left behind by their competitors. When a completely new breed of solar panels yields a 10 percent difference in generation capacity, manufacturers who fail to quickly set up new production lines do so at their own peril. For the consumer, this added capacity means more energy with less real estate, perhaps a smaller parcel of land to purchase for your solar farm. For the manufacturer, it means the difference between commanding a viable price versus being dumped in the remainder bin.

As the oversupply of Chinese panels has spilled into the international market, the bizarre dynamics have spread with them. Just as in Shandong Province, negative prices for electricity have also become common in Germany, thanks to Chinese panels. Or take Pakistan. Around 2022, a global spike in natural gas prices made the Pakistani electrical grid even more expensive and less reliable than usual. But instead of just suffering or firing up diesel generators, millions of Pakistanis installed solar panels to free themselves from the grid. The country imported so many Chinese solar panels that the grid as a whole began to fall into what is called a death spiral. Customers started opting out, leaving the grid to charge ever higher prices, which led even more people to flee, and so on.

Who benefits, aside from the environment? It's actually hard to say. The Chinese government is one of the Pakistani grid's major creditors. So Chinese firms are undermining the economics of major development projects funded by state-owned banks.

If only there was more electrical storage—technology that holds solar power generated during the day and releases it in the evening—then a lot of the issues that torture China's renewables market would be resolved. Solar panels would become more valuable to the grid, their generation wouldn't have to be curtailed, and the producers would be able to sell more of their products at better prices. Of course, China has come to dominate this fast-growing sector as well: It is by far the world's largest battery maker. But China's electrical system hasn't figured out the rules and pricing to push battery capacity onto the grid fast enough to keep up. And besides, the vast majority of the batteries that China is churning out do not end up in grid storage. They're revolutionizing another increasingly Chinese-dominated green industry that is going fast, cheap, and out of control: automobiles.

In 2018, the city of Shanghai lured Tesla in to build a gigafactory with what seemed like an especially attractive offer. For years, foreign automakers like Ford, GM, Volkswagen, and Toyota had dominated the Chinese car market—the world's largest—but were required to form joint ventures with Chinese firms for the privilege of doing business in the country. Shanghai told Tesla it could fully own its Chinese operations. Subsidies for land and cheap loans were proffered as well.

A major solar farm in Shandong Province.

Tesla's Shanghai gigafactory was completed in 168 days. It quickly became Tesla's largest in the world. And it was fed by a network of local component suppliers that cropped up around it. The only problem—for Tesla, anyway—was that those local firms eventually became the basis for a Chinese supply chain that supercharged the nascent electric vehicle sector in the country. Nearly overnight, firms like Nio and BYD were producing plug-in cars that could rival Tesla in cost and quality. As with solar, a wave of entrants battled for market share, causing profits to evaporate but giving consumers great choices at excellent prices.

By 2024, nearly half of all cars sold in China had plugs. Internal combustion automakers in China are suffering or shuttering. And the reverberations are perhaps even stronger abroad. China shifted from an also-ran to the world's dominant auto exporter over the past five years, displacing Japan, South Korea, and Germany. It shipped more than 5.5 million cars overseas in 2024. Other countries have begun to panic that their own auto sectors could be eviscerated by the competition of cheaper, cleaner vehicles from China. The United States has effectively banned imports from China, while Europe has imposed serious tariffs.

Yet just like in the solar sector, where thin profits and high debts have turned some firms into sprinting zombies, the Chinese EV space is full of failed and failing enterprises. Even BYD, the biggest player globally, seems to be dangerously close to spinning out of control. Its sales over the past few months have faltered badly compared with the previous year, and murmurs about its debt burden lead some to wonder if it too might collapse—even as people around the world are still dying to get their hands on these cars, and other automakers strain to compete.

Indeed, the greatest beneficiaries of China's renewables revolution may, in fact, be consumers, both inside and outside of China. In sun-blessed Australia, where rooftop solar panels sit atop nearly a third of all households, the country's energy minister, Chris Bowen, proposed a “solar sharer program” to offer three hours of free electricity on sunny days. Solar and battery systems have allowed Hawaii to close its final coal power plant, and such systems are similarly helping other islands like Jamaica to reduce their need for imported fossil fuels.

One country—one leader, especially—is trying to buck this trend. Donald Trump hates many people and things, but wind turbines and solar panels seem to hold a special place of contempt in his heart. His administration has attempted to cancel major offshore and onshore wind projects, along with plans for Esmerelda 7, a solar megabase slotted for the Nevada desert that would have been worthy of Western China. Trump and his energy secretary, Chris Wright, often speak of American energy dominance, but they are crippling American firms' ability to deploy and build the cheapest sources of electricity in the history of this planet, in favor of a combination of long-in-the-tooth arguments about fossil inevitability and long-shot bets on small modular nuclear reactors and, yes, fusion.

Even among billionaires who don't share Trump's belief that climate change is a hoax, this latter affinity for far-out, breakthrough technologies has long been a hallmark of American climate investment and philanthropy. This attitude is epitomized by Bill Gates, who once dismissed existing green technologies like solar and wind power as “cute.” Instead, Gates has always preferred a lordly, capital-intensive variety of decarbonization, plowing dollars into sci-fi technologies that remain in a perpetual state of being just five years away—not the rapid, messy approach involving solar panels sprouting on every rooftop and recalibrating electricity pricing schemes. (Recently, just as it was becoming clear that the transition to renewables was spiraling from success to success, Gates wrote a memo saying he was pulling back from climate funding altogether.)

Mao Zedong famously declared that a revolution is not a dinner party. It is an insurrection, an act of violence by which one class overthrows another. The green tech revolution—whose violence is principally financial, a withering assault on the value of fossil firms' assets—is not a dinner party. Nor is it inevitable. It could still be held back or slowed down. Yes, it is the result of the conscious choices made by people, firms, and governments, many of the most critical ones made in China. But it is happening now, and faster than our systems—electricity grids, industrial sectors, labor, geopolitics, and more—are ready for.

And it's a good thing, too, because there is another force powered by the sun's fusion that is also arriving at a force and scale that we are not prepared for: climate change. When the Category 5 Hurricane Melissa tore through Jamaica, Haiti, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic in late October, killing more than 90 and leaving tens of thousands homeless, most government investments in protecting people from the storm were not up to the challenge. What did provide some refuge were rooftop solar panels, which kept the lights on when the sun rose the next morning. A global energy system undergirds modern life. Through all the chaos, that system is getting a major upgrade.

unclear if its the one where the official HN mods (there are only 2) believed to be the ones doing thisthe reality is that the official mods are largely hands off, when they do get involved, more often than not it is to reverse a community flagging action, which is where most moderation happens, at a large enough community scale that a handful of people cannot wield this much flagging powerIf you believe unjust flagging has happened, the best recourse is to email the HN mods, the are very friendly, helpful and fair

As you stated, they reached the front page, which implies the opposite, that many people saw it and flagged it

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Emma Hayes eager to see which top prospects can prove they belong on USWNT","https://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/story/2026-01-20/emma-hayes-uswnt-young-rising-players","Tue, 20 Jan 2026 12:30:00 GMT","

 This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here. 

When Emma Hayes took the reins of the women's national soccer team in 2024, one of her first goals was to plumb the depths of the team's talent pool. She knew what she had on the surface with veterans such as Rose Lavelle, Naomi Girma, Lindsey Heaps and Trinity Rodman. But what about the players under them? Who could step in in case of injury, absence or a lack of form?

Twenty months later, Hayes still hasn't reached the bottom of that pool, making this month's training camp in Carson an important one with World Cup qualifying looming in the fall.

“Some of the pool players are going to get an opportunity to shine,” she said. “Some are high-potential prospects. I think about Hal Hershfelt or Croix Bethune, players who have not had a lot of opportunity with us. I get a chance to really see where they're at.

“My message is these players really have to take these opportunities because they will become few and far between.”

 Soccer 

As the man behind the 1984 L.A. Olympics soccer tournament and the 1994 World Cup, Alan Rothenberg arguably had more to do with writing the story of modern U.S. Soccer than anyone.

Hayes has given 27 players their senior national team debuts and has used 50 different starters in her 30 matches as coach. No other U.S. manager has named more than 36 starters over a similar span. And the number of debutantes could grow since three of the 26 women called up are still looking for their first international cap — something they could earn this month since the training camp will end with friendlies against Paraguay on Saturday at Dignity Health Sports Park and Chile at UC Santa Barbara on Jan. 27.

Saturday's matinee will include a pregame tribute to Christen Press, a two-time world champion who announced her retirement last fall.

But as valuable as the continuing auditions may be, the decision to call up a roster of young, NWSL players was made out of necessity, not design. Because the camp falls outside a FIFA window, Hayes was unable to summon European-based players such as Girma, Heaps, Alyssa Thompson, Crystal Dunn and Catarina Macario. Also unavailable were Jaedyn Shaw, Jaelin Howell, Tierna Davidson, Emily Sonnett and Lavelle, U.S. Soccer's women's player of the year, who will all be playing for Gotham FC in next week's FIFA Women's Championship Club in England.

“If the European-based players and the Gotham-based players were here, this would be a completely different roster,” Hayes said. “But that's not the case.”

It's also nothing new. The coach hasn't had what she considers her first-choice roster since taking over the national team.

Injury kept Macario off the team that struck gold in the Paris Olympics, Hayes' first tournament as coach, while forwards Sophia Wilson and Mallory Swanson have been on maternity leave since the Olympics. Injuries have limited Rodman, another forward, to one game over the past 18 months.

Despite that, the U.S. has lost just three of 20 games since climbing off the medal stand in Paris. So while she would prefer to start the new year with the veteran core of her 2027 World Cup roster in uniform, that didn't happen. Instead, the 26 invited players — among them Rodman, Angel City defender Gisele Thompson and Santa Clarita's Olivia Moultrie — average 24.1 years of age and 6.6 caps of senior-team experience.

“What I've learned since the Olympics is I can never, ever pick the best roster because I'm always going to be without players,” she said.

With the World Cup a year away, the tryout period will soon be ending. Hayes said she and her staff have mapped out how they'd like to see 2026 unfold, and that plan includes narrowing the potential player pool to about 35 women ahead of the SheBelieves Cup in March.

 Soccer 

The champion with Tigres UANL women's team and U-17 World Cup medalist detailed the sporting and personal reasons that led her to change course, with the full support of her parents.

“Once we get to SheBelieves, if everyone is available to me, it will be the group that are strong candidates to be [part of World Cup qualifying],” she said. “It will be an extremely competitive roster.”

Yet it will be one that still won't include Wilson or Swanson, who combined for seven of the team's 12 goals in the Olympics. Wilson gave birth to a daughter in September, two months before Swanson did the same. Hayes, who had a son in the spring of 2018, doesn't plan to rush back either player.

“I know how long it takes to recover after having a baby. That's why I don't like putting time frames on it,” she said. “Hormones play a big part of it. And you don't actually realize that until you've had a baby.

“For some the recovery is quicker than others. Depends on your age, depends on type of birth, sleep. Loads of things.”

In the meantime, Hayes will keep dipping into the talent pool she has.

It may be the end for “American Idol” winner Kelly Clarkson‘s daytime talk show. 

Page Six exclusively reported that the host will be calling it quits after this season. One insider described her pending exit from daytime as “definite” while another said it's “likely that it will not go on,” according to the outlet. “[Her show] is a lot to put on, and looking at the landscape across daytime television, it's not sustainable anymore,” they said.

Last year, it was rumored that the former “TODAY” anchor, Hoda Kotb, was on the verge of replacing Clarkson amid her sudden exit from the morning show. There was also buzz that Clarkson wanted out, with NBC insiders telling the Post there was a long list of names, including Kotb, being suggested to replace her.

However, Page Six reported that “another insider told us that nothing's been decided either way.” Although the insider acknowledged that there is ongoing buzz, they said that “people are jumping the gun,” and “nothing is definite yet, and it's a still a long season.”

Multiple sources previously told Page Six that Clarkson was looking to exit her talk show when her contract expires in 2026. At the time, Clarkson had been absent from her show, and it was later revealed that this was due to caring for her ex-husband Brandon Blackstock, who passed away at 48 in August 2025 after a private battle with melanoma.

Clarkson revealed Blackstock had been ill, and she postponed her Las Vegas residency to spend time with their children, daughter River, 11, and son Remington, 9.

“While I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children's father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them,” Clarkson wrote in a statement, apologizing to fans and expressing appreciation for their “grace, kindness and understanding.”

In January 2026, Clarkson gave a rare update about how her kids are doing following the passing of their father.

During a YouTube question-and-answer session released on the official “Kelly Clarkson Show” channel, Clarkson  responded to a fan who asked her to share one thing she does every day that brings her joy, and the answer involved her and Blackstock's two children.

“Snuggle,” she responded. “My kids, they're 9 and 11. Kind of that special little fun stage where they can wipe their own behinds, but they're still small enough to, like, love cuddling and love snuggles.”

“There's been a lot for our family recently, and so I have allowed my kids to sleep with me quite a bit,” she continued.

“It's my two dogs, my two kids and me. It's a lot,” she quipped. “It's been really special, though, because… the conversations you have during that time are pretty cute. So that's probably my favorite time of day.”
