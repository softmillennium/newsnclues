It's been years since Styles last dropped new music, with Billboard 200-topper Harry's House turning 4 years old this year. The single announcement comes just a little more than a week after Styles first started teasing Kiss All the Time.

As Dillon hides the fact that she's living out of her car, Freddy's wary in-laws (Shannon and Greer) step in to protect their grandson.

Other credits as producer include Gus Van Sant's Dead Man's Wire, the upcoming sci-fi comedy Alpha Gang, and Werner Herzog's upcoming Bucking Fastard. “I've spent over a year in Las Vegas to write and prepare this film, a story about people living close to the edge, who don't believe they deserve love, and find it anyway,” said Bahrani. Soon to premiere the dramatic thriller Rock Springs in the Midnight section of the Sundance Film Festival, A/Vantage Pictures' Berman said, “We could not be more thrilled to launch our new production company A/Vantage Pictures with Ramin Bahrani's urgent, emotional, socially and culturally relevant film Vegas: A Love Story.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz's wedding guests set the record straight on the chef's claims that Victoria Beckham danced “inappropriately” with her son at his 2022 nuptials. Stavros Agapiou — the partner of British DJ Fat Tony, who was asked to perform at Peltz and Brooklyn's wedding reception — backed the nepo baby in a now-deleted Instagram comment. “I was there and she did he's telling the truth,” Agapiou wrote. After deleting his response, Agapiou wrote: “Good on him for finally speaking out!” Page Six has reached out to Agapiou for comment but did not immediately hear back. After Agapiou's comment went viral, he took to his Instagram Stories Tuesday, sharing a mirror selfie and writing, “Keeping my mouth shut from now on.” The Arrogant Hypocrite clothing co-owner's comments come after Brooklyn released a scathing statement about his estranged family. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. “I do not want to reconcile with my family,” the 26-year-old wrote on his Instagram Stories Monday. “My mum cancelled making Nicola's dress in the eleventh hour despite how excited she was to wear her design, forcing her to urgently find a new dress,” he wrote. Additionally, Brooklyn claimed his famous parents allegedly “repeatedly pressured and attempted to bribe” him into “signing away the rights to” his name ahead of the Palm Beach, Fla., wedding ceremony. As far as the first dance being “hijacked,” the Vogue interview stated that “Brooklyn invited his mother on stage for a dance” and that they were joined by his dad and sister. The Beckhams have not publicly responded to their eldest son's explosive claims.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Also on Tuesday, Leila Cobo and Jason Lipshutz were promoted to co-chief content officers of Billboard, while editorial director Hannah Karp will depart for Warner Music. Since joining Billboard as an intern in 2016 and swiftly becoming a full-time staff member, Havens has grown into one of the publication's most trusted and respected voices in modern music journalism. Known for her detailed storytelling and passion for music, she has penned compelling cover stories on such artists as Billie Eilish, Post Malone and Lil Yachty, while also expertly overseeing The Sound, Billboard magazine's music-driven section. Rys has been a trusted authority on music business journalism for more than a decade, covering everything from major record labels and publishers to innovative streaming platforms and emerging trends in the industry. Rys also oversees Billboard‘s regular Executive of the Week column and key business-focused reporting packages. “Dan Rys has evolved from a tireless industry reporter to a leader of Billboard‘s overall news and music business coverage over the past decade, while Lyndsey Havens has established herself as one of the most thoughtful and trusted editors in modern music journalism,” said Cobo and Lipshutz. Brown, who has been integral to Billboard‘s video initiatives, has been promoted to senior vice president, video and off platform growth. She will enhance viewers' journeys across all touch points, improve quality and scale of Billboard's video production, and drive growth through intellectual property development for new shows. Rooney has been promoted to SVP, Experiences, cementing her critical position within Billboard's live consumer event strategy and thought leadership efforts. Previously serving as VP of Events, Rooney has masterminded high-profile initiatives such as Billboard‘s Women in Music, Latin Music Week and The Stage at SXSW. Moving forward, she will helm all of Billboard's signature business events while driving new consumer-facing programs and elevating the overall brand identity. Both Brown and Rooney will continue reporting to Dana Droppo, Billboard's chief brand officer. In the last few years, she has guided a talented team and amplified our ability to reach music fans and professionals through video,” Droppo said. “Mary Rooney's experiential expertise and razor sharp event execution has pushed Billboard to new heights. These promotions are a testament to their essential contributions, and we couldn't be prouder of our team.” As Billboard proudly celebrates these internal promotions, the company also bids farewell to longtime editor in chief Hannah Karp. During her successful tenure at Billboard, Karp elevated the publication's editorial voice and continued its legacy of excellence in music industry coverage.

One of the films ready to make a splash out of the Sundance Film Festival‘s 2026 World Cinema Dramatic Competition is first-time writer/director Rafael Manuel's “Filipiñana.” With a surreal visual language that hat-tips everyone from Jacques Tati to Michael Haneke and the filmmaker's longtime mentor Jia Zhangke, the film is a striking, startling class critique based on Manuel's own Silver Bear-winning 2020 short film (which you can watch now on the Criterion Channel, by the way). Related Stories Warner Bros. (Yes, Warner Bros.) Leads the Way of New Buyers Set to Shake Up the Sundance Market ‘Rosebush Pruning' with Riley Keough, ‘At the Sea' with Amy Adams Among 22 Films in Berlinale Competition New to the job, she wanders the immaculate grounds sampling its luxuries as members, including an industrialist and his expatriate niece, the club president and his pampered wife, and a slew of Chinese tourists, engage in a complex dance with the club's doting and subservient staff. But something is rotting beneath the pristine fairways of the elite resort, as Isabel discovers when she tries to return a mislaid golf club to its patriarchal director, Dr. Palanca. As the Sundance programming staff shared in its official guide,” through a stylized, colorful approach lensed with care and precision by cinematographer Xenia Patricia, Manuel takes us into a world where violence and control are exerted with the subtle flick of a wrist or tip of a hat. Painting a scathing portrait of class disparities and post-colonial power structures in ways that are both quiet and unsettling, ‘Filipiñana' announces the arrival of an accomplished writer-director who unflinchingly confronts his country's past, present, and future.” “Filipiñana” is currently seeking distributors at Sundance, with Magnify handling sales. The movie premieres at Sundance on Friday, January 23, though it looks for now like all screenings are sold out until it bows on the online streaming platform.

But one big question remained: Who would actually release the studio's films as they ramped back up after the disappointment of their last release, “Missing Link”? The studio has worked before with everyone from Focus Features to Annapurna Pictures and United Artists Releasing, but as it readied to bring its latest stop-motion effort, “Wildwood,” to theaters, word on who would actually be responsible for its distribution was slim. Two answers, real quick: yes, Fathom Entertainment has been steadily edging into the wider distribution world beyond its bread-and-butter of one-off event screenings around everything from opera to sports events, and no, this is not the first time Laika has teamed up with the group. Laika and Fathom film will open “Wildwood” in theaters nationwide on October 23, 2026. The film's voice cast includes Carey Mulligan, Peyton Elizabeth Lee, Jacob Tremblay, Mahershala Ali, Angela Bassett, Awkwafina, Jake Johnson, Charlie Day, Amandla Stenberg, Jemaine Clement, Maya Erskine, Tantoo Cardinal, Tom Waits, and Richard E. Grant. “Wildwood is a testament to Laika walking its own path,” said David Burke, the studio's chief marketing and operations officer, in an official statement. It's a strategy built specifically for ‘Wildwood,' preserving LAIKA's independence while aligning with world-class collaborators to support the film's ambition.” Our movie is a celebration of artistry over algorithms, and of the belief that films made by hand, with enormous care, can still feel bold, surprising, dangerous, and alive. We designed Wildwood to be seen the way movies first captured our imaginations: discovered in the dark, on a big screen, with a room full of fellow dreamers experiencing joy, silence, and wonder together.” It's just one more step in Laika's big return to the movies. The studio's Live Action subsidiary also has a range of projects in development, including a feature film based on the action thriller novel “Seventeen” by screenwriter John Brownlow; the original script “Crumble,” written and directed by Brian Duffield with Phil Lord and Chris Miller producing; and an original project from Oscar-nominated screenwriter Jon Spaihts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Midnight Oil drummer Rob Hirst has passed away after a three-year battle with pancreatic cancer. “After fighting heroically for almost three years, Rob is now free of pain – ‘a glimmer of tiny light in the wilderness,'” the post reads. Hirst first revealed the news in April 2025 after being diagnosed in 2023, saying at the time: “I've had pretty much every treatment known to man – every scan, ultrasound, MRI. Fellow Australian music icon Jimmy Barnes paid tribute to Hirst's passing in a social media statement. You are irreplaceable, one of a kind, and myself, my family, and all the rest of this great country will miss you so much.” Hoodoo Gurus also paid tribute to Hirst, noting his close friendship with bassist Rick Grossman. “You left this world a far better place than the way you found it,” the band said in a post. “Your creativity, passion and joy has left its mark on all of us, and the strength of your spirit will be an inspiration forever. “Rob was brash, funny and super intelligent, contrary to the clichéd view of drummers,” Moginie wrote in his 2024 memoir, The Silver River. The latter instrumental lineup featured two of his fellow members of Midnight Oil (Jim Moginie and Martin Rotsey) as well as bass player Brian Ritchie from the Violent Femmes. In 2020, Hirst and his daughter Jay O'Shea released a collaborative album.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pitchfork has been publishing album reviews almost every day for 30 years. This simple format has always been the foundation of our site. We practice this obsessive ritual of publishing daily album reviews because we love music and want to deepen our readers' relationship to the artform. Now, I am excited to announce that, for the first time, we are making it possible for that ongoing conversation to happen on Pitchfork.com. Starting today, there is a new Pitchfork subscription that costs $5 a month, which allows readers to score albums themselves, comment on our reviews, and be in dialogue with our critics and each other. Once a review has more than five scores, the aggregate reader score will appear beneath Pitchfork's score on the review. We still believe in the authority and, to be honest, the primacy of Pitchfork's taste—but we want to publish our readers' taste and opinions, too. Subscribers will also have access to Pitchfork's full review archive, which now contains over 30,000 reviews. And casual readers can continue to read four free reviews per month. But to read unlimited reviews, see the reader scores, and comment yourself or read the comments of others, you'll have to smash subscribe. What we're emphasizing by evolving the site to capture the voices and taste of our readers is that music and music criticism are inherently social. The Pitchfork review has always been authoritative. It can sometimes feel like the final word, a monkey peeing in its own mouth etched into a stone slab. But we publish reviews to turn people onto new music we love (or to save them from music we don't) and to create critical discourse. We want our reviews to be generative, and we hope the comments section and other cool new tools on the site will deepen our readers' connection to music and each other. Thanks to every one of you for reading Pitchfork, whether you've been here since Ryan Schreiber was publishing the site out of his parents' home, or you just found us because this letter is making the rounds on X. With your support, we've somehow found ourselves at year 30.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lori Loughlin's ex-husband Mossimo Giannulli, 62, still thinks highly of the “Full House” star despite their marriage ending after a college admissions scandal dubbed “Varsity Blues” ripped through the headlines in 2019. In statements given to People from three separate sources, it was revealed that Giannulli is especially thankful for Loughlin's support of their two daughters, Isabella Rose, 27, and Olivia Jade, 26. Despite wanting “everything resolved quietly,” according to a source, the fashion designer “thinks she's a lovely person and an incredible mom.” After having served a combined seven months in prison following their guilty plea to conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, Loughlin and Giannulli reportedly lost their romantic spark. Loughlin and Giannulli were married for 28 years before they decided to part ways. When Loughlin began to open up about how she was coping following the widespread controversy, the “When Calls the Heart” actress felt compelled to discuss how forgiveness played a big part in her healing process. Stuff happens to everyone,” she told First for Women in 2024. The former couple's daughter Olivia, who, along with Isabella, was not charged in the University of Southern California bribery scandal, opened up on “Red Table Talk” in 2020, saying she didn't want to be “shamed” for the controversy. “What happened was wrong, and I think every single person in my family can look at it and be like, ‘That was messed up; that was a big mistake,' but I think what's so important to me is to learn from the mistake,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While it's well established that some HGTV stars have become good friends off-camera, thanks to all the events they've attended and spin-off shows they've filmed together, many fans are just learning of the bond between two of the network's longtime stars — David Bromstad and Alison Victoria. On January 16, 2026, Victoria dove into the popular social media trend of posting throwback photos and memories from 2016. On Instagram and Facebook, she shared a series of decade-old images, including two of her with Bromstad, star of HGTV's hit series “My Lottery Dream Home.” Victoria wrote in her caption that 2016 was “the year I fell in love and in friendship with @bromco (look at our babyyyy faces),” and fans went wild over the pics and learning of their years-long connection. Victoria has regularly shared pics with other HGTV buddies, like her former “Battle on the Beach” co-stars Taniya Nayak and Ty Pennington, but many fans weren't aware that she's also such good friends with Bromstad. Her throwback post was flooded with comments from people swooning over the idea of them hanging out together. On Instagram, one exclaimed, “Oh [expletive] I'm in love with you both!!! In 2024, Victoria told Realtor.com that her friendships with fellow HGTV stars are genuine, explaining, “They're my favorite people. “We just really love each other,” she continued, “and we really support each other, and that to me is a camaraderie that you just can't fake.” Back in 2016, Victoria was the star of HGTV's “Kitchen Crashers,” a popular show that was the precursor to her series “Windy City Rehab” and 2025's “Sin City Rehab.” Ten years prior, in 2006, Bromstad was the first-ever winner of “HGTV Design Star” and landed his first show, “Color Splash,” which aired from 2007 to 2013. By 2016, he'd filmed one season of “My Lottery Dream Home,” but HGTV was struggling to find lottery winners who wanted to be on the show. It wasn't until season three that the series exploded in popularity. In 2015, he and Victoria appeared at a big HGTV event held in Nashville during the CMAs, but it wasn't until the following year that they really clicked, according to Victoria's post. Victoria wrote in her caption, “2016… you probably wouldn't have been as much if I stopped drinking back then. It was the year I fell in love and in friendship with @bromco (look at our babyyyy faces) and @guyfieri and @billycorgan, the year I went platinum blonde and all my hair broke off, the year I traveled more than a human should, but don't regret one.single.moment of doing so, the year I had my face plastered all over the streets of New York, the year I saved A LOT of dogs, the year I shot my 9th and final season of Kitchen Crashers…and the year that I clearly didn't stick to my resolutions. Interestingly, both Victoria and Bromstad shared their sober journeys with fans in 2025. In June, Victoria revealed on her podcast that she'd quit drinking eight months before, and Bromstad opened up in December about his struggles with substance abuse.
