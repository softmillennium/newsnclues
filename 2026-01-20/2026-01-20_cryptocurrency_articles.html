                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A version of this article appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on January 20. Ethereum transactions are soaring — but scams seem to be driving the surge. On January 16, daily transactions hit an all-time high of more than 2.8 million, according to data from BitInfoCharts. “Mass address poisoning attacks are a persistent issue, and it's getting worse,” Gonçalo Magalhães, head of security at Immunefi, a crypto bug bounty and security platform, told me. Such attacks are like spam phishing emails — low cost and low success rate, but if just one or two of the thousands of people targeted fall for them then it's worth it for the attacker. “Over the past seven days alone, we've been detecting more than one million address poisoning preparations per day on Ethereum, underscoring the scale at which these campaigns are currently operating,” Michael Pearl, a vice president at crypto security firm Cyvers, told me. The increased bandwidth also means mass address poisoning attacks have become much cheaper for scammers to pull off. Additionally, Magalhães said, recent Ethereum user experience upgrades, such as those enabling account abstraction, have made it easier for users to inadvertently sign a transaction they don't fully understand. Just as services like Google's Gmail scan email attachments for viruses and warn users of attacks, crypto wallets also need to provide warnings to stop users falling for address poisoning. “We also need more adoption of naming systems like ENS, because human-readable identifiers make lookalike address attacks harder.” Rabby, for example, warns users if they've never interacted with an address before when sending funds, assesses potential transactions for suspicious activity, and flags phishing-related transfers in a user's transaction history. But until more wallets adopt these features, crypto users will have to remain extra vigilant.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin dominance holds steady around 59%, creating room for selective altcoin moves without forcing defensive positioning. XRP processed 1.45M transactions on January 13, a 180-day high, while ETF inflows exceeded $1.3B, yet the price remained stuck near $2.10 Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is holding its ground while activity shifts toward networks showing real usage. XRP's (CRYPTO: XRP) ledger just hit a 180-day transaction high, Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) is quietly outperforming on throughput and returns near $145, and capital appears to be rotating to altcoins rather than rushing. Instead of broad speculation, the market is rewarding function, speed, and settlement demand. The spike followed a steady upward trend that began in late 2025, coinciding with new payment corridors through Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity platform and stablecoin integrations like RLUSD. This gap between activity and price often appears early in crypto rotation cycles. When networks process more value without speculative excess, repricing tends to lag. Analysts tracking filtered payment data note mid-sized transfers are rising, pointing to operational demand rather than short-term noise. Its efficiency in cross-border settlement keeps it relevant for institutional use cases that don't depend on headline momentum. Solana pulled ahead as capital prioritizes speed and throughput over macro narratives. A price near $145 masks stronger relative performance, as network activity continues to expand while Bitcoin and Ethereum stall. Daily transactions remain elevated, driven by DeFi flows, trading activity, and applications requiring fast settlement without cost friction. What stands out is how closely price strength tracks usage. High transaction counts, rising DEX volumes, and stablecoin movement suggest Solana is absorbing real flow, not short-lived speculation. Recent infrastructure upgrades improved reliability, helping developers stay active even as Ethereum traffic fragments across Layer 2s. This operational consistency explains why rotation capital keeps favoring Solana during risk-on windows. Instead of pulling liquidity away from everything else, Bitcoin is holding its share while letting select altcoins breathe. That balance has historically allowed focused rallies to develop without forcing traders into defensive positioning. Past cycles show flat Bitcoin dominance levels often precede crypto rotation into assets with real usage—not broad speculation. Capital spreads outward in controlled moves, rewarding networks showing growth rather than chasing narratives. From a structural perspective, stable Bitcoin dominance suggests crypto rotation rather than panic or euphoria. Bitcoin remains the anchor, but it's no longer crowding out opportunities. If this balance holds, altcoins can continue advancing on fundamentals rather than momentum alone. They start on-chain, where rising activity shows up before prices move. During 2017 and again in 2021, transaction spikes across major networks appeared weeks before prices reacted. XRP's payment volumes and early high-throughput chains showed steady growth while prices drifted sideways. About three weeks later, capital rotated out of Bitcoin once dominance cooled. Liquidity followed usage, not technical patterns, and altcoins repriced sharply as conviction formed. Bitcoin stabilizes, on-chain activity builds, then markets respond once data holds long enough to feel credible. XRP activity sits near long-term highs, while Solana continues to lead in throughput and daily transactions. Payment velocity, whale transfers, and DEX volumes are rising first—with prices lagging behind. It reflects how capital moves cautiously, waiting for confirmation rather than chasing noise. When catalysts arrive—whether upgrades, regulatory clarity, or ETF expansion—prices often catch up quickly. If activity fades, momentum stalls, and history suggests patience rewards those watching usage, not intraday swings. XRP's on-chain activity is elevated, Solana continues showing relative strength with gains, and the Altcoin Season Index climbed from 37 in late December to above 50 in early January. What the data shows looks more like early crypto rotation than full participation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On-chain trading platform Magic Eden, previously known as the largest Solana NFT marketplace, said it will begin directing 15% of all platform revenue into the ME token ecosystem, starting on Feb. 1. Buybacks are often implemented by projects to boost the token price, as buybacks imply that circulating token supply is reduced. Despite the news, ME is trading about 6.5% lower over the past 24 hours, and remains over 95% down since its launch in December 2024, according to CoinGecko data. Magic Eden clarified that USDC rewards will be distributed “based on staking power,” which depends on both how much ME is staked and how long it is locked. Stakers must claim their rewards within 90 days, per the announcement. At a 15% allocation rate, that would translate to roughly $3.6 million flowing into the ME ecosystem each year, if revenue holds at similar levels. If half of that were set aside for USDC rewards, a total of roughly $1.8 million could be available as rewards for stakers, though individual payouts will vary The former NFT marketplace announced its pivot into broader crypto trading, specifically memecoins, in April of last year when it acquired on-chain trading platform Slingshot. The same month, fellow leading NFT marketplace OpenSea made a similar move, launching Solana token trading. Know what matters in Crypto and Web3 with The Defiant Daily newsletter, Mon to Fri</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The NFT sector may be experiencing stagnation, but it is certainly not dead. The NFT sector may be experiencing stagnation, but it is certainly not dead. This view was expressed by Yat Siu, co-founder of Animoca Brands, in an interview with CoinDesk. “I am a big collector myself and share similar views with my colleagues in this field. […] For instance, a Picasso collector will feel a connection with everyone else who buys the artist's paintings; you are kind of part of that club. The same goes for Ferrari, Lamborghini, or Rolex watches. He acknowledged that his personal NFT portfolio “has dropped by about 80%,” but considers these assets long-term and significant, rather than speculative. Siu noted that the monthly trading volume of non-fungible tokens is currently around $300 million. Major investors like Adam Weitsman, who buys expensive NFTs such as Bored Apes and Otherdeed virtual land plots, now play a key role in the sector. “Remember, five years ago this was a market with zero capitalization. So everything is relative and depends on the perspective. However, Siu attributed this not to market issues, but to changes in the regulatory climate and security problems in France. Previously crypto-friendly, the country has tightened its policy on digital assets. Many people, including myself, tried to avoid Paris a bit precisely because of security issues,” noted the expert. During that period, NFT sales volume exceeded $23 billion. Amid the extensive and prolonged correction, many crypto exchanges, including Bybit and Kraken, as well as larger companies like GameStop, closed their NFT trading platforms. They were joined by the British auction giant Christie's. Recently, Magic Eden's head Jack Lu announced a change in the company's development vector. Currently, the only successful NFT segment is Telegram gifts. Back in July, Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko called meme coins and NFTs “digital junk.” Ethereum's Transaction Surge Linked to Spam Attack, Researcher Claims Major Hacks Spell Doom for 80% of Crypto Protocols, Experts Say We use cookies to improve the quality of our service.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While some traders believe tokenization could benefit established blockchains such as Ethereum and XRP, the NYSE has not identified any public network for settlement. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) said it is developing a blockchain-based platform for trading and on-chain settlement of tokenized securities, a move that has fueled speculation among traders about potential spillover effects for assets such as Ethereum and XRP. The initiative, announced by NYSE parent Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), would support continuous trading, faster settlement, and tokenized funding mechanisms. While NYSE has not endorsed the use of any public blockchain or cryptocurrency, bullish comments from exchange executives and figures in the crypto industry have amplified speculation online. Subject to regulatory approval, the platform would power a new NYSE trading venue supporting fungible tokenized shares that are interchangeable with conventional securities, as well as natively issued digital securities. NYSE executives have described the platform as part of a long-term effort to modernize market infrastructure rather than a pivot toward crypto trading. “For more than two centuries, the NYSE has transformed the way markets operate,” Lynn Martin, president of NYSE Group, said in a statement. Bullish reactions from crypto industry executives have also contributed to trader interest. Ripple executive Reece Merrick described the NYSE plan as “big,” while Galaxy Digital head of research Alex Thorn called the initiative an “important step.” Some traders have speculated that broader institutional adoption of tokenization could increase demand for blockchain networks that already support tokenized real-world assets, including Ethereum and XRP. Following the announcement, users on X debated which blockchain might ultimately be used, with some pointing to Ethereum based on its existing infrastructure and experience supporting tokenized assets. “It's got to be Ethereum, obviously,” said one X user. NYSE has not identified any public blockchain for settlement, and market structure experts note that regulated U.S. equity markets are likely to rely on permissioned digital infrastructure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here's why ETH price is failing to rise alongside active addresses | Credit: Hameem Sarwar Ethereum (ETH) has presented a startling divergence between on-chain utility and market valuation. Yet Ethereum's price still stalls below $3,500, currently hovering around $3,200 at this writing. That gap is the story right now. So, why is ETH struggling to keep pace with the rise in active addresses, and what could this imply for the price? Etherscan-based trackers show daily transactions spiking to record levels in mid-January, with prints around 2.8 million per day. Even more interesting, Glassnode-cited reporting says the “new user” cohort is growing fast. That looks like onboarding, not just leveraging churn. Typically, the rise in these metrics should be bullish for Ethereum's price. Coinbase pulled support for the Senate's draft CLARITY Act on Jan. 14, 2026. That move slowed the “regulatory clarity” trade. However, it also changes who holds the bag. But they also buy less aggressively on breakouts. Liquidation data shows a heavy pocket of short liquidations sitting just above $3,400. Bulls hesitate because they know the fight will be violent. Put it together, and ETH's current price action starts to make sense. Yet macro and positioning keep price pinned. That is why the next move could be sharp. If spot demand stays real and ETH clears $3,400 to $3,500, the squeeze dynamics can flip fast. However, if it fails again, the market may keep valuing Ethereum's price like a range trade, even while the chain runs at full speed. While ETH can still trend higher over the long run, this short-term signal argues against a clean breakout. The number of addresses holding ≥10,000 ETH has been falling for three straight months. That matters because this cohort usually represents whales, treasuries, significant funds, and long-duration allocators. When this metric declines, it often means one of two things is happening. First, big holders may be reducing exposure. That behavior adds supply at key levels and makes it harder for the price to punch through resistance, such as the $3,500 region. Either way, the signal can affect price through liquidity. That rejection matters because it shows sellers still control the supply zone, and buyers have not forced a clean trend expansion yet. The Money Flow Index (MFI) has dropped sharply, which signals weaker inflows and fading demand. When the MFI falls like this after a rejection, ETH often drifts toward support because buyers stop stepping in with the same urgency. Notably, ETH's price has slipped below the 20-day EMA (blue), a move that usually signals a shift from “buy-the-dip” to “sell-the-rally”. In other words, the 20 EMA is no longer providing support. If this setup holds, Ethereum's price risks breaking the support near $3,100. If that level gives way, the next move could cut below the $3,000 psychological mark, especially if volume rises on down candles. Still, the bearish case is not set in stone. If buying pressure returns and ETH reclaims the 20 EMA, it could quickly reset momentum. A break above $3,438 would invalidate the immediate downside threat and signal that demand is strong enough to absorb sellers. In that bullish scenario, ETH could rally toward $3,942.

Trove Markets has come under intense scrutiny after confirming it will retain roughly $9.4 million from a token sale that was originally marketed around a planned integration with Hyperliquid, despite pivoting its perps DEX to Solana just days before its token launch. This led its newly launched TROVE token to collapse by more than 95% minutes after trading began. TROVE launched with an expected market capitalization of about $20 million, but within ten minutes of going live, the token plunged to around $0.0008, cutting its valuation to under $2 million, as shown by  DEXScreener data. That shift immediately raised questions about whether funds collected for the Hyperliquid build should be returned. With that support gone, the team said it no longer made sense to continue building on Hyperliquid rails and opted to rebuild the perps exchange on Solana from scratch. Trove said the decision fundamentally changed its constraints and forced a reset rather than pushing forward with what it described as an uncertain setup. Trove said it had already refunded about $2.44 million as part of cleaning up participation and protecting distribution integrity, with an additional $100,000 slated to be refunded automatically to ICO participants. The remaining funds, it said, have been spent or earmarked for developer salaries, frontend and backend infrastructure, a chief technology officer, advisory services, marketing, and operating costs. On X, some users accused the project of breaking fundraising expectations, arguing that money raised to build on Hyperliquid should not be repurposed after a last-minute pivot. Give back the money and raise on solana if you think that's what your community really wants Others went further, calling for refunds, threatening legal action, or alleging the situation could result in lawsuits. 2/ $TROVE launched earlier today and quickly dropped -90%• The presale was at $20M FDV• It now trades around $2M FDV https://t.co/HHABuaSnz7 pic.twitter.com/2FhDwew2IX The turmoil follows an already chaotic ICO process earlier in January.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home » News » India Proposes BRICS CBDC Interoperability to Boost Cross-Border Payments The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced on January 19 that it is preparing a proposal to promote interoperability among central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) within the BRICS bloc. 🚨RBI has proposed linking the digital currency of BRICS nations to ease cross border trade and tourism payments. Market participants are closely watching whether CBDCs can eventually offer convenience comparable to major cryptocurrencies and altcoins. India introduced the digital rupee in December 2022 and has reportedly reached around 7 million users. The RBI has also encouraged fintech innovation by allowing private companies to develop CBDC-compatible wallets using crypto wallet technology, further strengthening the digital currency ecosystem. The United States has expressed concern over initiatives that bypass dollar-based settlement systems, and former President Donald Trump previously criticized BRICS as “anti-American,” warning of potential tariff measures. Indian officials maintain that de-dollarization is not the primary objective, but analysts note that interoperable BRICS CBDCs could nonetheless reduce reliance on the US dollar by providing an alternative cross-border settlement mechanism. Amid shifting global monetary dynamics, investor interest in Bitcoin (BTC) as a diversification and hedge asset remains strong. Differences in payment infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, and technical standards across BRICS nations complicate the creation of a unified CBDC system. To address these issues, policymakers are reportedly exploring mechanisms such as central bank currency swap agreements and periodic settlement models on a weekly or monthly basis. While CBDC development accelerates, the RBI continues to take a cautious view of privately issued stablecoins. Deputy Governor T. Rabi Sankar has warned that stablecoins may pose risks to financial stability, reiterating the central bank's position that CBDCs offer a safer, more controlled alternative.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin and major altcoins reversed recent gains, with traders reacting to fresh tariff headlines and the possibility of escalating economic retaliation on both sides of the Atlantic. While crypto is often viewed as a separate market, this move once again showed how quickly digital assets can behave like high-beta risk trades when macro uncertainty spikes. According to analyst Darkfost, the liquidation impact was immediate and aggressive. More than $800 million worth of leveraged positions were wiped out in a matter of hours, including roughly $768 million in long liquidations. The scale of long closures suggests that traders were positioned for continuation to the upside, but were caught offside as prices rolled over sharply. What stood out most was where the damage occurred. Darkfost noted that Hyperliquid recorded the largest share of forced liquidations, with $241 million, while Bybit followed closely with $220 million. The wave of liquidations appears partly tied to the announcement of new tariffs targeting Europe, which triggered an equally fast response from EU policymakers, reigniting the broader “trade war” narrative across markets. As soon as CME trading opened, Bitcoin saw a sharp downside move, suggesting that institutional flows and macro-linked positioning played a direct role in the shakeout. In past risk-off episodes, the CME open has often acted like a volatility trigger, especially when markets are already fragile, and leverage is elevated across major exchanges. This is why the next few hours are critical. If sellers press again, the market could see another cascade of forced closures, particularly in high-beta altcoins that remain vulnerable after the overnight wipeout. Darkfost adds that attention should remain on incoming political updates. Further statements could arrive at any moment, and as history has shown, Trump often delivers market-moving headlines right in the middle of the weekend. Bitcoin Holds Fragile Rebound As Crypto Tests Macro Nerves Bitcoin is trading near $93,100 after a sharp rejection from the $96,000–$97,000 supply zone. However, the rebound remains vulnerable as long as BTC stays trapped beneath resistance and fails to reclaim the mid-$90,000s with conviction. The recent candles also highlight hesitation, with wicks suggesting aggressive selling into strength. If Bitcoin holds above that level, it keeps the recovery structure intact and prevents a deeper reset toward prior liquidity pockets. Risk appetite can return quickly, but it requires Bitcoin to break above resistance and hold. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many developing countries see this as a risk to their economic and political stability, especially during global conflicts. Another reason why BRICS CBDC linkage matters is the faster and cheaper transactions. If BRICS countries can settle trades directly using their digital currencies, the system could make payments much quicker, cut the costs of exchanging money, and avoid the slow, multi-step process of using US dollars, which adds fees and wait times. However, the US is concerned about actions that avoid using its currency. Past US comments have labeled BRICS projects as “anti-American,” a stance that could lead to increased trade or political tensions. India has always been careful about private cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, XRP, and Ether. Because of this cautious stance, India's crypto market has grown more slowly than others, as it faces challenges like high taxes, unclear rules, and the RBI's general skepticism. Still, this doesn't automatically mean they'll embrace cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Plus, the Indian central bank's cautious stance means that any new rules for private crypto will likely be introduced slowly and carefully.
