                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Supernatural" creator Eric Kripke has said he always wanted the Winchesters' 1967 Chevy Impala to be a third character on the show. After all, it's essentially a home for Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) while they cruise America's haunted highways, saving people and hunting things. Kripke has credited a neighbor with steering him toward the vehicle that would become known as Baby. "When I told my neighbor in Venice [California], who was a mechanic, that I wanted a bada** car and was thinking of a '65 Mustang, he said, 'Yeah, a Mustang is the perfect car if you're a p**sy,'" Kripke recalled in an interview with TV Insider. It was fitting, then, that Ackles and Padalecki were each gifted their own Impalas after filming the final episode. "The first song I listened to when I got in [my] Impala was 'Carry On Wayward Son,'" Padalecki told TV Insider, referencing the Kansas track that accompanies many scenes of Sam and Dean driving around in episodes of "Supernatural." Recalling his work on the series during a Reddit AMA, the creator recalled wanting to kit the vehicle out with unique gadgets that could have made the Winchester brothers take cues from classic pop culture spy stories — but he opted not to follow through with it. "In the pilot, we explored adding James Bond-style switches to the Impala dash — to release oil, or salt. But then we realized that was stupid." While salt could have been useful in the Winchesters' battles with demons and spirits, the idea was nixed quite quickly. In the end, Baby didn't need hidden gadgets or spy tricks, because its real power came from becoming an emotional anchor — a symbol of home, brotherhood, and the road that defined "Supernatural" for 15 seasons.</p>

Independent Film Company and Shudder have acquired Saccharine ahead of its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival this week, Variety has learned.

From writer-director Natalie Erika James (Relic, Apartment 7A), the supernatural body horror film will be released in North America and UK theaters before streaming on Shudder at some point in 2026.

The Australian production follows lovelorn medical student Hana, who becomes terrorized by a sinister force after taking part in an obscure weight loss craze: eating human ashes.

Midori Francis (“Grey's Anatomy”), Danielle Macdonald (Patti Cake$), and Madeleine Madden (“The Wheel of Time”) star.

James reunites with Relic producers Anna McLeish and Sarah Shaw on the project.

“I'm absolutely thrilled to be working with IFC and Shudder again after our experience releasing Relic together in 2020,” said James. “They're an incredible team with a deep understanding of genre and a real commitment to filmmakers.”

“Natalie announced herself as a singular force with her haunting debut Relic, a film that we were privileged to bring to audiences in 2020 via IFC Midnight,” added Emily Gotto, senior vice president of acquisitions and productions at Shudder. “With Saccharine, she returns with a chilling, utterly original vision that pierces our deepest obsessions with body image, reaffirming her work as a leading voice in genre cinema.”

Saccharine is produced by Carver Films and Thrum Films. It was financed by Screen Australia in conjunction with XYZ Films, IPR.VC, and Stan, in association with VicScreen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2021's The Black Phone is one of my favorite recent horror films because of how seamlessly it tied supernatural occurrences to its serial killer plot. Now that its 2025 sequel, Black Phone 2, is available on streaming, I'm happy to report that it's one of the best horror sequels I've seen in a hot minute. Stylistically, it couldn't be further from its predecessor, but not in a jarring way. Picking up four years after the 2021 film left off, Black Phone 2 is menacing thanks to its setting and cinematography, and Ethan Hawke's performance as the elusive and supernaturally dangerous Grabber is the stuff of nightmares. The film's influences are clear, but its willingness to stay in its own lane makes for a captivating watch that never feels like a ripoff or cheap carbon copy of what inspired its worldbuilding. We're reintroduced to Finney (Mason Thames), who escaped the Grabber's (Ethan Hawke) clutches during his 1978 crime spree. Instead, the spotlight shifts to his younger sister Gwen (Madeleine McGraw), who is now experiencing sleepwalking episodes punctuated by disturbing visions of the Grabber. Those visions lead Gwen, Finney, and their friend Ernesto (Miguel Mora) to Alpine Lake Camp, where the Grabber began abducting and killing children back in 1957. Channeling some serious Freddy Krueger energy, the Grabber targets Gwen in her dreams, where any physical harm she sustains while unconscious carries over into the real world. Though Black Phone 2 is technically a period piece, it benefits greatly from being set primarily in a cabin located deep in the wilderness. You don't need a lot of vintage cars to sell the era when trees, snow, and isolated cabins are effectively timeless. What truly elevates Black Phone 2 is its use of different cameras and image quality as visual shorthand. Gwen's dream sequences appear grainy and distorted, while scenes set in the waking world are presented with much higher clarity. This approach strips away any ambiguity and sets the film apart from A Nightmare on Elm Street. Establishing this language early allows for sharp, effective cuts between realms that clearly show how the Grabber's influence crosses planes of existence. While there's no real mystery driving Black Phone 2, its deliberate buildup, wide establishing shots of a brutal wilderness, and frantic crossover between the dream realm and waking life create several deeply unsettling sequences that linger long after the credits roll. Ethan Hawke is an absolute monster as the Grabber, fully committed to playing a modern analog to Freddy Krueger while still making the character his own. There are a couple of quick exposition dumps, but they feel earned, clearly motivated by pacing rather than a lack of trust in the audience. Finney is still clearly haunted by his encounter with the Grabber, but he's smart enough to recognize that Gwen shouldn't face this alone as they work toward ending the nightmare once and for all. Having earned $132 million at the box office against its reported $30 million production budget, it feels inevitable that the film series will continue. Everyone involved has expressed interest in returning, but only if quality remains the priority. Until a story worthy of further expansion takes shape, we're left waiting to see how, and when, the Grabber finds his way back for another rampage. As of this writing, Black Phone 2 is streaming on Peacock.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Luann de Lesseps‘ daughter, 31-year-old Victoria de Lesseps, opened up about her career as a psychic medium and healer during an interview last week, sharing that she once rid the Real Housewives of New York City alum's house of a ghost. As she also reflected on an “extreme” meeting she had with a healer that left her “very, very scared and freaked out,” Victoria explained what led her to the trade as she recalled past interactions with the ghost living at her mother's vacation home and confirmed she helped him move on from the residence. “Even [as] a young kid, I used to see some ghosts. Again in my teens,” Victoria, who Luann shares with ex-husband Count Alexandre de Lesseps, 76, revealed during a January 16 interview with Page Six. According to Victoria, her father's late mother was a “white witch” who practiced radiesthesia. Instead, they “faded away” until about three or four years ago, when a “series of events,” including a split, “led to an upswing” that fueled her past trauma. At that time, Victoria, who graduated from Pratt Institute, opened up to a gallery owner who was displaying some of her artwork. “I was kind of talking really openly, and she was like, ‘You gotta go see my healer, Lisa,'” she revealed. A lot of purging was going on. And I saw this very tall — now I know, spirit guide — standing next to me: big, kind of native, all in shadow with a big jaguar,” she recalled. While the session frightened Victoria, Lisa noticed something unique about her and told her she should pursue a career in the field. Although I'm super grateful and absolutely love it, I didn't see it coming,” she admitted. During one of her training sessions at Luann's house in the Hamptons, Victoria and another trainee came face-to-face with a ghost. And [my classmate] was like, ‘Hey, there's a ghost in your house! And I was like, ‘Yeah, he is here,'” she shared. “My mom's actually engaged with it before,” she continued. Like, I see something there,'” she explained. Once she gained understanding from the ghost, he “warmed up” to her. And I sensed there was something with [his] wife. So he was kind of just chilling in the house,” she said, noting that they “spoke casually.” “I was like, ‘Oh, do you want to leave? After the ghost left Luann's home, Victoria helped other ghosts “move on.” They need to share their story,” she explained. In addition to psychic readings and healing sessions, Victoria also offers past-life readings and tarot card readings, and she is writing a fantasy trilogy series based on “shamanic characters,” “oracles,” and “healers” in an “alternate universe.” Luann is also mom to Noel de Lesseps, 29. Reality Blurb was created to bring readers the latest and up to date reality TV news, updates and exclusive interviews.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Either the paranormal is real, in which case this should be accepted by the wider scientific community which currently rejects such claims; or else belief in and experience of ostensibly paranormal phenomena can be fully explained in terms of psychological factors. This presentation will provide an introduction to the sub-discipline of anomalistic psychology, which may be defined as the study of extraordinary phenomena of behaviour and experience, in an attempt to provide non-paranormal explanations in terms of known psychological and physical factors. This approach will be illustrated with examples relating to a range of ostensibly paranormal phenomena. Up until 2024, he was Head of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Far-right conspiracy theories and misinformation about the Vondelkerk fire are being widely shared on social media, NOS reports based on research by the Justice for Prosperity Foundation. According to Jelle Postma, a former officer at the intelligence service AIVD and the director of Justice for Prosperity, these posts are part of a deliberate disinformation campaign. Similar stories also started circulating on other social media platforms. From that moment on, the misinformation spread rapidly. “A snowball really turned into an avalanche here,” Postma said. The message was consistently that the church fire was an attack on Christians, and that Muslims and a “left-wing elite” were behind it. The Vondelkerk fire is not an isolated case when it comes to misinformation campaigns, Claes de Vreese, a professor of political communication at the University of Amsterdam, told the broadcaster. “You see anonymous accounts making suggestions about a local event. “These kinds of influencers have a political and commercial interest in doing this.” “But you see that it has an impact on various levels. From a young Muslim being confronted on a football field about an incident, to right-wing parties adopting certain rhetoric.” And what makes things even more complicated is that these kinds of claims are almost impossible to debunk. And if the authorities come to a conclusion that doesn't match the misinformation spreaders' opinion, they could always create more uproar by claiming a cover-up. According to Postma, more research needs to be conducted into the people and networks that deliberately spread disinformation. “You can moderate content, but if there's an incentive to spread disinformation, it will continue to happen,” he said. “Sometimes you have to protect democracy for itself. It would be good if there were a political discussion about this,” Postma said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2025 Africa Cup of Nations has not only showcased Morocco's organizational success but also exposed a growing surge of conspiracy‑driven narratives among certain African football federations. What began as made-up complaints escalated into a pattern of unverified accusations, particularly from Senegal, Egypt, and Algeria, even as Morocco received international praise for its hosting standards. Independent reporting, however, showed that the players were surrounded largely by enthusiastic supporters seeking photos and greetings, with no documented security breaches or criminal incidents. Firstpost noted that the scene involved excited fans pressing for selfies rather than any form of targeted threat. Despite the sharply worded communiqués, Senegal's political leadership conveyed a markedly different tone. Analysts observed that such actions reinforced the narrative of grievance and contributed to the perception of coordinated provocation claims rather than genuine competitive disputes. Senegal was not the only federation to adopt this tone. After Egypt's elimination, coach Hossam Hassan repeatedly claimed unfair treatment, hinted at hidden agendas, and described rival nations as “jealous,” sparking backlash from Egyptian analysts who labelled the rhetoric as unfounded and harmful to the country's sporting image. Morocco's response throughout the rising speculation focused firmly on defusing conspiratorial narratives. National team coach Walid Regragui dismissed allegations of referee favoritism and described such claims as a longstanding phenomenon in African football. As Morocco raises the bar in infrastructure, logistics, and sporting delivery, tensions among rival federations appear to manifest more readily as accusations of unfairness rather than technical or performance‑based assessments. The 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) to start this Sunday in Morocco is a crucial stepping stone in the country's ambitious journey to become a global football powerhouse and a significant dress rehearsal for its co-hosting duties at the 2030 World Cup, says British newspaper “The Independent”.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A mysterious UFO has been allegedly stored at a little-known US Navy base on the East Coast for decades as the military continues to reverse-engineer its secrets. A new report has claimed that Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland, better known as Pax River, has kept an 'exotic vehicle of unknown origin' secretly housed there, possibly since the 1950s. According to anonymous sources tied to Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), which is headquartered at Pax River, certain military programs at the base have been involved in analyzing and exploiting technology recovered from non-human craft for years. NAVAIR is a major part of the US Navy, which handles everything related to naval aircraft, weapons, and aviation systems. One is allegedly drones from China, and the other are non-human UFOs. Although the claims could not be confirmed by the Daily Mail, UFO whistleblower Luis Elizondo stated in written testimony to Congress that a specially built hangar was constructed at Pax River specifically for the transfer of extraterrestrial technology. Under oath, Elizondo described a plan where this hangar would help major defense contractor Lockheed Martin move non-human technology to another company called Bigelow Aerospace for further study and analysis. The Daily Mail has reached out to Lockheed Martin for comment. Bigelow Aerospace went dormant as a company in 2020, laying off its entire workforce during the Covid pandemic. According to the sources who spoke to Liberation Times, the US government allegedly has a secret contingency plan for moving the unidentified craft if its specific location at Pax River becomes publicly known or is threatened by further spying. Although Elizondo claimed that a new facility was built at Pax River just for these UFO transfers, the anonymous sources said none of them took place after the CIA's former director of science and technology blocked companies from gaining access. Elizondo is a former senior intelligence official who worked at the Pentagon, where he led a secret government program called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). AATIP studied unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), the new name for UFOs, determining if they were a possible threat to national security. Additionally, Elizondo's testimony noted that these programs have successfully reverse-engineered some of this technology and that the US was now in possession of advanced non-human equipment, including at bases like Pax River. 'These facilities included locations in the Las Vegas area and a newly built hangar at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station (“PAX”),' Elizondo said in his testimony. Although the US military has said there has never been any physical evidence of UFOs recovered, multiple former government employees and scientists have come forward to claim that several vehicles have been recovered since the 1940s. Although there was no evidence to confirm it, Puthoff claimed that some of these craft were actually fully intact craft that had been 'gifted' to humans by extraterrestrials. The bizarre drone swarms appeared to focus on US military installations as well as other key sites, including President Trump's property in New Jersey. However, an unnamed private firm contracted by the US military eventually took responsibility for the drone swarms, claiming they were conducting tests of their advanced aerial craft, according to off-the-record comments at an Army summit in August 2025.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The university administration announced the decision through an emergency notice issued at around 3:00 pm on Monday (January 19) and via email to students. Earlier, on Sunday (January 18) evening, separate notices signed by the university registrar confirmed the dismissal of Assistant Professor Layeka Bashir and Associate Professor Dr. ASM Mohsin from the Department of Basic Science and Humanities. The controversy began on December 10, when Assistant Professor Layeka Bashir shared a critical post on her personal Facebook account regarding the cultural practice of covering one's face with a veil. After the post circulated widely on social media, a section of current and former students labeled it “religiously offensive” and launched protests. Layeka Bashir has alleged that following the post, she faced threats and abusive remarks. Tensions escalated on the first day of the new semester at the University of Asia Pacific (UAP) as a section of current and former students held protests, press conferences, and sit-in demonstrations on campus. Shortly afterward, the university administration decided to dismiss two faculty members. Protesting students claimed that the dismissed teachers made anti-Islamic statements and showed political bias. However, students opposing the dismissals argued that the move was a targeted campaign to “tag” one teacher and exert mob pressure.
