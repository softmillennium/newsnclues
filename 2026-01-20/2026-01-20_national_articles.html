                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When news breaks, you need to understand what actually matters. At Vox, our mission is to help you make sense of the world — and that work has never been more vital. But we can't do it on our own. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The Supreme Court's Republican majority spent much of Tuesday morning trying to figure out how two mutually exclusive principles can both be true at the same time. One principle is that all Second Amendment cases must be judged using a bespoke legal rule that only applies to the Second Amendment. The other principle is that the right to bear arms must not be treated differently than other constitutional rights. Four years ago, in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022), the Republican justices struck down a century-old New York law that required anyone who wishes to carry a handgun in public to demonstrate “proper cause” before they could obtain a license allowing them to do so. While the law at issue in Bruen directly banned most people from carrying a gun in public, Hawaii's law tries to achieve this same goal indirectly by requiring gun owners to obtain explicit permission from a business's owner or manager before they can bring a gun into that business. Because few businesses are likely to grant such permission — and few gun owners are likely to go into a business unarmed, ask the manager for permission, and then return with their weapon — Hawaii's law is likely to operate as an effective ban on firearms in most public spaces. But Bruen also announced a bizarre legal rule that applies only in Second Amendment cases. This bespoke rule for Second Amendment cases is so vague and ill-defined that judges from across the political spectrum have complained that it is impossible to apply. But, in Wolford, Hawaii's lawyers made a very strong argument that their law should survive Bruen. Their brief names an array of old laws that are very similar to the Hawaii law at issue in Wolford. A 1771 New Jersey law, for example, barred people from bringing “any gun on any Lands not his own, and for which the owner pays taxes, or is in his lawful possession, unless he has license or permission in writing from the owner.” A similar 1763 New York law made it unlawful to carry a gun on “inclosed Land” without “License in Writing first had and obtained for that Purpose from such Owner, Proprietor, or Possessor.” And these are just two examples of the kinds of laws that existed in the 1700s that resemble Hawaii's law. But it turns out that none of this history actually matters, as all six of the Court's Republicans — including Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who did have some tough questions for lawyers on both sides of the case — signaled Tuesday that they are likely to strike the law down. Chief Justice John Roberts, for example, suggested that the First Amendment does not permit a state to forbid people from knocking on a private property owner's door and asking for their vote. Similarly, Justice Samuel Alito accused Neal Katyal, the lawyer for Hawaii, of “just relegating the Second Amendment to second-class status.” But if Roberts and Alito don't like the fact that Second Amendment cases are treated differently than First Amendment cases, they have no one but themselves to blame. So a court that fairly applies the Bruen test will sometimes reach different results than they would if they applied the legal rules that apply in First Amendment cases. If Roberts and Alito don't like this reality, the obvious solution is to overrule Bruen. When a modern-day gun law is not similar to gun laws from the 1790s, the Republican justices can apply Bruen and strike down the modern-day law under Bruen's good-for-the-Second-Amendment-only legal standard. One other sign that the Hawaii law is in trouble is that several of the Republican justices tried to embarrass Katyal, because one of the many examples of old laws cited in his brief was probably enacted for nefarious reasons. One of the old laws Katyal cites in his brief is a post-Reconstruction law, enacted by Louisiana, which allegedly was enacted in order to disarm Black people on private land. In any event, if Louisiana were the only state to require gun owners to obtain a property owner's permission before bringing a gun onto their land, then that historical example would undercut Hawaii's legal argument significantly. And the fact that Louisiana may have enacted one racist gun law does not invalidate all of the other examples of similar laws in Katyal's brief. The bottom line is that several states historically enacted laws similar to Hawaii's law, and all but one of those laws appear to have been enacted for benign reasons. But the Court's Republican majority does not appear interested in applying Bruen when they do not like the outcome it produces. And when Bruen's historical test cuts in the other direction, the Republican justices appear to believe that they cannot apply Bruen, because that would mean treating the Second Amendment differently than other constitutional rights. ﻿Why the nation's movies, video games, and toys went global in 2025. A small but meaningful split among Republicans is emerging. ﻿Satellites are our only insight into the ongoing conflict — and worth protecting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• The Justice Department plans to subpoena Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison related to an investigation of possible obstruction of federal officers during recent protests, two sources said. • DOJ appealed a judge's ruling that federal agents in Minnesota can't arrest or use pepper spray on peaceful protesters or stop people in their cars without cause. • DOJ launched a separate investigation after demonstrators interrupted Sunday service at a church where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent reportedly preaches. Minneapolis-area police leadership say over the last two weeks especially, “endless reports” from community members of civil rights violations by ICE agents have flooded their jurisdictions – and now, reports from their own officers paint a similar story. In a joint news conference, St. Paul Police Chief Axel Henry, Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt, and Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley called for better supervision and accountability from federal partners and stressed the importance of respecting constitutional rights. In Brooklyn Park, Bruley alleged some of his off- duty officers — all people of color — have been targeted by ICE agents in recent weeks, without quantifying how many. CNN has reached out to DHS and ICE about the allegations. In one instance, a female off-duty officer was pulled over during a traffic stop and boxed in by ICE agents, Bruley alleged, and said ICE agents demanded to see her paperwork. To de-escalate the situation, Bruley's officer identified herself as a police officer and that's when agents “immediately left after hearing this, making no other comments, no other apologies.” The Justice Department has delivered a subpoena to Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey over an investigation into possible obstruction of federal law enforcement, according to his office. CNN reported Friday that subpoenas were issued for both Frey and Minnesota Gov. President Donald Trump and his administration have been critical of state and local officials' response to unrest in Minnesota over the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, with the president suggesting he might invoke the Insurrection Act and deploy troops to the city to quell any violence. When protesters started chanting inside a church where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent reportedly preaches, supporters said the demonstrators were exercising their First Amendment right to freedom of speech. Freedom of speech “is not absolute,” the Congressional Research Service has explained. Americans generally have freedom of speech on public property – but not necessarily in private places, legal analysts say. While the First Amendment protects citizens from government censorship, freedom of speech “does not apply in private spaces or to private people or organizations,” the Freedom Forum said. “In fact, the First Amendment protects private people and companies' right to make their own decisions about speech in their spaces.” A group of Minnesota doctors are holding a news conference today to condemn ICE for creating violence and intimidation in healthcare settings, leading to disruptions in their ability to treat patients. The news conference will begin at 11:30 a.m. local time. Alice Mann and Matt Klein, both Democrats, are also expected to join the physicians. A video of Bishop Hirschfield speaking at a vigil honoring Renee Nicole Good earlier this month by an ICE officer, went viral. In his remarks, he urged his clergy to “get their wills written” and “have their affairs in order,” suggesting they may need to stand between the powers of the world and the most vulnerable with their bodies following the killing of Good. Martin Luther King Jr. embodied that aspect of the church. The Justice Department is planning to subpoena Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison in a criminal investigation of several state and local officials, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey are also expected to receive federal criminal subpoenas from the US Attorney's Office in the state. The planned subpoenas are a significant escalation between the federal government and elected officials in Minnesota during an increase of immigration enforcement and following the shooting death of Minneapolis resident Renee Good by an ICE officer. Walz and Frey have criticized the Justice Department's approach in their state. This post has been updated with additional information from sources. Correction: An earlier version of this post gave the wrong title for Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison. Attorney General Pam Bondi has landed in Minneapolis for an unannounced visit in a moment of immense tension following the shooting of Renee Good by a federal immigration officer. It is not unusual for DOJ officials to travel without notifying state or local leaders. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, of fueling protests, and CNN has reported the Justice Department is opening criminal investigations into Walz and Frey over possible obstruction of federal officials on the ground. The DOJ is also expected to subpoena Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, CNN reported. Additionally, President Donald Trump has threatened to send a military presence to Minnesota under the Insurrection Act, an extreme possibility of the presidency that is likely to be met with challenges in court. Walz has accused the federal government of “weaponizing the justice system and threatening political opponents,” while Frey said he “will not be intimidated.” Tensions remain high after anti-ICE protesters interrupted a church service in St. Paul, Minnesota over the weekend chanting “ICE out” and Renee Good's name — the woman who was fatally shot by an ICE agent nearly two weeks ago.

Rich Edson reports on President Trump's upcoming trip to Davos, Switzerland, highlighting his economic agenda and the controversial push to acquire Greenland. Bill Hemmer breaks down Greenland's strategic importance. The European Union's top official did not hold back in her warnings about President Donald Trump's threat to impose fresh tariffs on countries opposing his push for the U.S. to acquire Greenland, a semiautonomous Danish territory. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called Trump's threats "a mistake" and questioned U.S. trustworthiness, saying that the EU-U.S. trade deal from July had to "mean something." "Arctic security can only be achieved together. This is why the proposed additional tariffs are a mistake, especially between long-standing allies. The EU and U.S. have agreed to a trade deal last July. And when friends shake hands, it must mean something," Von der Leyen said. And plunging us into a dangerous downward spiral would only aid the very adversaries we are both so committed to keeping out of the strategic landscape," she added, vowing the EU's response would be "unflinching, united and proportional." During the World Economic Forum, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen slammed President Donald Trump's threats to impose tariffs on countries who defy his proposed U.S. takeover of Greenland. The outlet noted that he argued that allied countries should be focused on bringing peace to Ukraine and ending the nearly four-year war with Russia. Trump announced on Saturday that starting on Feb. 1, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the U.K., the Netherlands and Finland would face a 10% tariff on all goods imported to the U.S. The rate will then increase to 25% on June 1. The president added that "this tariff will be due and payable until such time as a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase of Greenland." The president doubled down on his argument that U.S. control of Greenland was necessary to protect national security and American interests, saying that the acquisition would be key to developing the Golden Dome, a cutting-edge missile defense system meant to intercept threats targeting the American homeland. However, on Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said U.S. relations with Europe remain strong and encouraged trading partners to "take a deep breath," the AP reported. Leaders from Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the U.K. issued a joint statement on Tuesday, affirming their commitment as NATO members to "strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest." They also expressed their solidarity with Denmark and Greenland. "Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response. We are committed to upholding our sovereignty," the statement read. France, Germany, Sweden and Norway participated in a two-day exercise to bolster the Danish territory's defenses amid Trump's threats. Visitors attend the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 20, 2026. In text messages that Trump published on Truth Social, Macron suggested a meeting of the Group of Seven (G-7) nations in Paris after the conference in Davos. As of Jan. 20, no such meeting had been announced. Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Martin Luther King III, and his wife Arndrea Waters King pose for a photo during the second half of an NBA basketball game between the Atlanta Hawks and the Milwaukee Bucks, Monday, Jan. 19, 2026, in Atlanta. Martin Luther King III, and his wife Arndrea Waters King smile during the second half of an NBA basketball game between the Atlanta Hawks and the Milwaukee Bucks, Monday, Jan. 19, 2026, in Atlanta. Brian Hooks, chairman and CEO of the nonprofit network Stand Together, said the 250th anniversary is a unique moment “to show people that they matter, that they have a part to play, and that the future is unwritten, but it depends on each one of us stepping up to play our part.” Funded by a mix of 50 philanthropic foundations and individual donors, Be The People builds on research that indicates many people want to contribute to their communities but don't know how. The initiative is targeting more than $200 million for its first year's budget. Founding members range from nonprofits — including GivingTuesday, Goodwill Industries, Habitat for Humanity and More Perfect, businesses like Ron Howard's Imagine Entertainment and the National Basketball Association, to funders like the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. Hooks said this is a 10-year commitment toward trying to achieve what would be a profound shift in behavior and culture. He referenced a 2024 Pew Research Center survey that found most Americans in 2023 and 2024 did not believe that the U.S. could solve its most important problems, saying it was a “red alert” for the country. Hooks said the initiative envisions actions far beyond volunteering or service that people could do in their free time. He pointed to a role for businesses and schools and said the initiative would launch a major data collection effort to track whether people are actually more engaged and whether problems are actually getting solved. Stand Together, which was founded by the billionaire Charles Koch, works across a broad range of issues and communities in the U.S. and has carved out a role for itself as a convener that can bring coalitions together across ideological lines. As an example, at the Atlanta Hawks game on Monday, Martin Luther King III and his wife, Arndrea Waters King, linked a program they launched last year, Realize the Dream, which aims to increase acts of service, to the new campaign. Asha Curran, the CEO of the nonprofit GivingTuesday, said small actions can build on each other like exercising a muscle. “Our experience with GivingTuesday is that when people volunteer together, when people work together on something to do with positive social impact, they find it harder and harder to demonize each other,” said Asha Curran, its CEO. Hahrie Han, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University, has studied civic engagement and said people need more opportunities to authentically participate as problem solvers when connecting with local organizations. “They're more likely to be invited into things where people are asked to let professional staff do most of the problem solving and they show up and give their time or their money,” she said. The result is that people feel less committed and don't see their participation as helping to achieve their interests or goals. A growing number of private foundations have started funding issues related to the health of U.S. democracy, said Kristin Goss, a professor who directs the Center for the Study of Philanthropy and Voluntarism at Duke University. While foundations cannot participate in elections, Goss said they can influence policy or public opinion in other ways. Another group of funders, including the Freedom Together Foundation, launched a project last year to recognize people and groups who stand up for their communities, which they called a “civic bravery” award.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>British officials went to bed on Monday thinking they had averted a crisis. They woke up in the middle of an even deeper row over Greenland, tiny specks of rock in the Indian Ocean, and whether they should deploy their ultimate Trump card: King Charles. Once again, President Donald Trump had upended everything with an early-hours Truth Social post. Crisis, the Brits believed, had been averted by the rational application of cool heads and a dose of logic. A call from Sir Keir Starmer, the prime minister, to Trump had set things straight. It was, in fact, the first step in making good on a commitment to do exactly what Trump wanted. The threat of sanctions followed, risking a rift in NATO. He has been something of a Trump whisperer, deploying charm, flattery and an invitation from King Charles to get his way. He was the first foreign leader to secure a trade deal last year, for example. The Brits quietly briefed that things were going in the right direction and urged their European counterparts not to panic. “Keep calm and carry on,” was the message, just so long as French President Emmanuel Macron could keep his trade “bazooka,” and the threat of massive financial retaliation, in his pants. Take Trump seriously but not literally, and sweet-talk him down from the ledge of wrecking the trans-Atlantic alliance, or fight might with might, unleashing the European Union's full financial clout in a show of force that the president could not ignore. Trump turned his fire on Starmer, slamming his decision to cede ownership of the Chagos Islands, a tiny archipelago in the Indian Ocean, which crucially includes the U.S. base at Diego Garcia. Never mind that the deal to hand them to Mauritius lines up with international law and that it secures the base for a century. And never mind that your Secrets scribe asked Trump about this on Air Force One a year ago. 1 on my list, I'll be honest with you,” was his answer. “Shockingly, our ‘brilliant' NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,” he posted. It must have left British officials choking on their toast and marmalade. They do still have one card up their sleeve. Trump may be prepared to slam the prime minister. Would he behave the same way to King Charles, for whom he clearly has a great deal of respect and with whom he bonded during the state visit to the U.K. last year? Starmer was asked twice about such a threat during an emergency news conference. We all know by now that the capital of Greenland is Nuuk. None of its letters can be coloured in.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>French President Emmanuel Macron shakes with soldiers as he visits the Istres military air force base, southern France, Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. PARIS (AP) — Here, verbatim, are text messages that U.S. President Donald Trump received from French President Emmanuel Macron and the head of NATO, Mark Rutte, and which he published on Tuesday: “From président Macron to President Trump My friend, We are totally in line on Syria We can do great things on Iran I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland Let us try to build great things: 1) i can set up a g7 meeting after Davos in Paris on thursday afternoon. President, dear Donald — what you accomplished in Syria today is incredible. I am committed to finding a way forward on Greenland. Trump also exchanged messages on Sunday with Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, as follows. The message from Støre was co-signed by Finnish President Alexander Stubb. “Dear Mr President, dear Donald - on the contact across the Atlantic - on Greenland, Gaza, Ukraine — and your tariff announcement yesterday. You know our position on these issues. But we believe we all should work to take this down and de-escalate - so much is happening around us where we need to stand together. We are proposing a call with you later today — with both of us or separately — give us a hint of what you prefer! “Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a “right of ownership” anyway? I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.</p>

Fernando Mendoza's brother made his decision about his playing future after the Indiana Hoosiers secured the national championship in a win over the Miami Hurricanes. Alberto Mendoza, who was Fernando's backup during the 2025 season, will enter the NCAA transfer portal. He shared a post from On3, confirming the decision. He appeared in nine games this season for the national champions, making 18 completions for 286 yards and five touchdowns.

After beating Miami in the College Football Playoff title game to cap a 16-0 season that was unprecedented in the modern era, the Hoosiers on Tuesday became the third straight Big Ten team to finish on top of the rankings. Indiana's championship and No. 1 final ranking followed those of fellow Big Ten teams Ohio State in 2024 and Michigan in 2023. 2 Miami (13-3) moved up eight spots and ended with its highest ranking since the 2002 season, when it was second behind Ohio State. The 2003 Miami team had been the most recent to finish in the top 10. Mississippi (13-2), which lost to Miami in the CFP semifinals after it beat Tulane and Georgia following coach Lane Kiffin's departure for LSU, was No. 3, its highest final ranking since 1962. 4 Oregon (13-2) finished in the top 10 for a third straight year and No. 5 Ohio State was in the final top 10 for the 12th straight year. The Big Ten had three teams in the final top five for the second straight year. Georgia (12-2), Texas Tech (12-2), Texas A&M (11-2), Alabama (11-4) and Notre Dame (10-2) rounded out the top 10. The Bulldogs were No. 6 in the final poll for the second straight season and have ended in the top 10 every since since 2017. Texas Tech is a season-ending top-10 team for the first time. Texas A&M hadn't been ranked in a final poll season since Jimbo Fisher's 2020 team was No. Alabama, which had ended every season between 2008-23 in the top 10, was back after slipping to No. Notre Dame won 10 straight games following an 0-2 start, was left out of the playoff and opted to not play in a bowl game. The Irish slipped one spot and were ranked in a ninth straight final poll. The Hoosiers were No. 20 in the preseason poll after going 11-2 in Curt Cignetti's first season. They earned their then-highest ranking ever at No. 3 after they won at Oregon to go 6-0. They moved up to No. 2 the following week and stayed there for seven straight polls. Their 13-10 win over Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game pushed them to No. 1 heading into the playoff. 17 Iowa was ranked for the first time this season after winning three straight, including a bowl win over Vanderbilt. 22 Houston beat Baylor and LSU to end the season and was ranked for the first time in four polls. 25 TCU, which had been 18 spots out of the Top 25, was ranked for the first time since September after beating Houston, Cincinnati and USC. — Arizona (21), Georgia Tech (24) and Missouri (25) dropped out. — The SEC had seven teams in the final Top 25 for the second straight year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Newsom told European leaders to stand up to Trump's tariff threats over support of Greenland, speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. California Governor Gavin Newsom is seen during the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Tuesday, Jan. 20, 2026. French President Emmanuel Macron speaks during the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Tuesday, Jan. 20, 2026. Canada Prime Minister Mark Carney makes his way to take part in an event tilted “Country Strategy Dialogue: Canada” as he attends the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday, Jan. 20, 2026. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent attends the 56th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, WEF, in Davos, Switzerland, Tuesday, January 20, 2026. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday as leaders at the World Economic Forum grappled with the Greenland crisis and heightened concerns over global trade. Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister and former central banker, urged countries below the top tier of global power to continue multilateral cooperation with a new, “dense web of connections.” And in the forum's entrance hall, Newsom was the most blunt, telling European leaders: “It's time to get serious and stop being complicit. It's time to stand tall and firm – have a backbone.” I should've brought a bunch of knee pads for all the world leaders,” the California governor and prominent Democrat said. “I hope people understand how pathetic they look on the world stage. I mean, at least from an American perspective, it's embarrassing.” He added: “Diplomacy with Donald Trump? Stop with this (expletive) diplomacy of sort of niceties and somehow we're all going to figure it out, saying one thing privately and another publicly. Before expressing his concern, the French president began his address with a joke: “It's a time of peace, stability and predictability.” Warning major powers against the temptation of modern colonial adventures, he added: “It's a shift towards a world without rules. Where international law is trampled underfoot and where the only law that seems to matter is that of the strongest, and imperial ambitions are resurfacing.” Then he took aim at the Trump administration, denouncing “competition from the United States of America, through trade agreements that undermine our export interests, demand maximum concessions, and openly aim to weaken and subordinate Europe, combined with an endless accumulation of new tariffs that are fundamentally unacceptable, even more so when they are used as leverage against territorial sovereignty.” “Great powers can afford for now to go it alone. Middle powers do not,” the Canadian prime minister said. “In a world of great power rivalry, the countries in between have a choice: compete with each other for favor or to combine to create a third path with impact,” he said. Carney strongly opposed U.S. aspirations to expand its Arctic territory. “I think our relations have never been closer,” Scott Bessent said, playing down the rift among Western countries over Greenland. He added: “We are in the middle of President Trump's policies. We are partners in trying to stop this tragic war between Russia and Ukraine, but that does not mean that we cannot have disagreements on the future of Greenland.” Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said that with Trump's Greenland provocations, “so many red lines have been crossed” in Europe. If you back down now you're going to lose your dignity,” he said during a Davos panel discussion on redefining Europe's place in the world. De Wever said that he and Belgium's King Philippe will meet with Trump on Wednesday when they will plan to press for a return to the old military alliance between Brussels and Washington. “We either stand together or we will stand divided, and if we are divided, there is the end of an era, of 80 years of Atlanticism, really drawing to a close,” he said. The former mayor of Antwerp, quoting the Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci, said that in a time of great transformation that it is up to U.S. president if the alliance holds. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said a diplomatic “downward spiral” in the West would only embolden its adversaries. “The proposed additional tariffs are a mistake, especially between long-standing allies. It is time to seize this opportunity and build a new independent Europe,” von der Leyen said. And plunging us into a downward spiral would only aid the very adversaries we are both so committed to keeping out of the strategic landscape.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• The Justice Department plans to subpoena Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison related to an investigation of possible obstruction of federal officers during recent protests, two sources said. • DOJ appealed a judge's ruling that federal agents in Minnesota can't arrest or use pepper spray on peaceful protesters or stop people in their cars without cause. • DOJ launched a separate investigation after demonstrators interrupted Sunday service at a church where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent reportedly preaches. • Critics are denouncing DOJ's handling of the fatal shooting this month of protester Renee Good in Minneapolis. While the FBI briefly opened a civil rights investigation into the ICE agent who shot Good, the probe pivoted to investigating Good and those around her, including her widow. A group of Minnesota doctors are holding a news conference today to condemn ICE for creating violence and intimidation in healthcare settings, leading to disruptions in their ability to treat patients. The news conference will begin at 11:30 a.m. local time. Alice Mann and Matt Klein, both Democrats, are also expected to join the physicians. A video of Bishop Hirschfield speaking at a vigil honoring Renee Nicole Good earlier this month by an ICE officer, went viral. In his remarks, he urged his clergy to “get their wills written” and “have their affairs in order,” suggesting they may need to stand between the powers of the world and the most vulnerable with their bodies following the killing of Good. Martin Luther King Jr. embodied that aspect of the church. The Justice Department is planning to subpoena Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison in a criminal investigation of several state and local officials, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey are also expected to receive federal criminal subpoenas from the US Attorney's Office in the state. The planned subpoenas are a significant escalation between the federal government and elected officials in Minnesota during an increase of immigration enforcement and following the shooting death of Minneapolis resident Renee Good by an ICE officer. Walz and Frey have criticized the Justice Department's approach in their state. This post has been updated with additional information from sources. Correction: An earlier version of this post gave the wrong title for Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison. Tensions remain high after anti-ICE protesters interrupted a church service in St. Paul, Minnesota over the weekend chanting “ICE out” and Renee Good's name — the woman who was fatally shot by an ICE agent nearly two weeks ago. Here's what else you should know today: The Department of Justice asked a federal judge Monday to reject a bid by Minnesota leaders to block President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown and to allow the surge of immigration agents in the state to move forward, after a lawsuit was brought by Minnesota and the Twin Cities claiming the move was unconstitutional. “Minnesota wants a veto over federal law enforcement,” the new filing by the Trump administration said, describing the lawsuit brought by state and local officials as an “absurdity” that “would render the supremacy of federal law an afterthought to local preferences.” Read more about Minnesota's legal bid to stop the immigration crackdown.</p>

"They've done so much to help me, whether it's confession or just to be able to talk or just Mass every Sunday.

Brendan Banfield is facing life in prison for his alleged role in the 2023 murders of his wife, Christine Banfield, and Joseph Ryan in Virginia. The first week of testimony in the Virginia trial of Brendan Banfield centered on an extramarital affair he was having with the family's nanny, allegedly prompting the ex-IRS agent to kill his wife and a stranger as part of an elaborate scheme. Banfield is charged with aggravated murder in the February 2023 killings of his wife, Christine Banfield, and Joseph Ryan inside their home in Herndon, Virginia, an affluent suburb of Washington, D.C. Prosecutors allege he orchestrated the killings to cover up his relationship with the family's au pair, Juliana Peres Magalhães. "They're calling it 'The Au Pair Affair'—it's like something out of a TV movie. As the star witness, the jury's decision rests on whether they believe her," Kelly Hyman, a criminal defense attorney, told Fox News Digital. Brendan Banfield listens during his double murder trial in Fairfax County Circuit Court, Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026, in Fairfax, Virginia. Magalhães, who admitted her role in the killings under a plea agreement, told jurors she was involved in a sexual relationship with Banfield and said the two plotted to kill Christine and make Ryan's death appear to be the result of a consensual encounter gone wrong. She testified that Banfield controlled the planning, created an online profile using his wife's credentials, and ultimately stabbed Christine after shooting Ryan. Christine Banfield was stabbed to death in the bedroom of her Fairfax County, Virginia, home. "It's a ‘Tale of Two Cities': the prosecution paints her as a 22-year-old victim, while the defense flips the script to show an instigator acting out of self-preservation," Hyman said. "By attributing key decisions to her and introducing prior inconsistent statements, the defense will aim to create reasonable doubt. If they can show she has an ulterior motive or a personal gain from the plea deal, they can argue the prosecution hasn't proven the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt." With Magalhães' testimony now complete, the trial is expected to shift this week to additional forensic evidence and law-enforcement witnesses. Juliana Peres Magalhães is escorted into the courtroom during the double murder trial for Brendan Banfield, Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026, in Fairfax, Virginia. A key dispute last week involved who controlled the FetLife account used to communicate with Ryan. Prosecutors pointed to digital evidence and Magalhães' testimony to argue Banfield was the mastermind behind the keyboard. The commonwealth argued these details support a narrative that the scene was staged to mislead investigators. This image, provided by the Fairfax County Police Department and taken on Oct. 13, 2023, was submitted as evidence in the murder case against Brendan Banfield. It shows a framed photo of Banfield and Juliana Peres Magalhães on his bedside table in Herndon, Virginia. The defense has yet to present its case.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The recently released 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans restrict refined grains, added sugars and ultraprocessed foods (known as UPFs) — a move applauded by medical organizations. However, the revised food pyramid — which flips prior pyramids on their heads  — also puts red meat and other foods full of protein and saturated fat in a starring role in the top tier, alongside fresh vegetables and fruits known to protect health. “We've been researching this for decades, and we definitively know saturated fat — such as butter fat, beef tallow, red and processed meat — are all closely associated with more deaths from cardiovascular disease,” said Williams, a past president of the American College of Cardiology. “This does not fall in line with President Trump's executive order 14303, which mandates that all federal policies use the best scientific evidence available.” That executive order, signed by Trump on May 23, 2025, called for a return to “a gold standard for science” to ensure “that Federal decisions are informed by the most credible, reliable, and impartial scientific evidence available.” In fact, randomized controlled clinical trials — the current gold standard of research — have found replacing saturated fats with vegetable and seed oils reduced cardiovascular disease by some 30%, similar to the benefits of statin medications. “There's no question that when we remove saturated fat from the diet and add in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats from fish, seed and plant sources, we save lives by improving cardiovascular health,” said Dr. Monica Aggarwal, an adjunct clinical associate professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Florida in Gainesville. “People are going to look at the new pyramid and think ‘Oh, I can eat as much steak as I like.' In a January 8 press conference on the new guidelines, federal officials spoke of their disdain for past nutritional guidance. “For decades, we've been fed a corrupt food pyramid that has had a myopic focus on demonizing natural, healthy saturated fats, telling you not to eat eggs and steak and ignoring a giant blind spot — refined carbohydrates, added sugars and ultraprocessed food,” US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said at the briefing. However, 10% or less is an impossible goal, experts say, if the major emphasis of the Make America Healthy Again movement is on eating more proteins with saturated fats. Chan School of Public Health, recently put the new dietary guidelines, which recommend three servings of dairy a day, to the test. Add a single tablespoon of butter (7 grams) or beef tallow (6 grams), and the person has surpassed their daily 10% limit of saturated fat. CNN reached out to Biglari Holdings, which owns Steak 'n Shake, for comment but did not receive a response before publication. This type of fat is banned in the United States except in tiny amounts due to its strong connection to heart attacks and stroke. Made from an industrial process in which hydrogen is added to liquid vegetable oils to make those oils more solid, trans fats are cheap to make and increase the shelf life of foods. Natural sources of trans fats are found in meat, milk, butter and cheese from ruminant animals — cows, sheep, goats — and are considered by some in the MAHA movement to be healthy. Natural trans fats found in foods from ruminant animals, and to a lesser degree in pork and poultry, are “actively pro-inflammatory” and lead to atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries, Williams said. “Beef tallow contains ruminant trans fats in levels far above what's considered safe. When paired with high saturated fat, as in deep-fried foods or fatty burgers, the combined risk is substantial,” he said. Warnings about the dangers of saturated fat aren't new. The American Heart Association  recommended a switch from disease-causing saturated fat to healthy options in 1961, acting on data-based recommendations from its nutrition committee, first established in 1954. Updates over the years to the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association's guidelines have reiterated that advice, citing hundreds of gold-standard studies on the role of fats in heart disease. “It's never been no- or low-fat,” said preventive cardiologist Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. “All types of fat can play a role in a healthy diet, but the emphasis is on polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats,” Freeman said. “That's what the Mediterranean diet and other plant-predominant diets have shown.” Studies have found the award-winning Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk of diabetes, dementia, memory loss, depression and breast cancer. Research has also linked the diet to stronger bones, lower cholesterol, a healthier heart and longer life. Red meat and sweets are extremely limited, designed to be served only on special occasions. “The old guidelines had such a low protein recommendation that we are increasing that by 50% to 100% — kids need protein,” Makary said. “The old protein guidelines were to prevent starvation and withering away. However, most Americans today, including children, eat much more protein than they typically need, experts say. I'm saving more money next year by meal prepping. Here's everything I use to do it (Courtesy CNN Underscored) “We also know that protein excess taxes the kidneys and is linked to certain cancers. “We need our politicians to focus on changing unhealthy behaviors, not promoting them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an ongoing struggle over the future of Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix says it is now prepared to pay all cash for Warner Bros. and HBO, rather than a mix of cash and stock. The companies hope that the new all cash-offer will help fend off Paramount's hostile takeover bid for all of WBD. Netflix is offering $27.75 per WBD share for the company's movie studio and streaming assets, which are due to be split off into a new publicly traded company called Warner Bros. later this year. CNN and other channels owned by WBD will become part of a separate company called Discovery Global. Netflix had previously offered $23.25 per share in cash and the rest in Netflix stock, enabling Paramount to argue that its all-cash offer was superior. Netflix on Tuesday said the transaction will be financed “through a combination of cash on hand, available credit facilities and committed financing.” This “simplifies the transaction structure, provides greater certainty of value for WBD stockholders, and accelerates the path to a WBD stockholder vote,” the companies said in a press release. WBD CEO David Zaslav said Tuesday that once the company clears its review by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, WBD will schedule a special shareholder meeting to vote on the deal. He expects that would happen in the spring. Paramount has been anticipating the all-cash revision and has been moving forward with its plan to buy up shares for $30 each. Earlier this month Paramount CEO David Ellison also threatened a proxy fight, vowing to nominate a Paramount-friendly slate of board members to take over the WBD board. WBD has rebuffed Paramount and argued that the Netflix deal plus the formation of Discovery Global leaves investors in a better position. Di Piazza, Jr., chair of the WBD board of directors, said Tuesday morning, “By transitioning to all-cash consideration, we can now deliver the incredible value of our combination with Netflix at even greater levels of certainty, while providing our stockholders the opportunity to participate in management's strategic plans to realize the value of Discovery Global's iconic brands and global reach.” Paramount, on the other hand, has argued that the channels have little to no equity value.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Von der Leyen embraced a “A Spirit of Dialogue,” the World Economic Forum's theme for this year's summit in Davos, Switzerland, during her speech Tuesday. She announced her economic vision for the EU, focusing on “European independence.” She said that if Trump continued with the proposed tariffs, then the EU would respond with an “unflinching, united, and proportional” response. Yet, even with her firm tone, she would rather focus on cooperation than retaliation. “Arctic security can only be achieved together,” von der Leyen said. “This is why the proposed additional tariffs are a mistake, especially between long-standing allies. The EU and U.S. have agreed to a trade deal last July. “Plunging us into a dangerous downward spiral would only aid the very adversaries we are both so committed to keeping out of our strategic landscape,” she said. “Geopolitical shocks can and must serve as an opportunity for Europe,” von der Leyen said. “And in my view, the seismic change we are going through today is an opportunity, in fact, a necessity, to build a new form of European independence. “But less than one year on, there is now a real consensus around this. “Of course, nostalgia is part of our human story, but nostalgia will not bring back the old order,” von der Leyen said. It is time to seize this opportunity and build a new, independent Europe. “It was a breakthrough after 25 years of negotiations,” von der Leyen said. “So this agreement sends a powerful message to the world that we're choosing fair trade over tariffs, partnership over isolation, sustainability over exploitation, and that we are serious about derisking our economies and diversifying our supply chains,” she added. She categorized it as proof that Europe was serious about its economic independence and 21st-century goals. “And right after Davos, I will travel to India,” von der Leyen said. “There's still work to do, but we are on the cusp of a historic trade agreement. Europe wants to do business with the gross centers of today and the economic powerhouses of this century, from Latin America to Indo-Pacific, and far beyond.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court will hear another significant gun rights case on Tuesday when it weighs a challenge to a sweeping Hawaii gun law preemptively barring people from carrying guns on private property. The Supreme Court's landmark June 2022 decision in New York Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen upheld the Second Amendment's right to bear arms by striking down a sweeping New York law that required a person to show “proper cause” to be given a permit to carry a concealed handgun in public. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the 6-3 majority that “the constitutional right to bear arms in public for self-defense is not ‘a second-class right, subject to an entirely different body of rules than the other Bill of Rights guarantees. The second law was a single Founding era law that the court thought was a ‘dead ringer' but, in fact, was enacted as a hunting regulation to punish poaching on private land not held open to the public,” the brief said. “Neither of these outlier laws is relevantly or distinctly comparable in the ‘how or why' to the Hawaii default rule. Even taken together, these two outlier laws do not amount to a well-established, representative or enduring national tradition that could justify Hawaii's default rule,” the brief continued. “Such a rule, the Court explained, swept ‘far too broadly' because it ‘would in effect exempt cities from the Second Amendment and would eviscerate the general right to publicly carry arms for self-defense.' The lawsuit has garnered support from several gun rights groups, with various organizations filing briefs in support of the coalition of Hawaii gunowners seeking to strike down the Aloha State's Act 52. States cannot evade Bruen by banning public carry through indirect means. History establishes that firearms regulations are per se unconstitutional if they are designed to thwart the right to publicly carry arms, or if they effectively negate the right,” the DOJ's brief said. The Justice Department explained in its brief how the law puts gun owners at risk in most publicly open places. The same goes for licensees who run errands at grocery stores, dine at restaurants, or stop to buy coffee. A mere nod from the property owner—or an insufficiently conspicuous sign—puts license-holders at risk of prosecution even if the owner welcomes firearms but failed to express his approbation clearly enough,” the brief said. While gun rights advocates have argued the law is plainly unconstitutional, Hawaii officials and anti-gun advocates have argued it falls in line with other laws restricting activities on private property. “Hawai'i's law therefore respects the Second Amendment right of its citizens to bear arms, while vindicating their fundamental right to exclude unwanted entry onto private property,” Hawaii Attorney General Anne Lopez said in a brief to the high court. That consent can come from the property owner or one of his agents, and it can be oral or written,” Lopez said. “The law therefore permits a person to bring a gun into any shop, convenience store, or other retail establishment so long as he gets an employee's on-the-spot okay. Anti-gun groups have also defended the law as being more about setting default rules for private property, rather than an attempt to infringe on Second Amendment rights. Hawaii's law that's under attack here in the Supreme Court is part, an integral part, of the long history of laws supporting that right,” Douglas Letter, chief legal officer for the anti-gun group Brady, told reporters ahead of Tuesday's arguments. “States have frequently set default rules, like Hawaii's, that require a private property owner's permission to do certain things on that private property, to hunt, for example, or graze cattle,” he added. “The basic principle is that private property owners are empowered to set the rules for their property, and the state can make it easier for those private property owners to do so.” The Supreme Court will hear arguments in Lopez at 10 a.m. Tuesday, after the high court issues an order list at 9:30 a.m. and is expected to release at least one ruling ahead of the beginning of oral arguments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>French President Emmanuel Macron texted President Donald Trump that he does “not understand” what the U.S. leader's goal in Greenland is, ahead of Trump's visit to speak in front of European leaders in Davos, Switzerland. The text, posted by Trump to Truth Social, detailed Macron's understanding of some of his recent geopolitical objectives. “My friend, We are totally in line on Syria. I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland,” Macron said in the posted message. “I can set up a G7 meeting after Davos in Paris on Thursday afternoon. Greenland is expected to be among the most discussed topics at Davos, as tensions have boiled over Trump's intentions to obtain the Arctic island for the U.S. and subsequent European objections against him doing so. It also comes on the heels of Trump's announcement last week of imposing 10% tariffs on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland after representatives from those countries “journeyed to Greenland for purposes unknown.” The tariffs are to be “due and payable until such times as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” according to Trump's Truth Social post from Jan. 17. “Any decisions on attendance are a matter for the government concerned. We can confirm that the Danish government will not be represented in Davos this week,” a Davos spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
