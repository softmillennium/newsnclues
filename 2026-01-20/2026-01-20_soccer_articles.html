Alexi Lalas and David Mosse break down FOX Soccer Insider Doug McIntyre's latest crack at predicting the United States roster at the 2026 FIFA World Cup. EXCLUSIVE: The 2026 FIFA World Cup is less than five months away and the State Department is set to roll out a system for ticket holders who need visas. The State Department will launch the FIFA Priority Appointment Schedule System (FIFA PASS), Fox News Digital learned on Tuesday. FIFA President Gianni Infantino and President Donald Trump arrive on the red carpet ahead of the FIFA World Cup 2026 Final Draw at John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Dec. 5, 2025. Prospective visa holders must be able to show that they qualify to obtain a visa and plan to follow the laws in the United States as well as leave the country once the tournament is over on July 19. Each applicant will undergo security screening and proper vetting. The State Department will deploy 500 additional staff members to process applications. President Donald Trump spoke about the FIFA Pass in November. He said the Departments of State and Homeland Security had been working "tirelessly" to "ensure that soccer fans from all around the world are properly vetted and able to come to the United States next summer easily." President Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino ahead of the FIFA World Cup 2026 Final Draw at John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Dec. 5, 2025. "I've directed my administration to do everything within the power to make the 2026 World Cup an unprecedented success. I think it's going to be the greatest, and we are setting records on ticket sales," Trump said at the time. "With this FIFA Pass, we can make sure that those who buy a ticket that are legitimate football fans, or soccer fans… they can come and attend the World Cup in the best conditions – starting from getting their visa and then coming, of course, in the country to enjoy," Infantino said in the Oval Office. Two people are reflected in the FIFA logo at the FIFA headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland, on May 27, 2015. Fox News' Scott Thompson contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Palestinian children playing soccer at the Aida Refugee Camp's football pitch in the West Bank in December Aida Youth Center FIFA president Gianni Infantino and his UEFA counterpart Aleksandr Ceferin have intervened to save a local soccer pitch in the West Bank from destruction, according to multiple sources briefed on the discussions. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) had been scheduled to demolish the pitch this week, telling local residents of the Aida refugee camp that it was “illegally” constructed alongside a security fence. Local campaigners said that 250 children use the pitch each week. The IDF and Israeli government did not respond to a request for comment. Concurrently, UEFA president Ceferin held several meetings with the IFA. The first of these took place last Monday, on January 12, with a follow-up call scheduled for three days later. “We hope the pitch can continue to serve the local community as a safe space for children and youth.” We still haven't received official confirmation from the army. You can't imagine the influence of this place — it offers the possibility of a normal, healthy life. Though Infantino has previously avoided directly intervening in the region, stating that FIFA “cannot solve political problems”, Ceferin himself has taken a more active role in the conflict. The Athletic reported in December that senior figures at UEFA had held meetings with the leaders of a pro-Palestinian campaign to discuss the circumstances around a potential ban of Israel from international competition. According to people briefed on the governing body's internal decision-making, Ceferin also personally pushed for a UEFA banner to be displayed at August's Super Cup final which read: “Stop killing children; Stop killing civilians”. Two Gazan refugee children were also involved in the medal ceremony. Separately, Swiss MPs were due to vote on Tuesday over whether to revoke UEFA's tax exemption in the country, with the motion accusing the body of “continu(ing) to recognise clubs in illegally occupied territories (in the West Bank).” That vote has now been delayed until January 27.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zohran Mamdani hosted a free viewing of the 2026 Africa Cup of Nations final at a city courthouse, and the soccer-loving Mayor has plans to organize more free watch parties during the FIFA World Cup. New York/New Jersey is one of 16 host cities during this summer's tri-hosted World Cup in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, and our region made some form of history by becoming the first host to charge fans looking to attend an official World Cup "Fan Festival." The aforementioned Liberty State Park in Jersey City, New Jersey, plus the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing, Queens, and Rockefeller Center in Midtown Manhattan are the three official locations for FIFA-sanctioned fan events this summer. According to Front Office Sports, the NY/NJ host committee "should make several million dollars" from selling Fan Festival admission. Philadelphia, for example, recently rolled out the details of their Fan Festival planned for Lemon Hill, with the city taking a minor victory lap on Twitter over the fact that their event is free while "other cities" charge for admission. New York is one of those pay-to-Fan Fest cities, insult to injury considering the eight matches scheduled for MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, might be some of the toughest and most expensive tickets to get during the 2026 tournament, a tournament consistently and globally excoriated for its exorbitant ticket prices and convoluted, complicated process for acquiring tickets. The soccer-obsessed Arsenal FC fan turned Mayor hard-launched his own version of a big soccer viewing party for the final of the 2026 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), with Mayor Mamdani taking over Surrogate's Court on Chambers Street in lower Manhattan to host a viewing of the wild, drama-filled meeting between Morocco and Senegal on Sunday, January 18. Clad in a suit with an Arsenal kit over his dress shirt and tie to show he's the ultimate Soccer Mayor, Mamdani enlisted familiar faces to New York City FC fans, The Cooligans, to serve as his event's emcees. The AFCON party will not, apparently, be a one-off, so it looks like the City of New York will become a consistent source of counter-programming to FIFA's fan events held during this summer's World Cup. News of Mayor Mamdani-led soccer viewing parties shouldn't come as too much of a surprise to anyone who followed his statements about soccer and the upcoming World Cup during his mayoral campaign and during the early days of his time in office. Mamdani made the high cost of tickets to the World Cup, and the lack of any carve-outs giving fans in host cities like New York access to discounted tickets, an issue during his campaign, launching a whole "Game Over Greed" initiative that called on FIFA to, among other things, end the use of dynamic pricing, which allows ticket prices to soar for the most in-demand games like, say, the World Cup Final scheduled for July 19 at MetLife Stadium. Taking on the most expensive World Cup in history seemed to fit seamlessly into Mamdani's overall focus during his campaign on the high cost of living New York City residents face in their day-to-day lives. On January 5, while signing three executive orders meant to crack down on "junk fees" tied to memberships, subscriptions, and ticket purchases, Mayor Mamdani again talked about dynamic pricing and the World Cup, saying "I continue to voice my opposition to the use of dynamic pricing here for the soon-to-come World Cup and the necessity of it being a more affordable experience for all. Public pressure did get FIFA to exclude certain categories of tickets from dynamic pricing, and to make a very small percentage of tickets available for $60 and designated as being for "Supporters" of certain competing nations. FIFA doesn't appear to want to make those free or open access for all New Yorkers, but the city's new soccer-loving Mayor might just use the power of city government to get it done instead.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>German Berterame has been warned that a move to join Lionel Messi at MLS Cup winners Inter Miami would be a “step backwards”. He has, however, been advised to remain at Monterrey and make a decision on his future after the World Cup. Various reports across North and South America have indicated that Inter Miami are prepared to trigger the $15 million (£11m) release clause in Berterame's contract. It has been revealed that talks regarding a move are ongoing. He has said: “I can tell you and confirm that there has been an approach and a proposal that is interesting to Berterame. Herons co-owner Jorge Mas has also validated the reports, with the current kings of MLS eager to continue reinforcing their squad around eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi. He has said: “Well, first of all, German Berterame is a great player. Monterrey head coach Domenec Torrent has acknowledged a raid for one of his most prized assets, while maintaining that there is no guarantee of a deal being done. The team that wants him knows Rayados won't make it easy… He has a price and clauses. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Several other prominent voices from inside Mexican football have urged Berterame to delay any move to the United States in a World Cup year. Fellow countryman and former national team star Paul Aguilar has told La Ultima Palabra on Fox Sports: “If I had to decide that, I would stay at Rayados and after the World Cup I would go to another team. Aguilar believes that Liga MX remains more competitive than MLS and remaining on home soil would give Berterame the best possible chance of earning a place in Javier Aguirre's World Cup squad. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting The expectation is that, despite receiving advice urging him to reconsider his options, a transfer to Inter Miami will be completed at some stage in the not too distant future. The Herons remain confident that they will get their man. The MLS Cup winners have lost former Barcelona stars Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba to retirement, but have seen veteran Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez commit to a new one-year deal. They have also drafted in reinforcements at left-back and in the goalkeeping department, while talismanic club captain Messi has ended any speculation regarding his future by signing a three-year contract extension through 2028.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A well-respected journalist has claimed that eight nations should “pause participation” in the 2026 World Cup after US President Donald Trump announced plans to impose fresh tariffs on eight European allies opposed to his proposed takeover of Greenland. Several countries have since been added to the list, with World Cup participants Haiti and Iran currently under full restrictions, with Ivory Coast and Senegal under partial restrictions. The list includes World Cup participants such as Brazil, Colombia, and Egypt. This led to fears from some fans that they could be turned away at the US border ahead of sporting events such as the 2026 World Cup and 2028 LA Olympics. A US State Department official, who spoke to the Mirror, has since insisted that the “ban applies to the issuance of immigrant visas only, and does not apply to non-immigrant visas, such as those for tourists, athletes and their families, and media professionals intending to travel for the World Cup". However, sponsors and supporters will likely still be impacted by the visa freeze. On Saturday (January 17), Trump threatened European allies, including the UK, with 10 percent tariffs if a deal over Greenland is not reached. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer described the move as “completely wrong”. Also last week, 23 UK MPs from four parties – Labour, Liberal Democrats, Green Party, and Plaid Cymru – signed a motion in parliament calling on international sporting bodies to consider expelling the US from major international competitions, including the World Cup. At this time, there is no suggestion that this could happen, although British journalist Piers Morgan has suggested that eight World Cup nations - England, France, Spain, Germany, Portugal, Netherlands, Norway, and Italy – should “pause participation” in the tournament as a way to “concentrate some minds”.</p>

She knew what she had on the surface with veterans such as Rose Lavelle, Naomi Girma, Lindsey Heaps and Trinity Rodman. Twenty months later, Hayes still hasn't reached the bottom of that pool, making this month's training camp in Carson an important one with World Cup qualifying looming in the fall. I think about Hal Hershfelt or Croix Bethune, players who have not had a lot of opportunity with us. I get a chance to really see where they're at. “My message is these players really have to take these opportunities because they will become few and far between.” Hayes has given 27 players their senior national team debuts and has used 50 different starters in her 30 matches as coach. No other U.S. manager has named more than 36 starters over a similar span. And the number of debutantes could grow since three of the 26 women called up are still looking for their first international cap — something they could earn this month since the training camp will end with friendlies against Paraguay on Saturday at Dignity Health Sports Park and Chile at UC Santa Barbara on Jan. 27. Saturday's matinee will include a pregame tribute to Christen Press, a two-time world champion who announced her retirement last fall. But as valuable as the continuing auditions may be, the decision to call up a roster of young, NWSL players was made out of necessity, not design. Because the camp falls outside a FIFA window, Hayes was unable to summon European-based players such as Girma, Heaps, Alyssa Thompson, Crystal Dunn and Catarina Macario. Also unavailable were Jaedyn Shaw, Jaelin Howell, Tierna Davidson, Emily Sonnett and Lavelle, U.S. Soccer's women's player of the year, who will all be playing for Gotham FC in next week's FIFA Women's Championship Club in England. “If the European-based players and the Gotham-based players were here, this would be a completely different roster,” Hayes said. Injury kept Macario off the team that struck gold in the Paris Olympics, Hayes' first tournament as coach, while forwards Sophia Wilson and Mallory Swanson have been on maternity leave since the Olympics. Injuries have limited Rodman, another forward, to one game over the past 18 months. So while she would prefer to start the new year with the veteran core of her 2027 World Cup roster in uniform, that didn't happen. Instead, the 26 invited players — among them Rodman, Angel City defender Gisele Thompson and Santa Clarita's Olivia Moultrie — average 24.1 years of age and 6.6 caps of senior-team experience. Hayes said she and her staff have mapped out how they'd like to see 2026 unfold, and that plan includes narrowing the potential player pool to about 35 women ahead of the SheBelieves Cup in March. The champion with Tigres UANL women's team and U-17 World Cup medalist detailed the sporting and personal reasons that led her to change course, with the full support of her parents. “Once we get to SheBelieves, if everyone is available to me, it will be the group that are strong candidates to be [part of World Cup qualifying],” she said. “It will be an extremely competitive roster.” Yet it will be one that still won't include Wilson or Swanson, who combined for seven of the team's 12 goals in the Olympics. Wilson gave birth to a daughter in September, two months before Swanson did the same. Hayes, who had a son in the spring of 2018, doesn't plan to rush back either player. “I know how long it takes to recover after having a baby. That's why I don't like putting time frames on it,” she said. “For some the recovery is quicker than others. ⚽ You have read the latest installment of On Soccer with Kevin Baxter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The benefit of national team players honing skills abroad is balanced by concerns over a weakened NWSL The dust has yet to settle on Trinity Rodman's club status, but the star USA forward's near future has ignited an emphatic revival of an old debate on this side of the Atlantic. How does the National Women's Soccer League stack up against its top competitor leagues? And what, if anything, can be done to stop the flow? The questions swirling stateside have been around for quite some time, though they once operated in much different conditions – a less competitive global landscape, diminished investment abroad, NWSL's formal management by US Soccer. Key players such as Catarina Macario, the captain Lindsey Heaps (who has signed for her home town club in Denver this month), Phallon Tullis-Joyce and Lily Yohannes were already abroad. Given the historic link between US national team stars and the NWSL's biggest crowds and marketability, that concern is merited. (Though notably, the league's health isn't as solely reliant on national team marketability as it has been in the past.) Criteria includes things such as minutes on the USWNT, and a high ranking on year-end lists such as ESPN's top 50 and the Guardian's top 100. The former Chelsea manager has addressed this topic at several points publicly, always emphasising that she is there to support each player in their own decisions, and is not pointedly directing them abroad. But to some extent, it's worth noting that USWNT talent going abroad isn't all about the money. Coffey, for example, moved to Manchester citing the same reasons international talents such as the Spain striker Esther González (who was the top scorer at last summer's Euros) or the Germany goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger gave when they came to NWSL; moving either way across the Atlantic provides players with new challenges in different systems. With the game growing globally, expecting any international star to play out their entire career in one league could be unrealistic. From the individual or national team perspective, it may also limit the growth of that player as they seek out new elements to their game. In the case of USWNT players moving to Europe, the unique experience of playing in the Champions League – which challenges players to adjust to a variety of styles across Europe's top leagues – is irreplaceable. Fox cited the opportunity to compete in the Champions League as a key motivator in her move to Arsenal, going on to win the competition in her debut season. Hayes has emphasised Champions League experience is a valuable tool for her players to have as they prepare for the 2027 World Cup. To help assuage fears, at the opposite end of migration, returning to NWSL remains an appeal for USWNT players such as Heaps or Catarina Macario, who have long charted their careers abroad. Whether the HIP Rule proves consequential on that front (as well as any renegotiated salary cap) is highly uncertain. But long term, USWNT stars spending some time overseas may not necessarily be cause for panic, and from a national team perspective, may add dynamism to the team as they seek to compete at the next World Cup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article was written by The Sweeper Podcast, a weekly world football podcast covering all 211 FIFA countries – and beyond. In Oceania, the New Zealand duo of Auckland FC and South Island United met for the first time, ushering in a new rivalry in an entirely new competition. Played as part of the league's first circuit series – of which there will be six in total – the all-Kiwi clash ended in a comfortable 3-0 victory for Auckland FC, who hosted both matches at their Eden Park home. But what exactly is the OFC Pro League? And how, in practice, does it all work? For decades, that – combined with limited funding and vast travel distances – has prevented OFC from establishing a professional competition. But eight years after exploratory discussions first began, the inaugural OFC Pro League launched in January 2026. The competition has been made possible by significant financial backing from Saudi Arabia, which is reportedly investing close to NZ$35 million to help launch the league and underwrite it during its first four years. The move is widely viewed as the latest example of Saudi Arabia's growing use of football as a soft-power tool on the global stage. The Pro League's objective is to create a sustainable, fully professional environment for players, staff and clubs, while developing young talent across the Pacific and improving Oceania's competitiveness internationally. That ambition inevitably extends to the FIFA Club World Cup, where Oceania's representative will be determined by the best-performing Pro League club over a four-year cycle. The line-up includes three established sides – Auckland FC, PNG Hekari (Papua New Guinea) and South Melbourne (Australia) – alongside five newly created clubs: South Island United (formed by Christchurch United to represent New Zealand's South Island), Solomon Kings (Solomon Islands), Bula FC, Tahiti United and Vanuatu United. The inclusion of A-League club Auckland FC and Australian Championship side South Melbourne among the participants benefits from additional context. Auckland FC were granted a licence on the condition they would send a reserve side, bolstered by a limited number of senior players, to the competition. South Melbourne, meanwhile, are participating as a guest club from an AFC nation and will not be eligible to represent OFC at the Club World Cup, even if they do qualify on merit. The first stage, which is currently underway in New Zealand (and seen one clash between Bula FC and South Island United postponed), will be followed by circuit series in Papua New Guinea, Australia, the Solomon Islands and Fiji. During that phase, the participating clubs will face each opponent twice and play 14 matches in total – three at each circuit series except for Honiara in the Solomon Islands, where they will each play twice. The teams will then return to New Zealand in mid-May to play the sixth and final series. The final four will then play a single-leg semi-final and final to become Oceania's first professional football champion and win the right to represent the continent globally – an honour that will bring the recipient both enormous prestige and valuable prize money.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jürgen Hardt, who works as a spokesperson on foreign policy for the Christian Democratic Union party, made the claim on his own to BILD. Germany, a prominent NATO member alongside Denmark, the nation to which Greenland belongs, has sent military personnel to the nordic island, alongside France and several other European nations. Trump, meanwhile, has increased his rhetoric on adding Greenland to the United States, suggesting that “we need Greenland for national security” and that he may impose stricter tariffs on nations “if they don't go along with [the plan for] Greenland.” While speaking with BILD, Hardt also pointed out that Trump has made it evidently clear how “important the World Cup is to him,” and expressed that he has “confidence that we will reach a better common understanding within NATO regarding the Greenland issue.” Polling conducted by BILD before Trump's latest threats revealed significant support for a German World Cup boycott, with 47% of Germans in favor and just 35% against if the U.S. took control of Greenland. Germany qualified for the 2026 tournament after claiming the top spot in Group A of UEFA World Cup qualifying and will play against Curaçao, Côte d'Ivoire and Ecuador in the group stage, with those matches set to take place in Houston and East Rutherford, New Jersey, as well as Toronto, Canada. On Jan. 14, FIFA announced that it received over 500 million ticket requests for the tournament, with Germany ranking fourth among countries seeking entry to matches, only trailing the three host nations. However, Iran boycotted the 2026 World Cup draw on Dec. 5, 2025, citing visa restrictions for its officials.
