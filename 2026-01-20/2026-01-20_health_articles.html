                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article is based on a poster originally authored by Tianfu Zhang, Ya Zhao, Na Zhang, Xing Zhang, Haonan Li, Spencer Chiang and Yuehchun Hsieh. Natural killer (NK) cells are large granular immune cells that play an important role in anti-inflammatory responses and in monitoring tumors.1 When using NK cells in adoptive immunotherapy, acquiring enough high-quality NK cells is a major challenge. The ability of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to differentiate into different cell types in vitro offers hope for cell treatments.2 A unique and reliable approach for inducing NK cells from iPSCs (iNK) in a completely feeder-free environment was designed in this study. After 35 days, the cell proportion of CD3- CD56+ iNK Cells reached 96.33 %, and by day 49, the expansion fold had reached 70 K, suggesting the feasibility of large-scale NK cell production for clinical applications. NOTCH ligands DLL4 and VCAM-1 provided a supportive environment for HSPC differentiation into the NK lineage. Flow cytometry analysis of cell components throughout the differentiation and expansion process. (A) iNK cell viability throughout the culture process and (B) expansion fold. After NK cell maturity, expansion reaches over 70K-fold, with an average survival rate of 95 % throughout the differentiation/expansion process, highlighting its potential as a robust NK cell source in only 49 days. After a 35-day NK cell expansion period, iNKs were analyzed for NK surface markers including (A) NKp46, (B) NKp44, (C) CD16, (D) NKG2D, (E) NKp30, (F) KIR to confirm cell identity and function. Figure 4. iNK (Day 35) and leukemia (K562) cells were co-cultured at various E:T ratios. (A) CD107a marker revealed middling degranulation of iNKs between negative (NC) and positive (PMA+IM) controls, revealing a 53.5 % expression of CD107a. (B)Secretion of IFN-γ at a high level, mimicking cytokine secretion at levels close to the chemically-induced positive control. Measurement of remaining target cells was performed after 7-AAD/CFSE staining and analyzed via flow cytometry. (A) iNK (Day 35) cytotoxicity increased with E:T ratios, revealing > 40 % of target cells lysed at the lowest ratio. (B) During a comparison between PBMC-derived NKs vs iNKs from this method, Day 35 iNKs showed the highest cytotoxicity against K562 cells. This study presents a scalable strategy for producing iNK cells from iPSCs, providing a consistent and efficient solution to fulfill clinical needs. At day 49, growth had exceeded 70 K-fold, with > 90 % viability and significant cytotoxic activity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article is based on a poster originally authored by Rachel Daniels, Yu Chen, Spencer Chiang, Tianfu Zhang and Yuehchun Hsieh. The in vitro cultivation of immune cells is an important stage in the development of cell and gene treatments. Immune cells, including T, NK, and Macrophages, require unique media to match their diversity and specialized nature. Each immune cell group has distinct metabolic requirements, activation pathways, and cytokine reliance. Standard, one-size-fits-all media cannot address these features. As a result, any adjustments to target immune cell types, such as switching from CAR-T to CAR-NK therapies, typically involve lengthy cell culture optimization processes. To address these constraints, this study focused on creating a two-part medium: a universal basic medium and custom-formulated supplements tailored and optimized for specific immune cell subpopulations. This strategy generates an adaptive yet fine-tuned formulation tailored to each cell type's biological and functional needs by carefully adjusting essential media components, including nutrients, cytokines, growth factors, and serum substitutes. Two supplements, NK cells and yδT cells, were designed to be used with a universal basal medium. The customizability of each generated cell media allows researchers to readily adopt and execute highly tailored cell media for diverse cell subpopulations, increasing the efficiency of research on different cell types in immune cell therapy studies. (A) Donor 1 and (B) Donor 2 human CBMCs were cultured using the Immune Cell Basal Medium with CelThera™ Immune Cell Supplement C. The resulting expansion fold exceeds 1,000 on Day 11 and can reach 10,000 on Day 19. Human CBMCs were cultured for 2 weeks using Immune Cell Basal Medium with CelThera™ Immune Cell Supplement C. Varying ratios of NKp44/NKG2D/CD69, all markers of activation, reveal significant levels of activation after the culturing process. Measurement of remaining target cells was performed after 7-AAD/CFSE staining and analyzed via ELISA. NK cells were used to evaluate cytotoxicity with several E:T ratios, revealing > 30 % of target cells lysed at the lowest ratio, similar to control NK cells. (A) Expansion fold and (B) viability of yδT cells were evaluated from PBMCs cultured with Basal Medium, T cell Expansion Supplement, and GMP Immune Cell Supplement D. Expansion fold exceeds 3,600 with a viability of > 90 % across the culture period. Cell population percentage of yδ2T after culturing using either phenol red or phenol red-free medium resulted in > 80 %. After two weeks, a high percentage of yδ2T was achieved, using the addition of several supplements alongside the traditional basal medium, revealing the capability to tailor media to a specific subpopulation. The creation of a universal basic medium combined with bespoke additives provides a versatile and efficient option for cultivating various immune cell subpopulations. This technique supports each cell type's particular biological and functional requirements by allowing for exact adjustments of nutrients, cytokines, growth factors, and serum substitutes. The expansion of NK cells and yδT cells at high purity resulted in 1,000- and 17,600-fold increases, demonstrating their effectiveness. This adaptable platform streamlines the transition between diverse immune cell targets, reducing optimization time and enhancing the scalability of cell and gene therapy studies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article is based on a poster originally authored by Linlin Ma, Di Shi, Tianfu Zhang, Zhicheng Dong, Spencer Chiang and Yuehchun Hsieh. Monitoring ADC internalization requires highly sensitive and specific methods for distinguishing surface-bound from internalized compounds. ACROBiosystems' pH-sensitive fluorescent dye-based endocytosis detection reagents enable real-time monitoring of key dynamic properties, including initiation speed, uptake length, drug metabolism, and total internalization in target cells. This approach not only aids in identifying superior ADCs characterized by "fast initiation, prolonged uptake, and high total internalization," but also provides critical data for studying ADC endocytosis mechanisms, optimizing therapeutic dosing, and fine-tuning administration schedules. Following the preparation of 4X (mass concentration) antibody and 4X Internalization Detection reagent (Cat. IGG-PZF2001 working solutions in cell culture medium, the solutions were combined and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. For suspension cells, 50 µL of cell suspension (1x106 cells/mL) was placed in a 96-well plate and mixed with 50 µL of the prepared labeling complex. For attached cells, after plating 5,000-10,000 cells per well and allowing attachment, the medium was substituted with 50 µL of fresh medium before adding 50 µL of the working solution. The cells were then treated with the labeling compound for 0.5-24 hours before being analyzed using flow cytometry or high-content analysis at specific time intervals. SK-BR-3(HER2+) cells were treated with various anti-HER2 mAbs and the ACROBiosystems Internalization Detection Reagent. The results showed that ACROBiosystems Internalization Detection Reagent provides reliable and consistent detection across a variety of primary antibodies. Furthermore, the signal intensity grew significantly over time (Fig. In contrast, no positive signal was obtained in the control cell line MDA-MB-468(HER2-), demonstrating the ACROBiosystems reagent's great specificity (Figure 1B). SK-BR-3(HER2+) cells were treated with Anti-HER2 mAbs or matching ADC medicines, as well as the ACROBiosystems Internalization Detection Reagent. The findings suggest that the intensity of the internalization detection signal increases with reagent dosage; also, the detection results of mAbs and their matching ADCs are consistent. SK-BR-3(HER2+) cells were treated with the ACROBiosystems Internalization Detection Reagent and an anti-HER2 antibody (Trastuzumab). The results demonstrated a similar rise in signal intensity with increasing molar ratios (Fig. Similarly, when Raji (CD20+) cells were treated with the ACROBiosystems Internalization Detection Reagent and Anti-CD20 antibody (Rituximab), a dose-dependent increase in signal was seen (Figure 3B). The kinetic changes of the internalization detection signal of anti-HER2 antibody in SK-BR-3 cells. The signal intensity steadily increases over the first seven hours, then plateaus and remains steady for up to 18 hours (Figure 4A). After removing the Internalization Detection Reagent and antibody mixture at seven hours, monitoring shows that the internalization signal in the 2 nM Anti-HER2 antibody group steadily declines over 24 hours (Figure 4B).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In other words, around one in five cardiovascular deaths worldwide are attributable to environmental exposures, exceeding the impact of many traditional cardiovascular risk factors. The joint statement represents a unified global commitment to place environmental protection at the heart of CVD prevention and policy. CVD remains the leading cause of death worldwide and environmental stressors have become its silent accelerators. Our message is clear: cleaner air, quieter cities and a stable climate are not solely environmental goals, they are essential for heart health and for reducing the CVD burden globally." Professor Thomas Münzel, lead author, University Medical Center Mainz, Germany As Professor Thomas F. Lüscher, ESC President and senior author explains: "The heart does not exist in isolation - it beats within an ecosystem. Immediate, coordinated and courageous actions from policy makers are needed to reduce personal and societal environmental risk factor exposure, particularly in low- and middle-income countries that disproportionately bear the brunt of global environmental degradation. Intense exposure to air pollution and other forms of contamination take their toll especially on the most vulnerable. It's imperative that all sectors act now and play their part to reduce and mitigate risks so that cardiovascular health for all becomes reality," says co-author, Professor Amam Mbakwem, WHF's Vice President. The joint statement calls on policymakers to adopt stricter air quality and noise standards, phase out fossil fuels and regulate toxic chemicals. "This joint effort reflects our shared understanding of the need to address environmental factors that affect heart health. Working together across societies and sectors is essential to create meaningful change for cardiovascular well-being worldwide," says co-author and past American Heart Association President, Dr. Keith Churchwell. "The American Heart Association is committed to advancing research and raising awareness so we can better protect heart health from the very start by protecting the planet," adds American Heart Association President, Dr. Stacey E. Rosen. In our latest interview, News-Medical speaks with Rosanna Zhang from ACROBiosystems about utilizing organoids for disease modeling in the field of neuroscience research.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vice President JD Vance attended, as did Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the leader of the ad hoc movement whose members rail against vaccines, Big Pharma, and ultraprocessed food. During a fireside chat that organizers broadcasted online, Vance extolled MAHA's impact on the Trump administration, calling it "a critical part of our success in Washington." But the strategy carries risks, because support for Kennedy is cratering and polls show voters care more about reducing health care costs than MAHA priorities such as ending vaccine mandates and promoting raw milk. "Polls show clearly MAHA issues are not the top issues for people," said Robert Blendon, a professor emeritus of health policy and political analysis at Harvard University. "The top health care voting issue is cost, and costs are actually rising." A few blocks away at the White House, President Donald Trump that day signed legislation to reopen the federal government. The 43-day shutdown centered on disagreement over expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies, which Democrats wanted to extend and GOP congressional leadership declined to take up. That has fueled the national affordability debate, as many of the roughly 24 million people who buy coverage on the health law's marketplaces are now facing premium payments more than double what they faced last year. In January, Congress continues to wrestle with what has emerged as a key kitchen table issue. MAHA was mainstreamed as part of the political platform embraced by Kennedy, an environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist who ran for president in 2023 and 2024. Some adherents also are skeptical of or opposed to vaccines. "Covid was really eye-opening for people," said Andrea Nazarenko, a psychologist and MAHA supporter who co-authored a book on food as medicine. MAHA has since emerged as an influential force for the GOP, gaining significant clout in a short time. Case in point: Early this month, Kennedy announced new dietary guidelines and updated childhood vaccine recommendations, which were both part of the movement's wish list and departures from existing frameworks. In addition, members of Congress have founded a MAHA caucus. Lawmakers in Republican-led states are introducing or passing legislation to advance the MAHA agenda, including laws to restrict mRNA vaccines or ban certain additives in food. Its supporters include desirable voting demographics — independents and some Democrats, many of whom are women, younger voters, or suburbanites. Republicans are counting on a MAHA bounce, and political analysts say they may need it. The party took a drubbing in November's statewide races, and Trump's approval rating has slumped from 47% in early 2025 to 36% by December, according to Gallup polls. Meanwhile, cracks are starting to threaten the Make America Great Again coalition and the lockstep support Trump has enjoyed from Capitol Hill Republicans. While MAGA shows signs of weakening, MAHA is flourishing. "Kennedy has ratified the Republican agenda around health and food," said David Mansdoerfer, who served in HHS leadership during the first Trump administration. Polling shows popular support for MAHA initiatives such as ridding food of synthetic dyes, but voters are far less enthusiastic about Kennedy and his denouncements of vaccines and efforts to limit access to them. Still, the Trump administration has broadened and accelerated its attack on vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration's top vaccine official in November said in a memo that the agency would overhaul vaccine regulation, asserting without evidence that at least 10 children had died from covid shots. In December, a federal vaccine advisory panel handpicked by Kennedy voted to stop recommending routine vaccination of newborns against hepatitis B. The Democratic Doctors Caucus, a group of medical doctors in Congress, issued a statement condemning the federal advisory panel's changed recommendation on the hepatitis B vaccine, calling it an attack on basic science. And Democratic Reps. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, Diana DeGette of Colorado, and Yvette Clarke of New York wrote to the FDA commissioner demanding data from the agency on the covid death claims. Highlighting the risks of the Trump administration's anti-vaccine initiatives is only part of Democrats' game plan to counter Republicans' alliance with MAHA. Strategists describe three aims: Expose GOP policies that run counter to MAHA priorities; trumpet Democrats' efforts to tackle health care costs; and highlight their own party's work on such MAHA goals as cracking down on pesticide-makers. "If people want to be healthier, they need affordable health care, and Democrats are the only ones pushing for affordable health care," said C.J. Warnke, communications director for the House Majority PAC, a fundraising group that works to elect more Democrats. Most notably, the strategy so far hasn't really involved attacks on Kennedy or MAHA itself. "If Democrats focus on attacking Kennedy, saying he's crazy and he has a brain worm, some voters hear that as reinforcing the notion that Democrats are wedded to Big Pharma and Big Ag," said Justin Zorn, a senior adviser at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive nonprofit focused on economic policy. So Democrats will talk about their continuing fight to address health care costs, such as with a possible retroactive fix to the now-expired ACA subsidies, or a bill by Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) to prevent pesticide manufacturers from getting legal immunity against health claims. "Everything they're doing actually makes people sicker with higher bills, dirtier air, and fewer people covered with insurance," said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist. "Democrats do need to take MAHA seriously and can't brush it off. The core is to show Democrats are focused on health and health care and exposing what the Republican agenda means." For Republicans, the next batch of MAHA events and summits is already scheduled. After taking a political back seat in recent years, health care may dominate the 2026 election races.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This means each transferrin molecule can facilitate hundreds of cycles of iron binding and delivery to cells in its lifespan.1 Abnormal transferrin levels in serum are associated with various diseases, including certain cancers and other inflammatory syndromes.3 Duetta is a highly sensitive spectrofluorometer that can be used to measure transferrin at very low concentrations. By integrating both fluorescence and absorbance measurements simultaneously, the Duetta spectrofluorometer offers key advantages in protein analysis. In their comparative study, Horiba assessed the fluorescence results obtained using the Duetta with absorbance results from a dedicated low-volume benchtop spectrophotometer. Transferrin was prepared at concentrations ranging from 50 µg/mL to 0.75 µg/mL in 10 mM PBS for fluorescence and absorbance measurements. The same buffer, devoid of protein, was utilized as a blank. Transferrin solutions from 0.75 µg/mL to 50 µg/mL were measured in absorbance mode. A comparison of the absorbance spectra obtained from both systems at the highest concentrations is shown below. Comparison of Absorbance spectra between the instruments. The spectra obtained demonstrate notable differences. The comparative data from the spectrophotometer exhibited a limit of detection around 25 µg/mL, with visibly noisy curves. Figure 3 shows the overlaid fluorescence spectra obtained. Fluorescence Emission spectra of transferrin at increasing concentrations (from 0.75 μg/ml to 50 μg/ml). Although the Duetta demonstrates twice the sensitivity in measuring protein concentration via UV absorption, its superior performance is further exemplified through fluorescence, as shown in the fluorescence profile in Figure 4. Comparison of Transferrin concentration measurements obtained with the spectrophotometer and Duetta instruments. This further demonstrates the sensitivity of its fluorescence spectroscopy. Fluorescence spectroscopy has numerous applications in life sciences, spanning cell biology to genomics. In protein characterization, the intrinsic fluorescence of certain amino acids (tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine) provides a valuable capability for studying proteins without the need for labeling. While the Duetta's limit of detection is approximately 25 µg/mL using absorbance, it can successfully detect transferrin at 0.75 µg/mL using fluorescence. This limit of detection can be enhanced by optimizing certain parameters, such as increasing the integration time, widening the slits, and enhancing the emission increment (binning). The Duetta is capable of measuring both UV-visible absorbance spectra and fluorescence spectra, exhibiting greater sensitivity than other benchtop spectrophotometers that are exclusively designed for absorbance measurements. The optimized optical layout and dual-purpose design of the Duetta spectrofluorometer make it ideal for protein spectroscopy and analysing low-concentration solutions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With hospitals and health systems looking for better ways to support patients with serious illness, a new resource is showing up as an addition to inpatient care teams: death doulas. Also known as end-of-life doulas, these practitioners provide nonmedical support focused on the emotional, practical, and existential dimensions of dying. While not much research exists around this burgeoning field, a study published in November 2023 that surveyed 10 bereaved family members indicated a positive impact of their services. The conclusion says that “For families in this study, DDs (death doulas) enabled the family member to be prepared for death, which led to a sense of empowerment. This, in turn, made them feel emotionally supported and enabled the family member to provide personalized deaths and funerals for their loved ones.” But death doulas are trained to support personal rituals, legacy work, and values-based conversations.” Hospice, palliative care, and even social workers have different roles from a death or end-of life doula, Scheer said. While death doulas have traditionally worked in community or home-based settings, some hospitals are now exploring how (and whether) to integrate them into inpatient palliative care programs, volunteer services, or hospice-adjacent teams. Much of the renewed attention to death doulas reflects a broader discomfort with how dying unfolds in modern medical settings. End-of-life nurse educator, hospice pioneer, and author Barbara Karnes has long framed death doulas as a parallel to birth doulas not because death and birth are identical but because both represent profound transitions that are physically intense, emotionally charged, and unfamiliar to most families. “There are so many similarities between birth and death — I mean I can go on and on, from food to sleep to labor,” Karnes said. That framing resonates with clinicians who regularly care for dying patients in hospitals. For Adjoa Boateng Evans, MD, MPH, an anesthesiologist and critical care physician at Duke Health and an assistant professor of anesthesiology at Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, who spends a significant amount of time at patients' bedsides during life's final hours, the idea of adding nonclinical end-of-life support feels like a recognition of what hospital medicine often can't provide consistently: time, presence, and emotional steadiness. She said clinicians who have been present for many deaths recognize that the transition itself is qualitatively different from most other hospital events. “Even the physical process of someone making that transition — it's very different from most of the other medical events that happen in a hospital,” she said. “It's an extraordinary life experience that's physically challenging, emotionally charged, and a myriad of emotions. One reason, Evans noted, is that most people have very limited firsthand experience with dying. “Most people might witness one, two, maybe three deaths in a way where they're physically present,” she said. “So to have someone who is comfortable in that space and can say, ‘I've walked this path many times, I sort of know what you're about to experience' — that expectation setting, I can't emphasize how important that is.” Shoshana Ungerleider, an internal medicine physician and founder of the End Well Project, said doulas are most often brought in when a patient transitions to comfort-focused care or when death is anticipated within days to weeks. Scheer noted that doulas may be especially helpful during prolonged or complex dying trajectories. She said that because doulas are not embedded in hospital staffing models, they can often provide continuity and flexibility that clinical teams cannot. Evans said that ultimately, end-of-life doulas could provide a real resource to clinicians as well, in helping address families' urgent, concrete fears without turning the interaction into a medical discussion. “When someone is transitioning to comfort care or they're on the precipice of dying, so much of my job in family meetings is expectation setting,” Evans said. Evans said the kinds of questions families often carry into the room have medical components but actually come from a place of seeking reassurance or comfort: Is my loved one suffering? “When we go into the room, it's expectation setting: ‘Here's what your loved one might look like. We're giving medication for secretions,' so they feel like everything is being addressed in that moment,” she said. “Sometimes we (as clinicians) can get hyper-focused on the medical aspects,” she said. Death doulas can be complements to these resources, and don't overlap their work. “What I see as the difference is individualized care, you know, like having one doula for one individual patient, vs as the physician and the palliative care team, we've got to spread ourselves thin between multiple patients and just can't give the amount of time and attention that we would like to,” Evans said. “I think the biggest gift end-of-life doulas give is time.” Scheer said that in most hospital settings, death doulas are not formally integrated into care teams. Instead, patients and families typically engage them independently, often alongside hospice or palliative care services. Evans, Karnes, Scheer, and Ungerleider reported having no disclosures.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A large Australian pilot shows that testing healthy young adults for high-risk genes can reveal serious disease risk years before symptoms appear, challenging traditional family history–based genetic testing. Study: Feasibility and outcomes of the DNA Screen nationwide adult genomic screening pilot. In a recent study published in Nature Health, a group of researchers evaluated the feasibility, clinical uptake, and diagnostic yield of nationwide genomic screening in the adult population for medically actionable genetic conditions. Earlier, genetic testing in adults was dependent on a strong family history and severe personal illness, which left high-risk individuals undetected. But advances in genomic medicine have made this possible. Population genomic screening is one promising alternative, as it identifies genetic risk before disease onset and can guide preventive care. Healthcare systems are increasingly exploring large-scale genetic testing, but real-world evidence is essential to inform ethical, clinical, and economic decisions. Further research is needed to understand long-term outcomes, gene-specific disease penetrance in unselected populations, and downstream impacts of this approach. A prospective nationwide genomic screening pilot was conducted among Australian adults aged 18–40 years who had no prior genetic diagnosis of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, Lynch syndrome, or familial hypercholesterolemia. Participants were recruited through national media coverage and then invited in stages to assemble a diverse cohort across geography, sex, cultural background, and socioeconomic status. Participants registered online, completed educational modules, passed a knowledge quiz, and provided informed consent before submitting saliva samples by mail. DNA was extracted and analysed using a custom next-generation sequencing panel targeting ten high-risk genes associated with the three conditions. Only pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were reported, following guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology. The reported findings were research results that required confirmation in accredited clinical laboratories, and the assay did not detect large structural variants or copy number changes. Participants with detected high-risk variants received telephone-based genetic counselling and were offered referral to specialist clinical genetics services or lipid clinics. Clinical teams collected family history, assessed eligibility for government-funded genetic testing, and arranged confirmatory testing through accredited diagnostic laboratories. Study data were managed using Research Electronic Data Capture software, and analyses were performed using the R statistical computing environment. Public engagement with the genomic screening initiative was substantial. More than 30,000 individuals registered within a short period following national media coverage, reflecting strong interest in proactive health information. No participant carried more than one high-risk variant. Almost all individuals (98.1%) had no prior personal diagnosis of a related clinical condition, highlighting the ability of genomic screening to identify hidden risk before disease is clinically recognised. However, the likelihood that a detected variant will cause disease may be lower in population-screened individuals than in families referred for clinical evaluation. Genetic counselling supported understanding of results and facilitated entry into appropriate care pathways, where participants were typically advised on evidence-based risk management strategies, such as enhanced cancer surveillance or lipid-lowering interventions. Another key finding was that 74.5% of participants who attended specialist clinics would not have qualified for government-funded genetic testing under existing criteria. Similarly, most participants with familial hypercholesterolemia variants had not previously met criteria for funded testing; 38.5% had not had cholesterol measured in the past year, and 63.5% were not receiving lipid-lowering therapy, despite many having elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels when assessed. Family history proved to be an unreliable predictor of genetic risk. More than half of the participants with high-risk variants reported no affected first-degree relatives. This finding highlights a major limitation of criteria-based testing approaches and illustrates how reliance on family history alone can delay diagnosis and prevention. From a real-world perspective, these findings have important implications. Early identification enables individuals to take preventive action well before clinical disease emerges, potentially reducing cancer incidence or cardiovascular events during early adulthood and midlife. At a population level, this approach may shift healthcare from reactive treatment to prevention, although longer-term follow-up is needed to assess impacts on health outcomes, healthcare utilisation, variant-specific penetrance, and costs. This nationwide pilot demonstrates that adult population genomic screening is feasible, highly acceptable, and clinically actionable within a public healthcare system. The programme successfully identified young adults at high genetic risk who would otherwise have remained undiagnosed under current testing frameworks. High clinical uptake and engagement indicate that individuals value early risk knowledge when appropriate counselling and follow-up care are provided. By revealing the limitations of family history-based testing, the findings illustrate how population genomic screening could reshape preventive healthcare, while underscoring the need for continued evaluation of long-term benefits, risks, penetrance uncertainty, and equity considerations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A controlled feeding trial shows that minimally processed pork, when incorporated into a plant-forward dietary pattern, delivers biomarker benefits comparable to those of legumes in healthy older adults without harming cognitive or physical aging markers. Study: Effects of Minimally Processed Red Meat within a Plant-Forward Diet on Biomarkers of Physical and Cognitive Aging: A Randomized Controlled Crossover Feeding Trial. The population of the United States (US) is aging rapidly, leading to a demographic shift and a greater healthcare burden from chronic diseases associated with aging. Among age-related conditions, cognitive impairment, especially dementia, poses a significant concern. Dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is projected to impact around 14 million Americans by 2060, underscoring the need for strategies targeting modifiable risk factors. Dietary patterns have been identified as one such modifiable factor, although most evidence relates to cardiometabolic and biomarker outcomes rather than clinical dementia endpoints. In the present study, researchers investigated the effects of incorporating minimally processed red meat in a plant-forward diet on biomarkers of cognitive and physical aging. This crossover feeding trial recruited community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older. Participants were randomized to a minimally processed pork (MPP) or lentil (MPL) diet. They were required to abstain from non-study foods, alcohol, and supplements, as well as other excluded protein sources, to maintain dietary control. In arm 1, participants consumed 162 g/day of minimally processed lean pork as the primary protein source. In arm 2, an equivalent amount of protein was provided from chickpeas, lentils, split peas, and black beans. Each intervention lasted eight weeks, separated by a two-week washout period. Further, a questionnaire was administered at the end of each phase to assess feasibility, adherence, and menu acceptability. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and after the end of each dietary intervention phase. A range of cardiometabolic, nutritional, and neuroactive biomarkers related to cognitive aging were measured in serum. Triglycerides, glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and total cholesterol (TC) were assessed via point-of-care testing. Serum levels of ferritin, insulin, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were determined using multiplex immunoassays. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was performed to assess body composition. The study included 57 participants assigned to an MPL or MPP diet. The cohort included Caucasian adults, aged 71 years on average, with a predominance of females (72%; 26 women and 10 men). Educational attainment was considerably high, with over 70% having a four-year degree or higher. Overall, participants were in good health for their age and free of major chronic conditions, which may limit generalizability to older adults with greater multimorbidity or lower socioeconomic diversity. Both diets produced favorable changes in several cognitive-related metabolic markers compared to baseline. TC was significantly lower after both phases, with no significant group differences. HDL was also lower across diets, though the reduction was smaller following the MPP diet, resulting in higher post-intervention HDL levels than following MPL. Triglycerides decreased by a smaller margin in both groups. BDNF showed a modest increase after MPL that did not reach conventional statistical significance, but was unchanged with MPP. However, phosphatidylcholine was significantly lower after MPP and MPL phases. Homocysteine levels increased modestly following MPP but remained unchanged after MPL, with the increase largely driven by a small subgroup of participants who had elevated baseline homocysteine concentrations, while most participants showed little change. Further, both groups had significant increases in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and reductions in its excitatory precursor, glutamic acid, which represent peripheral neurochemical markers rather than direct measures of brain function. Similarly, both groups had elevated levels of tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine. Body weight and lean mass decreased after both phases, reflecting the broader controlled dietary pattern rather than a specific protein effect, with no significant differences between diets. Handgrip strength was stable across time points, with minimal improvements from baseline. Likewise, the chair stand test indicated stable lower-body function, with no signs of decline during either intervention. In sum, plant-forward dietary patterns incorporating MPL or MPP produced broadly similar short-term changes in cardiometabolic, nutritional, and neuroactive biomarkers related to cognitive and physical aging. The results challenge perceptions that red meat is broadly unsuitable for older populations when consumed in minimally processed form and within a DGA-aligned dietary pattern. Importantly, the findings relate to short-term biomarker and functional measures rather than clinical outcomes such as cognitive decline or dementia, and longer-term trials in more diverse populations are required to determine clinical relevance.
