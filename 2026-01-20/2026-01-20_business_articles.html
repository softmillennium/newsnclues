                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ripple's CEO predicted Binance would re-enter the U.S., as the cryptocurrency exchange's co-CEO said it would adopt a "wait-and-see" approach. Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, exited the U.S. in 2023 as part of a deal in which then CEO, Changpeng Zhao, pleaded guilty to criminal charges over the failure to prevent money laundering on the exchange, as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice. Zhao was pardoned by U.S President Donald Trump in October. In an interview with CNBC in Davos on Tuesday, Binance's co-CEO, Richard Teng, said it was taking a "wait and see" approach to re-entering the U.S., which he called "a very important marketplace." Shortly afterwards, in a separate interview with CNBC, Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of blockchain company Ripple, predicted it would happen. "It's a very large market, and ... not that many years ago, they were a material player," he said of Binance. "I think they'll come back because they're a capitalistic, innovative company that wants to solve ... larger markets and continue to grow," Garlinghouse added. Garlinghouse said Binance's re-entry would increase competition and bring more people into the market. "I think it will actually have the positive impact of bringing more people into the market, in part because it'll reduce pricing," Garlinghouse said. "Today their [Binance] pricing is lower on a global basis than what we see here in the U.S." The Clarity Act faced opposition from some crypto industry participants. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong posted last week on X that his company "can't support the bill as written." "I would say that any regulation will be better than no regulation," Teng, who is a former regulator, said during his CNBC interview. And in the first instance, most regulations will not be perfect, but it is then going through a round of enhancements," Teng said. Garlinghouse said he was "surprised" at Armstrong's "vehemence" in coming out against the Clarity Act. "I mean, basically the rest of the industry, including exchanges that compete with Coinbase, were still supporting it," Garlinghouse said. "My understanding is everyone's kind of still at the table. I'm hopeful we find the how to break that impasse ... Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said Tuesday that "there has to be some regulation" of artificial intelligence, pointing to several documented cases of suicide linked to the technology. "This year, you really saw something pretty horrific, which is these AI models became suicide coaches," Benioff told CNBC's Sarah Eisen Tuesday at the World Economic Forum's flagship conference in Davos, Switzerland. Benioff's call for regulation echoed a similar call he made about social media years ago at Davos. In 2018, Benioff said social media should be treated like a health issue, and said the platforms should be regulated like cigarettes, "They're addictive, they're not good for you." "Bad things were happening all over the world because social media was fully unregulated," he said Tuesday, "and now you're kind of seeing that play out again with artificial intelligence."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Danish pension operator AkademikerPension said it is exiting U.S. Treasurys because of finance concerns as Denmark spars with President Donald Trump over his threats to take over Greenland. Anders Schelde, AkademikerPension's investing chief, said the decision was driven by what it sees as "poor [U.S.] government finances" amid America's debt crisis. But it also comes as tensions escalate between the U.S. and Denmark after Trump's latest threats to tariff European countries if Greenland, an arctic territory of Denmark, isn't sold to the U.S. "It is not directly related to the ongoing rift between the [U.S.] and Europe, but of course that didn't make it more difficult to take the decision," Schelde said in a statement to CNBC. The fund currently has a position of around $100 million in U.S. Treasurys, an AkademikerPension spokesperson confirmed to CNBC. The U.S. recorded a budget shortfall of $1.78 trillion last year, down just over 2% from 2024's fiscal year as Trump's broad and steep tariffs took effect. Moody's Ratings cut the United States' sovereign credit rating down to Aa1 from Aaa in May, citing the budget deficit and high borrowing costs associated with rolling over debt at lofty interest rates. The U.S.' finances made "us think that we need to make an effort to find an alternative way of conducting our liquidity and risk management," Schelde said. Denmark has grown increasingly hostile toward the U.S. as Trump has ratcheted up his calls for control of Greenland to be given to the U.S. Trump said over the weekend that he would institute tariffs on several European nations beginning Feb. 1 if the U.S. did not take control of Greenland and that those levies could rise to 25% on June 1. European leaders have reportedly considered using counter-tariffs and other punitive economic measures as a result. Some investors have worried that European countries could dump their U.S. asset holdings in response to Trump's new tariffs. Treasury yields in the U.S. and abroad surged Tuesday, a sign of investors feeling geopolitical turmoil rising. The U.S. dollar and stocks fell, and gold rose to new all-time highs in a session defined by the "sell America" trade. Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio told CNBC on Tuesday that sovereign funds could start to dump U.S. investments if they stop seeing the U.S. as a stable trading partner. "On the other side of trade, deficits, and trade wars, there are capital and capital wars," Dalio told CNBC's "Squawk Box" at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. In other words, maybe there's not the same inclination to buy ... U.S. debt and so on." Reuters first reported the Danish pension fund's Treasury exit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's far more to Davos fashion than the iconic blue beanie and a sea of suits. Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of eMed Population Health, was spotted at the event wearing a satin suit from Gabriela Hearst. The three-piece set, in its winter-white shade, featured a delicate floral print. She wore the ensemble with ballet flats and chunky black glasses. She wore a jacket and miniskirt from the fashion house's Coco Neige collection, a floor-length coat, and white boots with thick chain detailing. One attendee, photographed by Business Insider, accessorized his navy jacket with a multicolored scarf, sunglasses with orange-tinted lenses, and blue leather gloves. On its own, the outfit was chic and feminine — especially when paired with her Louis Vuitton tote bag. However, she didn't accessorize with heels or jewelry. Instead, she wore tan snow boots and brown leather gloves. One person wore dark-wash jeans with white socks, red sneakers, and a puffy coat that combined both colors with others across its statement print. Sarah Backhouse, an executive director at executive networking company World Fifty Group, matched the fur collar of her Frankie Shop coat with a cozy fur hat. She accessorized the ensemble with Saint Laurent sunglasses and a Maison Goyard bag. Wealth manager Andrew Gan gave his suit a Davos upgrade with a fur-lined coat and sunglasses as he headed to the Philippines House to moderate. Nidhi Sinja, the head of marketing and communications for BCG North America, opted to carry a notebook in her quilted weatherproof Tory Burch bag. She coordinated the look with a North Face coat and L.L. Bean boots, both in cream hues that matched her white purse. Wendy Diamond is the founder and CEO of Women's Entrepreneurship Day Organization. She's also an investor and board advisor for numerous companies. She told Business Insider that green is her "happy color," and that she likes to wear bright colors when "the world is so dark." When the CEO of Philip Morris International US travels, even for long trips, she takes a carry-on. Her trick: Pick a color for the week and coordinate outfits around that, with travel-well fabrics. In addition to the fabric layers, she wore black platform boots, white sunglasses, Chanel earrings, and a pink Prada handbag.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Greenlanders are "bewildered" by President Donald Trump's "devastating" bid to annex the Arctic island, its business minister has told CNBC, as the issue turns into a geopolitical firestorm. Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday ahead of Trump addressing the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Naaja Nathanielsen, minister for business and mineral resources, described the international attention as "quite devastating" for many of the roughly 57,000 Greenlanders. "To all of a sudden find ourselves in the midst of a storm that's about acquiring us like a product or a property, it's really difficult for us — not to mention the threats of military action and an actual occupation of our country." Her comments come as the U.S. president stepped up his efforts to acquire the self-governing Danish territory, which he has claimed is "imperative" for U.S. national security. On Monday, he answered "no comment" when asked by NBC if he'd use military force to seize it. "There can be no going back," Trump said of his plans in a social media post on Tuesday. The U.S. president on Saturday pledged to impose a rising wave of tariffs on eight European countries from Feb. 1 for opposing the U.S. acquiring Greenland. French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday described Trump's tariff threats as "fundamentally unacceptable," while British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the move "completely wrong." Nathanielsen told CNBC she had been "really moved by the strong show of solidarity" from European political leaders. "You cannot go along with a scheme where you have to accept that an ally occupies another ally," she said. Protests have taken place in Greenland's capital, Nuuk, and Denmark's Copenhagen in recent days, with people marching with red and white Greenlandic flags. Opinion polls have shown that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose U.S. control, while a strong majority support independence from Denmark. Nathanielsen said: "We have always known that our position in the world geographically causes some tensions. We used to be a colony of Denmark. So, we're not we're not unfamiliar with complexity and controversy and conflict — but we have always found our ways to adapt to the situation and work with it. So, I am absolutely certain that were we to become occupied, that would mean the destruction of our culture. Nathanielsen said the island's lawmakers would seek more clarity on how it can accommodate the U.S. "without being swallowed up" by it. "The threat of occupation is devastating to us. It is absolutely not something that we would be able to work with at all," Nathanielsen said. "So, we do not want to be bought. Of course, we don't want to be occupied — what country in the world would want that? And we do want to lower the temperature," she added. Denmark remains responsible for its foreign, defense and security policies. Most Greenlandic political parties support independence but disagree over when and how to reach it. The independence movement has become a balancing act between the island's ultimate goal of self-determination and the need for Denmark's financial support for essential services, such as health and education. Speaking to CNBC earlier this month, Aaja Chemnitz, an MP representing Greenland in the Danish Parliament, said Greenlanders wanted to "make sure that we're not dehumanized, which I think we have been in this whole situation." And I think it's important to remember that, of course, you can't buy a country, but you can also not buy a population," Chemnitz told CNBC on Jan. 8.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The looming U.S. Supreme Court ruling on President Donald Trump's tariffs could affect Trump's threats to levy new tariffs on NATO members over the issue of Greenland's sovereignty, trade attorneys told CNBC. The legality of that strategy will be decided by the Supreme Court, with a ruling expected as early as this week. "Although the president hasn't specified if these tariffs would be IEEPA-based, the U.S. Supreme Court decision on IEEPA would likely affect the outcome of the threatened Greenland tariffs," said Michael Lowell, partner and chair of the Global Regulatory Enforcement Group at Reed Smith. "Similar to the Brazil tariffs; if the Supreme Court rules IEEPA doesn't give the president tariff power, then these tariffs being threatened on NATO members would be illegal," Lowell said. Trump announced Saturday that if a deal is not reached allowing Washington to acquire Greenland, the eight European countries would face increasing tariffs, starting at 10% on Feb. 1 and rising to 25% on June 1. The court's latest batch of decisions issued Tuesday morning did not include the tariffs case. If the court overturns the tariffs, "it may still be necessary for companies that import from those countries to bring suit to enforce," Lowell said. But "that would be a quick lawsuit since the law would be clear by the ruling." Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said it's "very unlikely" that the Supreme Court will overturn Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs. Even if the administration loses, Trump officials have said new tariffs will go into effect immediately. Trade attorneys say the president could use the recently completed Section 232 investigation on critical minerals to levy tariffs. In a Jan. 14 proclamation, Trump invoked Section 232 authority to direct the negotiation of agreements with foreign nations to "ensure the United States has adequate critical mineral supplies and to mitigate the supply chain vulnerabilities as quickly as possible." If negotiations do not work, the proclamation says, "it may be appropriate to impose import restrictions, such as tariffs, if satisfactory agreements are not reached in a timely manner." "Regardless of the IEEPA outcome, Section 232 remains a powerful and unaffected tool that the administration will likely continue to deploy for additional tariffs. Importantly, we note that these tariffs do not stack on top of IEEPA tariffs," TD Cowen analysts wrote in a recent note to clients. We want to hear from you.

Dangling a free Cybertruck in front of an employee is one way to get results. Elon Musk made the unusual offer when xAI's engineers were setting up new GPU racks, according to then-technical staff member Sulaiman Ghori. "Elon's like, 'OK, you can get a Cybertruck tonight if you can get a training run on these GPUs in 24 hours,'" Ghori said on "Relentless." Now, Ghori said he sees Tyler's Cybertruck outside his lunch window. It's yet another example of Musk's drive for efficiency in execution. Employees at his companies are known to accept lower salaries but higher stock grants, betting their compensation on the company's performance. Four days after the podcast was published, Ghori revealed that he left xAI. "Nothing but love to my former team and coworkers!" Some famous faces popped in to question the timing of his exit. Musk has been known to make bets with his employees. Almost two decades ago, he reportedly wagered against early SpaceX employee Steve Davis. Davis won, and employees on the Hawthorne campus enjoyed their free fro-yo. It helps that Musk's companies tend to have a flat org structure, giving Musk one-on-one contact with many of his employees. In the interview, Ghori said that there were three levels at xAI: individual contributors, cofounders, and Musk himself. The fast-paced, individualistic culture may take some getting used to. Ghori came to xAI after years as a startup founder. "Nobody told me what to do," Ghori said. Ghori had no team and wasn't assigned a desk. He sought out cofounder Greg Yang, who had been instrumental in his hiring. He soon started working on the Ask Grok feature in X. As for the free Cybertruck, it's not Musk's first time promising to give one away. In March, he offered a Cybertruck to anyone who could find out who was behind a social media campaign from Democratic senators.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Billionaire investor Ray Dalio warned Tuesday that President Donald Trump's aggressive political direction could spark a new phase of global financial conflict, as foreign governments and investors reconsider their appetite for U.S. assets amid rising unease and economic tensions. "On the other side of trade deficits and trade wars, there are capital and capital wars," Dalio told CNBC's "Squawk Box" at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. In other words, maybe there's not the same inclination to buy at U.S. debt and so on." The founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world's largest hedge funds, is concerned that countries holding large amounts of U.S. dollars and Treasurys may become less willing to finance U.S. deficits if trust erodes. At the same time, the U.S. continues to issue large volumes of debt, creating a problematic situation if confidence weakens on either side, Dalio said. "We know that both the holders of U.S. dollars are denominated ... and those who need it, the United States, are worried about each other. So if you have other countries who are holding it, and they're worried about each other, and we're producing a lot of it, that's a big issue," he said. Treasury prices tumbled Tuesday as investors weighed renewed tariff threats from Washington that revived fears of a trade war with Europe and spurred a flight away from U.S. assets. Dalio said history offers multiple examples of similar episodes in which economic conflict escalated beyond trade into capital flows and currency disputes. "When you have conflicts, international geopolitical conflicts, even allies do not want to hold each other's debt. This is logical and it's factual, and it's repeated throughout the world history," he said. Dalio reiterated the importance of diversification, arguing that investors should not rely too heavily on any single asset class or country. He highlighted gold as a key hedge in periods of financial stress, recommending it make up between 5% and 15% of a typical portfolio. Spot gold rose to an all-time high of $4,689.39 on Tuesday as investors flocked to safe-haven assets on intensifying tensions. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs are starting to be reflected in the price of some items, as sellers weigh how to absorb the shock of the added costs. Amazon and many of its third-party merchants pre-purchased inventory to try to get ahead of the tariffs and keep prices low for customers, but most of that supply ran out last fall, Jassy said in a Tuesday interview with CNBC's Becky Quick at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "So you start to see some of the tariffs creep into some of the prices, some of the items, and you see some sellers are deciding that they're passing on those higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, some are deciding that they'll absorb it to drive demand and some are doing something in between," Jassy said. "I think you're starting to see more of that impact." The comments are a notable shift from last year, when Jassy said Amazon hadn't seen "prices appreciably go up" a few months after Trump announced wide-ranging tariffs. Last April, Jassy also predicted that some sellers may be forced to pass the added cost of the tariffs on to consumers because some businesses "don't have 50% extra margin that you can play with." A major retail trade association warned last August that the trade war would loom over companies' inventory ordering plans this Spring, which could lead to higher prices, fewer products on the shelves and job losses. Amazon is trying to "keep prices as low as possible" for consumers, but in some cases, price hikes may be unavoidable, Jassy said Tuesday. "At a certain point, because retail is, as you know, a mid-single digit operating margin business, if people's costs go up by 10%, there aren't a lot of places to absorb it," Jassy said. "You don't have endless options," he added. Consumers remain "pretty resilient" and are still spending amid the tariffs, Jassy said. But they have impacted some shoppers' purchasing habits, with Amazon observing some people trading down to lower priced items and bargain hunting, while others are holding off from buying higher-priced discretionary products, he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The "sell America" trade is in full swing Tuesday morning after President Donald Trump and European leaders escalated tensions over Greenland. "This is 'sell America' again within a much broader global risk off," Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central banking strategy at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients. Precious metals gold and silver marched to fresh highs. Gold, which has long been viewed as a safe-haven investment during periods of geopolitical turmoil, was on track for its biggest one-day gain since October. U.S. stocks tumbled as investors mitigated exposure to American assets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid more than 600 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each dropped more than 1%. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known Wall Street's "fear gauge," spiked to a highs last seen in November. The latest flare-up in so-called sell America positioning follows Trump's threats to impose 10% tariffs on eight European countries as part of his push to take over Greenland. Representatives from the 27-nation European Union gathered for an emergency meeting in response to Trump's tariff call, which he said would start Feb. 1 and then rise to 25% on June 1. Greenland has repeatedly rejected Trump's request to purchase the arctic island, with Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen saying Monday that it would "not be pressured" and "stand firm on dialogue, on respect and on international law." European officials are reportedly considering using a salvo of counter-tariffs and other punitive economic measures against the U.S. in retaliation. The "sell America" trade suggests that global investors will place higher risk premiums on U.S. investments amid fears that the U.S. is no longer a reliable trading partner. Following Trump's latest threats, some investors worry that European countries could dump U.S. assets in a show of power. "On the other side of trade, deficits, and trade wars, there are capital and capital wars," Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio told CNBC's "Squawk Box" at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. In other words, maybe there's not the same inclination to buy ... U.S. debt and so on." International markets continued to slide Tuesday after starting to retreat on Monday, when U.S. markets were closed for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday. Trump's latest threats to tariff French wine and other imported goods rattled investors who feared the U.S. would no longer act as an unwavering commercial ally of Europe. Evercore ISI's Guha said the dollar falling and the euro rising suggests that global investors are "looking to reduce or hedge their exposure to a volatile and unreliable" United States. Impacts on the dollar and other U.S. assets could be severe and long-term, if Trump does not walk back his plans — a trade known as "TACO," or "Trump Always Chickens Out," that was coined last spring — or find a compromise, Guha said. "What remains to be determined is the magnitude and duration of these dynamics," Guha said. More broadly, investors may be looking for ways to diversify away from U.S. stocks at a time when indexes are near all-time highs and American equities take up a majority of the world's total market capitalization, according to Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. "Markets may already be pricing in full the concept of American exceptionalism, at least barring an epic, crack-up economic boom," Mould said. — CNBC's Jeff Cox, Yun Li and Chloe Taylor contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bank chiefs called for calm on Tuesday as stocks plummeted after President Donald Trump's threats of fresh tariffs. The pan-European Stoxx 600 dropped about 1.2% in morning trade Tuesday — with the continent's major bourses and most sectors heavily selling off — after Trump floated a potential 200% levy on French wine and champagne. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell almost 1.5%, the S&P 500 slid 1.6%, the Nasdaq was last seen almost 2% lower, while, earlier, markets in Asia also closed in negative territory. With fears of a re-run of last April's "Liberation Day" tariff turmoil looming over the World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, bank CEOs in Europe called for cool heads around the prospect of a renewed trade war. "It's important to stay calm," Commerzbank CEO Bettina Orlopp told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Tuesday. "If anything told us from last year's [tariff] event, it's best to stay calm and see what's really happening." European banks were among the hardest hit in Tuesday's reversal, with the Stoxx 600 Banks Index down 1.4% on Tuesday, while financial services slipped about 1.3%. It came after markets were still reeling from the President's plan to hit European countries with tariffs of 10% from Feb. 1, rising to 25% from June 1, if they continue to push back against his bid to annex Greenland. Anthony Gutman, co-CEO of Goldman Sachs International, said that the current noise is creating volatility for investors, warning that "this is the new normal." Speaking with CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" in Davos, Gutman said that while the bank is optimistic on Europe this year, the risk of tariffs will "create complexity for our clients who are business leaders and have to make business decisions." Steven Van Rijswijk, CEO of ING Group, said that European markets had ultimately weathered last year's "Liberation Day" tariff turmoil, but the growing use of trade policies as a geopolitical weapon had provided a "wake-up call" for the continent. He said the current "back and forth" rhetoric over tariffs and territory could have a lasting impact on the global economy. "Clearly, things like geopolitics, trade disputes, supply chain challenges are not good for the stability of the economy," Van Rijswijk told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" in Davos. Do we see organizations change trade patterns or produce somewhere else? It's more the indirect effects that cause concern rather than the direct effect of an import tariff implementation."

"All cash removes any uncertainty around share price movements and makes Netflix's bid more comparable to Paramount's," said Joe Bonner, a media analyst at Argus Research. Ellison has made eight bids for WBD, all of which have been rejected. Paramount is now suing WBD while fighting for spots on its board. If WBD's cable channels, such as CNN, TNT, and HGTV, are valued at less than $2.25 per share, or about $5.9 billion, then Paramount's proposal appears, at first glance, to be more appealing than Netflix's. However, WBD has said that it must knock off $1.79 per share from Paramount's bid to account for costs it would incur by changing course, like a $2.8 billion breakup fee to Netflix. Paramount has argued that the WBD cable networks it wants to buy are worth $0 per share, or only as much as the debt they're expected to carry. Ellison and company acknowledged "the theoretical possibility" that those TV assets could be worth $0.50 per share. Most media analysts have a rosier view of WBD's cable business, valuing its channels anywhere from the low single digits to $3.51 per share. Even a glass-half-empty view based on the valuation of new cable company Versant would put WBD's networks at $1.20 per share as of last week, a Business Insider analysis found. Netflix's updated all-cash offer helps solidify WBD's decision to choose it, after accounting for the added costs from Paramount's bid.</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Forty-five percent of gig workers surveyed by TransUnion said that they had either rented or sold access to a gig work account on a gig work platform, the company said in a report released last week. Gig work apps such as Uber, DoorDash, and Walmart's Spark have told Business Insider that they don't allow users to share their accounts with other people. On Facebook, Telegram, and other social media platforms, users can find ads offering to sell or rent accounts for gig work apps. Many also offer third-party programs, called "bots" by gig workers, which claim to give users an edge in claiming deliveries. At Walmart, some Spark delivery drivers have shown up at stores or customers' homes using names that don't appear to match who they actually are, Business Insider reported in 2023. Walmart has since taken additional steps to verify who its delivery workers are, such as asking them to stop by a store and show their ID. Thiry said prospective gig workers might buy or rent accounts for several reasons, such as not having a long enough driving history or being unable to pass a background check. Sharing accounts with other people violates the terms of service for major gig work apps. A company spokesperson said that users who share their accounts risk "losing access to the Uber platform permanently." Last year, Uber required all its drivers and delivery workers to reverify their identities. A DoorDash spokesperson also confirmed that the company removes workers from its app for sharing accounts. In 2024, DoorDash said it began requiring more frequent identity verification for some delivery workers to crack down on account sharing. TransUnion, which provides identity verification services for apps and websites, asked gig workers about renting or selling accounts after seeing an uptick in suspicious activity, Colleen Thiry, director of TransUnion's gig economy business, told Business Insider. "Our data was showing some signals of workers selling their accounts," Thiry said, such as accounts that were long associated with Android smartphones suddenly showing up on an iPhone. There are other types of suspicious activity in gig work, TransUnion's survey found. Forty-three percent of gig workers surveyed said they have experienced tip-baiting, in which a customer offers a high tip only to cut it after the gig worker agrees to complete the order or trip. That practice can be demotivating for gig workers, TransUnion's analysis of the survey said. Fraud poses risks to the companies behind gig-work apps since both workers and customers need security, TransUnion's Thiry said. "Both sides of that transaction need to feel safe and secure," Thiry said.</p>

The company is rolling out Walmart-inspired ideas, including "Supercenter" warehouses, a new distribution layer known internally as the "1DC" network, and microfulfillment centers within Whole Foods stores, according to internal documents obtained by Business Insider. The shift reflects a hard lesson: mastery of e-commerce does not translate into dominance in groceries, particularly perishable items that drive frequent shopping. Nearly a decade after paying $13.7 billion for Whole Foods, Amazon still trails Walmart in everyday grocery shopping, and is now reshaping its retail infrastructure to compete head-on with Walmart's Supercenter model. Earlier this month, plans emerged for a roughly 225,000-square-foot Amazon megastore near Chicago. Bigger than a typical Walmart Supercenter, the new concept is designed to let customers buy "fresh groceries, household essentials, and general merchandise — all in one trip," according to Amazon.

Michael Levin and Josh Lowitz, cofounders of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, called the move "mind-blowing" and said "it reveals a degree of Walmart jealousy that we didn't expect." With roughly 90% of the US population estimated to live within 10 miles of a Walmart store, the company's 5,000-plus locations give it a powerful edge in selling fresh food and other perishables, along with many other everyday staples. Amazon and Whole Foods, meanwhile, each held roughly 1.6% of the market. That's fueled a surge in Walmart shares, valuing the company close to $1 trillion. Overall, it offers millions of products for same-day delivery. But when it comes to more delicate food items, such as pears, meat, and cheese, the company knows it has more work to do. Grocery is an "ever-growing" part of its fast-delivery business, the spokesperson added, while noting that in 2025, Amazon added perishable groceries to its Same-Day Delivery service, now available in 2,300 locations, allowing customers to shop without trade-offs between speed, selection, and savings. Internal planning documents show Amazon intended to launch at least five such sites last year. Amazon wanted to test whether customers would "step-change their shopping habituation and engagement" once the Supercenter warehouses went live, one of the documents stated. Sub-same-day grocery delivery is still a tiny part of Amazon's business. At the end of September, it had 30 million eligible customers for this service, according to one of the internal documents obtained by Business Insider. Only 1.6 million of them, or roughly 5%, shopped through the service. Amazon's Supercenter warehouses are part of a broader push to expand same-day grocery delivery. Internal forecasts called for at least 34 US same-day grocery sites in 2025. Amazon already operates over 80 same-day facilities nationwide, though not all handle groceries, according to Marc Wulfraat, president of logistics consultancy MWPVL. Under an initiative known as Project Taylor, the company plans to expand sub-same-day grocery delivery across Europe. Less visible, but just as important, is a new upstream distribution layer called "1DC." These facilities store the most frequently purchased products and replenish fulfillment centers as demand emerges. That can shift weeks' worth of inventory out of space-constrained fulfillment centers and into distribution sites optimized for palletized storage and rapid transfer. One internal document described the change as a move from a "push" system, in which inventory is positioned based on forecasts, to a "pull" system that allows fulfillment centers to draw inventory from distribution centers as needed. Amazon began rolling out the 1DC concept last year through new buildings and retrofits. Longer delivery windows once allowed the company to rely on a single layer of warehouses that could ship inventory from any fulfillment center to any customer. But faster delivery promises made that model "untenable," forcing Amazon toward a structure long used by traditional retailers, the document added. MWPVL's Wulfraat said Walmart pioneered the distribution-center model that stores inventory for replenishing retail locations, while Amazon built its business around fulfillment centers that ship directly to consumers. Amazon also operates a cross-dock network to resupply its fulfillment centers, he said, and the 1DC sites represent a newer, more targeted layer of that system focused on high-velocity items. Amazon's spokesperson told Business Insider that 1DC is part of a broader initiative the company previously announced to regionalize its delivery operations and reduce shipping costs. Amazon has begun installing micro-fulfillment centers in the back of select stores, effectively turning them into local hubs for online orders. The model lets shoppers buy Whole Foods-specific items while also ordering products available only on Amazon, reducing the need to shop at other retailers. This approach also mirrors Walmart's strategy of using its stores to fulfill online orders. Walmart said last year that it can offer same-day delivery to 93% of US households through its store-fulfilled network, with about 35% of those orders arriving within three hours. Internal plans show Amazon aiming to expand its perishables distribution capacity from 2.6 billion units in 2025 to 3.3 billion units by the end of 2026. The push is central to Amazon's same-day delivery strategy and its broader grocery ambitions. Company documents stress that delivering high-quality perishables quickly and reliably is essential to scaling the business.</p>

I'm reporting from Davos, Switzerland, where thousands of business leaders and politicians have arrived at the World Economic Forum to shake hands, talk shop, and maybe even eke out a few ski runs. Some executives I've spoken to this week had some big concerns about AI, but none of them had anything to do with a potential bubble. Raj Sharma, EY's global managing partner of growth and innovation, said there's not enough talk about AI security — specifically, the management of AI agents and their lifecycle. Compare that to humans, where every computer system and piece of data they touch is often tracked. Every time Dan publishes a story, you'll get an alert straight to your inbox!

But if you look under the covers, it's still not mature." AI agents are the latest twist in executives' ongoing concerns over cybersecurity, and it's proving to be an incredibly challenging problem. In some cases, the risk has gotten so big that it's shifting timelines on companies' AI plans. "It's not that they're not moving forward, but they are taking a moment to make sure that their environment is secure, and perhaps even leaving data on-prem a little bit longer so they're confident that got their data security in place," Walsh told me. Walsh said another "real concern" is the threat of quantum computing from a security perspective. While he acknowledged we're still a few years out from the tech being fully developed, its power is incredible. That's led companies to look at their systems and reencrypting things, no easy task. "We're spending quite a bit of time as well, helping companies think through: What does that look like?</p>

A favorite tool of President Donald Trump has been costing Americans, according to new study. The president's aggressive tariff policy launched last year placed additional duties on dozens of trade partners, including China, India, and the European Union.

The Kiel Institute study examined more than 25 million shipment records, worth nearly $4 trillion, between January 2024 and November 2025. "US import prices rise nearly one-for-one with tariffs, while trade volumes contract," the study said. The findings echo other research that has found Americans are paying for tariffs, including from Harvard Business School and The Budget Lab at Yale. The Kiel study said American importers and wholesalers are first hit by the tariff cost, followed by manufacturers and retailers, all of which must choose whether to absorb the tariff or pass it on to their customers. American consumers are then hit by increased prices, both on imported goods or American-made products that use foreign inputs. Many of Trump's tariff policies could also be undone. The Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on the legality of a host of Trump's tariffs that were instituted under an emergency national security law.</p>
