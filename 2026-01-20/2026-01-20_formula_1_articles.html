                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aston Martin and Honda have kicked off their new partnership via a Tokyo launch presentation. Aston Martin and Honda celebrated the start of their works F1 partnership on Tuesday during a special pre-season event in Tokyo, Japan. Aston Martin Aramco Executive Chairman Lawrence Stroll was joined by Honda President and Representative Executive Officer Toshihiro Mibe for the presentation, while F1 President and CEO Stefano Domenicali also attended and took to the stage. Since returning to F1 as a works team back in 2021, the Silverstone-based Aston Martin squad have been powered by Mercedes engines, but this changes for 2026 – and the sport's all-new regulations – thanks to their Honda tie-up. Aston Martin's former Team Principal and new Chief Strategy Officer Andy Cowell has been overseeing the final stages of the integration, drawing on his lengthy and successful stint at Mercedes High Performance Powertrains, with F1 design legend Adrian Newey taking on team boss duties. “I am delighted to celebrate the start of our partnership with Honda here in Tokyo today,” said Lawrence Stroll. “Our journey won't always be easy and challenges inevitably lie ahead, but winning is what drives both companies forward and together we look forward to many successful years of partnership.” “Striving to become number one in the world, Honda will continue to take on challenges together with the Aston Martin Aramco Formula 1 Team. “Today we also launch a new ‘H' mark with a refreshed design, which Honda has adopted as the new symbol representing its automobile business. This new H mark symbolises the transformation of Honda's automobile business so it is an important moment for us.” “Formula 1 began racing in Japan in 1976 before moving to Suzuka in 1987, so there is a deep loyalty and connection to the country where a record 13 World Drivers' Championships have been decided over the years. “The sport is growing in Japan where there are now nearly 17 million passionate and incredible F1 fans. The Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka last year welcomed 266,000 weekend attendees, and saw a +26% year-over-year increase in TV viewership in Japan. There will be a simplified hybrid engine that runs on advanced sustainable fuel without impacting the performance. “F1 echoes the commitment of Honda and Aston Martin Aramco Formula 1 Team to sustainability, and is on target to achieve the goal of Net Zero by 2030 having already delivered a 26% reduction in carbon emissions by year end 2024 compared to 2018.</p>
