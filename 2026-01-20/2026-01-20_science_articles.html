                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It means that matter and energy will degrade—ultimately leading to chaos in the universe—if things are left alone. So why is a new theory suggesting that gravity could possibly emerge from entropy? Yup, you read that right: quantum relative entropy may determine the action of gravity. This is what physicist and mathematician Ginestra Bianconi from Queen Mary University of London proposes in a new theory. There's just one issue: for this to work, two theories that have forever been at odds with each other need to harmonize. Einstein's theory of general relativity sees gravity as the curvature or warping of spacetime by an object, with more massive objects having a greater effect on the spacetime surrounding them. As a result, our planet is orbiting within the huge distortion in spacetime that the Sun's enormous presence has caused, like a quarter rolling around one of those oversized funnels. Quantum theory, on the other hand, views the universe as being made of extremely small objects (think subatomic particles) that act as both particles and waves. According to quantum mechanics, the universe is described on micro and nano scales. Quantum entropy quantifies (no pun intended) how much disorder or unpredictability is in the state of something, which helps distinguish between two quantum states. Bianconi, in her work, found that she could use it to describe how spacetime and matter interact. “Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry [of spacetime],” she said in a study recently published in Physical Review D. By allowing quantum entropy to describe differences between matter and spacetime, Bianconi's theory modifies general relativity by first giving the fabric of spacetime low energy and a small curvature, and then by predicting a small cosmological constant (which explains how much and how fast the universe is expanding). The new theory also incorporates a G-field, or gravitational field. G-fields are vector fields—which means they have both magnitude and direction—that explain how space is influenced by an object. Bianconi uses the G-field as what is known as a Lagrangian multiplier, which finds the maximum and minimum of a function. If the clash between the theories is finally resolved, you end up with quantum gravity, which would exist in particle and wave form. That said, gravity existing in particle form raises another question. Dark matter is made of particles, but the nature of those particles remains an enigma, since they have never been directly observed. Bianconi thinks that, if gravity can exist as particles, the G-field might offer an explanation for dark matter. “This work proposes that quantum gravity has an entropic origin and suggests that the G-field might be a candidate for dark matter,” she said in a press release. There's still a lot of work that needs to be done before this idea is anywhere near confirmed. But, there's a chance that chaos brings about gravity, which in turn might, in one form, possibly be dark matter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Looks like limestone's on the menu for some unknown creepy crawly. For most organisms on Earth, rocks are objects, not food. But for one oddball microbe, desert limestone seems to have been on the menu. Recently, geologist Cees Passchier from Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz came across what looked like tiny burrows in marble and limestone in the deserts of Namibia, Oman, and Saudi Arabia. “The investigated areas are currently arid, but experience occasional rain showers and regular dense coastal fog, while wet periods occurred in the past.” So, what type of microogranisms could have made the burrows? Bacteria, fungi and lichens have shown that they can survive extreme conditions, and some of them are endolithic, meaning they live inside rocks. Fungi secrete digestive agents that were not present in the rock, and they also create a complex network of hyphae, or filaments, known as a mycelium. The burrows were parallel and evenly spaced, which would be unusual for fungi, and there were no other patterns observed. Because the burrows were found to be too wide to have only been made by one organism at a time, and they showed growth rings, its was more likely that they were formed by colonies of microbes. Calcium carbonate dust found in the tunnels is also a common excretion from microbes that live in these types of rocks. However, no fossilized organisms have yet been found—just evidence of their existence. These setbacks, however, did not rule out the idea of life. On the contrary—while weathering or abiotic chemical processes can create structures mistaken for signs of life, a thorough microscopic examination showed this was not the case. Whatever microbes carved out the tunnels have been long dead, though there are questions around whether the mystery species still exists. Maybe it's still creeping around somewhere, digging new tunnel systems for us to one day uncover.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That same power also makes them especially appealing targets for cyberattacks, said Swaroop Ghosh, a professor of computer science and electrical engineering at the Penn State School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Ghosh and Suryansh Upadhyay, who recently earned his doctorate in electrical engineering from Penn State, coauthored a research paper that outlines several serious security weaknesses affecting today's quantum computing systems. The physical hardware that runs these systems must also be part of any serious defense strategy. Ghosh: Traditional computing works using units of information called bits, which you can picture as a light switch in the "on" or "off" position. These qubits are much more versatile than standard bits, capable of effectively representing one, zero or both at the same time, otherwise known as a superposition. These qubits can also be linked to one another, known as entanglement. By incorporating superpositions and entanglement into decision making, quantum computers can process exponentially more data than bit-powered computing systems, while using an equivalent number of qubits. Q: What are some of the main security vulnerabilities facing quantum computers right now? Upadhyay: Currently, there is no efficient way to verify the integrity of programs and compilers -- many of which are developed by third parties -- used by quantum computers at scale, which can leave users' sensitive corporate and personal information open to theft, tampering and reverse engineering. Many quantum computing algorithms have businesses' intellectual property integrated directly in their circuits, which are used to process highly specific problems involving client data and other sensitive information. If these circuits are exposed, attackers can extract company-created algorithms, financial positions or critical infrastructure details. Additionally, the interconnectedness that allows qubits to operate so efficiently inadvertently creates a security vulnerability -- unwanted entanglement, known as crosstalk, can leak information or disrupt computing functions when multiple people use the same quantum processor. Q: What are current commercial quantum providers doing to address the security concerns? Can they use the same security methods implemented in traditional computers? Upadhyay: Classical security methods cannot be used because quantum systems behave fundamentally differently from traditional computers, so we believe companies are largely unprepared to address these security faults. Currently, commercial quantum providers are focused on ensuring their systems work reliably and effectively. While optimization can indirectly address some security vulnerabilities, the assets unique to quantum computing, such as circuit topology, encoded data or hardware coded intellectual property systems generally lack end-to-end protection. Since quantum computers are still a relatively new technology, there is not much incentive for attackers to target them, but as the computers are integrated into industry and our day-to-day life, they will become a prime target. At the device level, developers should focus on mitigating crosstalk and other sources of noise -- external interference -- that may leak information or impede effective information transfer. At the system level, hardware needs to be compartmentalized by dividing business data into different groups, granting users specific access based on their roles and adding a layer of protection to the information. Our hope is that this paper will introduce researchers with expertise in mathematics, computer science, engineering and physics to the topic of quantum security so they can effectively contribute to this growing field.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Roughly 400,000 years later, after the cosmos cooled enough for atoms to form, it entered a long and quiet phase known as the "Dark Ages." Scientists believe hydrogen atoms emitted very faint radio waves with a wavelength of 21 cm. These signals are thought to preserve valuable information about the earliest stages of cosmic history. Importantly, dark matter is expected to cause variations in this signal of a similar size. Measuring the overall radio signal across a wide frequency range of about 45 MHz could therefore provide critical information about dark matter, including the mass and speed of its particles. To detect such an extremely weak signal, astronomers need a location free from interference caused by Earth's atmosphere and human technology. Several upcoming lunar missions, including Japan's Tsukuyomi Project, aim to place radio telescopes on the Moon for this reason. was supported in part by grant NSF PHY-2309135 to the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics (KITP).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. has held its measles-free status for more than 25 years. Experts say unrelenting outbreaks in the past year may change that It has been a full year since one of the worst measles outbreaks in recent U.S. history began ripping through West Texas. The highly infectious disease has continued to burn across multiple U.S. states, Mexico and Canada since Texas reported an outbreak in children in January 2025. The U.S. had been virtually free of the disease for more than a quarter-century thanks to highly effective and safe vaccines, but now experts say we're on track to losing that status if officials determine measles has spread continuously for a year. For measles, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) formally declares a country has “eliminated” the disease when cases can no longer be linked to one another—there is zero continued transmission—for 12 months or more. Last November the Americas officially lost their elimination status when PAHO's review of epidemiological data revealed that Canada was no longer measles free for a year. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. “Loss of measles elimination status does not carry formal sanctions, but it is a significant public health signal,” PAHO's spokesperson wrote in an e-mail to Scientific American. The Americas have faced setbacks before—including temporary loss of status in Venezuela (2018) and Brazil (2019)—and successfully regained elimination through intensified vaccination, strengthened surveillance, and rapid outbreak response.” The organization will hold its meeting on April 13 in order to give countries enough time to provide documentation and data, its spokesperson added. Epidemiologist Walter Orenstein, who is on a committee for the Task Force for Global Health, which independently reviews elimination of diseases, expects that the U.S. will soon follow Canada. “It's certainly looking like we have lost our status, but we have to look at the data,” he says, adding that the Task Force for Global Health's committee hasn't been called at this stage to look at the current situation. “Elimination itself is a really huge public health achievement—but with measles especially because the virus is so infectious,” says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan. Measles requires very high levels of population immunity to squelch transmission; at least 95 percent of people in a community must have immunity from prior infection or vaccination. And national vaccination efforts played a central role in raising those population immunity levels in the U.S., says Orenstein, a professor emeritus at Emory University, who has worked on measles elimination for decades. “This intervention can stop and break the chains of transmission,” he says. Most people know measles for its itchy rash, but it can cause high fevers, ear infections, severe dehydration, pneumonia and chronic brain inflammation, or encephalitis, Orenstein says. Such severe measles cases—largely unseen in U.S. hospitals for decades—came roaring back during recent outbreaks. From there, “cases increased exponentially,” says Katherine Wells, a public health director of the city of Lubbock, Tex., which is about 70 miles from Gaines County. “Two young children lost their lives because of measles, and that's unprecedented. Among those cases, one adult and two children died; all three were unvaccinated. It remains to be seen if these outbreaks stem from the initial epicenter in West Texas. “If [health officials] make that connection, then there will be transmission for a full year, and we'll definitely lose measles elimination status,” Wells says. Amanda Montañez; Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (data) Previously, measles cases have sporadically popped up in people who traveled to countries where the disease was more prevalent, but those small outbreaks were rapidly contained and never lasted longer than a year. A major reason measles has become so entrenched now is because of declining national vaccination rates and growing antivaccine messaging driven by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Rasmussen says. In response to Scientific American, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services maintained that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles. “He has gone out of his way to encourage alternative treatments that are unproven to work like vitamin A, cod liver oil and steroids.” “Some of the federal partners that we typically have in a public health outbreak weren't necessarily available to us,” she says. News outlets have recently reported that U.S. federal officials are trying to maintain that the country is still measles-free by building a case to prove that ongoing infections, such as in outbreaks in Utah, Arizona and South Carolina, are not linked to West Texas cases. “It is important to understand whether these cases are linked because that may help inform efforts to control the spread of measles,” Nuzzo says, “but we should not be looking for this information as though we're attempting to wheedle our way out of an embarrassing political situation.” She, Rasmussen and Orenstein fear that other historical, vaccine-preventable diseases, such as polio, could also come raging back. Even if it's proven that the current outbreaks are not related to those that began in January 2025, Wells says it may only be a matter of time before measles is no longer considered eliminated in the U.S. Young is associate editor for health and medicine at Scientific American.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Will brain science deliver answers about consciousness or hit another wall? This article includes a companion guide to competing theories of consciousness. Until half a billion years ago, life on Earth was slow. The seas were home to single-celled microbes and largely stationary soft-bodied creatures. Bodies diversified in all directions, and many organisms developed appendages that let them move quickly around their environment. These ecosystems became competitive places full of predators and prey. We don't know whether this was the moment when consciousness first arose on Earth. But it might have been when living creatures began to really need something like it to combine a barrage of sensory information into one unified experience that could guide their actions. This last step is what we have to thank for most of art, science and philosophy—and the millennia-long quest to understand consciousness itself. Why does being awake and alive, being yourself, feel like anything at all, and where does this singular sense of awareness come from in the brain? These questions may have objective answers, but because they are about private, subjective experiences that can't be directly measured, they exist at the very boundaries of what the scientific method can reveal.

Their search has revealed constellations of brain networks whose connections help to explain what happens when we lose consciousness. We now have troves of data and working theories, some with mind-bending implications. We have tools to help us detect consciousness in people with brain injuries. But we still don't have easy answers—researchers can't even agree on what consciousness is, let alone how best to reveal its secrets. The past few years have seen accusations of pseudoscience, results that challenge leading theories, and the uneasy feeling of a field at a crossroads. Yet the stakes for understanding consciousness have never been higher. Sometimes these artificial-intelligence models claim outright to be sentient. “We're going to be looking back at this period.” When you dream, some strange form of consciousness persists, even if it's disconnected from the outside world. Some scientists have used these different states of consciousness to chop up conscious experience into at least three pieces: wakefulness, internal awareness and connectedness. In a “normal” state of consciousness, you have all three. Jen Christiansen; Source: “Near-Death Experience as a Probe to Explore (Disconnected) Consciousness,” by Charlotte Martial et al., in Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Vol. How the brain gives rise to these strange experiences is a question that has haunted neuroscience for as long as the field has existed. Massimini was driven wild by the mystery in medical school, when he held a brain in his hands for the first time. It's not particularly elegant,” he says, but “inside this object that you can hold in your hand, there is a universe.” Many philosophical traditions have dealt with this apparent disconnect by saying the mind—or the soul—is not made of the same physical stuff as our bodies, a position called dualism. Science has instead flourished by assuming the opposite and siding with a theory called materialism, which presumes that everything we observe somehow arises from physical matter, including consciousness. “You had to be retired or religious or a philosopher to be able to talk about it,” says neuroscientist Christof Koch, a member of the Scientific American board of advisers and chief scientist at the Tiny Blue Dot Foundation, a research nonprofit focusing on perception science. In 1990 Koch and Nobel laureate Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of DNA, directly challenged this taboo. They published a paper that laid out an ambitious plan to study the neurobiology of consciousness and launched the field as we know it today. That same year neuroscientists invented a new way to observe the working brain called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Koch, who studied vision, thought that by measuring people's brain responses as they looked at special optical illusions, scientists could figure out which parts of the brain are activated when something is consciously perceived. Some of the illusions used can be perceived in one of two ways; one example is Rubin's vase, which can be seen either as a vase or as two faces in profile. If neuroscientists could scan people's brains as their conscious perception switched, they could find parts of the brain that were associated with that change: the neural correlates of consciousness. Chalmers took the bet, thinking 25 years “might be a bit optimistic,” he says. These low-level sensory-processing areas contain a lot of information that our conscious selves aren't privy to. These areas appear to continue receiving sensory information when we're under anesthesia as well. So consciousness seems to happen in some region outside these early visual-processing areas—but there is no consensus on where. The most popular is global neuronal workspace theory (GNWT), which envisions consciousness as a kind of stage. When something enters your conscious awareness—an itch, say, or the buzz of your refrigerator—it's thrust onto the stage and spotlighted in a process called ignition. For you to be conscious of a refrigerator's buzzing, your brain cannot just represent the buzz by activating its auditory parts (which are located near the temples). Reentry and predictive processing theories (PPTs), on the other hand, propose that consciousness emerges from our brain's balancing of two processes: perception and prediction. Neuroscientist Anil Seth of the University of Sussex in England, who favors PPTs, describes conscious perception as a “controlled hallucination,” with the brain's best guess of what's going on around you mapping onto what you consciously perceive. There's a chasm between our everyday experiences and what science can explain. Then there's integrated information theory (IIT), a mathematical and philosophical theory that stands out from the rest because it doesn't start with the brain. Instead it starts with consciousness itself and the observations we can make about its properties, then asks what kind of system could allow something with these properties to exist. IIT takes consciousness to be differentiated—there are a lot of things you could be experiencing right now but aren't, making your consciousness rich in information. And it is also unified, or integrated—all your diverse experiences are bundled into one single stream of consciousness. Mathematically, these two features together make the system very complex. But first it would inspire one of the most important insights we have into how consciousness works. They loaded the machine into a truck and drove more than nine hours to Liège. A neurologist in Liège named Steven Laureys had founded the Coma Science Group for treating and learning from patients with disorders of consciousness, and Massimini believed his new device could be used to measure someone's level of consciousness from their brain activity. Researchers had tried to measure the difference between conscious and unconscious brains with other brain-imaging techniques before, without much success. Then EEG measured brain waves to reveal how that stimulation spread. In a conscious brain (whether awake or dreaming), the disturbance ripples outward as neurons cause neighbors in their networks to fire. But unlike waves in water, each of those ripples of neuron activity begets more ripples, spreading in a complex and far-reaching way throughout the brain's networks. In dreamless sleep, this doesn't happen, Massimini had previously found. If there are ripples, they don't spread far. In Liège, Massimini and his colleagues tested the technique on people with various disorders of consciousness—patients who were in vegetative states, or were in minimally conscious states, or were outwardly unresponsive but internally aware. This relation could be represented as a single number, called the perturbational complexity index, or PCI. PCI is a very crude measure of consciousness, but it can estimate someone's place on the spectrum of consciousness quite reliably. And it suggests that complexity is an important part of a conscious brain. In this way, conscious brain activity is both differentiated (or rich in information) and integrated (forming one unified whole)—principles that Massimini borrowed from IIT, the theory that doesn't begin with the brain. These interactions build up complexity, or what IIT theorists call a “cause-effect structure,” so that when you stimulate one part of a conscious brain, other parts respond. But during dreamless sleep or when someone is under anesthesia, all that communication goes away. In the “silent periods” between the waves, neurons enter what's called a down state, in which they can't respond to electric signals from their neighbors. “Why can I reverse sleep in a few seconds, and I can reverse anesthesia in the course of minutes, but I might not ever be able to reverse this pathological state?” asks George Mashour, an anesthesiologist and neuroscientist studying consciousness at the University of Michigan Medical School. Massimini hopes that we can eventually learn how to jump-start consciousness—rebuild the cathedral—for people who are in vegetative or minimally conscious states. “It feels like there's been a hard-won legitimacy to the study of consciousness over the past 30 years.” —Anil Seth, University of Sussex Yet understanding brain-network complexity does not solve the mystery of consciousness. These findings can help explain how a brain can reach the state of consciousness but not what happens once it's gotten there, Mashour points out. It can't explain how a toothache feels different from a headache, how someone without functioning circulation can have a near-death experience, or how the psychedelic drug 5-MeO-DMT makes time seem to stop and obliterates your sense of self. There's a chasm between our everyday experiences and what science can explain. “No one really has a theory that closes the explanatory gap,” says Tim Bayne, a philosopher at Monash University in Melbourne. “But that's a problem on us, not the brain.” At a June 2023 conference in New York City, Koch gave Chalmers his case of wine and conceded that he had lost their bet. The results of a massive research project pitting IIT against GNWT had recently been shared. Researchers developed predictions from each theory about what should happen in the brain when an image is consciously perceived versus when it's not. Testing those predictions could challenge or even falsify either theory. GNWT, in contrast, predicts that a stimulus (such as an image) rises to the level of consciousness only when there is an “ignition” to the workspace in frontal parts of the brain such as the prefrontal cortex, which is known for planning and decision-making. GNWT also predicts that this ignition signal will appear as two discrete spikes of activity—one when an image is first presented and one when it's removed—whereas IIT predicts sustained activity as long as a person is looking at an image. And although there was a signal in the prefrontal cortex when images were first presented, there was not a second signal when they were removed, contrary to GNWT's predictions. An open letter calling IIT pseudoscience was published online in September 2023, signed by 124 researchers in or adjacent to the field. “My greatest fear is that we get another ‘consciousness winter' wherein just talking about consciousness is considered pseudoscientific bunk,” wrote Erik Hoel, a consciousness researcher at Tufts University who has published extensively on IIT's limitations, in a post defending the theory. But now there is a sense that the field has arrived at an “uneasy stasis,” Seth and his colleagues wrote recently in the journal Frontiers in Science. And there are important results to show for it. We've learned about specific brain regions that are associated with specific pieces of conscious experience, such as our sense of self. We're also getting hints that ancient structures deep in our brain, such as the thalamus, may be more involved than neuroscientists had previously thought. Comparing consciousness among species could reveal why it exists in the first place. “There's still disagreement about how to define [consciousness], whether it exists or not, whether a science of consciousness is really possible or not, whether we'll be able to say anything about consciousness in unusual situations like [artificial intelligence],” Seth says. “It's a wonderful moment but also kind of sobering,” Bayne says. But for revealing the stuff of consciousness, there's no sure bet. “If Bill Gates gave me $100 billion tomorrow and said, ‘Okay, find out about consciousness,'” he says, “I wouldn't know what to do with that money.” In 2022, when a Google engineer publicly claimed the AI model called LaMDA he had been developing appeared to be conscious, Google countered that there was “no evidence that LaMDA was sentient (and lots of evidence against it).” This struck Chalmers as odd: What evidence could the company have been talking about? “No one can say for sure they've demonstrated these systems are not conscious,” he says. As these machines get better at imitating human dialogue—sometimes even claiming outright to be conscious—ethicists, AI companies and the concerned public are increasingly looking to consciousness research for answers. Where does consciousness exist in the world around us, and how can we prove it? Scientists and philosophers are increasingly studying animals, human fetuses, brain organoids and AI to figure out what common principles could underlie consciousness. Researchers have often studied consciousness by focusing exclusively on humans, because the only consciousness we can ever truly be sure exists is our own. For everyone else, we must rely on behavioral cues and trust they are not a “philosophical zombie,” with all the outward signs of consciousness but without any of the internal experience. We extend this assumption to fellow humans every day. Sometime in the 20th century, though, scientists stopped doing so for animals. “When I started my graduate studies in the 1990s, ‘chimpanzees aren't conscious' was the default position for a lot of philosophers,” says Kristin Andrews, a philosopher studying animal minds at the City University of New York Graduate Center. Jen Christiansen; Source: “Theories of Consciousness,” by Anil K. Seth and Tim Bayne, in Nature Reviews Neuroscience, Vol. First, in the 1990s, consciousness scientists broadened it to do research on lab monkeys that couldn't be done on humans. Now the frontier rests with fish, crustaceans and insects. The 2024 New York Declaration on Animal Consciousness, which Andrews co-authored, states that there is at least a “realistic possibility” of consciousness in all vertebrates and some invertebrates, such as insects, certain mollusks and crustaceans. “We can't just assume that all these animals are not conscious,” says Chalmers, who signed the declaration. Comparing consciousness among species could reveal why it exists in the first place. “People have focused a lot on where consciousness is in the brain and perhaps less so on what it's for,” Seth says. He theorizes that consciousness is intrinsically linked to life. Living beings can do only one thing at a time, and to choose what to do, they must bring a lot of relevant information together into one stream. “Just as we can build things that fly without flapping their wings, maybe there are other ways of being conscious that don't require being alive,” Seth says. The AI large language models (LLMs) that underpin chatbots such as ChatGPT and Claude can certainly imitate consciousness well, although today they are most likely the zombies that Chalmers and other philosophers once imagined. Even most AI enthusiasts will tell you that all an LLM does is predict which word comes next in a sentence; it doesn't “know” anything. But—to be strictly philosophical about it—can we really prove LLMs aren't conscious if we haven't yet agreed on how consciousness works? Some researchers think theories rooted in the human brain, such as GNWT, could still provide clues. If the brain is like a biological computer—a dominant assumption of cognitive neuroscience—then maybe researchers can compare how LLMs process information and test for indicators of consciousness. GNWT, which was itself inspired by an early type of AI model, says information is consciously experienced once it's broadcast across the entire system. Brains do a lot more than run algorithms that process information, Seth says. “It's a massive assumption that none of these things matter,” he says. IIT proponents such as Massimini and Koch also think the underlying physical “stuff” of a system matters—and that mere simulations, including LLMs, can't yield consciousness. “It's like [how] simulating a storm will not get you wet,” Massimini says, “or simulating a black hole will not bend space and time.” In consciousness science, everything comes back to the measurement problem. You can try to find markers of different states of consciousness—for instance, by scanning a person's brain while they are awake versus in slow-wave sleep, which is typically dreamless and therefore unconscious. This experimental setup assumes the subject is in fact not dreaming. But that assumption could be wrong: sometimes people do report dreams when woken from slow-wave sleep. How can you confirm that your assumptions about consciousness are correct when your only ground truth is someone else's word—which is not really a ground truth at all? When we are faced with this seemingly intractable problem, it's tempting to reach for an escape valve: Maybe none of it is real. This skeptical position was often put forward by the late philosopher Daniel Dennett, and it's a legitimate question. But it doesn't allow us to opt out of treating brain injuries, understanding drugs such as anesthetics and psychedelics, and grappling with our treatment of animals and the intelligent machines we're birthing. All of science rests on inferences about things we cannot see. We can't see a black hole, Koch points out, but we can spend decades building up theories and creating instruments that let us infer their existence. Consciousness may be a more challenging case, but researchers don't plan to stop trying. With the right tools, “the sense of mystery about how material processes could give rise to conscious experiences would start to go away,” Seth says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From anxious Weimaraners to aggressive Chihuahuas: What science can tell us about dog breeds A large dataset shows some dog stereotypes are based in reality, and others might be unfair characterizations Dogs can have wildly different personalities, which often vary by breed and size. Although individual temperament matters most, larger trends can help predict which pooch will be meek and mild and which is most likely to bite the postal worker. The Dog Aging Project, a long-term study on canine aging, has collected data on dog behavior from more than 50,000 owners, distilling the results into scores for traits such as trainability, excitability and aggression. Understanding these patterns is key to improving the compatibility of people and their pets. “Dogs are entirely dependent on their owner,” says veterinarian Audrey Ruple of the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, a collaborator on the Dog Aging Project.

Miriam Quick, Lee Lotor and Jen Christiansen; Source: Dog Aging Project (DAP) https://data.dogagingproject.org/Index (data) Good behavior in a big dog is often judged as more of a necessity, whereas people may let little dogs off the hook. They often obey “sit” or “stay” commands immediately, and they aren't as easily distracted by interesting sights, sounds or smells. Some breeds are known for being easily taught, and mixed-breed dogs tend to get rated as less trainable than purebreds. That pattern, however, might reflect the early life experiences of mixed-breed dogs, who often are adopted from shelters or rescues and have experienced trauma, Ruple says. A purebred dog raised by a reputable breeder, however, will be primed to be comfortable around people and eager to learn. collectively find solutions to these problems as long as the federal government remains committed to providing funding for this research,” Wilson notes.

While large language models (LLMs) achieve near-perfect scores on medical licensing exams, these evaluations inadequately reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world clinical practice. Here we introduce MedHELM, an extensible evaluation framework with three contributions. First, a clinician-validated taxonomy organizing medical AI applications into five categories that mirror real clinical tasks—clinical decision support (diagnostic decisions, treatment planning), clinical note generation (visit documentation, procedure reports), patient communication (education materials, care instructions), medical research (literature analysis, clinical data analysis) and administration (scheduling, workflow coordination). These encompass 22 subcategories and 121 specific tasks reflecting daily medical practice. Second, a comprehensive benchmark suite of 37 evaluations covering all subcategories. Third, systematic comparison of nine frontier LLMs—Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, DeepSeek R1, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Llama 3.3 and o3-mini—using an automated LLM-jury evaluation method. Our LLM-jury uses multiple AI evaluators to assess model outputs against expert-defined criteria. Advanced reasoning models (DeepSeek R1, o3-mini) demonstrated superior performance with win rates of 66%, although Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved comparable results at 15% lower computational cost. These results not only highlight current model capabilities but also demonstrate how MedHELM could enable evidence-based selection of medical AI systems for healthcare applications.

(2026)Cite this article The supermoiré lattice, arising from the interference of multiple moiré patterns, reshapes the electronic band structure of the material that hosts it by introducing new mini bands and modifying the band dispersion. Concurrently, strong electronic interactions within the flat bands induced by the moiré pattern lead to the emergence of various correlated states. However, the impact of the supermoiré lattice on the flat band system with strong interactions remains largely unexplored. Here we report the existence of the supermoiré lattice in twisted trilayer graphene with broken mirror symmetry and elucidate its role in generating mini flat bands and mini Dirac bands. We demonstrate interaction-induced symmetry-broken phases in the supermoiré mini flat bands alongside a cascade of superconductor–insulator transitions enabled by the supermoiré lattice. Our work shows that robust superconductivity can exist in twisted trilayer graphene with broken mirror symmetry and underscores the importance of the supermoiré lattice as an additional degree of freedom for tuning the electronic properties in twisted multilayer systems. It also sheds light on the correlated quantum phases such as superconductivity in the original moiré flat bands, and highlights the potential of using the supermoiré lattice to design and simulate quantum phases.

Superconductivity appears on both the hole-doped side and electron-doped side. Correlated states appear at moiré filling ν = 1, ± 2, 3. The result is symmetric with respect to the displacement field, reflecting the device's mirror symmetry. c-d, Landau fan diagram of Rxx (c) and Rxy (d) at D = 0 V/nm. e, The states shown in (c) and (d). Landau levels originating from ν = ± 4, 0 and ν = 1, ± 2, 3 are visible, as indicated by the black and red lines, while those from the Dirac band are shown in pink. The red lines mark the most robust Landau levels stemming from each correlated state at ν and have a slope of C = 2 + 4 − ν in the fan diagram. Dirac Landau levels contribute CDirac = 2, and Cflat = 2 + 4 − ν originates from symmetry-broken Chern insulators in flat bands, similar to those observed in TBG. a, Rxx and Rxy as a function of B and n when D = − 0.193 V/nm. The right figure extracted the states by black lines, and the red lines mark 1, 1/2, 1/3… quantum flux of the supermoiré lattice. Landau levels stemming from different supermoiré minibands are visible. b, the same measurement as a with fixing top gate voltage Vtg = 11 V and varying Vbg to change carrier density. Four sets of Landau levels can be seen and the distance between each is nsm. a, Longitudinal conductance as a function of n and B at T = 15 K. The conductance shows peaks at the fractional quantum flux of the supermoiré lattice, suggesting the Brown-Zak oscillation. b, Line cut of conductance at a fixed carrier density from a. The longitudinal resistance Rxx is plotted as a function of carrier density for a fixed top gate voltage of Vtg = 11 V under different magnetic fields. Red lines serve as guides to the eye, indicating the expected positions of resistance peaks. The spacing between successive red lines corresponds to nsm = 0.468 × 1012 cm−2. The first resistance peak consistently aligns with the corresponding red guiding line. The second resistance peak shows a slight deviation from the red line; however, at B = 0.15 T and B = 0.25 T, it aligns well with the guiding lines. The third and fourth resistance peaks exhibit small deviations from the red lines. a–p, The single particle electronic structure of the TTG is tracked as a function of interlayer potential difference ΔU and interlayer tunnelling between layer 2 and layer 3. The band color indicates the extent of state polarization on the bottom layer (layer 3). In the weak tunnelling regime, the Dirac band exists and the relative fermi surface between mini bands and Dirac band can be adjusted by the displacement field. a-d show the band structure at ΔU = 0 meV. e-h show the band structure at ΔU = 10 meV. i-l show the band structure at ΔU = 20 meV. m-p show the band structure at ΔU = 30 meV. a–b, n − D mapping of Rxx and Rxy when B = 1 T. Same as in Fig. 2e,f, vertical features are flat band Landau levels, and ‘S' shape features are the transition lines of nearby Dirac Landau levels. However, compared with the results measured at B = 0.5 T, the distance between different vertical features equals eB/h, which means the four-fold degeneracy of flat band Landau levels is lifted. c-e, Zoom-in of Rxx (c) and Rxy (d). The degeneracy of Dirac band Landau levels is also lifted. There are four Dirac Landau level transition lines near CNP, between which NDirac equals 1, 0, − 1. At a fixed n, the number of total filled Landau levels Ntotal = nh/eB and the filled flat band Landau levels Nflat = Ntotal − NDirac can be extracted. e, Figure shows (NDirac, Nflat) in the n − D mapping. a, the corresponding Landau fan diagram of Rxy of the Rxx shown in Fig. b, Line cut of Rxy at a carrier density of n = 4.26 × 1012 cm−2. Rxy shows almost quantized resistance values of h/e2, h/2e2, h/6e2, and h/10e2, attributed to the Dirac Landau levels. When the Fermi level lies within the gap of the flat band, the transport is solely governed by the Dirac band, which transitions into Dirac Landau levels in the presence of a magnetic field. c-d, n − D mapping of Rxx and Rxy at B = 1 T for electron densities near the full filling of the top moiré lattice. The black solid lines indicate the full filling of the top moiré lattice. It is evident that the position of this full filling shifts as a function of the displacement field. This shift arises from the relative band shift between the Dirac band and the flat band. When the displacement field becomes sufficiently large (in our case, D > 0.3 V/nm), the Dirac band hybridizes with the flat band. As a result, Rxy no longer exhibits characteristics associated with the Dirac band. The purple lines mark the strong states appearing at n12 + nsm, which occur when the Fermi level lies within the gap of both the Dirac and flat bands. Additionally, the red dashed line highlights a gapped state induced by the supermoiré lattice. Between the red and black lines, three more states marked by yellow, green, and cyan lines are observed. These are attributed to isospin symmetry breaking within the supermoiré miniband. Landau fan diagram of Rxx and Rxy at D = 0.145 V/nm. All the observed features in the Landau fan are illustrated. The black dashed lines represent Landau levels originating from the full filling of the top moiré lattice (n12). The red dashed line marks the gapped state induced by the supermoiré lattice. The pink line indicates the transition between different Dirac Landau level regimes and above this line, two Dirac Landau levels are filled; below it, due to a change in degeneracy, six Dirac Landau levels are filled. Additionally, three states highlighted by yellow, green, and cyan lines are observed, with spacings nsm/4. These are isospin symmetry broken states within the supermoiré mini band. n − D mapping of Rxx on the hole-doped side. The red dashed lines mark the half filling \((\frac{1}{2}* {n}_{12})\) and full filling (n12) states of the top moiré lattice. The green dashed lines are the guiding lines for the other resistive states appearing in the superconducting regime. And the distance between is \(\frac{1}{2}* {n}_{sm}\). Similar to Fig. 4a, the nature of these states depends on the relative strength between interaction effects and the supermoiré potential. a, n − D mapping of Rxx at T = 240 mK. b–e, dVxx/dI versus Idc and n at different displacement fields. At a very large negative displacement field (b), superconductivity shows a single superconducting dome with the maximum critical current around 100 nA. As the displacement field increases, superconductivity weakens, and the maximum critical current decreases. More interestingly, the superconductor is gradually diced into small superconducting domes. At D = 0 V/nm, the critical current shows a kink in the superconducting dome as marked by the green dashed line where the carrier density is \(\frac{1}{2}* {n}_{12}+{n}_{sm}\). This shows that the supermoiré lattice starts mediating the superconductivity. At higher displacement fields, there are critical current kinks features appearing as marked by green dashed lines in d, e, and f. The carrier density at these green lines corresponds to the half filling of supermoiré minibands. This indicates the appearance of symmetry-broken phases in mini flat bands.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) contributes to thermoregulation and glucose metabolism, but how these functions are coordinated remains unclear. While thermogenesis in the activated BAT typically coincides with increased blood flow and glucose uptake1,2,3,4,5, several pathophysiological and nutritional states dissociate these processes6,7, suggesting they are governed by distinct sympathetic circuits. Here we identify subpopulations of sympathetic neurons in the stellate ganglion that mediate distinct functions of intrascapular BAT (iBAT) in mice. Two main types of sympathetic neurons project to iBAT: those that innervate the organ parenchyma and those that innervate the large blood vessels feeding the depot8,9,10,11,12. Here we develop a toolkit to parse the functions of these neuronal subclasses through targeted chemogenetic activation of projections to iBAT, while sparing other organs, and single-cell transcriptomics coupled to retrograde tracing from iBAT to the stellate ganglion. We find that stimulation of the parenchymal projections increases blood flow and thermogenesis in iBAT, without affecting circulating glucose levels. Conversely, stimulation of the vascular projections improves glucose tolerance but does not alter blood flow or thermogenesis in iBAT. These data provide a mechanistic explanation for the dissociation between the thermogenic and glycaemic effects of BAT activation13,14,15,16. Cold-induced thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) is an energy-demanding process that relies on enhanced blood flow as well as uptake of fuels, processes that are all triggered by sympathetic nervous system (SNS) signalling17. Thus, these parameters are often considered interchangeably when assessing the physiological consequences of stimulating BAT in humans. However, glucose uptake in BAT does not require cold-induced thermogenesis in humans18 or rodents13,14,15, and the metabolically beneficial effects of glucose uptake in BAT are dependent on adrenergic signalling but are independent of cold ambient temperature16. Conversely, diabetes in humans and mouse models is associated with impaired glucose uptake in BAT19,20, while its metabolic activity is normal6. These observations raise the possibility that thermogenic and glucoregulatory functions of BAT are controlled by distinct sympathetic circuits, although the exact neuronal substrates are unknown. Cold responses in the skin are mediated through the coordinated regulation of functionally distinct populations of sympathetic neurons defined by the expression of different combinations of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides21,22. Neurons that co-express norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y (NPY) project to the vasculature and promote vasoconstriction23,24, while norepinephrine neurons with low levels of NPY promote piloerection (goosebumps)25. This neuroanatomical organization of sympathetic fibres is preserved in BAT8,9,10,11,12. Gain and loss of Npy expression in the SNS impacts both cold tolerance and glucose metabolism11,12,26,27. Since NPY is also expressed in neurons that innervate visceral organs11,28, the function of sympathetic neurons that innervate intrascapular BAT (iBAT) per se cannot be evaluated in these genetic models. Here, we developed novel mouse genetic tools and in vivo assays to parse the functions of molecularly and neuroanatomically distinct sympathetic projections to iBAT, without affecting sympathetic projections to other visceral organs or sensory projections to iBAT that also affect metabolism. Retrograde adeno-associated viruses (AAVrg) are routinely used to mark and manipulate neural projections to a target of interest within the brain29. We assessed the efficacy of retrograde labelling from iBAT to its largest source of sympathetic innervation, the stellate ganglion (SG)30,31. Despite using viral titres tenfold higher than commonly used in the brain (>1013 vg ml−1), SG labelling following intra-iBAT injections of AAVrg::CAG-GFP was much less efficient than tracing with cholera toxin subunit B (CTB; Extended Data Fig. Intersectional approaches involving direct viral injections into the nodose ganglion can effectively target sensory projections to adipose tissues32. However, this approach is not feasible in the SG owing to its physical inaccessibility. Thus, the dearth of tools to robustly modulate SG projections to peripheral organs in the thoracic cavity is a major obstacle to studying their impact on physiology. Intra-iBAT injections of the MaCPNS1 serotype, which was engineered for use in the periphery33, achieved robust labelling in the SG but also labelled sensory projections from the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) (Fig.1a,b and Extended Data Fig. Injecting a Cre-dependent MaCPNS1 virus into iBAT of Th-Cre mice robustly labelled sympathetic projections to iBAT (SGBAT) from the SG through T4, with a few neurons labelled between T5 and T7 (Extended Data Fig. Since iBAT-projecting neurons are distinct from the subpopulation of tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing neurons in the DRG (Extended Data Fig. 2), this strategy avoided labelling sensory neurons that could provide negative feedback to the SNS32 (Fig. a, A schematic illustration of retrograde labelling to sympathetic (yellow) and/or sensory (blue) ganglia with AAV injections into iBAT. b, Injections of GFP-expressing MaCPNS1 virus into iBAT of WT mice labelled neurons in the SG and DRG at C4, C6 and T1. c, Injections of Cre-dependent mCherry-expressing MaCPNS1 into iBAT of Th-Cre mice labelled neurons in the SG but not DRGs. d,e, Representative traces of thermogenesis (ΔiBAT − lower back (LB), top) and blood flow (bottom) in iBAT in a Th-Cre mouse injected with a control Cre-dependent mCherry-expressing MaCPNS1 virus (d) or with a Cre-dependent hM3D–mCherry-expressing MaCPNS1 virus (e). f,g, Change in temperature (f) and blood flow (g) in iBAT following SAL or CNO injection (n = 16 mice, tested in both conditions, P < 0.001). h, A schematic illustration of the random crossover experimental design to assess the impact of DCZ versus SAL treatment in awake Th-Cre mice that received Cre-dependent hM3D–mCherry-expressing MaCPNS1 virus in iBAT (data shown in i–m). i, The average traces of energy expenditure (EE). j,k, Changes in EE (j) and RER (k) following SAL or DCZ injection (n = 16 mice each tested in both conditions, P < 0.001). l, The effect of DCZ or SAL delivered immediately before an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) on circulating glucose levels.

In f, g, j and k, the dots represent average values and lines represent individual mice. Paired t-test, two tailed, no adjustments. We used this approach to investigate the physiological outcomes of acutely activating SGBAT neurons with Cre-dependent MaCPNS1 viruses expressing either mCherry (control) or an excitatory designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD, hM3Dq; Extended Data Fig. injections of saline (SAL) and the DREADD agonist clozapine-N-oxide (CNO, 10 mg kg−1) on thermogenesis and blood flow in iBAT in mice under constant anaesthesia. CNO injections into hM3D-expressing mice increased iBAT thermogenesis and blood flow, without effects on core body temperature, while mice injected with the control virus did not respond (Fig. Within 5 min of CNO treatment, iBAT temperature increased by ~0.8 °C and blood flow increased by ~25% (Fig. The number of neurons expressing the DREADD virus in this cohort varied from 2,283 to 3,595, but there was no correlation with changes in thermogenesis or blood flow (Extended Data Fig. Thus, when >2,000 neurons are infected, the effect is largely binary. The number of labelled SG neurons and the magnitude of responses were similar in males and females. Delivery of the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol rapidly reversed the effects of chemogenetic stimulation on thermogenesis and blood flow in both sexes, demonstrating the requirement for SNS signals (Fig. Treatment with the α-adrenergic receptor antagonist phentolamine acutely reduced blood flow by 60 ± 24.3% (mean ± s.e.m.) but did not affect thermogenesis (Extended Data Fig. While it is possible that increased blood flow contributes to elevated iBAT temperature, the two processes can be decoupled. The experiments presented here do not distinguish between UCP1-dependent and UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanisms. Next, we explored the effects of chemogenetic manipulation of SGBAT neurons on systemic metabolism in freely moving, awake mice. To minimize possible off-target effects of CNO, we switched to a higher-affinity DREADD ligand, deschloroclozapine6 (DCZ, 200 µg kg−1). Since activated BAT in humans is associated with improved glucose homeostasis16 and β3-adrenergic stimulation improves glucose tolerance34,35, we assessed the effect SAL versus DCZ injections immediately before an oral gavage of glucose (2 g kg−1 at time 0) in a random crossover design (Fig. DCZ treatment lowered blood glucose levels after 15 min in male and female mice expressing a Th-Cre-driven excitatory DREADD (Fig. 1l,m) but had no effect in wild type (WT) mice (Extended Data Fig. The glucose-lowering effect of chemogenetic stimulation was not observed in the absence of oral glucose gavage (Extended Data Fig. 6a–c), raising the possibility that SNS projections to iBAT are endogenously activated by glucose. To test this, we performed complementary intra-iBAT injections of a MaCPNS1 virus expressing a Cre-dependent inhibitory DREADD (hM4Di) in Th-Cre mice. Chemogenetic inhibition impaired glucose tolerance at 30 min after gavage in both sexes (Fig. Mice expressing the excitatory DREADD were transferred to metabolic cages where they were acclimated to i.p. SAL injections for 5 days before receiving either SAL or DCZ in a random crossover design. DCZ and CNO did not affect energy expenditure when injected into WT mice (Extended Data Fig. Increased energy expenditure following chemogenetic stimulation was not accompanied by a compensatory increase in food intake (Supplementary Fig. The average respiratory exchange ratio (RER) in the 30 min post-injection decreased with DCZ but not SAL (Fig. 1k), but some of this effect may be attributable to DCZ alone, as it also lowers RER in WT mice (Extended Data Fig. To further investigate the effects of acute chemogenetic stimulation, we performed bulk RNA-sequencing and lipidomics in iBAT in a separate cohort of female and male mice 30 min after SAL or DCZ treatment. We identified 87 (56 upregulated and 31 downregulated) differentially expressed genes with DCZ treatment after controlling for sex (Fig. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified ‘cell activation' as the top enriched term in upregulated genes (Fig. Notably, Ucp1 expression was not increased at this timepoint. Other enriched GSEA terms are consistent with effects on metabolism in iBAT. Many of the most upregulated and downregulated genes are implicated in lipid homeostasis. Together, these results indicate that acute stimulation of SNS projections to iBAT regulates thermogenesis and fuel disposal at the local (tissue) level. In addition, we observed marked sex differences in the transcriptional profile of iBAT, independent of chemogenetic stimulation (Fig. Females preferentially expressed genes related to amino acid catabolism, glycolysis and triglyceride (TG) biosynthesis (Fig. 2d), whereas males preferentially expressed genes related to lipid and glutathione catabolism (Fig. The idea that sex differences exist in the metabolic properties of iBAT was also reflected in how stimulating SGBAT neuronal impacts the lipid profiles of both plasma (Fig. 2f,g,j,k) and iBAT (Fig. Chemogenetic stimulation of SGBAT neurons reduced circulating TG species to a similar degree in females and males (43.1% and 46.4%, respectively) (compare Fig. Within iBAT of females, chemogenetic stimulation increased the abundance of TGs, although this did not reach significance (Fig. However, a number of specific lipid species such as TG 58:6-FA20:4 or TG 56:4-FA18:1 that were found significantly lower in plasma accumulate in iBAT of females, suggesting that chemogenetic stimulation mediates uptake and storage of TG species. Uncovering sex differences in the metabolism of different macronutrients that underlie these results is an important area for future research. a, A heat map of significantly differentially expressed genes between DCZ- and SAL-treated anaesthetized Th-Cre mice that received Cre-dependent hM3D–mCherry-expressing MaCPNS1 virus in iBAT, controlling for sex (F, female; M, male). b, Statistically significant GO terms from GSEA of genes from a. c, A heat map of significantly differentially expressed genes between males and females from a, controlling for treatment. d, Selected GO terms from GO-ORA of upregulated genes in males from c. e, Selected GO terms from GO-ORA of upregulated genes in females from c. f,g, A volcano plot of lipid species (f) and lipid class concentrations (g) in plasma of female mice from a. h,i, A volcano plot of lipid species (h) and lipid class concentrations (i) in iBAT of female mice from a. j,k, A volcano plot of lipid species (j) and lipid class concentrations (k) in plasma of male mice from a. l,m, A volcano plot of lipid species (l) and lipid class concentrations (m) in iBAT of male mice from a.

To explore the molecular identity of post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons innervating iBAT, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) coupled with retrograde tracing from distinct peripheral targets in the mouse SG. We focused on SG neurons innervating iBAT (SGBAT) and forelimb (SGFL), because they are both involved in thermoregulation and the projections share a similar anatomical trajectory via the dorsal rami. We performed simultaneous retrograde tracing from iBAT and forelimb by injecting CTB conjugated to Alexa555 (CTB–A555) into iBAT and CTB–A488 into the forelimbs. Three days later, we generated z-stacked images of intact cleared ganglia. SGBAT and SGFL neurons were intermingled in the lateral SG but were not overlapping (Fig. a, Retrograde labelling of SG neurons that project to iBAT (red) and forelimb (green) with cholera toxin B. b, A heat map of the expression of cluster-enriched genes in cells sorted by cluster. c, Violin plots showing the expression of sympathetic and cluster-specific marker genes. d, Validation of cluster marker genes in the SG using smFISH in n = 4 mice.

Scale bar, 100 µm Panel l created with BioRender.com. Next, we performed scRNA-seq in conjunction with CTB retrograde tracing from iBAT and forelimb (Extended Data Fig. We collected a total of 1,039 single cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (433 SGBAT (A555+) and 220 SGFL (A488+) and 375 non-labelled neurons) from three independent sorts of n = 12 SG in 8-week-old mice. The A555+ and A488+ cells were distinct, confirming that SGBAT and SGFL neurons do not overlap (Extended Data Fig. Based on an unsupervised analysis of single-cell transcriptomic signatures, we divided SG neurons into four clusters, SG1 to SG4 (SG1–4; Fig. Projecting the CTB labelling onto the unsupervised clustering revealed that each cluster contains neurons projecting to iBAT (A555+, red), forelimb (A488+, green) and other organs such as the heart (grey) (Fig. However, >85% of SNS inputs to iBAT derived from the SG1 and SG2 subtypes, with most of the remaining innervation coming from SG3 (Fig. Neurons in all clusters expressed Th, Dbh and Slc18a2/Vmat2, consistent with a sympathetic neuronal identity39, but expression was highest in SG1 and SG2 neurons (Fig. Similarly, Npy was expressed in all clusters, but SG1 neurons expressed it at levels that were 7–50-fold higher than the other clusters (Fig. While NPY immunoreactivity has been used to mark SG1 neurons (Fig. 3d), its low expression levels in SG2–4 disqualifies its use as the basis for a Cre driver. This was unexpected as VMAT1 expression is thought to be restricted to neuroendocrine cells in the adrenal gland and gut. SG4 neurons expressed the cholinergic markers Chat and Slc18a3/VAChT (Fig. We confirmed the specificity of the expression patterns of the marker genes identified in the bioinformatic analyses by multiplex single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) on SG tissue sections (Fig. We confirmed that the SG1 markers Fst, Sctr and Rfxp1 were co-expressed with Npy, but not with Slc18a1 (SG2), Colq (G2–4) or Aqp1 (SG3). Nearly all Slc18a1+ neurons (SG2) expressed Colq (SG2–4), but little to no Aqp1 (SG3). The transcriptional profiles within each cluster were shared by SGBAT, SGFL and unlabelled neurons. The most notable difference was in the cholinergic sudomotor neurons (SG4), which preferentially projected to forelimb, consistent with the paws serving as the major site of sweat release in rodents. Next, we explored why the unique markers of SG subpopulations identified here were not revealed by earlier analyses. A major difference between the approaches is our exclusive focus on the SG, while earlier studies pooled sympathetic ganglia from SG through T13 (refs. We evaluated the expression of the markers for SG1–3 in ganglia at more rostral (superior cervical ganglion; SCG) and caudal (celiac ganglion) positions in the chain. We performed multiplex smFISH in Npy-GFP reporter mice to map the expression of SG markers genes relative to vasoconstrictor neurons in the SCG previously reported by Lundberg et al. and Pernow et al.23,24. These Npy-GFPHI neurons co-expressed the SG1 markers Rxfp1, Fst and Sctr, and not markers for SG2–4 neurons such as Cckar, Colq or Aqp1 (Extended Data Fig. Based on these results, we conclude that the gene expression pattern in the SCG parallels our observations in the SG. Gene expression in celiac ganglion, which innervates the gastrointestinal tract and liver, diverged substantially from the pattern observed ganglia of the rostral sympathetic chain (SCG and SG). Npy-GFPHI neurons co-expressed the SG1 marker Rfxp1, but not the other SG1 markers such as Fst and Sctr (Extended Data Fig. In addition, the SG2–3 markers Cckar, Colq and Aqp1 were preferentially expressed in Npy-GFPHI neurons in the celiac ganglion (Extended Data Fig. 8b), consistent with prior reports that Npy is broadly expressed by sympathetic neurons in the celiac ganglion11. The only SG markers that maintained the same pattern of relative expression in Npy-GFPHI neurons in the SCG, SG and celiac ganglion were Rfxp1 (SG1) and Slc18a1 (SG2). The differences in the combinations of genes expressed by subpopulations of neurons in the rostral and caudal sympathetic chain explain why pooled sympathetic ganglia analyses across the entire chain did not identify subpopulation-specific markers. We crossed Rxfp1-Cre, Vmat1-Cre and Th-Cre lines to the tdTomato reporter strain (Ai9) and validated the expression of the Tomato lineage trace in the SG by performing smFISH with Rxfp1 and Tomato probes and by visualizing the pattern of fibre projections in the intact iBAT depot. The Rxfp1-Cre lineage trace exhibited the expected pattern: reporter expression confined to Rxfp1 neurons in the SG but absent in Colq-expressing neurons (SG2–4)(Extended Data Fig. We optimized the Fast 3D Clear system42 to visualize axonal projections in iBAT from Th-Cre::tdTOM and Rxfp1-Cre::tdTOM mice that were retroorbitally injected with isolectin (IL)–A647 to mark the vasculature. Pan-sympathetic fibres labelled with the Th-Cre lineage trace were detected around large blood vessels and in the parenchyma (Fig. Fibres labelled with the Rxfp1-Cre lineage trace were confined to blood vessels with a diameter of ~10–11 µm (Fig. 3i, Supplementary Videos 4–6 and Extended Data Fig. 10a), consistent with reports that NPY+ fibres exclusively project to arterioles in iBAT12. To quantify this relationship, we calculated the average distance between each 647-nm-positive pixel (blood vessels) and its nearest 550-nm-positive pixel (nerves) and compared the proportional distribution of nerve vessel distances. Rxfp1-Cre::tdTOM fibres had a higher proportion of contacts in close proximity to blood vessels (0.41–2 µm) than the pan-sympathetic Th-Cre::tdTOM fibres, which were the predominant fibres found at greater distances (>5 µm) from vessels (Extended Data Fig. This further supports our observation that Rxfp1-Cre::tdTOM projections are preferentially associated with blood vessels. It should be noted that Rxfp1-Cre::tdTOM fibres are a subset of the Th-Cre::tdTOM fibres. When Vmat1-Cre mice were crossed to the Ai9 reporter strain, Tomato was detected in all iBAT-projecting neurons in the SG, including those that expressed Rxfp1 (Extended Data Fig. 9d–f) owing to transient Vmat1 expression in the embryonic peripheral nervous system43,44. To overcome this limitation, we injected Cre-dependent mCherry retrograde viruses into iBAT of Rxfp1-Cre or Vmat1-Cre strains in adult mice and assessed reporter expression in conjunction with NPY immunostaining in the SG and in the DRG. In Rxfp1-Cre mice, most of the neurons expressing the viral mCherry reporter co-expressed NPY (Fig. NPY+ neurons that did not express mCherry presumably represent SG1 neurons that project to other targets, such as the forelimbs. By contrast, in Vmat1-Cre mice, little overlap between the mCherry reporter and NPY was detected (Fig. To further confirm that Rxfp1- and Vmat1-based driver lines target distinct subpopulations in the adult SG, we generated an Rxfp1-Flp driver line and crossed it to Flp-dependent Tomato reporter and Vmat1-Cre lines. The resulting Rxfp1-Flp::FSF-Tomato;Vmat1-Cre mice were injected with a Cre-dependent EGFP-expressing AAVrg in iBAT (Fig. Notably, most tdTomato+ SG neurons co-expressed NPY, while EGFP+ SG2 neurons did not express NPY or tdTomato (Fig. 3l), demonstrating the existence of two molecularly distinct neuronal populations in the SG projecting to iBAT. 3g), it is likely that the parenchyma-projecting fibres observed in Th-Cre::tdTOM mice originate from Vmat1+ neurons. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Vmat1+ neurons also project to blood vessels. We compared the functional consequences of acute selective stimulation of either Rxfp1+ (vasomotor) or Vmat1+ (parenchymal) SGBAT neurons using the chemogenetic tools and paradigms described above (Fig. Of note, the specific stimulation of SG2/Vmat1+ neurons innervating brown adipocytes in the parenchyma induced thermogenesis (Fig. 4b,c), while activation of SG1/Rxfp1+ neurons projecting exclusively to the blood vessels did not (Fig. Contrary to the dogma that NPY+ neurons are vasoregulators8,23,24, blood flow was only increased by stimulating parenchymal SG2 projections (Fig. Increases in iBAT thermogenesis and blood flow by stimulating parenchymal SG2 projections to iBAT (Fig. 4c,d) were comparable to those achieved by stimulating all iBAT-projecting neurons in Th-Cre mice (Fig. a–d, The effects of chemogenetic activation of parenchyma-projecting SG2 neurons in anaesthetized mice: the experimental strategy to record from Vmat1-Cre mice injected with Cre-dependent hM3D–mCherry-expressing MaCPNS1 virus in iBAT (a); average traces of thermogenesis (ΔiBAT − LB, top) and blood flow (bottom) in iBAT recorded from mice injected with SAL and CNO (n = 14 mice) (b); and changes in temperature (c) and in blood flow (d) in iBAT following SAL or CNO treatment in mice shown in b.

In b, f, j and n, the lines represent the means and shaded areas represent ± s.e.m. In c, d, g, h, k, l, o and p, dots represent average values and lines represent individual mice. Next, we examined the impact of stimulating each subpopulation on systemic metabolism in awake animals (Fig. Consistent with observations in anaesthetized mice, activation of parenchyma-projecting SG2/Vmat1+ neurons resulted in higher average energy expenditure across the study in both sexes (Fig. 4j,k), whereas stimulation of vasomotor SG1/Rxfp1+ neurons did not (Fig. RER was decreased in both Cre lines (Fig. was similar to pan-sympathetic stimulation in Th-Cre mice (−0.045 ± 0.007; Fig. 1k), and the RER response to SG1/Rxfp1+ stimulation (−0.022 ± 0.006) was comparable to that in WT mice (−0.028 ± 0.007; Extended Data Fig. However, we cannot definitively parse the circuits regulating fat oxidation. In the context of an oral glucose challenge, chemogenetic activation of vasomotor SG1/Rxfp1+ projections to iBAT produced a marked reduction in blood glucose levels at 15 min (Fig. 4s,t), but stimulation without glucose gavage had no effect on baseline glucose levels (Extended Data Fig. Chemogenetic inhibition resulted in increased circulating glucose at 30 and 45 min (Fig. 4u–w), fully recapitulating the effects observed when all iBAT-projecting sympathetic neurons were activated or inhibited in Th-Cre mice (Fig. Notably, stimulating parenchyma-projecting SG2/Vmat1+ neurons had no effect on glycaemia (Fig. 4q,r and Extended Data Fig. In summary, we demonstrated that thermogenesis and blood flow in iBAT are regulated by parenchyma-projecting SG2/Vmat1+ neurons, while systemic glucose is modulated by vasomotor SG1/Rxfp1+ neurons. By combining retrograde injections with Cre-dependent viral constructs, we targeted manipulations to subpopulations of BAT-projecting sympathetic neurons without confounding effects on the brain, sensory nervous system or other peripheral organs. Acute stimulation of SG2 projections to the iBAT parenchyma is sufficient to increase blood flow and heat production in iBAT and to promote fat utilization, whereas effects on total energy expenditure are modest and variable, consistent with observations in humans45. Our findings do not exclude the possibility that sympathetic stimulation of white adipose tissue lipolysis is needed to fully support energy combustion by iBAT20,46. NPY co-transmission in the SNS has been implicated in regulating a wide range of physiological functions. In contrast to the dogma that NPYergic sympathetic projections are vasoconstrictors23,24, chemogenetic activation of SG1 projections did not affect blood flow or thermogenesis in iBAT. Since SG1 neurons in the SCG and SG are molecularly distinct from NPYergic neurons in the celiac ganglion, exploring whether other NPYergic neurons in the rostral sympathetic chain share projection targets and functionality is an important area for future research. Another important question raised by our results is whether activation of SG1 and SG2 neurons is sensed by molecularly and functionally distinct populations of DRG neurons that innervate iBAT, as shown for cutaneous-projecting DRG neurons47. For example, it is possible that subpopulations of thermosensors provide negative feedback to prevent overheating in response to activation of SG2 neurons, but not SG1 neurons. Our data support the idea that effects of SNS-derived NPY on total energy expenditure, cold tolerance and adiposity11,12 reflect direct actions in other tissues and/or chronic adaptations in the context of a congenital knockout driven by a Th-Cre reporter. Since this driver line is also expressed in the brain and DRG, it is possible that central and sensory circuits contribute to these effects. On the other hand, some of the effects of SNS-derived NPY on glucose tolerance that were attributed to actions in the pancreas, liver and white adipose tissue could stem from signalling in iBAT11. Consistent with this idea, glucose uptake in BAT is associated with lower glycaemia and risk of diabetes in humans, independent of external temperature16. As chemogenetic modulation of SG1/Rxfp1+ neurons alters glycaemia in the context of a glucose load but not at baseline, it is possible that crosstalk with other metabolic organs is involved. The ability to target SG1 projections to iBAT without affecting thermogenesis may be particularly beneficial in the context of diabetes, which is associated with impaired glucose uptake but normal thermogenesis in BAT6,48. In the long term, uncovering SNS targets that mediate the metabolically beneficial effects on glycaemia without activating thermogenic programmes that are subject to robust negative feedback could lead to novel approaches to treat metabolic diseases. All procedures were performed within the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Columbia University Health Science Division. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to use the minimum number of animals required for statistical validity. Mice were housed at 22 ± 1 °C on a 12 h light:12 h dark cycle in the Russ Berrie Medical Sciences Pavilion barrier facility with ad libitum access to chow (13.2% calories from fat; 5053, PicoLab Rodent Diet 20) and autoclaved water. C57BL/6J (000664), Ai949 (007909), Flp-dependent Tomato50 (032864) and NPY-GFP51 (006417) strains were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories, Th-Cre (B6.129×1-Tht1(cre)Te/Kieg) from the European Mouse Mutant Archives (RRID: IMSR_EM:00254) and Rxfp1-Cre (B6.Cg-Rxfp1tm1(cre)Zel), Rxfp1-Flp (B6.Cg-Rxfp1tm1(cre)Zel) and Vmat1-Cre (B6.Cg-Slc18a1tm1(cre)Zel) strains were generated by CRISPR-mediated T2A-nlsCre insertion at the Genetically Modified Mouse Model Shared Resource at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Consistent with findings from other groups31, the Jackson Th-Cre line (008601) drove minimal Ai9 recombination. Mice receiving viral injections were single housed post-surgery. Under isoflurane anaesthesia, the upper back was shaved and sterilized with alternating betadine and 70% isopropyl alcohol. Buprenorphine (0.1 mg kg−1) was given for analgesia. Mice were placed on a heating pad under a sterile drape and a 1 cm incision was made over the interscapular region. The upper white adipose layer was dissected to expose iBAT, and CTB–Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher, C22843; 1 μl of 1% in SAL) was injected at two sites per depot using a glass-pulled needle and mouth pipette. CTB–Alexa Fluor 488 (C22841) was similarly injected at three sites per forelimb. Wounds were cleaned and mice monitored for distress. After 72 h, stellate ganglia were collected following euthanasia with Avertin (500 mg kg−1; Fisher, AC421430100), dissociated for analysis or post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1 h, washed and mounted in LIMPID52. Mice were anaesthetized and prepared as described above. A horizontal incision was made ~2 cm below the iBAT to avoid scar interference with Doppler imaging. Virus was injected at three to five evenly spaced sites per depot using a 25 µl Neuros syringe (Hamilton, 65460-11). Each mouse received a total dose of 1.3 × 10¹² gc, with the injection volume (20–50 µl) adjusted to viral titre (Supplementary Tables). At the end of the study, SGs and DRGs were collected, post-fixed in 4% PFA for 1 h, washed and mounted in LIMPID. SGs and DRGs were incubated overnight at room temperature in the dark and imaged on a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (20×, tiled z stacks, 5 µm steps). Fluorescent reporter-expressing neurons were quantified using Stereo Investigator Cleared Tissue Edition software (MBF Bioscience). Mice were anaesthetized with Avertin (350 mg kg−1, i.p.) Animals were maintained at 35 °C on a heating pad with rectal temperature feedback (Harvard Apparatus, 75-1500). A perfusion needle connected to a syringe pump (Medfusion 3500, ICUMedical) delivered Avertin continuously (190 mg kg−1 h−1) via the lateral vein to maintain anaesthesia. A small incision was made over the previous surgical site to expose iBAT and the fat pad was cut caudally to insert an implantable thermal probe (IT-21, Physitemp). A second probe was placed subcutaneously on the lower back and a third measured ambient temperature. Probes were connected to a thermometer (TC-2000, Sable Systems), and signals digitized via LabJack U3-LV for acquisition on a laptop. Blood flow over the interscapular region was recorded using a high-resolution laser Doppler imager (MOORLDI2-HIR, Moor Instruments). Baseline measurements were acquired for 10 min, followed by i.p. Norepinephrine (0.5 mg kg−1) served as a positive control. All injections were volume-matched to 5 µl g−1. After recordings, mice were euthanized by anaesthetic overdose and ganglia were collected as described above. Doppler data were processed with Moor LDI Review v6.0. The interscapular region was defined as the area showing maximal norepinephrine-induced activity, and this region of interest was applied to all frames to extract mean perfusion values. Thermal data were analysed in R using a custom script. For each injection, we computed the stepwise temperature difference between iBAT and lower back probes. Baseline (2 min pre-injection) and treated (5–10 min post-injection) averages were calculated and the difference (treated − baseline) was used for SAL, CNO and adrenergic blocker conditions. The same procedure was applied to relative blood flow values. Mice were transferred to clean cages without food for 4 h before testing. Baseline blood glucose was measured from tail vein pricks (Contour Next EZ, Ascensia). Mice then received an oral gavage of d-(+)-glucose (2 mg kg−1; Sigma, G8769, 1:2 in ddH2O, 20 µm filtered) and an i.p. injection of either DCZ (200 ng g−1) or SAL. Blood glucose was recorded at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after gavage. Each mouse received DCZ and SAL in a balanced crossover design, with a 7-day washout between sessions. Mice were single housed in a Promethion Core Metabolic System (Sable Systems) for 1 week under controlled ambient temperature (22 ± 1 °C), a 12 h light:12 h dark cycle and with ad libitum access to food and water from the same barrier facility. Mice were acclimated to the metabolic cages and daily i.p. SAL injections at 16:00 for 3 days. On days 4 and 5, mice received two i.p. SAL injections per day (10:00 and 16:00). During the final 2 days, mice received two daily injections of either DCZ (200 ng g−1) or SAL in a balanced crossover design. Specifically, on day 6, half of the mice received DCZ and half received SAL (10:00 and 16:00), and treatment groups were reversed on day 7. All injections were volume-matched to 5 µl g−1 body weight. Mice were returned to their home cages after each recording session. Energy expenditure (heat) and RER (CO2 produced/O2 consumed) were quantified. For experiments comparing DCZ and CNO in WT mice, animals were acclimated for 2 days with a single daily i.p. Over the next 3 days, mice received two daily injections of either SAL, DCZ or CNO in a randomized and counterbalanced order to minimize carryover effects. Statistical analyses were performed by comparing average values before and after injections for each mouse and parameter. For each parameter, the mean value during the hour following injection (excluding the first 9 min to account for gas equilibration and stress-induced hyperthermia) was calculated and the equivalent pre-injection mean was subtracted. Differences between groups were analysed using paired t-tests. Three weeks after intra-iBAT viral injections of Th-Cre+/− mice (six males and six females) with MaCPNS1:CAG-DIO-hM3D-mCherry as described above, mice were anaesthetized with Avertin (350 mg kg−1, i.p.) and injected intraperitoneally with either DCZ (200 ng g−1, i.p.) Mice were maintained on a heating pad at 35 °C for 30 min before euthanasia via thoracotomy. Transcardial perfusion with 5 ml of cold PBS (4 °C) was performed to remove residual blood, after which iBAT and SG were collected. Each iBAT was bisected along the midline, weighed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. One lobe per mouse was used for RNA extraction. SG were post-fixed and washed as previously described, mounted in LIMPID mounting medium and imaged to confirm viral expression. Total RNA was extracted from iBAT using the Tri-Isolate RNA Pure Kit (IBI Scientific, IB47631) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA integrity was assessed using RIN analysis, and sequencing was performed by the Genome Center Core at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. mRNA was enriched using poly(A) selection and sequencing libraries were prepared with Illumina TruSeq chemistry. The final PCR step was modified using the KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready Mix. Libraries were sequenced on an Element AVITI platform to generate paired-end 75 bp reads. Raw BCL files were converted to FASTQ format and adaptor-trimmed using bases2fastq (v1.4.0.833301531). Reads were pseudoaligned to a kallisto index generated from the Ensembl v96 mouse transcriptome (GRCm38.p6) using kallisto (v0.44.0).Gene count matrices were analysed using R53 with DESeq54, while GSEA and Gene Ontology (GO) over-representation analysis (ORA) were done with clusterProfiler55. Shotgun lipidomic analysis of murine plasma and BAT samples was performed as previously described56. Briefly, 25 µl of plasma or 3–5 mg of BAT samples were spiked with internal standards and mixed with MTBE/methanol/water 10:3:2.5 (v/v/v) as described57. Following homogenization, samples were centrifuged (4 °C, 10,000g, 10 min) and the lipid-containing upper phase was transferred into a new vial. Lipid extracts were concentrated by vacuum centrifugation and reconstituted in a mixture of dichloromethane (50): methanol (50)-containing 10 mM ammonium acetate. Direct infusion of lipid extracts into the mass spectrometer was conducted by an ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography system (Nexera X2, Shimadzu) using dichloromethane (50): methanol (50)-containing 10 mM ammonium acetate as eluent at a flowrate of 0.008 ml min−1. The separation and targeted profiling of lipid species was performed combining differential mobility spectrometry and a QTRAP system (QTRAP 5500, SCIEX) run in multiple reaction monitoring mode operated via Analyst (v1.6.8, SCIEX). The mass spectrometry-generated raw data were converted to mzML format using MSconvertGUI (v3.0.21245-5724be1). Data processing and lipid quantification were performed using the Shotgun Lipidomic Assistant software, a Python-based application according to ref. SG were dissociated following modified published protocols58,59. SGs were collected bilaterally from two 6–8-week-old C57BL/6J males (four SG per batch) in ice-chilled Eagle's balanced salt solution equilibrated to 95% O2/5% CO2 for 1 h. After removing fat and connective tissue, SGs were minced into three to four pieces and transferred to low-bind tubes containing 1.67 ml pre-heated (37 °C) digestion solution for 1.5 h with agitation. Following digestion, half of the suspension was transferred to a new tube, mixed with digestion-stop solution, inverted and centrifuged (300g, 4 °C, 5 min). Pellets were resuspended in 500 µl digestion-stop solution, combined and triturated with BSA-coated fire-polished pipettes of decreasing diameter (400 µm to 150 µm). The cell suspension was washed twice with 1 ml medium, centrifuged (300g, 5 min) and resuspended in 200 µl medium. Cells were filtered through a 40 µm strainer, stained with Sytox Blue (1:1,000) and kept on ice before FACS. A detailed description of this protocol can be found on protocols.io (https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.14egn79e6v5d/v1). Single cells were sorted into three to four 96-well plates using a FACSAria sorter equipped with a 130-µm nozzle (12 PSI). Approximately two-thirds of wells were filled with CTB–A555 or CTB–A488-positive neurons, and the remaining third with non-labelled neurons. Plates were centrifuged (200g, 2 min) and snap-frozen on dry ice. Three sorting sessions yielded a total of 1,039 cells across 11 plates from 6 mice. ScRNA-seq was conducted by the Single Cell Analysis Core at Columbia University Irving Medical Center as previously described60. Briefly, libraries were prepared using template-switching reverse transcription with adaptor-linked oligo(dT) primers containing cell- and molecule-specific barcodes. cDNA from each plate was pooled for PCR amplification and library construction, and 3′-end libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500/550. Reads were aligned to the mouse genome (GRCm38, Gencode M13, Ensembl 88) using STAR v2.5.3a61 and assigned to genes with featureCounts v1.5.362. BAM files were sorted, duplicates removed and unique molecular identifier (UMI) count matrices generated with UMI-tools63, yielding 1,039 cells. Downstream analysis was performed in Seurat v364. Quality control excluded cells with <1,000 genes, >10% mitochondrial content or no CTB dye assignment, retaining 879 cells. Expression matrices were log-normalized and scaled while regressing out batch, nUMI and mitochondrial fraction. Highly variable genes were identified, and dimensionality reduction was performed by principal component analysis. JackStraw identified 42 significant principal components, of which 30 were retained for clustering. Cells were clustered using Seurat's FindClusters function on a KNN graph, refined by Jaccard distance and modularity optimization. Cluster markers were identified using FindMarkers (Wilcoxon rank-sum test). To prevent glial gene interference, 136 genes expressed by satellite glial cells65 were removed from the highly variable set (3,555 genes retained). Cluster markers were defined as genes enriched in ≥40% of cells within each cluster. Expression was visualized via heat maps and violin plots. Vertebral columns were post-fixed overnight, washed in PBS and SGs and DRGs were extracted, embedded in OCT, frozen at −80 °C and sectioned at 10 µm. Thawed sections were washed in PBST (0.1% Triton X-100) and circled with a hydrophobic pen. Slides were blocked in PBST + 5% normal donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (anti-NPY, anti-RFP, anti-GFP and anti-TH, 1:1,000 each). After washing, sections were incubated 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (1:500), washed and mounted with ProLong Glass Antifade. SGs were imaged on a Zeiss Axio Observer 7 (20×, tiled), DRGs on a Keyence BZ-8000 (20×, tiled). Neurons were manually counted in ImageJ70, using negative controls for background subtraction. DRGs counts were imaged with a Keyence BZ-8000 fluorescent microscope at 20× as a tiled image. Neurons were manually counted using ImageJ67. Negative control slides (incubated without primary antibodies) were used for background subtraction. SGs from WT mice and SCG/celiac ganglion from Npy-GFP mice were post-fixed in 4% PFA for 1 h, embedded in OCT, frozen at −80 °C, sectioned at 10 µm and mounted on slides. Multiplex smFISH was performed using the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit following fixed-frozen tissue protocols. To preserve GFP fluorescence, a mild antigen retrieval was used (boiled buffer, 5 min at room temperature). After smFISH, sections were immunostained for GFP (Bio-Rad, 4745-1051, 1:250; Invitrogen, A-11015, 1:500) and imaged on a Zeiss LSM confocal microscope (40× and 63×). Whole iBAT clearing was performed using a modified Fast 3D Clear protocol42. Mice were perfused with cold PBS followed by 4% PFA, and iBAT was post-fixed overnight at 4 °C. Samples were dehydrated in 50%, 70% and 90% tetrahydrofuran (Sigma, 186562) with pH adjusted to 9–9.5 using triethylamine, then rehydrated in reverse order. Clearing solution was prepared with 48 g Histodenz (Millipore-Sigma, D2158), 0.6 g of diatrizoic acid (Millipore-Sigma, D9268), 1 g of N-methyl-d-glucamine (Millipore-Sigma, M2004) and 10 g of ultrapure urea (Millipore-Sigma, 15505) in 13 ml water, incubated overnight at 37 °C. Samples were incubated in clearing solution overnight at 37 °C and imaged in the same medium on a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (20×). Whole-tissue iBAT images were acquired as described above using a 2-µm z step. Each stack was divided into consecutive 20-µm substacks (10 images each) and converted into maximum intensity projections. Images were processed in ImageJ with custom Python scripts. For each channel (nerves and blood vessels), projections were converted to 8-bit greyscale, brightness/contrast were manually adjusted and binary masks were generated by manual thresholding. A custom script calculated the Euclidean distance from each nerve pixel to the nearest vessel pixel, capped at 100 pixels, and converted to micrometres using microscope calibration (2.4089 pixels per µm). Distance distributions between genotypes were compared using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test in R53. Whole-tissue images of iBAT were acquired as described above, using a 2-µm z step. Each image stack was visually inspected and split into two or more substacks to avoid overlapping between innervated blood vessels, then converted into maximum intensity projections. Blood vessels innervated by tdTomato-positive fibres were manually annotated in ImageJ and traced along their long axis. For each vessel, the diameter was measured manually at five evenly spaced points along the long axis. The average of these measurements was taken as the vessel diameter and converted from pixels to micrometres using the microscope calibration (2.4089 pixels per µm). Trunk samples were immunostained and cleared using a modified combination of PEGASOS68 and iDISCO69 protocols. Mice were transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS (Thermo Fisher, 10010023) followed by 4% PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 15710). Thoracic and lumbar vertebral columns were post-fixed overnight at 4 °C, washed in PBS and decalcified in 20% EDTA (Millipore-Sigma, E5134) for 4 days at 37 °C with daily solution changes. Samples were washed, incubated in 25% Quadrol (Sigma-Aldrich, 122262) for 48 h, washed again, treated with 3% ammonia (Sigma-Aldrich, 338818) for 6 h and washed overnight at 37 °C. Tissues were delipidated and dehydrated through graded tert-butanol (tB, 30%, 50% and 70%; Sigma-Aldrich, 360538 with 3% quadrol; Sigma-Aldrich 122262) at 37 °C, rehydrated in reverse order and permeabilized and blocked for 48 h each as in iDISCO. Samples were incubated with rabbit anti-RFP (Rockland, 600-401-379, 1:10,000) for 6 days at 37 °C, washed for 24 h and then incubated with donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen, A10042, 1:1,000) for 5 days at 37 °C, followed by a 24-h PBS wash. Samples were embedded in 1% agarose (Invitrogen, 16500500), dehydrated again in graded tert-butanol, incubated in tB-protected polyethylene glycol (tB-PEG, 75% tB + 22% PEG + 3% quadrol) for 48 h and cleared in benzyl benzoate PEG (BB-PEG, 75% tB + 22% PEG + 3% quadrol) for 48 h at 37 °C following the PEGASOS protocol. Imaging was performed with an Ultramicroscope II light-sheet microscope (Miltenyi Biotec) at 4× in BB-PEG clearing solution. All statistical analysis were performed in R53 and Graphpad Prism v10.2.0 with the indicated statistical tests. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications32,70, and sample sizes for each experiment are reported in the figure legends. For metabolic data, the sample size was determined based on cage availability. For experiments involving viruses, the sample size was determined based on virus availability. No data were excluded, except mice with deteriorating health issues after surgery or during the experiment and mice with missed viral targeting assessed by histology. All in vivo experiments were performed at least twice or grouped from two independent cohorts with the same conclusion. Experiments were randomized across experimental days and daily blocks were chosen balancing sex and experimental conditions. The Investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. For representative images, the numbers of experimental repetitions were as follows: Fig. 3a: over ten animals across six independent experiments; Fig. 3h,i: over six animals per genotype across four independent experiments; Fig. 3j–l: three animals per experiment; Extended Data Fig. 1a–h: over six animals per experiment, with the exception of Extended Data Fig. 1e, which was two animals per experiment; Extended Data Fig. 9b,c,e,f: over three animals per experiment.

(2026)Cite this article Quantum circuits with local unitaries offer a platform to explore many-body quantum dynamics in discrete time. Their locality makes them suitable for current processors, but verification at scale is difficult for non-integrable systems. Here we study dual-unitary circuits, which are maximally chaotic yet permit exact analytical solutions for certain correlation functions. Using improved noise-learning and error-mitigation methods, we show that a superconducting quantum processor with 91 qubits is able to accurately simulate these correlators. We then perturb the circuits away from the dual-unitary point and benchmark the dynamics against tensor-network simulations. These results establish error-mitigated digital quantum simulation on pre-fault-tolerant processors as a reliable tool to explore emergent quantum many-body phases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the first time, researchers at the University of British Columbia have shown how to consistently produce a crucial type of human immune cell, known as helper T cells, from stem cells in a controlled lab setting. By solving this problem, the work could help make off-the-shelf treatments more accessible and effective for conditions such as cancer, infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, and more. "This study addresses one of the biggest challenges in making these lifesaving treatments accessible to more people, showing for the first time a reliable and scalable way to grow multiple immune cell types." Over the past several years, engineered cell therapies such as CAR-T treatments have produced dramatic, sometimes lifesaving results for people with cancers that were once considered untreatable. Even with their success, cell therapies remain costly, complex to manufacture, and out of reach for many patients around the world. One key reason is that most existing treatments rely on a patient's own immune cells, which must be collected and specially prepared over several weeks for each individual. "The long-term goal is to have off-the-shelf cell therapies that are manufactured ahead of time and on a larger scale from a renewable source like stem cells," said co-senior author Dr. Megan Levings, a professor of surgery and biomedical engineering at UBC. "This would make treatments much more cost-effective and ready when patients need them." Cancer cell therapies are most effective when two types of immune cells work together. "Helper T cells are essential for a strong and lasting immune response," said Dr. Levings. "It's critical that we have both to maximize the efficacy and flexibility of off-the-shelf therapies." The scientists found that a developmental signal known as Notch plays an important but time-sensitive role in immune cell formation. "By precisely tuning when and how much this signal is reduced, we were able to direct stem cells to become either helper or killer T cells," said co-first author Dr. Ross Jones, a research associate in the Zandstra Lab. "We were able to do this in controlled laboratory conditions that are directly applicable in real-world biomanufacturing, which is an essential step toward turning this discovery into a viable therapy." The cells showed signs of full maturity, carried a wide variety of immune receptors, and were able to develop into specialized subtypes with distinct immune roles. Researchers say the ability to generate both helper and killer T cells, and to carefully control their balance, could greatly improve the effectiveness of stem cell-derived immune therapies. "This is a major step forward in our ability to develop scalable and affordable immune cell therapies," said Dr. Zandstra.

Over the next several days, engineers and technicians will focus on readying Artemis II for a wet dress rehearsal. This test simulates key launch-day activities, including fueling the rocket and running through countdown procedures. These steps are essential preparations ahead of NASA's first crewed Artemis mission. NASA may conduct more than one wet dress rehearsal to ensure the rocket and spacecraft are fully prepared for flight. The Artemis II test flight will carry NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Christina Koch, along with CSA (Canadian Space Agency) astronaut Jeremy Hansen.
