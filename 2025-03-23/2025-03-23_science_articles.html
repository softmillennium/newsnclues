                <p>Canadians are heading once again to the polls on April 28 to vote in a federal election.

This election will offer voters competing visions of Canada’s future at a time when it has become all but impossible to separate foreign policy from domestic politics.

There’s no question much of the conversation during the campaign will centre on how the next government will deal with United States President Donald Trump amid his continuing threats to Canadian sovereignty.

Most political scientists have traditionally argued that foreign policy does not matter to Canadians at the voting booth.


Foreign policy as an issue

My new report, “Foreign Policy and Canadian Elections: A Review,” finds truth on both sides.

Foreign policy is what people who study elections call an “issue,” just like the economy, national security or health care.

Issues compete with many other considerations — like ideology, perceptions of leadership and the need for change — to determine a voter’s ultimate decision.


Handling the Trump threat

There are no real divisions between the election’s front-runners — Liberal Mark Carney and Conservative Pierre Poilievre — over how to deal with Trump.

Both have pledged that Canada will never become the 51st state and have promised to strike back at American tariffs with economic measures of their own.


What’s ahead this election campaign

Over the next five weeks, Canadians should expect to learn about the leading political parties’ views on relations with the U.S., the situations in the Middle East and Ukraine, foreign interference in the affairs of state and Canada’s global defence.

Voters can and should demand that those who wish to lead the country are thoughtful and literate on these and other international issues.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney has called an April 28 federal election, setting the stage for a campaign where climate policy could be a central issue.

The current iteration of Canada’s consumer carbon rebate is dead — which many view as a casualty of effective communication — yet climate policy remains a pressing topic for voters and a major battleground for political leaders.

As Canada grapples with intensifying climate-related challenges, the next government will not only need to implement evidence-based policies to meet international climate commitments, but also effectively communicate its vision to voters.

The public remains concerned about environmental issues, yet many are worried that bold climate policies have damaged the economy. This tension between environmental responsibility and economic growth will shape how each party formulates and communicates their climate policies in the upcoming campaign.

For Carney and the Liberal Party, the challenge is twofold. First, the Liberals must present a new climate plan after the collapse of the consumer carbon rebate, which has faced widespread public opposition in recent years.

Carney’s website states that his strategy will: “Provide incentives for consumers. Put more of the burden on big polluters. And help us build the strongest economy in the G7.” This suggests his climate policy will hinge more on positive incentives for consumers to invest in sustainable approaches rather than putting a cost on polluting.

Climate change is no longer just an environmental issue; it’s increasingly seen as a matter of economic survival, with green energy jobs and clean technologies representing an opportunity for Canada to position itself as a global leader in the sector.

Carney will have to make a convincing case that his policy will create jobs, stimulate innovation and provide a clear path toward a greener, more sustainable economy.

Failing to do so could lead to the loss of centrist and moderate voters, some of whom are wary of the perceived economic risks of aggressive climate action.

On the opposite end of the political spectrum, federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has made axing the carbon rebate a central part of his platform.

Poilievre has framed the carbon rebate as an economic penalty, promising to “axe the tax” and relieve financial pressures on Canadian families and businesses.

However, even if the Conservatives are successful in eliminating the carbon rebate, they still face the challenge of needing a comprehensive climate policy that lowers emissions and meets Canada’s Paris Agreement targets.

Poilievre has said he would not withdraw Canada from the accord, but he hasn’t addressed how he would meet Canada’s commitments.

Poilievre’s populist rhetoric may resonate with voters who feel economically squeezed, but it’s unlikely to be enough to win over voters concerned about the climate crisis — especially as he has voted against environmental and climate action in Parliament over 400 times in his career.

The NDP and Green Party are generally considered left-of-centre parties alongside the governing Liberals.

The NDP, which can siphon progressive votes away from the Liberals — which sometimes benefits Conservatives — have been clear as mud when it comes to their climate policy for the next election.

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh rescinded his party’s long-standing support for the Liberal carbon rebate in April 2024, but has not yet said what his party would put in its place.

The Green Party has generally maintained its support for the carbon rebate. Its website suggests the party supports the polluter-pays principle.

However, the Greens have yet to take a clear stance on the shifting climate grounds on which this election could partially be fought.

In the coming years, the future of climate policy in Canada will be less about crafting the perfect policy and more about crafting a message that addresses how people are feeling.

The Liberal Party has been open about the demise of the carbon rebate being a combination of a lack of their own effective communication strategy, mixed with harmful disinformation campaigns that led to the demise of their signature climate policy.

For the Liberals, Conservatives, NDP, and Greens alike, the road to effective climate policy will lie in this communication.</p></b>

                <p>Mark Carney has called an election for April 28 after serving as prime minister for two weeks.

As the first in Canadian history to be named prime minister without ever having held public office, Carney is hoping he can win the trust of Canadians.

He'll run for a seat in the Ottawa riding of Nepean.

Trustworthiness is awarded to those who are at least perceived as knowledgeable, transparent and concerned.

When it comes to economics, Carney is among the most knowledgeable in the country.

After obtaining a PhD at the University of Oxford, Carney has had a distinguished public service career in the Canadian Department of Finance, the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England.

His supporters say he's the right person to lead Canada in the face of economic uncertainty due to threats from United States President Donald Trump.

His chief rival, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, was first elected to the House of Commons at the age of 25 and has a different CV.

Carney might struggle more with being perceived as open and showing concern.

The Conservatives have criticized Carney for not being more transparent about his private financial interests.

Canadians need to know if he's in conflict of interest when making decisions in government, they argue.

Carney's answers to questions about his time at Brookfield Asset Management have been unsteady on occasion.

The Conservatives are implying that Carney is an out-of-touch elite who doesn't share the concerns of average Canadians by alluding to his wealth and connections.

Some visuals of Carney can cut both ways, such as his recent chummy embrace with French President Emmanuel Macron.

Others might find this reassuring due to geopolitical tensions, while some may see it as privileged and off-putting.

Even his hockey skills, acquired partly during his time at Harvard University, could be seen as elitist.

Former prime minister Justin Trudeau was a motivational speaker in the 2000s and used public speaking opportunities like the WE Charity to connect with young voters.

Trudeau used these connections when he led the Liberals to victory in 2015.

Political instinct is also crucial, requiring reconciling expert knowledge with everyday concerns.

There's no formula for finding this balance.

Former prime minister Jean Chretien was a winner of three consecutive majorities and delivered a speech that went over well at the recent Liberal convention confirming Carney as leader.

Chretien had unparalleled political instincts, including when he backtracked on his original opposition to the GST.</p></b>

                <p>Groundbreaking observations of a repeating explosion in space, the recurrent nova LMCN 1968-12a, reveal that it's the hottest burst of its kind ever recorded.

Located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a nearby satellite galaxy of the Milky Way , LMCN 1968-12a is the first recurrent nova outside our galaxy to have been studied in near-infrared light.

When a white dwarf, the leftover core of a collapsed star, is in a tight orbit around another star, it can pull material from that star, leading to some pretty dramatic astronomical events. One of these is called a nova, which means "new" in Latin.

This event results in a bright flash in the sky, as if a new star had appeared, and lasts a few weeks or months before fading. When the dust clears, the original stars remain (unlike in a supernova , which happens when a star is completely destroyed).

In the binary system, as the white dwarf steals gas from its younger companion, the accumulated material forms an accretion disk around the white dwarf. Matter swirls in the disk, and when it reaches the white dwarf's surface and piles up, the pressure and temperature rise so high that it ignites a rapid burning of hydrogen into heavier elements.

This is known as a thermonuclear runaway reaction. Related: Scientists find evidence of 'supernova graveyard' at the bottom of the sea — and possibly on the surface of the moon

This reaction produces a high-energy blast that expels a huge chunk of material from the white dwarf's surface — resulting in a nova. The nova is called "recurrent" when the white dwarf continues to pull more material from its companion, causing similar short-lived bursts of energy at regular intervals ranging from a few months to several years apart.

Not many recurrent novas have been observed in our galaxy, and even fewer have been found outside the Milky Way. Studying novas helps astronomers understand the dynamics of binary systems and the influence of surrounding conditions on these eruptions.

LMCN 1968-12a was the first recurrent nova to be found outside our galaxy. Discovered in 1968, the system consists of a white dwarf and a red subgiant star. It erupts every four years, and its eruptions have been observed regularly since 1990.

The most recent eruption occurred in August 2024. Following the initial observations, the Magellan Baade telescope and the Gemini South telescope — both in Chile — carried out follow-up observations of LMCN 1968-12a in near-infrared light nine days and 22 days after the outburst, respectively.

The observations showed the light emitted by various elements that became highly energized during the eruption. A light spectrum analysis showing the unexpected chemicals detected in the nova explosion.

The spectra from the Magellan telescope revealed a clear spike in ionized silicon that was 95 times brighter than the light emitted by the sun added up across all of its wavelengths. A similar dominance of silicon was seen in the spectra from Gemini, although the brightness was lower.

The brightness of silicon was unexpected, said study co-author Tom Geballe , an astronomer emeritus at NOIRLab, and the missing spikes were even more surprising. "We would've expected to also see signatures of highly energized sulfur, phosphorus, calcium and aluminum," Geballe said in a statement .

Study co-author Sumner Starrfield , Regents professor of astrophysics at Arizona State University, added, "This surprising absence, combined with the presence and great strength of the silicon signature, implied an unusually high gas temperature, which our modeling confirmed."

According to the team's estimates, this is one of the hottest novas ever recorded, with the temperature of the expelled gas reaching 5.4 million degrees Fahrenheit (3 million degrees Celsius). The highly violent eruption, indicated by such extreme temperatures, suggests a connection to the conditions surrounding the nova.

The Large Magellanic Cloud has a lower metallicity than our galaxy, meaning it contains fewer elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. This results in a greater buildup of matter on the white dwarf's surface before ignition, leading to more violent nova explosions.

By contrast, in high-metallicity systems, heavy elements alter the process. Moreover, the ejected gas collides with the companion star's atmosphere, creating a shock that raises temperatures. Starrfield predicted that low-metallicity material would cause more-intense nova events, and the observations have come through.</p></b>

                <p>The current system of consent is flawed, with instantaneity being a major issue. Consent is often expressed without time limits or possible regret.

It's imperative to organize the "advise" process, particularly on the internet where people consent to data sharing without any timeframe for reconsideration.

The current emphasis on consent preserves less the autonomous will of the consenting party than maintaining the applicant as a third party not involved.

What does the applicant say precisely about their intention, projects, and what they will do with the consent?

The requirement for raw consent is not sufficient when trying to protect a potential victim. It's just a means, not an end.

Elude consent and force a person to enter a contractual relationship can sometimes be desirable in certain circumstances.

Forced consent can be justified by the need to combat illegal discrimination or maintain access to essential services.

It's a concrete legal issue that crosses borders, illustrated by cases such as an American florist who refused to sign a contract for supplying bouquets for a same-sex wedding.

All this testifies to a form of objectivization of consent, which induces that consent is no longer the most obvious expression of individuality.

It's time to consider alternative forms of authorization or acceptability in place of traditional consent.</p></b>

                <p>The new trial is believed to be the first to demonstrate the beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation for multiple sclerosis, but this line of research is still in its infancy.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. In those with the disease, immune cells mistakenly attack the protective layer around nerve fibers, causing lesions or scar tissue to form.

Studies suggest that vitamin D deficiency is a potential risk factor for MS. Vitamin D can reduce inflammation in the central nervous system by inhibiting the release of chemical messengers from immune cells that trigger inflammation.

The link between low vitamin D and multiple sclerosis was first identified in the 1960s. Yet, over the years, various clinical trials have tried and failed to show that taking high doses of vitamin D can help reduce patients' symptoms or disease progression.

To overcome these hurdles, Dr. Eric Thouvenot and colleagues took a different approach in their new trial. They looked at the effects of high-dose vitamin D supplementation in 303 patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS).

The patients in the trial had yet to start taking other drugs for multiple sclerosis, so the researchers had a window in which they could directly investigate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on their disease progression.

During the trial, the team randomly assigned 156 patients to take a high-dose of a form of vitamin D called cholecalciferol. They took the supplement once every two weeks for two years or until they showed signs of MS symptoms or new or growing lesions during medical visits.

If disease activity was detected, patients would be removed from the trial and immediately prescribed disease-modifying drugs.

A comparison group of 147 patients underwent the same protocol but took a dummy drug instead of vitamin D, according to a report of the trial published in the Journal Jama.

The dose the vitamin D group received was 100,000 International Units, which is around 20 times more than what common drug stores contain per dose.

Overall, the researchers found that disease activity occurred in 60% of the vitamin D group compared with 74% in the placebo group. The time it took for symptoms to emerge was also significantly longer in the treatment group than the latter - about 432 days compared with 224 days.

Taken together, these findings suggest that supplementation with high-dose vitamin D may help slow the progression of CIS to multiple sclerosis.

This is "important research" and supports the use of high-dose vitamin D by patients with multiple sclerosis, said Dr. Klaus Schmierer, a professor of neurology at Queen Mary University of London who was not involved in the new trial.

Many clinicians recommend that MS patients take between 4,000 and 5,000 International Units of vitamin D each day. Any more than this can cause a condition called hypercalcemia, in which too much calcium builds up in the body due to vitamin D normally regulating levels of this mineral in tissue.

Despite being over the recommended limit for vitamin D supplementation, no one in the new trial who received vitamin D developed hypercalcemia.

The aim of this research would not be to replace current disease-modifying drugs for MS but rather to provide another therapeutic option for patients who otherwise don't have access to the drugs.</p></b>

                <p>Despite Canada’s commitment to universal health care, one in 20 Canadians cannot afford their prescribed medications.

People from Alberta, New Brunswick and British Columbia are the most likely to say they’re missing doses due to costs, leading to more emergency room visits and costly hospital stays.

Ensuring people have coverage for essential medications is crucial. 

The Pharmacare Act, Bill C-64, received royal assent in October 2024 and became law, covering contraceptives for nine million Canadians.

The act will also cover diabetes medications for the 3.7 million Canadians living with the disease, critical for managing blood sugars and preventing complications.

The rollout of pharmacare remains uncertain due to the Constitution Act of 1867, which gave provinces jurisdiction over health care.

The federal government must now negotiate agreements with each province to implement the plan, a task made more difficult by medication coverage varying widely across Canada.

Without full co-operation, pharmacare’s impact could be limited, with coverage gaps persisting for millions of Canadians. 

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has said he’ll scrap pharmacare.

Coverage differs among provinces, including some that provide universal coverage with income-based deductibles and others that use premium-based systems.

Most provinces also use co-payments, meaning people must cover part of the cost of each prescription. 

Only Québec mandates prescription insurance coverage, either privately or through its public plan.

Currently, a major driver of how much Canadians pay for their medications is arbitrary – it’s about where one lives.

For example, a young Albertan living with diabetes and heart disease who earns $14,000 would need to pay $1,000 annually for medications. 

In Ontario, that same person would pay just $100.

Such differences can influence where people choose to live and can hinder interprovincial labour mobility.

Pharmacare could have been implemented nationally, offering federal coverage for essential medications while insurers and provincial plans cover the rest.

This approach was considered in the waning days of the current Liberal federal government, but appears not to be chosen.</p></b>

                <p>Asteroid 2024 YR4 was spotted on a trajectory that could potentially threaten Earth, but observations determined it will not hit. However, an impact on the moon cannot be ruled out.

The asteroid is about as big as a football field and was referred to as a "city-killer." Its larger counterpart, 887 Alinda, is over four kilometres in diameter and could cause a global extinction event.

Asteroid orbits 
Both 887 Alinda and 2024 YR4 orbit the sun three times for every time Jupiter goes around once. Since Jupiter's orbit takes 12 years, the asteroids will take four years to be back on similar paths in 2028.

Alinda was discovered in 1918 and has made several sequences of near passes at four-year intervals. 2024 YR4 has made what NASA considers close passes every four years since 1948, but was only recently noticed.

Not since the 1970s has so much attention been paid to asteroids with a three-to-one relation to Jupiter. Such relationships had already been noted as a curiosity by American astronomer Daniel Kirkwood in the late 1800s.

These so-called Kirkwood gaps are not obvious since they show up only in plots of the average distance of asteroids from the sun. The gaps remained a mere curiosity of the solar system for about 100 years.

The employment of new computer technologies to calculate orbits revealed the effects of resonance to scientists in the 1970s. Resonance occurs when asteroids appear to move at the same, or a multiple of, the orbit speed of another external object — in this case, Jupiter.

The Kirkwood gaps are explained by asteroids similarly interacting with Jupiter to leave the asteroid belt, even while their average distance from the sun does not change. By dipping into the inner solar system, these asteroids are often removed from the gaps in a very simple way: by hitting an inner planet like Mars, Venus or Earth.

Scientists also found that these gaps were not completely empty; Alinda, for example, was in the three-to-one gap. Many more such asteroids have been found, and they are generically named “Alindas,” after the prototypical first discovery.

Return of the asteroids 
If the bad news is that Kirkwood gaps are due to asteroids hitting inner planets, including Earth, can it get much worse? For Alinda-class asteroids it does. Alindas follow their pumped-up orbit every four years, so properly aligned Alindas get a chance to hit Earth about that often.

Near passes of these asteroids tend to happen spaced by longer intervals, but when aligned, they come back several times with four-year spacing. A limiting factor is how tilted their orbits are: if they are quite tilted, they are not often at a “height” matching Earth’s, so are less likely to hit.

The bad news about that is that both Alinda and 2024 YR4 are very nearly in the plane of Earth’s orbit, and are not tilted much, so are more likely to hit.</p></b>

                <p>Bullying is a serious problem that impacts hundreds of millions of young people across the world each year. Defined as the goal-directed, harmful abuse of a power imbalance, bullying can cause serious, long-term physical and mental health outcomes for victims.

Countries around the world have mobilized anti-bullying efforts, but these efforts have had relatively little impact on bullying worldwide.

One reason might be that bullying is, at least in part, an evolutionary adaptation that offers adolescent perpetrators benefits, like popularity, resources, and even dates and sex.


But do these benefits extend beyond adolescence? The researchers wanted to test this by looking at whether the earlier and more frequent dating and sex that adolescent bullies experienced translated into having more children in later life.


An evolutionary trait? There is very little data on whether bullying benefits like popularity or sex extend beyond adolescence, but early data suggested that might be the case. The researchers sought to replicate that research using two studies.

The first was a longitudinal study of approximately 600 Canadian boys and girls from age 14 until their mid-20s. The second was a retrospective study of more than 500 North American adults ages 18-35.


We found that adolescents who bullied others reported having children earlier and having more children in total, compared to adolescents who did not engage in bullying.

While we note that a complete study should entail following adults into their mid-40s (the very end of most child births), we wanted to compile data now rather than waiting another 15-20 years for our longitudinal sample to mature.

That means that while we can’t rule out that non-bullies might catch up with later reproduction, the data clearly shows that onset of reproduction is tied closely to total reproduction.


Is having children early, and more often, a good thing? Given that bullying does appear to be partly due to evolved genetics (with the environment still playing a pivotal role in its expression), reproduction is the ultimate currency of evolution.

Passing on genes is, quite literally, the biological meaning of life. So this is strong evidence for the theory that bullying is, at least in part, an evolutionarily successful strategy in some contexts.


Socially, bullies are also more likely to be in the romantic relationship that is typically required to have children. We believe this is because bully’s power is related to potentially positive attributes, like attractiveness, strength, and even social skills.

Our yet-to-be published data also indicates that former bullies end up investing more energy into their children than average parents. Think of the hockey or soccer parents yelling on the sidelines, bullying their child’s coach, referees, or other players in order to benefit their own child.


Bullying’s links with parenting go beyond purely quantitative considerations and impact both mating success and parental effort.

Why does this matter? It matters because it helps explain why bullying is so ubiquitous and hard to prevent. Bullying appears to offer meaningful benefits to those who use it, and that’s critical information if parents, teachers, schools, and governments want to come up with strategies for preventing it.


What might some of those strategies look like? If bullying offers benefits, we want to reduce, replace, and redirect those benefits. We can do so by getting peers to not reward bullies with the attention and popularity that they desire.

We can replace benefits with costs by pointing out that while bullies gain popularity, they lose likeability. People might fear the bully’s power, but they generally don’t like them.


Finally, we can try to teach adolescents to replace bullying with more prosocial behavior that might have equal or better outcomes with respect to peer support.

This also matters because our data shows bullying as a potentially intergenerational problem. We know that violence can be transmitted from parents to their children.

It is possible that children of bullies will learn how to be bullies themselves, through directly experiencing bullying from their parents or through indirectly watching their parents bully others.


Given the seriousness of the consequences of bullying for its victims, we must all take a good, hard look at why so many people continue to bully, or support bullies, so that we can understand how we best stop this toxic and damaging pattern of behavior.</p></b>

Half a century ago, Chinese farmers stumbled upon an enormous underground mausoleum full of life-size clay people, animals and military equipment.

Archaeologists think that the tomb may be an entire replica of the Chinese city of Xi'an built to honor the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, who died in 210 B.C.

Excavations within the tomb over the past five decades have continued to reveal more chambers full of statues , weapons , and skeletons of both humans and animals . 

But the actual grave of Emperor Qin, who conquered six warring states and unified China, has remained untouched for over two millennia.</p></b>

                <p>Our newly published research introduces a way to create audible enclaves — localized pockets of sound that are isolated from their surroundings.

Sound is a vibration that travels through air as a wave. These waves are created when an object moves back and forth, compressing and decompressing air molecules.

The frequency of these vibrations is what determines pitch. Low frequencies correspond to deep sounds, like a bass drum; high frequencies correspond to sharp sounds, like a whistle.

Controlling where sound goes is difficult because of a phenomenon called diffraction — the tendency of sound waves to spread out as they travel. This effect is particularly strong for low-frequency sounds because of their longer wavelengths, making it nearly impossible to keep sound confined to a specific area.

Certain audio technologies, such as parametric array loudspeakers, can create focused sound beams aimed in a specific direction. However, these technologies will still emit sound that is audible along its entire path as it travels through space.

The science of audible enclaves

We found a new way to send sound to one specific listener: through self-bending ultrasound beams and a concept called nonlinear acoustics.

Ultrasound refers to sound waves with frequencies above the human hearing range, or above 20 kHz. These waves travel through the air like normal sound waves but are inaudible to people.

Normally, sound waves combine linearly, meaning they just proportionally add up into a bigger wave. However, when sound waves are intense enough, they can interact nonlinearly, generating new frequencies that were not present before.

This is the key to our technique: We use two ultrasound beams at different frequencies that are completely silent on their own. But when they intersect in space, nonlinear effects cause them to generate a new sound wave at an audible frequency that would be heard only in that specific region.

Crucially, we designed ultrasonic beams that can bend on their own. Normally, sound waves travel in straight lines unless something blocks or reflects them. However, by using acoustic metasurfaces — specialized materials that manipulate sound waves — we can shape ultrasound beams to bend as they travel.

The key phenomenon at play is what's called difference frequency generation. When two ultrasonic beams of slightly different frequencies overlap, they create a new sound wave at the difference between their frequencies.

This means you can deliver audio to a specific location or person without disturbing other people as the sound travels.

Advancing sound control

Audio enclaves could enable personalized audio in public spaces. For example, museums could provide different audio guides to visitors without headphones, and libraries could allow students to study with audio lessons without disturbing others.

In a car, passengers could listen to music without distracting the driver from hearing navigation instructions. Offices and military settings could also benefit from localized speech zones for confidential conversations.</p></b>

                <p>Sunset on the moon, part of the first collection of high-definition imagery of a lunar sunset.

Where it is: Mons Latreille, a mountain in the moon's Mare Crisium ("Sea of Crises") basin

When it was shared: March 18, 2025

This week, a spacecraft on the moon took a unique sequence of images of a lunar sunset. Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lunar lander snapped these gorgeous high-definition photos from its position at the foot of Mons Latreille, a mountain in the "Sea of Crises" basin.

The footage shows the horizon glowing as the sun sets, with Earth and Venus on display. (Venus is the glowing dot to the upper right of the sun, and Earth is the large, bright object at the upper left.) Another image from Blue Ghost shows darkness falling over the moon as Earth and Venus look on.

Sunsets are much rarer on the moon than they are on Earth. Because the moon is tidally locked with Earth, one day on the moon — sunrise to sunset — lasts 14.5 Earth days.

Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost mission could sustain itself using solar panels for just over two weeks. After landing on March 2, it operated on solar power until transitioning to battery power on March 16. It finally "went dark" at 7:15 pm EDT that day, five hours after sending back its landmark images.

Blue Ghost's mission came full circle, having begun with an image of a lunar sunrise on March 3. On March 14, the spacecraft took an iconic image of a "blood moon" total lunar eclipse as seen from Earth. From Blue Ghost's perspective on the moon, it saw a total solar eclipse — complete with a "diamond ring" effect — from a red lunar surface.

The mission was named Blue Ghost Mission 1, nicknamed "Ghost Riders in the Sky," and marks the longest surface duration commercial mission on the moon to date.</p></b>

                <p>Jim Chalmers likes to boast, or marvel, that he is the first treasurer since Ben Chifley to deliver four budgets in a term.

If Labor wins the May election, the treasurer will reckon the budget will be done and dusted for this year. But actually, we really need another budget post-election.

That’s for two reasons. First, because this one will be short on any hard reforms or big savings, because it is all about chasing votes. From roads to health, this year has been give, give, give from the government. Much of the spending has been matched by the opposition. Just in recent days, the Coalition has said yes to the government’s initiatives to boost bulk billing and to reduce the price of pharmaceutical scripts.

At the weekend, it instantly embraced the announcement to extend energy bill relief (A$150 dollars off bills in the second half of 2025). Secondly, the budget could, to an extent, be quickly overtaken because it is being delivered days before the Trump administration’s April 2 tariff announcement. That announcement could have big implications for the world economy, which would flow through to the outlook for Australia.

The international fallout would be more serious for Australia than any direct hits we might take – there are worries around beef exports and pharmaceuticals – although the politics would centre on what happened to our industries.

Given the election context, you will have to look hard for specific “nasties” in this budget. The main negative is likely to be the overall uncertainty about the future.

So specifically, what should we look for on Tuesday? Independent economist Chris Richardson suggests, in an interview with The Conversation, five things to track.

1. The big ‘off-budget’ number This is where the cost of initiatives does not directly show up in the underlying bottom line (which will be deficits through the forward estimates). Putting large commitments off budget has increased over the years. Richardson says the Albanese government inherited about $33 billion off-budget spending (over the forward estimates), and in this budget it could be more than $100 billion.

This includes spending on student debt relief, the NBN, some housing areas, and infrastructure programs. Putting lots of items off budget “means less scrutiny and accountability,” Richardson says.

2. Tax reform (or lack thereof) Richardson’s second item won’t involve much of a search. He asks rhetorically, “Will there be any hint the government is trying to do anything about the narrowing base of the tax take?” That is, anything to lighten the very heavy weight we place on personal and company taxes to raise revenue.

As an advocate for tax reform, Richardson expects the budget will contain zero in this area. 3. NDIS spending What is really happening with reining in spending on the National Disability Insurance Scheme? The government has made much of its progress towards bringing the growth in its share of spending on the scheme down to a projected 8% annually.

But Richardson says this is looking at only part of the story. Considerable responsibility is being pushed back onto the states; the federal government agreed to finance half the cost of new services to be delivered through state education and health systems for children with developmental disabilities to curb the burden on the NDIS.

“To focus only on the federal spend on the NDIS is to miss the wider cost picture,” he says. 4. The mid-year mystery How will the budget deal with the “mystery” that existed in its December mid-year update? That update did not seem to account for a rise in wages for public servants, even this was clearly in the pipeline.

5. The Trump factor The budget will discuss the risks on the downside for the economy, but how will it deal with what is to come from Donald Trump? What assumptions will it contain on the likely actions of an unpredictable president?

With the election so close, there will be almost as much interest in Peter Dutton’s Thursday budget reply as in the budget itself. The understanding is it will contain some new policy. It could hardly do otherwise.

But will whatever Dutton announces stand up to scrutiny? If it is too thin, it will reinforce an impression the opposition is not presenting a credible alternative.</p></b>

                <p>African countries are struggling to balance their books due to high debt levels.

Increasing revenue from citizens is an obvious place to look, starting with the tax contribution of wealthy individuals.

The most underperforming taxes in Africa are those bearing on income and property of wealthy individuals.

People who are better off often remain invisible to tax authorities, while others have formal labour contracts that make tax evasion impossible.

Only a few high-income earners pay personal income tax, such as top Ugandan government officials and successful lawyers.

In Sierra Leone, only 16% of landlords had registered for taxes during a registration drive in 2021.

Wealthy Africans face lower effective tax rates than average citizens, replicating a trend seen with small and large companies.

Research shows that revenue increases from wealthy citizens can be obtained by enforcing existing taxes rather than introducing new ones or hiking tax rates.

An effective approach to increase wealthy citizens' tax contribution relies on three strategies: identification, simplification of tax compliance processes, and enforcement of existing taxes.

These suggestions can lead to quick revenue gains, such as US$5.5 million in Uganda or US$900,000 in Nigeria in one year.

Changes in the way African revenue authorities operate are needed for these improvements to happen.

Tax collection services need to be better resourced, with a typical tax officer on the continent responsible for 10 times more taxpayers than their Global North counterparts.

Their efforts should be redirected from registering small informal businesses to developing a definition of high-net-worth individuals.

In Uganda, this includes criteria such as land transactions or rental income; in Nigeria, it varies across states but also covers less directly measurable assets.

Investing in real estate is an important strategy for wealthy citizens to store wealth during inflation and foreign exchange fluctuations.

Property taxes are underperforming, contributing little revenue from the income of wealthy citizens.

Research shows that high-net-worth individual units require substantial backing from senior management and government support.

Cooperative approaches should be chosen, such as voluntary disclosure programmes with tax amnesties, which have contributed significant revenue in South Africa and Nigeria.

Requiring candidates running for public office to obtain tax clearance certificates can also provide information and revenue.</p></b>

                <p>Roger Ballen, an internationally renowned photographer, was born in the US but has lived in South Africa since the 1970s.

He gained a cult following for his surreal images of white poverty during apartheid.

His work exposed the exploitation and marginalization of his subjects as well as the failure of apartheid to uplift its privileged white minority.

Over time, Ballen's practice expanded beyond photography into a hybrid realm of exhibition, installation, and performance.


The Inside Out Centre for the Arts in Johannesburg serves as a theatre for this experimentation.

The name "Inside Out" is typically "Ballenesque", evoking the psychological effect he seeks to instil in viewers: a blurring of perception and reality.


His exhibition, End of the Game, is an arresting debut for the centre.

It challenges perspectives on African narratives and supports various artistic practices, including photography, painting, sculpture, installation, drawing, and film.


Ballen walks me through the exhibition as a scholar of literature and visual cultures.

The show's been up for over a year, but there's no rush to close it due to its popularity and eclectic events at the centre.</p></b>

                <p>Nigeria's government launched an initiative in 2024 offering free emergency caesarean sections to poor and vulnerable women, in a plan to bring down the high number of mothers dying in childbirth.

Aduragbemi Banke-Thomas, a maternal and newborn health researcher, and Itohan Osayande, a teaching fellow in public health, discuss the initiative and how it can achieve its objectives.

How serious is the maternal mortality challenge in Nigeria?

Of the 287,000 pregnant women who died in 2020, almost a third were from Nigeria. At 1,047 deaths per 100,000 live births, Nigeria has the third highest maternal mortality rates globally. This is behind South Sudan and Chad.

The leading causes of maternal deaths are severe bleeding, infections, high blood pressure during pregnancy and unsafe abortions. These deaths are mostly preventable if pregnant women get emergency obstetric care, including caesarean sections.

What drives Nigeria’s maternal mortality?

There are several factors.

At an individual level, there is evidence that women delay seeking care, for various reasons. The cost of care and lack of awareness of danger signs are among them. There are also cultural norms that advise against lifesaving measures like caesarean section.

There are also issues related to Nigeria’s healthcare system. Research shows that women don’t always get the care they need when they get to a health facility. This might be because health facilities do not provide care as women cannot afford to pay. For others who cannot pay but receive care, some are unlawfully detained in the health facility until they pay.

Other shortcomings include ineffective referral systems and a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals. In recent years, there has been a sharp increase in health professionals migrating to other countries.

Inability to pay means that some women do not even seek care in health facilities. They end up delaying presentation at health facilities or going to traditional birth attendants, putting them and their unborn babies at risk of complications and death.

Beyond the healthcare system, other factors include poor roads to care. Many pregnant women in Nigeria are left to travel to health facilities on their own even in an emergency.

In rural areas, women face long travel distances to reach the nearest hospital.

Also, conflict displaces pregnant women and their families from their homes and disrupts access to healthcare.

Will the new initiative reduce deaths?

The initiative aims to increase health facility use and skilled birth attendance by 60%. It also aims to reduce maternal mortality by 30% within three years.

It recognises that Nigeria’s maternal mortality challenge is multi-faceted and only a multi-pronged approach can tackle it. 

The scheme includes a suite of community-centred interventions to be implemented starting in the 17 states that contribute over half of the maternal deaths reported in Nigeria.</p></b>
