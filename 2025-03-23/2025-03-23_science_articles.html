<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/trump-threats-is-foreign-policy-the-biggest-issue-for-canadian-voters-this-election-247065'>Trump threats: Is foreign policy the biggest issue for Canadian voters this election?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-23 16:38:51 <p>
This election will offer voters competing visions of Canada’s future at a time when it has become all but impossible to separate foreign policy from domestic politics. But even though the Trump administration has undermined the liberal democratic world order in which Canada has prospered for close to a century, it’s unclear whether threats of a global tariff war, an ongoing divisive conflict in the Middle East and continued Russian aggression in Ukraine will directly affect how Canadians cast their votes. Most political scientists have traditionally argued that foreign policy does not matter to Canadians at the voting booth. But a recent book by historian Patrice Dutil has claimed that “at least half of Canada’s national elections featured substantive discussions of Canada’s place in the world.” My new report, “Foreign Policy and Canadian Elections: A Review,” finds truth on both sides. Foreign policy is what people who study elections call an “issue,” just like the economy, national security or health care. Issues compete with many other considerations — like ideology, perceptions of leadership and the need for change — to determine a voter’s ultimate decision. Our political parties don’t typically differ significantly on world affairs. Read more: Trump's potential embrace of 'continentalist geopolitics' poses grave risks to Canada There are no real divisions between the election’s front-runners — Liberal Mark Carney and Conservative Pierre Poilievre — over how to deal with Trump. Now that Carney has axed the tax himself, those differences have become much less significant. Domestic politics aside, Trump will still loom large throughout the next five weeks. But international and domestic issues have been, and remain, sufficiently interconnected that it’s hard to discuss one to the exclusion of the other. Canadian support for Syrian refugees came up regularly during the 2015 election campaign. Still, it’s not clear if these differences affected more than a small number of individual Canadians when they marked their ballots. There’s hardly anything today of any significance that doesn’t have a huge international dimension to it.” But expecting party views on foreign policy to shape the election’s outcome is probably unrealistic. Exactly how Carney or Poilievre promises to deal with Trump probably won’t matter nearly as much as who they simply feel will do a better job on a host of issues.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Prime Minister Mark Carney has called an April 28 federal election, setting the stage for a campaign where climate policy could be a central issue. The current iteration of Canada’s consumer carbon rebate is dead — which many view as a casualty of effective communication — yet climate policy remains a pressing topic for voters and a major battleground for political leaders. Read more: The Canada Carbon Rebate is still widely misunderstood — here's why This tension between environmental responsibility and economic growth will shape how each party formulates and communicates their climate policies in the upcoming campaign. Carney’s website states that his strategy will: “Provide incentives for consumers. This suggests his climate policy will hinge more on positive incentives for consumers to invest in sustainable approaches rather than putting a cost on polluting. While the carbon rebate initially enjoyed broad support as a key tool for reducing emissions, it has become a lightning rod for political controversy. Climate change is no longer just an environmental issue; it’s increasingly seen as a matter of economic survival, with green energy jobs and clean technologies representing an opportunity for Canada to position itself as a global leader in the sector. Framing the carbon rebate as an economic penalty, Poilievre has played into populist sentiments by promising to “axe the tax” and relieve financial pressures on Canadian families and businesses. However, even if the Conservatives are successful in eliminating the carbon rebate, they still face the challenge of needing a comprehensive climate policy that lowers emissions and meets Canada’s Paris Agreement targets. Poilievre’s populist rhetoric may resonate with voters who feel economically squeezed, but it’s unlikely to be enough to win over voters concerned about the climate crisis — especially as he has voted against environmental and climate action in Parliament over 400 times in his career, a point his opponents will be sure to raise repeatedly. Poilievre will need to clearly articulate how his policies will preserve Canada’s environmental future without stifling economic growth or inflating costs for the average Canadian. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh rescinded his party’s long-standing support for the Liberal carbon rebate in April 2024, but has not yet said what his party would put in its place. Meanwhile, the Green Party, which has historically played a less significant role in electoral outcomes in terms of vote splitting, has generally maintained its support for the carbon rebate. However, the Greens have yet to take a clear stance on the shifting climate grounds on which this election could partially be fought. In the coming years, the future of climate policy in Canada will be less about crafting the perfect policy and more about crafting a message that addresses how people are feeling. Political leaders will need to balance ambition and pragmatism, ensuring their policies align with Canadians’ economic interests.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

After a busy two weeks as prime minister, Mark Carney has called an election for April 28. As the first in Canadian history to be named prime minister without ever having held public office, Carney is hoping he can win the trust of Canadians. He’ll run for a seat in the Ottawa riding of Nepean. Trustworthiness is awarded to those who are at least perceived as knowledgeable, transparent and concerned. With such a high level of economic uncertainty today in the face of repeated threats from United States President Donald Trump, his supporters say he’s the right person to lead Canada. His chief rival, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, was first elected to the House of Commons at the age of 25 and has quite a different CV. Carney, however, might struggle more with the other characteristics of trustworthiness — seeming open and showing concern. The Conservatives have criticized Carney for not being more transparent about his private financial interests. While Carney is following disclosure rules, the Conservatives argue Canadians need to know more about whether he’s in a conflict of interest when he makes decisions in government. Carney’s answers to questions about his time at Brookfield Asset Management have on occasion been unsteady. On the surface, this is about transparency, but in fact it’s just as much about empathy and whether Carney can relate to working-class voters. By alluding to Carney’s wealth and connections, the Conservatives are implying that Carney is an out-of-touch elite who doesn’t share the concerns of average Canadians. His recent chummy embrace at the Élysée with French President Emmanuel Macron exemplifies how immediately comfortable he is with world leaders. Even his hockey skills, which were part of a recent photo-op in Edmonton when he practised with the Oilers, were acquired partly during his time at Harvard University, an institution among the most elite in the world. Former prime minister Justin Trudeau could certainly rally a crowd. Trudeau became a motivational speaker in the 2000s and used opportunities like the WE Charity to practise public speaking to what would become an important constituency for him — young voters — when he led the Liberals to victory in 2015. There is no formula for this balance sheet. It was interesting that at the recent Liberal convention confirming Carney as leader, delegates gushed over former prime minister Jean Chretien, far from an elitist. A winner of three consecutive majorities, Chretien delivered a speech that went over at least as well with delegates as Carney’s. When Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney rolled out the GST in 1991, it was deeply unpopular. The fact that Carney dropped the carbon tax and capital gains tax was an early sign that he’s not an economist anymore, he’s a politician. The challenge for Carney — and for any politician in the heat of an election campaign battle — will be to find the sweet spot that reconciles expert opinion with public concerns and to articulate policies in a manner that voters will understand and support.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Groundbreaking observations of a repeating explosion in space, the recurrent nova LMCN 1968-12a, reveal that it's the hottest burst of its kind ever recorded. Beyond its extreme temperatures, this nova is also notable for being an extremely violent eruption with unique chemical properties that differ significantly from those observed in our galaxy, the researchers explained in a paper published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society . When a white dwarf, the leftover core of a collapsed star, is in a tight orbit around another star, it can pull material from that star, leading to some pretty dramatic astronomical events. One of these is called a nova, which means "new" in Latin. When the dust clears, the original stars remain (unlike in a supernova , which happens when a star is completely destroyed). Matter swirls in the disk, and when it reaches the white dwarf's surface and piles up, the pressure and temperature rise so high that it ignites a rapid burning of hydrogen into heavier elements.

Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors The nova is called "recurrent" when the white dwarf continues to pull more material from its companion, causing similar short-lived bursts of energy at regular intervals ranging from a few months to several years apart. LMCN 1968-12a was the first recurrent nova to be found outside our galaxy. It erupts every four years, and its eruptions have been observed regularly since 1990. The brightness of silicon was unexpected, said study co-author Tom Geballe , an astronomer emeritus at NOIRLab, and the missing spikes were even more surprising. "We would've expected to also see signatures of highly energized sulfur, phosphorus, calcium and aluminum," Geballe said in a statement . Study co-author Sumner Starrfield , Regents professor of astrophysics at Arizona State University, added, "This surprising absence, combined with the presence and great strength of the silicon signature, implied an unusually high gas temperature, which our modeling confirmed." The Large Magellanic Cloud has a lower metallicity than our galaxy, meaning it contains fewer elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. This results in a greater buildup of matter on the white dwarf's surface before ignition, leading to more violent nova explosions. By contrast, in high-metallicity systems, heavy elements alter the process. Starrfield predicted that low-metallicity material would cause more-intense nova events, and the observations have come through. The study authors emphasized that using large telescopes like Gemini South to study different galaxies will enhance our understanding of these processes in various chemical environments.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/au-dela-de-la-sexualite-les-faux-semblants-du-consentement-250981'>Beyond sexuality, the pretenses of consent</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-23 15:54:05 <p>
Gradually associated with sexuality, where it is a promise to advance in the fight against violence, consent is in fact present in a large part of our social interactions. Ambiguous term, it often masks a relationship unbalanced in the prejudice of that which consents. Consent is easily considered to be the foundation of any balanced social relationship and ultimate solution to regulate the evils. Several recent works strive to grasp its complexity and shed light on the risks it presents. These questions take a new thickness in the contemporary context. It is in fields with high social echo such as sexual relations, monitoring of vaccination prescriptions, compliance with the norm (which we think of the phenomenon of "yellow vests"). However, it is not in these contexts, which often include epidermal reactions that are hardly conducive to serene reflection, that we want to locate our words. Especially since many other areas, less publicized because of their technical dimension, such as the development of alternative disputes of disputes, or digital consent, and which however irrigate our daily lives, are particularly enlightening when we want to evoke the ambiguities of consent. In reality, it is simply omnipresent in the feeling of increased tension between, on the one hand, the excess of consent associated with individualism (I am, so I must be able to consent), on the other hand, the degraded reality of a trompe-l'oeil consent (I freely convenient to share all my data or to buy an object impulsively (and mythified Consents, has it ever made forced weddings disappear?) It would seem that nothing can exist without being granted. But does this trivialization of consent not sign its end? From Monday to Friday + Sunday, receive the analyzes and decrypts from our experts for free for another look at the news. By demanding the objective and concrete expression of consent, highlighting the act to come, we would protect the person by adding a complementary step between their being and their behavior: take the time to objectify, materialize, their inclination for what comes. Even less in consideration of a consent more and more often given in an emergency, or at least in instantaneity, without a process of reflection being committed or the properly discerned consent. However, our social relationships sail between individualism and mass phenomenon, and their apprehension by law requires an increasing solicitation of consent presented as an alternative to the taxation of the norm. Rather than imposing behavior, we request the participation of the person concerned in the process, by his consent ... without giving way to negotiation, to the co -construction of what will happen, without leaving a real choice (we do not impose cookies on an online trade site, but without consent, no access to all these objects of desire). On the one hand, the use of consent, however fictional as it may be, is essential insofar as he empowers the person who will have to formalize positively, by law, his adhesion to such act, such action. On the other hand, consent protects the freedom of the consent to a private, public or social constraint, even a "model" of society when in the name of certain values ​​or imperative reasons, we seek to impose a determined action. No freedom without consent, unless it is the opposite. Neuroscience sheds light on free will and its conditions. Philosophy reminds us that consenting is not wanting. Sociology reveals the social representation that is played out when consenting becomes giving in to the need (what is we ready to accept to integrate "the group", whatever it is? It is imperative to better understand consent, to better observe its legal forms, everywhere complexified, often presumed or even imposed, as in private business law. Things are therefore less simple than it seems. It is at best a "euphemism of the will" (M. Messu, "The sense of consent", in M. Cannarsa, Mr. Disant, Mr. Monot-Fouletier, F. Toulieux, Consent. Choosing to go in a direction without knowing where we are going, taking a risk by agreeing to partially ignore what we consent. Everyone regularly has the experience of "accepting" cookies, of "consenting" to data sharing, to access a digital service. There is no voluntarism in consent that we would like to see. To place the individual safe from his consent is to put him in the open of his commitment. Being pronounced before the proposed social interaction occurs, he cannot know the contours very precisely: consent is not ratification, it is not always free and rarely perfectly lit, and yet it objectively marks the commitment of the one who grants it. It does not allow time for the desire to build and evolve. It could be particularly useful on the internet, where we currently consent to the sharing of our data without time limits, without possible regret. What does he say precisely about his intention, his projects, what he will do with our consent? The "raw" requirement of consent is therefore not as such a sufficient guarantee when you want to protect a potential victim. And temporality (how to take into account the evolution of the context having given birth to consent? Because consent is not just a lonely act. It can be an egalitarian, united act, conceived as involving the interests of third parties, or even a general interest. Thus of a company in the dominant position which, in competition law, will have to contract with operators that it would not have chosen if its will could be expressed freely. Forcing consent can also be justified by the need to combat illegal discrimination: one cannot refuse to sign a contract, or refuse to maintain it, because of sex, origin, sexual orientation, place of domicile, age or family situation of the potential contracting partner. It is undoubtedly time to consider his alternative to better name what he claims to designate: a simple authorization, the testimony of an acceptability in which the guarantee of loyalty, condition of confidence, must have its place.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune diSE that affects the brain and spinal cord. This leads to symptoms such as muscle weakness, changes in vision, nombness and memory problemms, which may eith eith and go or get worse over time. Existing Drugs can help patients manage their symptoms, but these medications often have nasty side effects, such as an increased risk of infections and gastrointestinal. Related: Twin Study Reveals Signs of Ms That Might Be Detectable Before Symptoms Studies suggest that vitamin d deficiency is a potential risk factor for ms. That's because Vitamin d can reduce inflammation in the central nervous system in numerous ways - for instance, by inhibiting the release of chessengers from immune cells that trigger inflammatory. Thus, Theory is that having too much vitamin d May Allow Runaway Inflammation to Ensue. PREVIOUS TRIALS MAY HAVE FAILED BECAUSE THESY INCLUDED TO Few participants and Monitored Patients for Only Short Periods of Time, Such As A Year, Said Dr. Eric Thouvenot, Co-Lead of the New Clinical Trial and A Neurologist at the University of Montpellier in France. Past trials also tested vitamin d Supplementation in Patients who we Already Taking Drugs to Manage Their Ms, He Told Live Science. This made it Harder to Determine How Effective Vitamin D was, in and of itself. To overcome these HURDLES, Thouvenot and Colleagues Took A Different Approach in Their New Trial. They Looked at the effects of high-dose vitamin D Supplementation in 303 patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Cis Describes when Patients Have Early Signs that are suggestive of multiple sclerosis but they have not yet developed the full-fledged disease and don meet the diagnosis Criteria. Signs of CIS include inflammation and damage to the protective layer surrounds nerve fibers. Although not a given that cis will progress into multiple sclerosis, this is the case for approximately 85% of ms patients. If Disease Activity was deteted, Patients WOULD BE Removed from the Trial and Immodely prescribed Disease-Modifying Drugs, Meaning Drugs that alleviate symptoms by targeting the root Causes of ms. Taken Together, these findings suggest that supplementation with High-Dose Vitamin D May Help Slow the Progression of Cis to Multiple Sclerosis. Many Doctors Already recommend such supplementation, Schmierer Told Live Science in an Email. Many Clinicians recommend that ms patients Take Between 4,000 and 5,000 International Units of Vitamin D Each Day. That hinted that this High dose May be in this context, and notably, the participants Took the Supplement Twice a Month, Rather Than Daily. Furthermore, The Aim of This Research Would Not Be To Replace Current Disease-Modifying Drugs for Ms But Rather to Provide Another Therapeutic Option for Patients who Otherwise Don't Have Access to the Drugs, for Example Because of Financial Reasons, Thouvenot Emphasized.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/pharmacare-is-now-law-in-canada-but-negotiations-with-provinces-could-slow-progress-250888'>Pharmacare is now law in Canada, but negotiations with provinces could slow progress</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-23 13:21:23 <p>
When people skip medications, it leads to more emergency room visits, costly hospital stays and worse health. In October 2024, Canada took a step forward when Bill C-64, or the Pharmacare Act, received royal assent and became law. It will also cover diabetes medications for the 3.7 million Canadians living with the disease — critical for managing blood sugars and preventing complications like blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks and strokes. Despite this historic passage of pharmacare legislation, its rollout remains uncertain. The federal government must now negotiate agreements with each province to implement the plan — a task made more difficult because medication coverage varies widely across Canada. Without full co-operation, pharmacare’s impact could be limited, with coverage gaps persisting for millions of Canadians. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has also said he’ll scrap pharmacare. This means provincial coverage only kicks in after an individual reaches a spending threshold on medications. Alberta and New Brunswick use premium-based systems, requiring monthly membership fees. Only Québec mandates prescription insurance coverage, either privately or through its public plan. Currently, a major driver of how much Canadians pay for their medications is arbitrary — it’s about where one lives. It’s a driving force behind the push for pharmacare — to ensure free access to the most important medications, regardless of where someone lives. Pharmacare could have been implemented nationally, like it was for the Canadian Dental Care Plan, offering federal coverage for essential medications like contraceptives and diabetes medications, while insurers and provincial plans cover the rest. This would have been a simple approach that would have allowed for future changes, and could have been implemented by provinces much like vaccines are — paid for using people’s provincial health numbers, sidestepping the difficulty of enrolling people in a new plan. where deals have already been made with the federal government, while other provinces remain in talks. As Canada takes its first steps toward pharmacare, many questions remain. For provinces with income-based deductibles, would the deductible simply shift to other drugs, meaning people with other health conditions won’t really save on their overall medication costs each year? How would this be rolled out in Québec where some form of medication coverage is already mandatory? The push for universal drug coverage in Canada dates back decades. Yet, despite decades of advocacy, Canada has remained the only country with a universal health-care system that doesn’t provide comprehensive drug coverage.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In late 2024, astronomers spotted asteroid 2024 YR4 on a trajectory that could potentially threaten Earth. This observation triggered a fervid series of observations of the object — possibly as big as a football field — to determine that it will not hit. However, an impact on the moon cannot be ruled out. Read more: What are the chances an asteroid will impact Earth in 2032? Asteroid 2024 YR4 has a diameter between 40 to 90 metres and was referred to as a “city-killer” capable of causing regional damage and affecting the climate; the larger asteroid, 887 Alinda, is over four kilometres in diameter and could cause a global extinction event. Alinda remains just outside Earth’s orbit, while 2024 YR4 does cross our orbit and still could impact Earth; however, this won’t occur in the foreseeable future. These special kinds of asteroids are dangerous, since they come back regularly. Alinda was discovered in 1918 and has made several sequences of near passes at four-year intervals. 2024 YR4 has made what NASA considers close passes every four years since 1948, but was only recently noticed. Such relationships had already been noted as a curiosity by American astronomer Daniel Kirkwood in the late 1800s. Working with very sparse data since few asteroids were known at the time, he noted none went around the sun twice for each Jupiter orbit, nor three times, nor in more complex ratios like seven-to-three or five-to-two. By dipping into the inner solar system, these asteroids are often removed from the gaps in a very simple way: by hitting an inner planet like Mars, Venus or Earth. Scientists also found that these gaps were not completely empty; Alinda, for example, was in the three-to-one gap. Many more such asteroids have been found, and they are generically named “Alindas,” after the prototypical first discovery whose name origin is a bit obscure. If the bad news is that Kirkwood gaps are due to asteroids hitting inner planets, including Earth, can it get much worse? Near passes of these asteroids tend to happen spaced by longer intervals, but when aligned, they come back several times with four-year spacing. The much more dangerous Alinda is still being pumped: in about 1,000 years, it may be poised to hit Earth. However, getting an orbital kick from Earth, its orbit will still cross ours, just not as often. The last damaging one to do so appeared undetected on Feb. 15, 2013, over Chelyabinsk, Russia, injuring many people when its shock wave shattered glass in buildings. While astronomers work diligently to survey the night sky from Earth’s surface, space-based surveys like the upcoming Near-Earth Object (NEO) surveyor can be very efficient in detecting asteroids. They do so by their heat (infrared) radiation and, being in space, can also study the daytime sky. Among asteroids, we must pay special attention to resonant ones, such as 2024 YR4, because eventually, they’ll be back.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/could-bullying-be-an-evolutionary-trait-251237'>Could bullying be an evolutionary trait?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-23 13:11:00 <p>
Defined as the goal-directed, harmful abuse of a power imbalance, bullying can cause serious, long-term physical and mental health outcomes for victims. As a result, countries around the world have mobilized anti-bullying efforts. One reason might be that bullying is, at least in part, an evolutionary adaptation that offers adolescent perpetrators benefits, like popularity, resources and even dates and sex. This is what we set out to test at Brock University’s Research on Aggression and Victimization Experiences group. In particular, we wanted to know if the earlier and more frequent dating and sex that adolescent bullies experienced translated into having more children in later life. The first was a longitudinal study of adolescents: approximately 600 Canadian boys and girls from age 14 until their mid-20s. The second was a retrospective study of more than 500 North American adults ages 18-35. We found that adolescents who bullied others reported having children earlier and having more children in total, compared to adolescents who did not engage in bullying. While we note that a complete study should entail following adults into their mid-40s (the very end of most child births), we wanted to compile data now rather than waiting another 15-20 years for our longitudinal sample to mature. Given that bullying does appear to be partly due to evolved genetics (with the environment still playing a pivotal role in its expression), reproduction is the ultimate currency of evolution. Our yet-to-be published data also indicates that former bullies end up investing more energy into their children than average parents. Think of the hockey or soccer parents yelling on the sidelines, bullying their child’s coach, referees or other players in order to benefit their own child. We can do so by getting peers to not reward bullies with the attention and popularity that they desire. We can replace benefits with costs by pointing out that while bullies gain popularity, they lose likeability. People might fear the bully’s power, but they generally don’t like them. This also matters because our data shows bullying as a potentially intergenerational problem. We know that violence can be transmitted from parents to their children. It is possible that children of bullies will learn how to be bullies themselves, through directly experiencing bullying from their parents or through indirectly watching their parents bully others. This generational transmission might very well be another reason why bullying is so hard to prevent — because it starts in the home.

Half a century ago, Chinese farmers stumbled upon an enormous underground mausoleum full of life-size clay people, animals and military equipment. Archaeologists think that the tomb may be an entire replica of the Chinese city of Xi'an built to honor the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, who died in 210 B.C. Excavations within the tomb over the past five decades have continued to reveal more chambers full of statues , weapons , and skeletons of both humans and animals . But the actual grave of Emperor Qin, who conquered six warring states and unified China, has remained untouched for over two millennia.

Or have a private conversation in public without other people hearing you? Our newly published research introduces a way to create audible enclaves — localized pockets of sound that are isolated from their surroundings. In other words, we've developed a technology that could create sound exactly where it needs to be. The ability to send sound that becomes audible only at a specific location could transform entertainment, communication and spatial audio experiences. Certain audio technologies, such as parametric array loudspeakers , can create focused sound beams aimed in a specific direction. However, these technologies will still emit sound that is audible along its entire path as it travels through space. In our work, we used ultrasound as a carrier for audible sound. It can transport sound through space silently — becoming audible only when desired. Normally, sound waves combine linearly , meaning they just proportionally add up into a bigger wave. However, when sound waves are intense enough, they can interact nonlinearly, generating new frequencies that were not present before. This is the key to our technique: We use two ultrasound beams at different frequencies that are completely silent on their own. But when they intersect in space , nonlinear effects cause them to generate a new sound wave at an audible frequency that would be heard only in that specific region. Related: These noise-canceling headphones can filter specific sounds on command, thanks to deep learning Crucially, we designed ultrasonic beams that can bend on their own. Normally, sound waves travel in straight lines unless something blocks or reflects them. However, by using acoustic metasurfaces — specialized materials that manipulate sound waves — we can shape ultrasound beams to bend as they travel. By precisely controlling the phase of the ultrasound waves, we create curved sound paths that can navigate around obstacles and meet at a specific target location. The key phenomenon at play is what's called difference frequency generation . This means you can deliver audio to a specific location or person without disturbing other people as the sound travels. For example, museums could provide different audio guides to visitors without headphones, and libraries could allow students to study with audio lessons without disturbing others. In a car, passengers could listen to music without distracting the driver from hearing navigation instructions. Offices and military settings could also benefit from localized speech zones for confidential conversations. Despite these hurdles, audio enclaves present a fundamental shift in sound control. By redefining how sound interacts with space, we open up new possibilities for immersive, efficient and personalized audio experiences.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Jim Chalmers likes to boast, or marvel, that he is the first treasurer since Ben Chifley to deliver four budgets in a term. But actually, we really need another budget post election. First, because this one will be short on any hard reforms or big savings, because it is all about chasing votes. Secondly, the budget could, to an extent, be quickly overtaken because it is being delivered days before the Trump administration’s April 2 tariff announcement. The international fallout would be more serious for Australia than any direct hits we might take – there are worries around beef exports and pharmaceuticals – although the politics would centre on what happened to our industries. Given the election context, you will have to look hard for specific “nasties” in this budget. So specifically, what should we look for on Tuesday? Independent economist Chris Richardson suggests, in an interview with The Conversation, five things to track. Putting large commitments off budget has increased over the years. Richardson says the Albanese government inherited about $33 billion off-budget spending (over the forward estimates), and in this budget it could be more than $100 billion. This includes spending on student debt relief, the NBN, some housing areas, and infrastructure programs. Putting lots of items off budget “means less scrutiny and accountability,” Richardson says. Richardson’s second item won’t involve much of a search. As an advocate for tax reform, Richarson expects the budget will contain zero in this area. What is really happening with reining in spending on the National Disability Insurance Scheme? But Richardson says this is looking at only part of the story. That update did not seem to account for a rise in wages for public servants, even this was clearly in the pipeline. What assumptions will it contain on the likely actions of an unpredictable president? With the election so close, there will be almost as much interest in Peter Dutton’s Thursday budget reply as in the budget itself. The understanding is it will contain some new policy. But will whatever Dutton announces stand up to scrutiny? In last year’s budget reply Dutton announced his proposed migration cuts and that quickly became mired in an argument about whether his numbers fitted together. Under the spotlight in budget week, the opposition also has to be careful with precisely what is being said and committed to. We’ve seen the confusion over its divestiture policy and about a possible referendum to facilitate the removal of dual citizens. She told Sky, “The NDIS, for instance, is one of those areas in the budget that has run out of control; it was growing at 14% per annum. Labor’s spinners and ad team would have been rubbing their hands.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Faced with some of the worse debt levels in over a decade, African countries are struggling to find ways to balance their books. Increasing revenue sources from their citizens is an obvious place to look. A good starting point for African countries would be to focus on the tax contribution of wealthy citizens. In contrast, prior to 2015, only one of the top 71 Ugandan government officials and 17 of the country 60 most successful lawyers paid any personal income tax. Similarly, only 16% of all landlords identified in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, during a registration drive in 2021 had registered for taxes. This shows that wealthy Africans face lower effective tax rates than average citizens, replicating a trend already demonstrated for the relative tax burden of small and large companies. But there are immediate steps that African revenue authorities can take to address this unfairness. Research led by the International Centre for Tax and Development, to which I have contributed, shows that revenue increases from wealthy citizens can be obtained by focusing on better enforcement of existing taxes rather than by introducing new ones or hiking tax rates. An effective approach to increase wealthy citizens tax contribution relies on three strategies: But these improvements require changes in the way African revenue authorities operate. Revenue services in all African countries need to be better resourced. First, their efforts need to be redirected away from the registration of small informal businesses. Research in Ethiopia and Rwanda shows that investing in real estate represents one of the main strategies to store wealth when inflation and foreign exchange fluctuation make bank deposits unattractive. While we lack granular data on capital gains or rental income taxes, there are good reasons to think they are also significantly underperforming. Capital gains refers to the additional value which an investor accrues when disposing of assets such as houses or companies share previously bought at a lower price. Most countries, including the majority of anglophone African countries, have a dedicated office following the tax affairs of large companies active in their territory. Having dedicated resources for high net-worth individuals would be useful because using the international definition (a net worth of US$1 million) might be hard to operationalise. The reason for this is that most revenue authorities lack detailed data on assets owned by their taxpayers. African countries are better off relying on data already in their possession as they seek to collect further useful information on their taxpayers. This backing is needed for actions as apparently easy as obtaining data from other government agencies, without which identification efforts could be quickly thwarted, and becomes crucial when its time to move to enforcement. One approach is voluntary disclosure programmes with associated tax amnesties. These are useful to obtain information about the assets of wealthy citizens. Fourth, requiring candidates running for public office to obtain tax clearance certificates can also be an important source of information and revenue. This has been shown to work in both Uganda and Nigeria. Efforts to produce suitable guidance for wealth taxation for low-income countries by the United Nations, or to introduce a global wealth tax on billionaire by the Brazilian G20, are important to highlight the role of fiscal redistribution in addressing inequality. But many African countries are better off by first being bold about the basics of their tax systems, which can already make them more effective and progressive.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

He gained a cult following for his grotesque, surreal images of white poverty, captured on the rural fringes during apartheid. His work exposed not only the exploitation and marginalisation of his subjects but also the reality of apartheid’s failure to uplift even its privileged white minority. Over time, Ballen’s practice has expanded beyond photography into a hybrid realm of exhibition, installation and performance. The name itself, Inside Out, is typically “Ballenesque”, evoking the psychological effect he seeks to instil in viewers: a blurring of perception and reality. Ballen is committed to challenging perspectives on African narratives. Designed as a platform for thought-provoking exhibitions and educational programmes, Inside Out supports a range of artistic practices, including photography, painting, sculpture, installation, drawing and film. As a scholar of literature and visual cultures, I am fascinated with this epic engagement with colonial archives and the history of big game hunting in Africa since the 1700s. Even though the show’s been up for over a year, there’s no rush to close it, Ballen tells me. It’s become the backdrop of many eclectic events at the centre – live tattooing, poetry performances, curatorial talks, music workshops, film screenings, panel discussions. The centre is also proving popular for school group visits. Entering End of the Game, visitors are greeted by Tarzan posters and a room filled with photos, books and documentary material on colonial hunting. Here, Ballen’s images merge with eerie, mechanised sculptures of taxidermied (stuffed) creatures and unsettling painted tableaus. Ballen blurs the line between documentary and constructed imagery, creating existential psychological dramas within haunting interiors. Through his depictions of people and animals on the fringes of existence, he invites us to confront both our own alienation from the natural world and also the devastating consequences of our destructive behaviour. His props, masks, drawings and sculptures have come to feature more prominently than people. The results often look more like mixed media collages than photographs. In the context of climate change, the show stands as both a stark indictment and an urgent call to action. Walking through it feels like entering a jungle, the taxidermied animals look poised for confrontation. For Ballen, this encounter is both physical and psychological – are animals enemies or figures of beauty? The image of it as a wild continent to be tamed and conquered, an unspoiled paradise, or a playground, has persisted. Kenyan writer Binyavanga Wainaina, in his essay How to Write About Africa, satirised this: Here, safari embodies the enduring thrill of conquest. In the screen room, a collaged film is shown, made up of old hunting expedition clips found on YouTube. It is travel propaganda of famous hunting expeditions, led by colonialists and influential western figures. The show sparks critical conversations on wildlife conservation, responsible tourism and environmental stewardship. Inside Out was originally intended to be a photography centre, but during construction Ballen started imagining broader possibilities. Set to open in the last quarter of 2025, the centre will host photography exhibitions, talks and a bookstore, making it one of Africa’s few dedicated photography centres.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

How serious is the maternal mortality challenge in Nigeria? Of the 287,000 pregnant women who died in 2020, almost a third were from Nigeria. At 1,047 deaths per 100,000 live births, Nigeria has the third highest maternal mortality rates globally. The leading causes of maternal deaths are severe bleeding, infections, high blood pressure during pregnancy and unsafe abortions. These deaths are mostly preventable if pregnant women get emergency obstetric care, including caesarean sections. At an individual level, there is evidence that women delay seeking care, for various reasons. There are also cultural norms that advise against lifesaving measures like caesarean section. There are also issues related to Nigeria’s healthcare system. Other shortcomings include ineffective referral systems and a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals. Inability to pay means that some women do not even seek care in health facilities. They end up delaying presentation at health facilities or going to traditional birth attendants, putting them and their unborn babies at risk of complications and death. Beyond the healthcare system, other factors include poor roads to care. In rural areas, women face long travel distances to reach the nearest hospital. The initiative aims to increase health facility use and skilled birth attendance by 60%. It also aims to reduce maternal mortality by 30% within three years. empowering community-level leaders in Ward Development Committees to track and encourage pregnant women to use maternity services in primary health centres advocacy by prominent people to promote safe delivery practices revitalising the national emergency medical service and ambulance system the offer of free caesarean sections for poor and vulnerable women. What conditions are attached to the free caesarean scheme? Nigerians who have health insurance pay a premium monthly. Some African countries have taken steps to improve access to lifesaving maternal healthcare interventions, including caesarean section, by removing user fees. Examples are Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Morocco, Niger, and Senegal. Though evidence on the impact of free caesarean section policies on reducing maternal mortality is not conclusive, there are now higher rates of caesarean section, particularly among women from lower-income, rural and less educated backgrounds. This suggests that the benefits of such schemes go beyond pregnancy and childbirth. There are lessons from countries that have implemented similar schemes. “Free” caesarean without free delivery may lead to more women being identified as needing a caesarean, since the vaginal childbirth might come at a higher cost to the pregnant woman. Making both vaginal childbirth and caesarean “free” should be considered. Skilled health personnel must follow clear guidelines to assess whether a caesarean is necessary or not. With the recent funding cuts and withdrawals in foreign aid from the US, help is unlikely to come from outside. Giving verified private sector providers incentives to buy into the scheme should also be considered. The scheme should also be extended to women on community-based health insurance schemes, which are more likely within the financial reach of poorer families.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
