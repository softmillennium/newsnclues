UK considers changes to tech tax to avoid US tariffs

The UK government is exploring potential adjustments to its digital services tax (DST) to avert further tariffs from the US, Rachel Reeves confirmed.

The DST, which targets global tech heavyweights like Meta, Google and Amazon, has raised around £800m a year since its introduction in 2020.

Yet, with President Donald Trump set to announce new tariffs on the 2nd April, the UK is reportedly mulling changing the tax in exchange for a carve out from the duties Trump had threatened to impose on most of the UK’s trading partners.

Addressing the situation, Reeves said: “We need to get the balance right. We don’t want British exporters facing higher tariffs.”

She also said that the UK would continue to make sure tech firms pay taxes where they operate, while aiming to maintain fair trade relations with the US.

Yet, the proposal faced sharp criticism.

Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey condemned the idea of hanging UK tax policy to placate Trump.

Speaking at his party’s spring conference in Harrogate, Davey warned: “Changing the UK’s tax policy to appease Donald Trump and Elon Musk is a dangerous path. Appeasement never works with bullies, and it doesn’t work with Trump. Look at what he’s already done with British steel tariffs”.

His comments reflect growing concern that Labour’s approach to Trump could undermine the UK’s ability to assert its financial independence.

“Now Labour’s even talking about scrapping Britain’s tax on social media giants”, he added.

While Labour officials, including Reeves, have not ruled out changing the DST to secure favourable trade terms, the opposition argues that such concessions could lead to long term harm.

Business secretary Jonathan Reynolds has been in Washington this week discussing trade issues, while tech secretary Peter Kyle has also been in the US, promoting the UK as a hub for AI investment.",cityam

Cricket’s biggest show returned this weekend with the 18th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL) getting underway in Kolkata.

Cricket’s biggest show returned this weekend with the 18th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL) getting underway in Kolkata.

And while online betting is restricted in India – to such categories as the lottery and horse racing – there’s a growing international gambling market interested in the Twenty20 league.

Ironically the Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals were once suspended from the competition – in 2016 and 2017 – following a spot-fixing and controversy.

Global betting giant Entain tells City AM that 90 per cent of IPL bets placed in their international markets are in-play, with just 10 per cent wagered pre-match.

Last year’s competition saw the highest average first innings score, 191, with punters often betting at the half-way point.

Andrew Harriott, group head of cricket betting, says: “Generally, the two biggest factors for those looking to bet on cricket are: high run-scoring feats and record-breaking chases.

“The IPL delivers both of these in abundance.”

The betting breakdown

Entain’s Global Sportsbook reveals that 40 per cent of Indian Premier League bets in 2024 went on match betting while nearly 15 per cent went on next over runs, 12 per cent on team runs and eight per cent on player runs. In total 90 per cent of bets happen after the first innings.

The spread of bets appears to be pretty fluid in the IPL, and with a number of the teams now having minority or majority stakes in Hundred franchises there could be some affiliation built between fans in the UK and clubs across the subcontinent.

But the outcome can be a toss-up, with last year’s games seeing a near 50-50 split between winners who batted first and winners who battered second.

Added Harriott: “Cricket is more complex than most sports for bookmakers in that it has a third dimension, because of how much the pitch can impact a winning score.

“This can be challenging and leave us feeling like meteorologists at times.”

IPL changes

The IPL has, too, had three different winners in three years, with the Kolkata Knight Riders, Chennai Super Kings and Gujarat Titans all lifting the trophy.

And the Titans did it in their first season in the expanded tournament in 2022, the first case of a first season victory since Rajasthan Royals’ 2008 win in the IPL’s first ever iteration.

Their owners were private equity giants CVC Capital Partners but they’ve sold a majority stake to Torrent Group for an estimated $575m, valuing the franchise at over $850m.

There’s a lot of money hovering around the IPL, whether that be in the value of the teams or in the betting markets. But how will the cards fall this year? We’ll have to wait and see.",cityam

Chancellor defends budget choices and civil service spending cut

Chancellor Rachel Reeves has defended the government’s recent budget decisions, claiming they were necessary for economic stability amid uncertain global conditions.

In an interview with BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday, Reeves emphasised the importance of making difficult choices to ensure long term fiscal responsibility.

“There are always going to be costs for every choice you make, but there are also costs for irresponsibility”, Reeves said, ahead of Wednesday’s Spring statement.

“I did the responsible thing in the Budget. It required difficult choices but now, in the changing and uncertain world we’re in, we have economic stability.”

Reeves outlined several achievements stemming from the government’s policies, which she claimed have helped restore confidence in the markets.

These include maintaining non-negotiable fiscal rules, reducing debt as a share of GDP from record levels inherited from the previous government, and the Bank of England’s recent decision to lower interest rates.

The Chancellor also highlighted that wages have risen almost twice the rate of inflation in recent months, benefiting workers across the country.

While acknowledging the need for further action, Reeves said that the government’s focus on stability and reform would bring about growth, without relying on tax hikes.

“We have more to do, but my goal is to bring back the growth without asking people to pay more”, she added.

A major component of Reeves’ plan to reduce government spending is a commitment to cutting civil service costs by 15 per cent by the end of this parliamentary term, she told the BBC.

She outlined how government had increased its administrative and back office functions during the pandemic, but argued that the size of civil service hasn’t been scaled back since.

To address this, every government department has been asked to rank their spending priorities, ensuring resources are allocated accordingly.

“We want to put more money into things that are important for citizens, and less on things that are just not necessary”.

No zero-based review of government spending has been conducted since 2007, a review which Reeves sees as crucial to ensure effective spending.

She reiterated: “I’m determined to bring back the growth that is the prize on offer, alongside the stability and reform needed to deliver it”.",cityam

Picture Alliance

According to Deutsche Bank, the planned trillion editions for infrastructure and Bundeswehr can significantly increase economic growth. She raised her forecast for the economy and even trusts Germany to grow two percent - but only in the long run with further reforms. The plans and the Union and SPD have a look at prices, jobs and state debt.

""There is no question that a fiscal package of this size will boost growth in the next few years"": This is how the economists of Deutsche Bank Research begin a detailed analysis of the Union and SPD debt and expenditure plans, which is available Business Insider. As a consequence, Deutsche Bank raises its forecast for the German economy from 2026. With additional reforms for competitiveness, Germany can now reach more growth in the long term.

In a row: This year the German economy is still suffering from the stronger headwind from the global economy. Deutsche Bank therefore reduces its growth forecast for 2025 from 0.5 to 0.3 percent. The economy was a little worse through winter than expected. In addition to uncertainty about US tariffs, the risk of a weaker US economy has also grown. The United States is the most important sales market abroad for German companies.

Does the strongest growth have been visiting since 2017?

At the end of 2025, the impulse of the higher expenditure of the state will be noticeable. For 2026, the economists raise their growth forecast significantly from 1.0 to 1.5 percent. In 2027 they trust Germany 2 percent growth. It would be the strongest growth since 2017-outside of Corona turbulence.

However, this is only sustainable if the debt -financed government expenditure is supplemented by real reforms. ""Although productivity -increasing investments in defense and infrastructure could raise potential growth from the current 0.5 percent to maybe 1 percent,"" writes the bank. ""However, deep structural reforms would be required for sustainable growth of around 2 percent"".

The growth potential is extremely important. It describes how strongly an economy can grow with a normal economic situation. This is determined by the development of working volume and productivity, for which the capital stock, i.e. technology, systems, machines and infrastructure, are important. In Germany, growth potential has recently shrunk from 1.5 percent to 0.5 percent. Union and SPD have agreed in their coalition paper ""Our goal is to increase potential growth in Germany to well over one percent.""

Deutsche Bank expect the following course for the next five years:

The potential growth could recover from ""probably 0.5 percent in 2025 to about 1 percent in 2029"". Investments in the infrastructure should increase productivity. Defense expenditure should increasingly be geared towards the domestic high-tech defense sector, ""what potential technological effects promise for the civilian economy,"" the economists write. U m The ""potential growth noticeably over 1 %"" are also necessary in profound structural reforms,

Could ""probably recover 0.5 percent in 2025 to about 1 percent in 2029"". Investments in the infrastructure should increase productivity. Defense expenditure should increasingly be geared towards the domestic high-tech defense sector, ""what potential technological effects promise for the civilian economy,"" the economists write. U m The ""potential growth noticeably over 1 %"" are also necessary, the inflation is essentially 2.5 % than 2.0 %. The ""fiscal stimulus"" initially meets a low utilization in industry and construction as well as on the labor market. With the higher demand from the state, however, wage pressure should also increase. In addition, there is the planned increase in the minimum wage to 15 euros per hour. This would be an increase of 17 percent. Overall, this would lead to a stronger increase in gross wages - special for the lower tariff groups in order to keep the distance to the minimum wage. This should delay relaxation in inflation.

In essence, 2.5 % should be more than 2.0 %. The ""fiscal stimulus"" initially meets a low utilization in industry and construction as well as on the labor market.

This should delay relaxation in inflation. Labor market: ""The improved growth perspective is good news for the job market,"" the economists write. ""Numerous industries will have a rapidly increasing demand, from highly qualified engineers in the defense sector to less qualified workers under construction"". This is likely to press the unemployment rate below 6 percent by 2026. In 2025, Deutsche Bank expects a stagnation of employment at the record level of 46.1 million. In the medium term, the shrinking workforce offer growth. The unemployment rate could decrease to 5.5 percent by 2029.

: ""The improved growth perspective is good news for the labor market,"" the economists write.

This is likely to press the unemployment rate below 6 percent by 2026. In 2025, Deutsche Bank expects a stagnation of employment at the record level of 46.1 million. In the medium term, the shrinking workforce offer growth. The unemployment rate could decrease to 5.5 percent by 2029.

""However, there is no need to strengthen real growth on the offer on the offer on the offer to strengthen real growth. By 2035, the debt rate could increase to 75 percent by 2035.

When does the money flow out of the new programs

Federal states. Deutsche Bank assumes that the federal states fully exploit the additional scope for debts of 0.35 percent of GDP from 2026. ""The federal states will probably use a part to increase personnel in education, social affairs or justice.""

""Ketchukflashen effect"" in the infrastructure. It will take time for public projects to get into the construction phase. ""We assume that the infrastructure investments by the federal and state governments reach around 30 billion euros in 2026 before jumping to 60 billion euros in 2027-a ketchy plastic effect,"" writes the bank. ""From 2028 we assume that the remaining fund will be exploited in stable amounts over the following decade.""

Defense spending as an unknown. Defense expenditure could climb from the current level of around 1.8 percent of GDP to 3 to 3.5 percent. Here, too, the bank accepts a ketchy plant effect. Time passes between the order and delivery. ""Specifically, we assume that the defense expenditure of around 80 billion euros in 2025 will increase to EUR 110 billion in 2026 before they are raised to EUR 150 billion in 2027"".

Growth impulse clearly positive

""The majority of the infrastructure editions will contribute to domestic demand,"" writes the bank. In the German economy there is scope to accept this demand. ""The capacity utilization is around 75 percent in industry and even below 70 percent in construction - the lowest level since the financial crisis"". Workers are there. ""In 2024, around 100,000 jobs were lost in the processing of the trade alone, around 30,000 in the construction industry. Around 250,000 employees are in short work.""

In the medium term, however, the increasing demand is likely to reach capacity limits, which result from the low potential growth of Germany. ""The biggest needle is probably the job market, whose labor offering is stagnating at best."" In the construction sector, the increasing demand for workers and material in combination with higher interest rates could dampen relaxation.

The growth effect of defense expenditure is more difficult to estimate. Most recently, around 70 percent of the expenditure for weapon systems flowed abroad. In the future, domestic value creation will increase. ""There are increasing signs that upgrading is more focused on European equipment, in particular on forward-looking technologies in the field of drones, cyber and space security, in which German (and other European) governments could strengthen domestic companies"". The increase in the armed forces may result in the reintroduction of compulsory military service.

Reading IFO also warns of economic costs of compulsory conscription and instead calls for a higher payment from the Bundeswehr

Weapons instead of cars - a chance in the crisis

""A few years ago, a quick capacity structure in the German defense industry could have led to a serious competition for scarce resources with the auto industry,"" the economists write. Today, the armaments sector can fall back on free capacities of the car industry to expand its production. The switch to defense production is also likely to be accompanied by higher orders for the machine and electrical sector.

In addition to direct demand, defense spending could increase productivity in the civilian private sector. ""There are robust evidence from other countries that government investments in defense -relevant research and development improve the innovative strength of the private sector,"" the economists write. Under the right conditions, they could be crucial for a flourishing technology ecosystem ”. It is difficult to predict whether this will succeed in Germany.

Where is the ""big bang agenda"" for companies?

Sustainable turn to more growth is not yet. ""Without a offer -side reforms, we think it is difficult that potential growth can increase well over 1 % in the coming years."" In order to bring potential growth back towards two percent, deep reforms are necessary. ""So far, however, there has been no convincing signals for a"" big bang ""reform agenda for reducing the bureaucratic burdens for companies, combating the shortage of skilled workers or on the curtache of increasing wage costs.""

The economists point out that the positive effect of the expenditure programs on the forecast is even greater. At the same time, the framework conditions for the German economy have deteriorated. So he gives greater risks among the tariffs of the United States.",businessinsider

I live in Hingham, Massachusetts. I was raised by two parents who grew up in more difficult conditions. I grew up in a lifestyle, which one would probably call a high middle class in a city of the upscale middle class. I was not as economical as my father, but when I spent money, I had a guilty conscience.

I visited the University of Massachusetts and made my bachelor's degree in communication because I wanted to go to the film and television industry. For a long time I worked with people from the industry who lived in tiny apartments in New York City at the age of 35 and hardly got a penny. I saw all my friends were doing well and how they enjoyed themselves, so I finally moved back to Boston and started a career in sales.

I joined the then Smithklin Beecham company, a manufacturer of health products. I came up with the idea that it would take three years, and then I would look for another place to earn my millions. Thirty years later, in 2019, when GSK merged with Pfizer, my career was over there.

A long career

I started sales at GSK, went from business to shop, spoke to the people in the corridors, spoke to the managers about the design of the expenses and made sure that our products were in stock. I got to know the business from PIKE by drove to the shops on Saturday morning to upgrade them. Then I headed a team that looked after regional supermarket chains.

In the early 2000s it was more about data analysis. My boss encouraged me to take a very analytical job. I switched to the care of national customers, in my case to the US pharmacy chain CVS. I went there and fell in love with the work. I was able to lock myself up in the basement for three days and delve into the data to find out how our business developed and where we failed with customers.

In 2019 we had these meetings, and I always had to laugh because everyone said: ""Who will be released?"" I showed them the gray in my beard and said, ""My time came"" because I was quite expensive. I was right, and the job cuts came in December 2019. In March 2020, hell was going on, so I was looking for a job during this time.

After all, I ended up in a brokerage sales that had worked for regional food chains. That was then dissolved. I switched to a company that produced a cannabis sleeping agent. The branding was great and it was a dream result. I also invested in a brewery with a former colleague and helped my wife's business.

I thought I would be 62 years old and sell the product while I still earn six digits, and I would design the end of my career as I would never have dreamed.

Although I was successful in building the company, the job ended abruptly and unexpectedly with the discovery of financial misconduct by the managing director and his tragic death shortly afterwards. I was unemployed in February.

A year of unemployment

At the beginning of the process, there were some options that I didn't notice. When I applied for jobs and some of the salary packages were much lower than I wanted, I thought: 'I have a daughter for whom I just paid for college, and I have a son who studies.' There is also a little ego.

I talked to an old colleague who was similar who then ended up with a management consultancy and got along well, but he was never as successful as with GSK. I have learned that you have to stop looking at jobs as you would have done at 39. You have to start asking yourself which jobs I can do that correspond to my skills that motivate me to get up in the morning that get my brain going and cover my costs. If you are looking for the unicorn, you will be unpatted with many opportunities to find it.

At this stage of my career, I have the feeling that the puzzle part has to be right if you want to hire someone my age. If you set me at the age of 40, it would be like a puzzle with which you take a part and it looks like it would fit and it is close enough.

I am not afraid of technological changes because I grew up at a time when they quickly accomplished. But I have the feeling that after a year I lost the connection without work. Will I go to work and not even recognize what people do? Did it develop so quickly?

The best scenario I have seen is perhaps ten to 15 percent below my previous basic content, but there are places that are 25 to 40 percent below my previous basic content, even more if you look at the overall package.

Nevertheless, I applied to some CEOs and companies, but in the end they rejected them. If you hire exactly the same person at the age of 40 who can contribute to the growth of the company, you could work with it for at least six to eight years. But if you look at someone at my age, you wonder if he will go back to the moment when he builds up a solid network in the area in which he has not yet worked.

Age discrimination is real, but it is not about a bunch of people sitting around and saying, 'We don't hire the older ones'. You would like to bring experience to the company, but you weigh all the factors. I think they perceive me as someone who is at the end of his career. But if I worked in a company in which I had a boss who gets up every morning and treated myself as I was treated when I did an apprenticeship in my twenties, it would not be as practical for me.

I was very good at dealing with personal finances and saved a good sum of money so that I could survive this special storm. GSK paid me a very good severance payment, so I don't have to worry about things like health care. But I know that it could be devastating for someone who earns a third or half of what I earn in such a situation.

In theory, I could retire in November, but I would live with half of the budget that I hoped for, which would change my lifestyle significantly. I have made plans all my life and I did the right thing by saving me, and that really thrown me back from this plan.",businessinsider

So much earnings biathlon world champion Franziska Preuß. Picture Alliance

Franziska Preuss won the overall World Cup in the biathlon in a dramatic final on Sunday in a dramatic final. It is her greatest triumph to date. Biathlon is the most popular winter sport on TV. Preuss is one of the largest biathlon stars. This also pays off really well for the 31-year-old. Preuss is one of the top earners in winter sports. She really makes that much money.

Franziska Preuß can easily afford the cover baggage for the trophy cases on the return trip from Oslo. In the best winter of her career, the German biathlete earned around 350,000 euros in prize money alone. There are also income from sponsors and advertising partners. On Sunday exactly you on the legendary stalks in Oslo for the first time the overall World Cup in biathlon. Even if the 31-year-old from Bavaria is not primarily about money: success in the most popular TV winter sport for Germans has long been worthwhile.

It was a dramatic final. Before the weekend, Preuss only led 20 points in front of the French Lou JeanMonnot. Preuss won the sprint race on Friday with the wafer-thin lead of 0.2 lowering in front of JeanMonnot. The French woman won the persecution on Saturday and passed Preuss by five points. In the subsequent mass start, Prussia won again and secured the World Cup.

Preuss had won 250,000 euros in prize money before Oslo. The overall victory in the World Cup brought her 40,000 euros. In addition, she received 15,000 euros for her two victories in the individual races. The small crystal balls for the World Cups in the disciplines sprint and mass start also won Preus and each received 12,000 euros. At the weekend alone, 94,000 euros in prize money landed in their account. Almost 350,000 euros came together in the season.

Around 350,000 prize money in one season alone

Preuss also cleared the World Cup in February. She collected four World Cup medals and received 55,000 euros in premiums alone. The highlight was gold in the persecution thanks to a perfect race without shot errors. In general, she is the best in the field with the weapon: 92 percent hit rate is outstanding. Paired with strong mileage, Preuss can be at the forefront at the end of the long season. It is her big goal.

Franziska Preuss earns more than ski jumper

Preuss is currently the top German earner in winter sports and has even received more prize money this year than the best German ski jumper. According to official statistics, Andreas Wellinger is the most financially successful German with a good 155,000 euros this winter, for women it is Selina Friday with just over 80,000 euros.

In the alpine area, Emma Aicher is the only German in the prize money tops with a good 160,000 euros. Overall, alpine stars earn significantly more than biathletes. At the Alpin World Cup in Saalbach there was 61,000 euros for gold, Preuss received 25,000 euros for her World Cup victory and can now be the sixth German overall World Cup winner. This was last achieved Laura Dahlmeier in 2017.

The time of the many diseases is over

A year ago it would have been almost absurd for Preuss to think of this success. She had to end one season early because she was plagued by infections and illnesses. During a winter, she had to expose them several times, foregoing important races at World Championships. Only an operation of the sinuses finally brought improvement in the spring.

""I just realize that there is no stove in the body that limits me,"" says Preuss: ""So I was able to train better overall, with significantly higher sizes, and I feel more resilient."" That has been seen in November since the beginning of the season. In 18 World Cup races, she was on the podium eleven times, had hardly any bad appearances and earned the respect of the competition. """" She seems inviolable, ""JeanMonnot said before the World Cup.

The 26-year-old French is the largest adversary from Preuss. Already last year she became behind the Italian Lisa Vittozzi overall second. JeanMonnot won seven times in this World Cup season, Prussia only twice. ""We both make a super good season,"" said Preuss. ""No matter how it turns out, we can be proud of what we did."" Now it went out particularly well for Preuss.

https://businessinsider.com,AI in the personality test: so differently tick chatt and gemini,https://www.businessinsider.de/wirtschaft/ki-im-persoenlichkeitstest-so-verschieden-ticken-chatgpt-und-gemini/,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 15:07:11 GMT","According to a leading personality test, AI models can have different personalities. Getty Images

The DISC model is a personality test for the workplace in which the behavior is divided into four areas.

A DISC provider tested the most popular chatbots, including Chatgpt and Gemini.

The chatbots seem to have different personalities, which could affect the dynamics at the workplace.

Chatgpt from Openai is confident and positive, but, if you drive it to the top, can also be manipulative. Google's Gemini is a good listener, but maybe needs a little encouragement to say what he really thinks.

This emerges from the disc, a popular personality test for the workplace that some companies now use to integrate AI models into their workforce.

The test was developed by the American psychologist William Moulton Marston, who already dealt with basic questions about human behavior in the 1920s.

In contrast to his contemporaries Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, who examined people with mental disorders, Marston examined how people interacted in good intellectual condition with others and their surroundings. It is also attributed to the invention of an early version of the lie detector.

Marston finally came to the conclusion that human behavior can be divided into four categories and presented the discperteness model in a book in 1928. Disc stands for the English equivalents of dominance, influence, steadiness and conscientiousness. And Marston viewed her as the four ""primary emotions"" that control human behavior.

Since then, Marston's model has been formalized in assessments that are now used by Fortune 500 companies, government agencies and universities. The questions that are often asked in the form of statements are, for example, ""I am motivated by performance and authority"" or ""I am mostly right"", and the participants answer, depending on how much they agree.

Ultimately, the test participants are assigned to one of 12 types based on their most dominant properties. Someone who receives a D for ""dominance"" could be described as direct and strong -willed. Someone who receives a DC for ""Dominance Conscientation"" (dominance and conscientiousness) may be more meticulous and is characterized by critical thinking.

Since companies accelerate the introduction of AI, employees use generative AI to write emails, collect ideas and carry out research. You could see chatbots like Chatgpt as a competent but neutral interlocutor for your thoughts. But these models may not be so neutral.

Online Disc Profile, a provider of Disc, conducted reviews of the most popular AI chatbots. It turned out that Chatgpt from Openaai and Copilot from Microsoft are both di types (Dominance influence ”). These types are known to be enforceable and result-oriented and have a sense of urgency. In the worst case, they can also be manipulative.

Google Gemini and China's Deepseek are a combination of S, C and I and can be classified as ""steadiness"" types that are less common. These types are more stable and stable and tend to be a good listener. They are characterized by the fact that they give others the feeling of being supported, but they also tend to avoid conflicts.

Some companies should consider how the dynamics in the workplace change when employees communicate several hours a week with a supportive but conflict -shy chat bot alongside their teammates.

According to Sarah Franklin, CEO of Lattice, a platform for the management of employee performance and engagement, teams suddenly become a bit like the management of the characters from Star Wars.

""You have Princess Leia, who leads the rebel command, and she has to do Luke Skywalker together with R2-D2, the robot, along with Han Solo, together with Chewbacca, and then you have C-3PO, another robot, and you all have to coordinate,"" she said business insider. ""This is exactly what we are doing at the moment. We have to be able to work together, but you also need a mission control.""

Lattice relies on disc as an internal assessment to ""reduce conflicts and improve work"" Some employees have already trained chatbots on their disc style, says Mollie West Duffy, director of learning and development at Lattice, to BI by email.

According to Duffy, employees can then ask this bots like: ""I am a type C and work with a type D on a cross -functional project. How should I give the other person feedback in the face of their style?""

The platform does not use the work assessment data from its 5,000 customers, which include Openai, Anthropic and E3, but Duffy said that this is something that Lattice is considering for the future. Managers could possibly receive tailor-made feedback tips based on the disc profiles of their direct employees. Or the platform could suggest personalized growth areas.

""We have to have a system in which the AI ​​exists as an employee with transparency, responsibility and management,"" said Franklin.",businessinsider
https://businessinsider.com,He researches whether fewer calories improves longevity - his diet,https://www.businessinsider.de/wissenschaft/gesundheit/er-forscht-ob-kalorienreduktion-langlebigkeit-verbessert-seine-diaet/,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 14:29:46 GMT","James White/Getty

The doctor James White researches to what extent a reduced calorie intake can extend life. He himself reduces calories in his own diet - in a safe and sustainable way. In an interview with Business Insider, White explains his routine.

How many calories do I have to take for a long life - and how much sport should I do? James White deals with these questions as a doctor at Duke University in the US state of North Carolina.

If we reduce our calorie intake, this triggers low stress in the body. As a result, some processes are going to remove the markers of aging from our DNA, explains White in an interview with Business Insider. Research assumes that our cells in old age will work efficiently.

In a study, White and his team found that mice that consumed comparatively 30 to 40 percent fewer calories lived 40 percent longer. This corresponds to a person's life expectancy by another 30 years, says White.

But people are not mice. Such studies are more likely to provide proof of concept for further research than that their results can be transferred to us.

In a separate two -year study, where White also worked, 220 healthy participants who did not suffer from obesity took about 100 to 200 calories a day than they would normally do. Her cardiometabolic health improved - as did the pace of her biological aging. This was measured using markers in the blood, such as the proportion of white blood cells and the change in genes.

However, there is no sufficient evidence that a calorie restriction contributes to the fact that we live longer.

Instead of thinking about how many calories he consumes, White addresses his research results to his life by eating nutritious foods that tend to contain fewer calories. He also tries to keep his sporting routine because he tends to eat healthier when he feels ""eating for one purpose"".

White told about other lifestyle decisions that he made in the hope of a longer life.

Eat enough calories to keep a ""healthy"" weight

White does not believe that people have to greatly reduce their calorie intake in order to use the potentially life -prolonging advantages, especially older people who should focus on maintaining muscle mass. Instead, he tries to keep an ""healthy"" weight in his opinion, in which he has an optimal body composition by not eating too much.

""You have to find a secure basic value for your body for calorie consumption, in which you do not increase. If you want to save a few hundred calories every now and then, it is okay,"" he said, quoting a study published in the magazine Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology in 2019.

It stated that healthy, non -obese participants aged 21 to 50, who restricted their calorie intake by an average of 11.9 percent for two years, rarely had cardiometabolic diseases and better blood pressure values ​​and higher insulin sensitivity.

""But you don't have to constantly restrict the calorie intake for years,"" he said. ""Even if you only restrict calorie consumption by a small percentage on a few days a week, health benefits will be shown in our investigations"".

It is important to know that calorie -reduced diets are not suitable for people under the age of 18, pregnant women, breastfeeding or people with eating disorders, Katherine Gomez, a registered nutritionist, told BI.

Cardio and strength training

Even a slight increase in physical activity can have ""enormous advantages for health and durability"", says White.

He trains five or six days a week and does both cardiovascular and strength exercises to maintain the muscles, muscle function and endurance. He lifts weights and goes for 45 minutes for an hour to walk, jog or ride bike.

""But there is a lot of literature that says that three times a week is very effective,"" he says. A meta -analysis of over 30 million people without previous illnesses published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine in the British Journal of Sports Medicine showed the risk of participants to die from chronic diseases such as cancer and heart diseases.

Eat lean protein and lots of vegetables

White usually focuses on the number of calories he consumes by using calorie measuring apps on his cell phone, and not on what he eats, but he prefers to prefer lean proteins, vegetables and healthy fats.

He also tries to restrict carbohydrates, especially processed, since it is easier to overeat from them.

The Mediterranean diet, which follows similar principles, was chosen by the US News & World Report the eighth year in a row as a healthiest diet. It is rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains and legumes and contains little processed food and added sugar.

Stress reduction through more sleep

""It is very easy to squeeze into a schedule of working, in which you work constantly, sleep little and feel stressed as a whole,"" says White.

So he tries to get eight hours of sleep, which helps him to reduce stress, he says.

""Stress is inevitable, but sleep is a good way to relax,"" he said. ""Sleep and stress are a constant process that you have to deal with and listen to your body.""

https://businessinsider.com,I owe my big tech career to a book-3 important lessons,https://www.businessinsider.de/karriere/meine-big-tech-karriere-verdanke-ich-einem-buch-3-wichtige-lektionen/,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 13:20:26 GMT","Courtesy of Jigyasa Grover

Jigyasa Grover attributes the book ""The Secret"" to be responsible for her professional success in the areas of AI and technology. The book has encouraged them to set themselves ambitious goals and to imagine how they can achieve them. Grover emphasizes that the combination of visualization with hard work and cooperation leads to success.

The 29-year-old Jigyasa Grover completed an internship at Meta and worked for over four years at X as a senior machine learning engineer. She was discontinued as a senior data scientist at the startup Faire in San Francisco before she started her current full -time position as head of AI and research on Bordo Ai.

She is also a member of the Developer Advisory Board from Google and AI consultant at Diem. She has reached all of this since she completed computer science in 2018.

In addition to her hard work, Grover said to Business Insider that Rhonda Byrne's self-help bestseller “The Secret” from 2006 influenced her approach to achieving higher career goals.

Grover read ""The Secret"" in 10th grade

She said that ""The Secret"" had a ""profound influence"" on her approach to determining professional goals and overcoming self -doubt.

""It is not about manifesting things in a magical way, but about developing a strong way of thinking that stimulates action,"" said Grover. “The book was particularly helpful because it taught me to set concrete, realistic goals and then implement them

Here are three strategies that Grover used from ""The Secret"" to improve their attitude and achieve great goals on their big tech career.

1. Focus on dreams that are taken far, not just on what seems realistic

Before she read ""The Secret"", Grover only concentrated on the objective of what appeared to be ""realistic"". Byrne's book encouraged her to have larger dreams and set goals based on their true wishes, even if they initially appeared far.

In addition to her interest in working with artificial intelligence and machine learning, Grover had another goal of which she believed that she could not achieve it so soon: to write a book.

In 2019 she began to be a published author with the help of techniques that she had learned from ""The Secret"" to ""really concentrate on her vision"". During her daily walks, she often thought about it.

""I imagined not only to hold the finished book in my hand, but also to explain complex concepts of machine learning in a clear and understandable way,"" said Grover. ""I imagined how I would break down the process of preparing data that I had learned through my work on Twitter and my research on UC San Diego.""

After she started visualization, according to Grover, the possibility of a book publication arose much faster than she expected. From the initial concept to the self -published book, less than a year passed.

""Since I always had this topic in mind, I quickly took the opportunity to write a book, and the universe showed me a way that I could not have imagined,"" said Grover.

This path was to find a co-author with additional specialist knowledge and unexpected time to realize a book project. Grover was contacted by some publishers for possible book projects in 2019, but at the time she lacked the time and the bandwidth to pursue these options.

""When the pandemic broke out, the resulting shift of my schedule and my living conditions created the perfect time window for me to publish a book on my own conditions myself,"" she said.

2. Imagine that you have already achieved your goals

Grover explained that an important part of ""The Secret"" is to imagine that the desired result has already been achieved. ""Before every project, I make sure that I firmly believe in my ability to realize the project,"" she said.

Whenever she offers an opportunity, be it in a fast-moving start-up environment or in a demanding technical environment at Big Tech, she imagines how she does well in this role. ""This really helps me to calm down my nerves, to keep it and achieve my goal,"" said Grover.

She used this method inspired by Secret during the post-acquisition chaos at X, where it worked from 2019 to 2023.

""That was a big challenge: massive layoffs, uncertainty about the future, and important stakeholders were gone, which threatened the entire product roadmap,"" said Grover. ""It was hard to see my talented teammates, so I started to imagine how I would emerge strengthened from this situation.""

Grover stayed with X for a few more months after the takeover and experienced most of the layoffs. ""I saw it as an opportunity to lead through changes, to support my team in an incredibly difficult time and to prove my resistance,"" she said.

With the focus on deep breath and ""This will also pass"", Grover introduced itself to use the turbulence of the situation: it becomes more adaptable, build closer relationships with the few remaining teams and learns to deal with the constant adversity.

Every evening before going to bed, she takes 15 minutes to distract herself from the work of the day and concentrate on a certain challenge, trying to see the overall picture and imagine what she can do.

She writes down three specific technical or creative challenges that she wants to tackle and dismantles the big chunk of work into bite -sized pieces. Then she introduces herself to how it solves every single task, concentrating on the positive effects and celebrating the achievement of every milestone.

When doubts sneak in with tricky areas, Grover plans to cope with them the next day and encourages their belief in their focused vision.

3. Go beyond the mere visualization to inspire you

Grover said that the secret to maximize these methods should go beyond the visualization of the desired result. She recommends believing that you can achieve something and use the visualization as a springboard to work hard, work well with others and maintain a strong vision.

""I really believe that the combination of technical expertise and attitude to implement these skills has only made my success possible,"" said Gover.

Grover believes that the balance between practical technical skills in the field of mechanical learning and its unshakable belief in the success of the project ultimately caused her to publish her book. She believes that ""The Secret"" has also indirectly contributed to getting her current job.

When she applied to Bordo Ai, the company was still in a very early stage of developing a new kind of AI solution. ""The Secret"" inspired her to imagine how the company could succeed in revolutionizing data analysis with AI. ""It helped me to cultivate a way of thinking that made it possible for me to see opportunities where others may see risks,"" said Grover.",businessinsider

https://businessinsider.com,New routes: The rare Airbus A330-800neo conquers the sky,https://www.businessinsider.de/wirtschaft/neue-routen-der-seltene-airbus-a330-800neo-erobert-den-himmel/,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 10:43:12 GMT","The extremely rare A330-800NEO from Airbus flies only on a few dozen routes worldwide. airbus

No Airbus model was sold less. But now the A330-800NEO is used on more routes. The aircraft is unpopular due to its higher seat costs and lower capacity compared to the A330-900NEO. Only three global airlines will use the 2025 aircraft on a few dozen routes.

Airbus has a strong aircraft portfolio and its deliveries regularly exceed Boeing. But one of his planes has proven to be a commercial flop: the Airbus A330-800neo.

The plane continues to fly than its sister, the A330-900NEO, but it has a higher fuel consumption per seat and bears fewer passengers-which reduces potential profits.

Why the A330-800NEO is so unpopular

Only three airlines operate the aircraft: Air Greenland, Kuwait Airways and Uganda Airlines. This year it will fly to a new city.

From May 18, Uganda Airlines will start A330-800Neo flights between Enebbe and London Gatwick Airport four times a week. The two countries will connect non -stop for the first time since 2015.

This is the first time that London has welcomed the plane since September 2023. People who want to experience the Ultra-Set Airplane can climb it this year in about three dozen cities worldwide.

Data from the aviation analytics company Cirium show that only about 4600 A330-800NEO flights are planned for 2025, around 450 more than 2024. Here are all the routes that the A330-800neo will fly this year. Kuwait, the first customer of the aircraft in 2020, is the largest operator.

From November 2024, Nuuk will be a new city for the A330-800NEO. Air Greenland - the smaller operator of the aircraft - started long -haul flights from the country's capital after the airport built a larger runway.

The airline's A330-800NEO route to Reykjavik is also new in 2025, but will only carry out two return flights, one in June and one in August. The route is otherwise operated with Boeing 737-800 and de Havilland Dash.

Kuala Lumpur is a recurring route for Kuwait, which last flew into the city in October 2023. Kuwait will not fly his A330-800NEO 2025 to Bangkok, as last year, but will replace the route for the larger Boeing 777-300s.

Some of Kuwait's routes will only carry out a few return flights in April, including Lahore and Islamabad in Pakistan as well as to Tbilisi, Georgia. Munich will fly twice in June.

Kuwait's service according to Ahmedabad, India, and Maschhad, Iran, were left out of the card. Because these are individual return flights that were already carried out in February and March.

The United States is a large market that is missing in the global A330-800NEO network. Kuwait recently flew the aircraft to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York in October 2023, but has since exchanged the plane for Boeing 777-300.

Why the A330-800NEO is so unpopular

The A330-800NEO was built as a long-distance version of the A330-900NEO and flies about 1600 kilometers further than its sister plane. The range should be the main sales argument. But it was not enough to compensate for the less favorable size and costs.

The A330-800NEO can transport up to 406 people compared to up to 465 passengers in the A330-900NEO. Both will be powered by the next generations of the Rolls Royce Trent 7000 engines, which consume 25 percent less fuel than older A330.

The reduced size and the supplementary efficiency of the A330-800neo could appear attractive on routes with less demand and a great deal. But the costs per seat are higher because the plane promotes fewer people, while it still bears the same structural components and engines as the A330-900NEO.

The capacity of the A330-900NEO enables more sales potential, especially since the larger cabin can absorb more high-priced business or first class seats. In addition, the range of the A330-900NEO of 8,300 miles (13,357 kilometers) is already suitable for the needs of the airlines.

The unfavorable economy of the A330-800NEO made it the worst-selling aircraft from Airbus. Air Greenland has one, Kuwait Airways has four and Uganda Airlines has two. A united private operator bought a unit in 2023.

However, Garuda Indonesia canceled its purchase agreement for four A330-800NEOS in October and reduced the aircraft's net betting to just eight over eleven years.

The A330-900NEO received almost 400 orders in the same period and showed Cirium data that it will carry out around 82,000 planned flights in 2025.

Nobody has ordered the A330-800NEO for almost two years, although the cheaper price of $ 260 million (239 million euros) could help compensate for the higher operating costs. The sister aircraft costs almost $ 300 million (just under 276 million euros).

However, it remains unclear whether Airbus will finally give up the project or keep it as an option because it has invested in the plane and may not want these efforts to be wasted.

He has successfully advised more than 400 transactions. Saxenhammer / Getty Images

M&A is the supreme discipline in the financial sector - highly complex deals, strategic decisions and negotiations at the highest level. But what does it take to be successful in this demanding industry? In this text, M&A consultant Christian Saxenhammer shares his experiences and gives valuable insights into how you can get started with M&A, which skills really count and how you can secure a place in the leading consulting houses in the long term. M&A is considered the most demanding discipline in the financial sector that not only requires analytical skills, but also strategic thinking and negotiation skills, says Christian Saxenhammer. The former investment banker is the founder and managing director of the M&A-Boutique Saxenhammer. He has successfully advised more than 400 transactions. Success in M&A depends less on numbers alone, but also on soft skills such as empathy and communication skills in order to successfully complete deals.

""Mergers & Acquisitions"" (M&A) is considered the royal discipline in the financial sector - high deals of deal, complex negotiations and the direct influence on corporate strategies make them one of the most exciting and demanding career paths in the financial sector.

But how does it come about? What skills are required? And what do young talents have to bring to be successful in the long term?

No job for everyone - my entry into M&A

At the age of 21 I sold our family business - an experience that not only changed my life, but also revealed my calling. I was confronted early with complex negotiations, strategic decisions and the dynamics of deal making.

The M&A industry is not a 9-to-5 job Christian Saxenhammer

Since then I know: M&A is not a profession, but a passion - but not for everyone.

Success in this area requires much more than analytical excellence. Strategic thinking, negotiation skills and entrepreneurship are essential.

The industry is not a 9-to-5 job-it requires high use, resilience and a tireless drive. If you want to successfully complete deals, you not only have to analyze numbers, but also convince investors and entrepreneurs.

The underestimated success factor: mentors and learning-by-thoing

In M&A there are no classic school books that prepare for every situation. Theoretical knowledge is important, but the true learning curve only begins when you are in the middle of complex deals. It is therefore crucial to find a mentor or sparring partner early, which reports from his own experience.

In my career, I benefited enormously from working with experienced dealmakers that not only gave me technical skills, but also the art of negotiating.

https://businessinsider.com,I was in space with Blue Origin - I now look at life differently,https://www.businessinsider.de/wirtschaft/ich-war-mit-blue-origin-im-weltall-ich-blicke-nun-anders-auf-das-leben/,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 10:30:52 GMT","Inkhouse

The technologist Lane Bess looks back on his two space travel with Blue Origin. Bess said that every trip has renewed its meaning for the essentials in life. He called for more visionary investments in space technology and research.

This is a conversation with the veteran of the technology sector Lane Bess. He founded Bess Ventures and is CEO of Deep Instinct, a cyber security company based on Deep Learning. He is also the chairman of Blaize Ai, former CEO of Palo Alto Networks and former COO of ZSCALER. He has no financial connections to Blue Origin.

I have been in space twice in the past three years. Every time I returned with a new awareness of the essentials in life.

My first flight took place in December 2021, my second last February. Every flight only lasted 10 minutes, but the earth looks completely different when you start and when you land.

This time I came back with some questions about the condition of our world. The war has escalated since my first trip. At that time I thought - and still thinking today - that the only limit for what humanity can achieve is our ability to get along.

What I see instead is a hunger for power, a changed perspective of people on politics and people who jeopardize the founding ideas of our constitutional forefathers for things that only favor one country to another.

US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese head of state Xi Jinping should not be the only three people in the world who have a say in how the rest of humanity lives his life.

All of this could think that we should look for a different place, because we will screw it up. We won't colonize Mars so soon, but maybe we have to start with it now.

A lifelong curiosity

I have been fascinated by rockets since childhood. Before I was a teenager, I went to the local craft shop -where I had to lie over my age -to buy these model missile engines (which of course were flammable). I then shared this passion with my son Cameron, who also accompanied me on my first space.

Years later it was also possible for civilians to fly into space. Fortunately, I had left my former cybersecurity companies Palo Alto Networks and Zscaler with great success at this point, so I could afford to offer an auction for a seat at Blue Origin. I also dealt with my family office, Bess Ventures, with investments in space technology.

In 2021, shortly before Thanksgiving, the director for the company and civilian sales of Blue Origin contacted me to attend the third flight. In January of this year I was contacted again when a place for the tenth flight was released.

I can't say exactly how much my last trip cost, but it was a millions. It is clear that my five fellow travelers also achieved a good financial result in life. Richard Scott is a reproduction endocrinologist who sold his company for reproductive medicine, Ivirma, to which private equity company KKR. Elaine Chia Hyde, a physicist, pilot and founder of the media company Chicago Star and the only woman on the trip, had saved it for years to do this.

Before departure, we spent about two and a half days in the classroom. Unlike astronauts who prepare for longer orbital trips, we did not spent time to train in a centrifuge or swim in a tank to understand the weightlessness. This was more about getting to know the technology behind the rocket so that you know how safe it is. However, you can get out of up to two and a half minutes before pulling the landing bridges.

Before the start, we climb into the capsule of the rocket provided for the crew. You don't feel much in the first five to seven seconds because the engine lights. You have earplugs to dampen the sound of the engine, but you still hear a loud knock. Then the capsule is thrown into the air.

In two and a half minutes you cross the Kármán line and realize how thin and fragile the earth's atmosphere is. At that time you are also weightless. I used my GoPro to take the view.

The climb is gentle, but the descent can be bumpy. With such a high gravity acceleration, you are pulled into the seat that you can no longer move - let alone inhale deeply.

After landing, we were received by our families. We encountered champagne and noticed that we were one of a few hundred civilians who had ventured into space.

Billionaires for space travel

I had my first contacts with Jeff Bezos' company Amazon in the nineties when I set up the AT&T internet business as a product manager and Amazon introduced the online sale of books.

I would not say that we are close friends, but I know him well enough to be able to say that his commitment to space and science is sincere. On his ranch he once told me that he felt blessed that he had generated so much wealth with his business that he could really think about things that most people would simply not think about.

There are thousands of billionaires in the world, but only about a dozen who put their money into really future -oriented things. I think every generation needs some of them.",businessinsider
https://businessinsider.com,Apple: iPhone customers are waiting for Siri update-and complain now,https://www.businessinsider.de/wirtschaft/apple-iphone-kunden-warten-auf-siri-update-und-klagen-jetzt/,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 09:55:23 GMT","From the point of view of some collectors, Apple promised AI tools and not delivered. AP Photo/Ted Shafrey

A Californian law firm sues the Tech Group Apple because the smartphone manufacturer delays the launch of its announced AI functions. The lawsuit said that Apple had deceived the buyers with the promised but not yet delivered features. In March, the company announced that the AI ​​improvements of its assistant Siri are still waiting.

In September last year, Apple had advertised his iPhone 16 with a new Siri update. In March, the company admitted delays in the delivery of artificial intelligence (AI) - and is now exposed to a lawsuit. The accusation: Apple made false promises and deceived customers.

On Wednesday, the law firm Clarkson based in Malibu, based in Malibu California, submitted to the US district court in San Jose for unfair competition. ""The consumers are enthusiastic about artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, this meant that Big Tech promised too much and delivered too little,"" said Timothy Giordano, partner of the law firm Clarkson, in a statement for business insider (BI).

According to the collective suit of numerous iPhone 16-owners, customers are disappointed. Apple ""exploited consumers' desire for the latest software and functions for artificial intelligence on their telephones"" and not delivered all Apple Intelligence tools that it had announced before the iPhone 16 was released. ""

Apple advertises with the first AI-iPhone-and remains behind expectations

Since the market launch in September, the Tech-Riese has been promoting the iPhone 16 as the first of its kind that is “built for artificial intelligence”. The so -called Apple Intelligence is an integral part of the advertising for the device. The technology is only available for the iPhone 15 Pro- or newer models. The iPhone 16 product series begins in Germany at 949 euros.

In a rare step, however, Apple announced at the beginning of the month that Siri's planned AI upgrade should only be there later than expected. The company had demonstrated its update months before the latest iPhone was published. The plaintiffs refer to a commercial from September. In it, the actress Bella Ramsey uses a more personalized Siri version.

Now the company is confronted with the accusation that it has ""exaggerated the AI ​​skills. In addition, it has left consumers in the belief that they would buy a device with functions that did not exist or were essentially presented,"" says the application.

The Tech-Riese demonstrated its Apple Intelligence months before the latest iPhone was published at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June. At that time, Apple presented a AI-controlled iPhone with tools for writing and editing photos, among other Genai functions that were supposed to appear in autumn. Apple Intelligence was introduced in October a month after the iPhone 16 came onto the market.

iPhone 16 with Ki-Siri: Apple wants to catch up with the competition-and exchange personal details

The company is aiming to equate Google, Meta and Microsoft with the AI ​​competition. This wants to boost iPhone sales. However, criticism of the previous results and questions about future developments are not new.

The analyst Benedict Evans, for example, states in a blog post. In it he writes that Apple was always reliable when it came to the launch of upcoming functions. The company will only present new products if they are also delivered. ""It never misses such appointments."" If Apple had now acted according to this pattern, it would have met its goals and the user could already use the AI ​​today.

The news agency ""Bloomberg"" reported on Wednesday of a change in staff in the Apple AI department. Accordingly, Mike Rockwell, the co-inventor of the VR glasses Vision Pro, the previous director, John Giannandrea, replaces Siri development.

Apple did not react immediately to our request.

Probably the current lawsuit is not enough to damage the Apple share. But Forrester analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee sees the company in the bredouille. In a statement for BI, he sees a ""threat to the market value of Apple"", which is unable to deliver a AI-supported Siri program in good time. Apple could no longer hide because the GEMAI chatbots of the competitors are already in use, he said.

https://businessinsider.com,Ex-Waymo-CEO: Teslas Robotaxis haben keine Chance gegen Waymo,https://www.businessinsider.de/wirtschaft/ex-waymo-ceo-teslas-robotaxis-haben-keine-chance-gegen-waymo/,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 09:42:30 GMT","Der ehemalige Waymo-CEO John Krafcik erklärte gegenüber Business Insider, dass Waymo im Bereich der Robotertaxis keine Konkurrenten hat, die mit der Größe, Sicherheit und Leistung des Unternehmens mithalten können. Sean Gallup/Getty Images

Der ehemalige Waymo-CEO John Krafcik sagte Business Insider, dass Waymo derzeit keine Konkurrenten habe. Er kritisierte erneut Teslas Kamera-Ansatz für autonomes Fahren. Krafcik sagte auch, dass andere Unternehmen in den USA und China noch hinter Waymo zurückliegen.

Im Jahr 2021, als John Krafcik sich dem Ende seiner Karriere bei Alphabet’s Waymo näherte, wies der CEO Tesla als ernsthaften Konkurrenten im Robotaxi-Wettbewerb zurück. Er bezeichnete Elon Musks Elektrofahrzeugunternehmen als einen Automobilhersteller mit einem „wirklich guten Fahrerassistenzsystem“.

Vier Jahre später bleibt seine Haltung unverändert.

„Tesla strebt seit fast zehn Jahren an, mit Waymo zu konkurrieren, aber sie tun es immer noch nicht“, sagte Krafcik in einer E-Mail-Korrespondenz mit Business Insider (BI). „Sie sind ein Automobilunternehmen mit einem Fahrerassistenzsystem. Sie haben noch keine einzige vollständig autonome, umsatzgenerierende Fahrt geliefert, etwas, das Waymo bereits eine Million Mal im Monat tut.“

Vergangenes Jahr machte Tesla eine auffällige Demonstration seines Robotaxi-Prototyps, Cybercab, einem flachen Coupé ohne Lenkrad, das zwei Passagiere transportieren kann, zusammen mit einem retrofuturistischen, selbstfahrenden Van. Die Wall Street war nicht beeindruckt und auch Krafcik nicht.

„Wenn ein Unternehmen ernsthaft ein sicheres und zugängliches Robotaxi-Geschäft aufbauen wollte, würde es nichts wie das Gezeigte aussehen“, sagte Krafcik im BI-Interview nach der Enthüllung des Cybercab im Oktober.

Krafcik bleibt hochkritisch gegenüber Teslas Robotaxi-Träumen.

In der Branche gibt es viele Stimmen, die sagen, dass sichere und zuverlässige autonome Fahrzeuge Lidar-Sensoren und Kameras benötigen, um ihre Umgebung zu navigieren.

Tesla und sein CEO hingegen setzen auf Kameras allein. Sie hoffen einen autonomen Fahrer einsetzen zu können, ohne die Kosten für die Anbringung von Lidar-Sensoren.

Doch Krafcik weist das Kostenargument zurück.

„Die Kosten für ein robustes Sensorset, einschließlich Lidar, sind auf einer Pro-Meile-Basis trivial. Noch mehr für die Kartierung“, schrieb er. „Und die Sicherheitsvorteile, gemessen an der Reduzierung menschlicher Schäden, sind real und nachweisbar.“

Ein Sprecher von Tesla antwortete nicht auf eine Anfrage zur Stellungnahme.

Der Robotaxi-Wettbewerb

Der ehemalige Waymo-CEO hatte Unternehmen im April 2021 aus nicht näher genannten Gründen verlassen und sitzt jetzt im Vorstand von Rivian. Er glaubt, dass Waymo im Bereich autonomer Fahrdienste weit voraus ist, auch wenn Unternehmen in den USA und China ihre eigenen Robotaxis einsetzen.

Baidus Apollo Go sagte, das Unternehmen habe im vierten Quartal 2024 etwa 1,1 Millionen Fahrten in China gemacht. Zoox, eine Tochtergesellschaft von Amazon, testet weiterhin in San Francisco und Las Vegas. Es plant, den öffentlichen Betrieb in diesen Städten später in diesem Jahr zu starten. Musk hat ebenfalls versprochen, bis Juni vollständig autonome Fahrten in Austin anzubieten.

Waymo sagte, es biete mehr als 200.000 Fahrten pro Woche in seinen Betriebsstädten Los Angeles, Phoenix und San Francisco an. Der Fahrdienst expandiert weiterhin in den USA und hat mit begrenzten Tests in Tokio begonnen.

„Im Moment hat Waymo keine Konkurrenz“, sagte Krafcik, der zuvor auch Hyundai Motor America als CEO leitete.

„Große Hoffnungen“

Krafcik sagte, er sei am meisten beeindruckt von Waymos Fortschritten in Bezug auf Skalierung, Sicherheit und Leistung. Deshalb glaubt er, dass Waymo für mindestens die nächsten drei bis fünf Jahre vorne bleiben wird.

„Sie sind das einzige Unternehmen weltweit, das erfolgreich einen verkörperten KI-Ersatz für einen lizenzierten menschlichen Fahrer einsetzt, der in jedes Fahrzeug integriert werden kann – und dies in großem Maßstab mit Drittanbieterdaten, die signifikante Leistungs- und Sicherheitsvorteile gegenüber menschlichen Fahrern bestätigen“, sagte Krafcik.

Ein Sprecher von Waymo antwortete nicht auf eine Anfrage zur Stellungnahme.

Über Zoox sagte Krafcik, er habe „große Hoffnungen“ und schätze „die Sorgfalt, die sie walten lassen, um auf den Markt zu kommen“. Trotzdem sei der Betrieb des Amazon-Unternehmens im Robotaxi-Bereich auf einer kleineren Skala, die eher mit Waymo im Jahr 2018 vergleichbar sei, sagte er.

Über chinesische Konkurrenten nannte Krafcik keine spezifischen Unternehmen. Trotzdem, sagte er BI, sei er skeptisch, dass ihre autonomen Fahrer so gut wie die von Waymo seien, da sie es nicht geschafft hätten, einen Robotaxi-Dienst in den USA zu starten. Zum Beispiel wurde Pony.ai, einem chinesischen Startup, im Mai 2022 wegen mehreren Fahrverstößen die Kalifornien-Genehmigung von der Abteilung für Kraftfahrzeuge entzogen.

Sprecher von Zoox und Pony.ai antworteten nicht auf eine Anfrage zur Stellungnahme.

Die positive Perspektive für Waymo

Der Nordstern für Waymo wird nicht nur ein eigenständiger Fahrdienst sein, sagte Krafcik. Der Ex-Waymo-CEO fügte hinzu, dass er sich vorstellt, dass das Unternehmen einen Abonnementdienst für einen „garantierten Zugang zum Waymo-Fahrer“ und autonome Fahrsoftware anbieten wird, die in großen Lastwagen und privaten Fahrzeugen eingesetzt werden kann.

Einige Analysten erwarten einen Waymo-Börsengang und eine Abspaltung von Alphabet, da das Geschäft voranschreitet.

Gene Munster von Deepwater Asset Management schrieb im November, dass Waymo innerhalb von zwei bis vier Jahren aus Alphabet ausgegliedert werden könne. Bis 2030 könne es möglicherweise mit 350 Milliarden bis 850 Milliarden US-Dollar bewertet werden.

Krafcik, der Waymos Abspaltung in eine unabhängige Tochtergesellschaft von Alphabet im Jahr 2016 überwachte, sagte: „Es gibt keinen Grund zur Eile.“

„Waymo hat eine tiefe, intelligente Gruppe geduldiger Investoren“, sagte er. „Es gibt keinen Grund zur Eile – sie sind nicht wie die anderen Möchtegern-AV-Unternehmen, die öffentliche Märkte anzapfen, um schnell Geld zu bekommen, um zu überleben. Die meisten dieser Unternehmen haben nicht die Technologie, um ihre Versprechen zu erfüllen, und werden scheitern.“",businessinsider

Paul Schockemöhle is a successful German entrepreneur.

He founded a logistics company in 1966 and became the important horse retailer with thousands of horses.

Shockemöhle shapes equestrian sports and builds up a diverse company portfolio.

From farmers' son to the showcase world-and large entrepreneurs with thousands of horses and millions in the account: Paul Schockemöhle made it.

On March 22nd, the man from the Steinfeld Lower Saxony celebrates his 80th birthday. We introduce it to you.

Studied broken off, career as an egg breeder started

Growing up at an agricultural business in Steinfeld, Oldenburg, Schockemöhle showed his entrepreneur early. As a teenager, he began to act with eggs.

Although he started studying business administration, he broke it off after four semesters. In 1966 he founded his own logistics company, which is now one of the largest freight forwarders in Germany.

The way to the top of the world in equestrian sports

His career as a show jumper began in the 1960s. Shockemöhle developed a place at the top of the international equestrian world and was considered a strategic thinker in the saddle. He was particularly well -known with his parade horse Deister and dominated international equestrian sports over a decade.

Overview of success:

Three European champions in jumping riding (1981, 1983, 1985)

Olympic silver 1976 (Montreal), Bronze 1984 (Los Angeles)

Six German championship titles

Triple winner of the Aachen Grand Prize

I also want to have 1000 properties at 35 - that's how I proceed for it

From the rider to a horse dealer

After his active riding career, Schockemöhle also became known as a horse dealer. He founded several stems in Mühlen (Lower Saxony) and Lewitz (Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania). Around 7,000 horses are said to be there today.

In 2010 he caused a stir internationally: the dressage miracle horse Totilas bought shockemöhle-according to estimates for around 10 million euros.

The breeding licenses were a lucrative business: the top tax was initially 8,000 euros. The cover tax is the remuneration that the owner of the female horse (mare) pays for the ceiling to the owner of the male horse (stallion).

Totilas died of a colic in 2020 at the age of 20. The life and career of the horse and his riders have always been controversial among critics of the equestrian sport, but still symbolize fascination and dark sides of dressage.

Entrepreneur with a foresight

Shockemöhle was not limited to horses alone. He built up a wide -ranging company portfolio early on, which includes freight forwarders, logistics, feed production, real estate and renewable energies.

There were also marketing companies and international auctions such as the ""PSI"", which is considered one of the most renowned horse auctions worldwide. Every year, top-class dressage and show jumping horses are auctioned, which are predestined for international sports successes. The 45th auction in 2024 achieved a total proceeds of almost 20 million euros. Individual horses are said to have reached prices of up to 1.6 million euros.

https://businessinsider.com,After this one question in the interview you should go,https://www.businessinsider.de/karriere/nach-dieser-frage-im-bewerbungsgespraech-solltet-ihr-sofort-aufstehen-und-gehen/,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 07:06:34 GMT","This question in the interview is a warning signal, says Kristine Capek. Getty Images / Olga Rolenko, Collage: Business Insider

According to the personnel consultant Kristine Capek, the key to a successful job interview in competence -based questions, which enable a precise assessment. The question ""Why should we hire you?"" On the other hand, put the applicants under unnecessary pressure. ""The application process is no longer just about a one -sided assessment - rather about getting to know each other at eye level."" Instead of pushing the applicants into a sales situation, companies should specifically ask about their motivation - for example: ""Why did you apply for this position?""

An interview can decide on the professional future - but often these conversations are anything but ideal. Companies present themselves in detail, applicants lose themselves in irrelevant details, and some questions have a daunting than effective.

Kristine Capek knows the typical stumbling blocks. As the founder and managing director of the personnel consultancy ""Ivies"", she has been teaching specialists in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry for over 15 years. She gives career tips on Tikkok as a ""dieheadhunter"". In an interview with Business Insider, she explains what really matters in a successful interview - and what questions should be deterrent.

How does an ideal interview work?

According to Kristine Capek, an ideal interview always starts with small talk. This creates a pleasant atmosphere and relaxes the situation. This is followed by a brief introduction to the company and Hiring management. ""But short and concise, because the focus is on the applicant, not the management or the team,"" emphasizes Capek.

Also read 6 psychological tricks to look more likeable in an interview

""When managers only present themselves for minutes, it is a clear red flag and says a lot about corporate culture."" Instead, the conversation should quickly pass to the applicants - this signal real interest on the part of the company.

The perfect self -presentation in the interview: neither too long nor too short

As an applicant, your self -presentation should take between five and ten minutes. No less, nothing more. You should leave out irrelevant details and concentrate on what is really important for the position, the personnel consultant advises. From the beginning, this creates a targeted connection between your own experience and the new position. However, reality often looks different. Capek knows: ""Many start with their Abitur - and lose their focus.""

Reading I also had over 1000 interviews - this one question should always ask applicants

However, this is not surprising that many companies vote for the first question to applicants very openly. You would say, for example: ""Tell something about yourself."" Instead, companies should target the interview and ask more specific questions. For example: ""Why did you apply for this position? What competencies do you bring with you that enable you for the job?"" The key to a successful interview? Competence -based questions.

Why competence -based questions are the key

For a successful interview, it is crucial that companies define in advance exactly which skills are required for the open position. ""For example, if negotiation skills are required, one could specifically ask for experience with difficult negotiations,"" explains Capek. Applicants could specifically explain how they have already used this competence.

As an applicant, on the other hand, you should not only worship past positions. Focus on the skills and strengths you have developed in previous roles and what added value you could offer in your potentially new role.

This question is a red flag in an interview: ""Why should we hire you?""

Not every question in the interview makes sense - some could (and should) even put off applicants according to the expert. One of them: ""Why should we hire them?"" This question is often asked from above, with the unspoken message: convince us first. The application process is no longer just about a one -sided assessment - rather about getting to know each other at eye level.

Reading you also ask no questions in the interview? Why this is a mistake according to HR and which you should at least make

Capek advises companies to formulate the question differently in order to put the applicants less under pressure. For example: ""Why did you apply for this position?"" This question rather aims at what applicants interested in the position and the company. Unlike the other question, it is not about how well someone can sell. Rather, it is about finding out how well someone is suitable for the open position.

This is how you react confidently to problematic questions in the interview

In one of her Tikok videos, Capek says: ""If you as an applicant are asked, why you should be set, then pack your things together and take a tear.""

But if that is too dramatic for you, for example, you can answer instead: ""I was invited because my qualifications fit the position. I would be happy to explain again which skills I bring with me and how I can bring them in.""

At the moment, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ 5G is even cheaper than recently in the Aldi deal. The cheapest provider sells it just from 160 euros, which corresponds to a saving of almost 30 euros compared to the discounter offer.

What does the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ 5G offer?

The tablet can also be worthwhile from a technical point of view. This is primarily due to his 5G mobile phone reception, which enables him to be used without any restrictions even on the go without any restrictions. A separate SIM card with a mobile phone tariff is required for this, but the option on mobile data alone is a real advantage. This applies in particular to tablets of this price range, which can usually not establish a mobile data connection.

Another advantage of the Samsung Galaxy tablet from the offer is its large eleven-inch display. It offers a resolution of 1920 by 1200 pixels and the good refresh rate 90 Hertz. The Octa Core processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 695, which is in midfield, ensures the necessary power (which is also fair given the RRP for the A9+ 5G).

One disadvantage is the manageable memory. The tablet comes with only 64 gigabytes of memory. Users who want to save many photos, videos, films, series sequences, songs or podcasts could quickly reach their limits. Fortunately, the memory can be expanded to up to a terabyte via a microStM card. However, the memory card is not included. The memory upgrade costs extra.

Finally, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ 5G scores with its battery. A capacity of 7040 milliampers' hours means a reliable term, even on the go without a socket and with mobile data.

Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ in the Aldi deal: for whom is the 5G tablet vicular?

If discounters like Aldi Tablets sell, it is often an entry -level models for more undemanding users. The Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ 5G does not fall into this category. It is also not a premium tablet like the iPad Pro or the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra, but it is a solid mid-range model with some practical functions. Above all, this includes 5G connectivity, which enables maximum flexibility. Otherwise, the tablet scores with equipment that should be more than sufficient for most users in everyday life.

As always: only if you want to use the tablet for detailed mobile games, professional image processing and Co. With the A9+ 5G, everyone else makes an excellent choice at a very fair price.

https://cnbc.com,Oppenheimer's best stock picks heading into April,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/23/oppenheimers-best-stock-picks-heading-into-april.html,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Oppenheimer's research group has a fresh list of top stock ideas that it expects to outperform over the coming year based on each company's fundamentals and ""in the context of current market conditions."" It's getting harder for investors to find upward momentum as stocks pull back amid trade and tariff tensions, recession fears and a shrinking market for technology shares. The S & P 500 edged up 0.4% last week, snapping a four-week decline. The Nasdaq Composite managed a 0.2% advance, also ending a four-week-long slide, while the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.1% after dropping in each of the prior two weeks. Against this backdrop, Oppenheimer asked its analysts to choose one stock from within their fields of expertise that they expect to do well, with each one rated outperform by the firm. The resulting list was described as ""a menu, not a portfolio."" Take a look at some of the names below: Costco has tumbled about 13.3% this month after the wholesale retailer posted fiscal second-quarter results whose earnings missed analyst estimates while revenue topped expectations thanks to rising same-store sales. The weakness hasn't shaken Oppenheimer, which has a price target on the stock that implies 24% potential upside from Friday's close. ""We look very favorably upon COST's [long-term] prospects,"" analyst Rupesh Parikh said about the wholesale club. He highlighted Costco's ""unique and improving consumer value proposition,"" global growth prospects, strong management team and potential for sustainable top- and bottom-line performance against a more competitive retail backdrop. Shake Shack is another stock that has recently been hit hard, down 17% in March, but that remains an Oppenheimer favorite. The research firm reiterated the burger chain as a ""top pick"" for this year, staying bullish on Shake Shack's earnings and same store sales growth. Shake Shack's fourth-quarter revenue rose 14.8% year-over-year as the company opened 19 company-operated locations and nine licensed restaurants in the three-month period. ""We believe new management's strategy remains a key catalyst for a brand with unused sales/margin levers,"" analysts Mike Tamas and Brian Bittner said of Shake Shack, whose shares have tumbled 30% in 2025. SHAK 1Y mountain Shake Shack over the past year. Oppenheimer also recommends AppLovin in the current market. The mobile app company's stock price has soared by 337% over the past year, but has struggled lately, slumping 24.4% in the past month. The latest retreat could serve as an opportunity to buy the shares, with analyst Martin Yang writing that ""AppLovin's growing scale and broadening customer base continue to improve its core product performance, which will accelerate its market penetration and [market] share gain."" Other stocks included in Oppenheimer's outperform-rated picks included Life Time Group , Visa and Monolithic Power Systems . Monolithic, one of the company's semiconductor favorites, is set up to outperform its peers with ""both an improving margin profile and an accelerating top-line outlook,"" according to the Wall Street investment bank.",cnbc
https://cnbc.com,Chuck Schumer rejects calls to step down as Senate Democratic leader,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/23/chuck-schumer-rejects-calls-to-step-down-as-senate-democratic-leader.html,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, speaks at a press event at the site of the first January 6, 2021 break in during the certification of the 2020 election at the Capitol in Washington, DC, on Jan. 6, 2024.

WASHINGTON — A defiant Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer vowed that he won't step aside as the chamber's top Democrat, rejecting calls from some House colleagues and liberal advocates critical of his move to help pass a Republican funding bill.

""Look, I'm not stepping down,"" Schumer said in a pretaped interview that aired Sunday on NBC News' ""Meet the Press.""

Schumer told moderator Kristen Welker he knew there ""would be a lot of controversy"" when he cast his vote to prevent a shutdown. But he maintains that while the GOP's six-month bill was ""certainly bad,"" a shutdown ""would be 15 or 20 times worse.""

""Under a shutdown, the executive branch has sole power to determine what is 'essential.' And they can determine without any court supervision. The courts have ruled it's solely up to the executive what to shut down,"" he said, warning that the Trump administration ""would eviscerate the federal government.""

""On Day 2, they could say, 'Oh, SNAP? Feeding hungry children? Not essential.' On Day 4, 'Mass transit? All transit? Aid to the states? Not essential. We're cutting it.' On Day 6, 'Medicaid? We'll cut that by 20%, 30%, 50%, 80%. We'll go after Social Security. We'll go after the veterans.' Their goal is to just eviscerate the federal government so they can give more taxes, and their tax cuts ... to their billionaire class over there,"" he said.

""Sometimes when you're a leader, you have to do things to avoid a real danger that might come down the curve. And I did it out of pure conviction as to what a leader should do and what the right thing for America and my party was. People disagree.""

It's up to Democratic senators to choose their leader, and none of them have called on Schumer to quit a post that he has held for more than eight years. But some have entertained questions about whether it's time for a re-examination. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., told a constituent at a town hall last week that ""we're going to have future conversations about all the Democratic leadership.""

Schumer also rejected comparisons to then-President Joe Biden's refusal to step down as the 2024 nominee, in response to a question about whether he's making the same mistake.

""No, absolutely not. I did this out of conviction. And, look, in my caucus, we have a disagreement as to, you know, some people voted one way, some people voted the other. But we've all agreed to respect each other because each side saw why the other side felt so strongly about it. And our caucus is united in fighting Donald Trump every step of the way,"" Schumer said.

He responded to a suggestion from former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., that the Senate Democrats who voted to break a filibuster gave their votes without getting anything. ""What we got, at the end of the day, is avoiding the horror of a shutdown,"" Schumer said.

Schumer said President Donald Trump has put the U.S. in a constitutional crisis as he escalates attacks on the judiciary and faces allegations from judges that he defied court orders.

""Look, this is an extraordinary moment. It does require extraordinary action. If he defies the Supreme Court, then we are in uncharted territory that we haven't been in for a very long time, and our entire democracy, this whole beautiful enterprise of democracy that we've had for over 240 years, is at risk. And look, I believe that if Donald Trump should defy the courts, the public will rise up,"" he said. ""Democrats will fight it in every single way.""

Schumer also discussed his new book ""Antisemitism in America: A Warning"" during the interview, saying he wrote it because he's concerned that antisemitism is on the rise again.

""I aimed it at both the hard right, and we've seen how viciously antisemitic they could be, but also at the hard left. I felt, as a progressive, I could talk to them about how some of their anti-Israel activity — I might disagree with it, but they're certainly entitled to do it, and it is not antisemitic — has been sliding over into direct antisemitism,"" Schumer said. ""I would like all of America to read this. So I hope it will be reading in colleges and in high schools to learn, teach people the history. ... I believe the best antidote to antisemitism is education.""

Schumer, who is the highest-ranking Jewish elected official in the United States, said it's ""possible"" there will be a Jewish president in his lifetime, because ""glass ceilings are broken every day.""",cnbc
https://cnbc.com,Pope Francis returns to Vatican after five weeks in hospital,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/23/pope-francis-makes-first-public-appearance-in-five-weeks-as-he-leaves-hospital.html,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Pope Francis waves during his first public appearance in five weeks, on the day he is set to be discharged from Gemelli Hospital, in Rome, Italy, on March 23, 2025.

Pope Francis returned to the Vatican on Sunday after surviving a five-week battle in hospital against double pneumonia that became the most serious health crisis of his 12-year papacy.

The 88-year-old pope, who also made his first public appearance since February 14 before being discharged from Rome's Gemelli hospital, left the facility shortly after noon.

A car carrying the pontiff was accompanied by police vehicles through Rome, making a short detour to take flowers to the Basilica of Saint Mary Major, a church to which Francis has a special devotion and visits frequently.

Though the pope has returned from hospital, his doctors have said it would still take ""a lot of time"" for his ageing body to heal fully.

They have prescribed a further two months of rest at the Vatican and told him to avoid large or stressful meetings, leaving unclear how much activity Francis will undertake in the coming months.

Just before leaving the hospital on Sunday, Francis smiled and waved at a group of well-wishers gathered outside. He used a wheelchair, as he has done for several years.

His face looked swollen, and bandages were visible on both arms underneath his white cassock during the appearance, which lasted only a few moments.

He spoke briefly, with a feeble voice, to thank 79-year-old Carmela Vittoria Mancuso in the crowd below. Mancuso, who visited the hospital each day during the pope's treatment, had brought yellow flowers for him. She told Reuters afterward that her heart ""was bursting"" when the pope noticed her.

Francis had only been seen by the public once before during his hospital stay, in a photo the Vatican released last week, showing the pontiff at prayer in a hospital chapel.

The pope, who has been receiving oxygen to help him breathe throughout his hospital stay, was breathing on his own during the public appearance. But he was seen using a small hose under his nose for oxygen while traveling in his car.

In the moments before the pontiff's appearance on Sunday, the crowd of hundreds of well-wishers called out for him, chanting ""Francis, Francis, Francis"".",cnbc
https://cnbc.com,"5 years into the remote work boom, the return-to-office push is stronger than ever—here's why",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/23/5-years-into-the-remote-work-boom-the-return-to-office-push-is-stronger-than-everheres-why.html,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","The Covid-19 pandemic ushered in a new way of working remotely, but even companies that initially championed the model are changing their tune. In recent months, staffers across corporate America, from Amazon to Dell to Walmart, as well as federal government workers, have been told that their days of working remotely are over — at least, with that employer. Instead, select employees have been called back into offices five days a week, a reversal of conversations in 2020 that touted remote and hybrid options as the future of work. But those who've come to appreciate the newfound flexibility aren't giving it up easily. While remote job opportunities are down, the competition to land one is fierce: Just 20% of LinkedIn postings are for remote or hybrid jobs, but they're getting 60% of applications on the platform. And nearly half of employees who work remotely at least some of the time say they'd be unlikely to stay at their job if they were called back to their offices full time, according to data from BambooHR. If employees do choose to stay, some rebel against the mandates by only making brief appearances in the office, also known as coffee badging. Or they may stay but be less engaged in their work, which translates to lower productivity and performance. In the now five-year debate between remote work and returning to offices, what can people expect next?

Why you're seeing more RTO announcements

Bosses have a few reasons why they'd like to get employees back into offices. One is to make use of expensive corporate real estate, says Kory Kantenga, LinkedIn's head of Americas economist. Some leaders may choose to default to how work has been done in the past and ""think that workers are possibly more productive in the office,"" Kantenga adds. ""Productivity translates to profits."" Indeed, a 2024 study of S&P 500 firms found businesses were more likely to mandate RTO after their stock prices dipped, hoping that in-office time would spur productivity and therefore boost the bottom line. Certain types of leaders are more likely to want people back in offices, says Mark Ma, an associate business professor at the University of Pittsburgh who led the research. ""We found return-to-office mandates are more likely in firms with male and powerful CEOs,"" Ma says. ""They are used to working in the office for five days a week. And they feel that they are losing control over their employees who are working from home."" It's not surprising to see more RTO mandates take shape as power has shifted in the labor market, from employees during the Great Resignation back to employers in a new layoff environment.

We do find significant evidence that return-to-office mandates hurt employee job satisfaction. Mark Ma University of Pittsburgh associate business professor

It's basic economics: With new job creation and hiring down, employers have more job-seekers than they have open roles, and therefore less incentive to offer perks like flexible work. Meanwhile, some experts say companies are issuing RTO mandates as a so-called ""back channel layoff,"" where they hope the policy will drive people to quit. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in an employee town hall that this was not the goal of the tech giant's five-day RTO policy after its cloud boss Matt Garman said staffers who don't agree with the rule could leave.

How RTO really impacts a business

But are in-office workers more engaged and productive? The results are inconclusive. There isn't much firm research as to whether companies with a five-day in-office policy perform better as a business or on the stock market. ""But we do find significant evidence that return-to-office mandates hurt employee job satisfaction,"" Ma says. His research analyzed millions of Glassdoor job reviews among companies that issued RTO mandates. One correlation: Job satisfaction ratings dropped ""significantly."" And RTO led to higher turnover among certain staff including women, highly skilled and senior tenured employees — ""not the people you want to lose,"" Ma says. Companies with fresh RTO policies also took longer to hire new employees.

I was excited to get in there and just do some work in person with all my teammates. Clinton Stamper Amazon software engineer

Still, some workers welcome more in-office time, like Clinton Stamper, 29, an Amazon software engineer in Austin, Texas. Like many with desk jobs, he worked entirely remotely for three years during the pandemic, but felt disconnected from his colleagues. It also enabled his procrastination. In the office, though, ""You can have small conversations in an elevator. You can randomly run into leadership and do an elevator pitch of your idea,"" he says. Stamper says working from an office helps him stay focused and collaborate with his colleagues better. He acknowledges that remote work can be beneficial to others at a different life stage, like parents and caregivers, or those who have different working styles. Ultimately for him, ""I was excited to get in there and just do some work in person with all my teammates,"" Stamper says. Office workers can also boost the local economy and support small businesses located near corporate buildings. ""Food trucks, laundry services — there are a lot of businesses that depend on workers in the office,"" Kantenga says. ""And when workers are not in the office, these businesses don't do well.""

Will 5 days in-office return as the norm?

Professionals may be spending more time in offices today than they did in the last five years, but the spread of remote flexibility has left a permanent mark on the way work gets done, experts say. More than 1 in 4 paid workdays in the U.S. were done from home in 2024, up from just 1 in 14 from pre-pandemic days, according to data from WFH Research. Most companies with remote and hybrid policies don't intend to change them in the next 12 months, according to new survey findings from Stanford and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Ma agrees that hybrid is here to stay — he believes that big companies can afford to lose employees and candidates by scaling back on remote options, but smaller employers won't be able to follow suit. ""The smaller firms are actually providing talent flexibility as a way to attract talent from the bigger competitors,"" he says.

https://cnbc.com,"As Binance works toward redemption, CEO says Trump has been ‘fantastic’ for crypto",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/23/binance-ceo-says-trump-has-been-fantastic-for-cryptocurrency.html,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Richard Teng, chief executive officer of Binance Holdings Ltd., at an event hosted by the Foreign Correspondents Association in Singapore, on Tuesday, Sept. 17, 2024.

Binance CEO Richard Teng says the Trump administration has been a ""fantastic"" reset for the cryptocurrency industry.

""It's an extremely different environment that we're operating in,"" Teng told CNBC on Tuesday.

In the span of 16 months, Binance has gone from a political outcast to a possible power broker in Washington. Once the poster child for regulatory defiance – Binance was slapped with a record $4.3 billion settlement with regulators and forced to oust billionaire founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao – the crypto exchange is now navigating a dramatically friendlier political landscape under President Donald Trump's second administration, Teng said.

""We've benefited from this shift,"" said Teng, who was appointed Binance's CEO in November 2023.

Teng's comments come as the crypto exchange is in talks to have the Trump family take a financial stake in the company, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal earlier this month. That same day, Bloomberg reported that World Liberty Financial, a Trump-linked crypto bank that has not yet launched, is engaged in talks with Binance to launch a dollar-pegged stablecoin.

If such deals were reached, it would mark a staggering reversal for a company that was once a pariah in Washington.

Teng, a soft-spoken former regulator, was careful with his words when addressing the reports.

""I believe both World Liberty Financial as well as CZ himself have tweeted and denied the reports,"" said Teng, who runs the exchange's operations outside the U.S.

As for the rumors about a Trump stake in Binance.US, Teng demurred.

"".US and .com are quite different animals, right?"" he said. ""They have different sets of shareholders, different boards of directors, and different CEOs running the show.""

Binance structured the two exchanges as independent entities in response to regulatory scrutiny, aiming to ring-fence its U.S. operations from the broader international business.

Still, Teng is bullish on what the new political environment means for crypto.

""We went from four years of Operation Choke Point 2.0 to now – you have a very pro-crypto, pro-AI president,"" he said. While Binance.com doesn't operate in the U.S., he said, ""We have benefited from all these pro-crypto policies.""

Choke Point 2.0 is how industry insiders refer to an alleged crackdown by legacy banks on digital asset firms during the Biden administration.

Teng described a rapid global expansion that brought Binance from 170 million to 265 million users in just one year.

""We have received a lot of approaches from different governments around the world,"" Teng said, citing regulatory progress in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Brazil, Argentina and the United Arab Emirates.

Binance is now licensed in 21 jurisdictions, and its influence extends well beyond the reach of any one country. That includes sovereign wealth funds, some of which are starting to quietly allocate to crypto, Teng said.",cnbc

As the CEO of Wayfairer Travel, which plans six-figure luxury vacations and trips for Fortune 500 CEOs and ultra-wealthy clients, he's helped customers solve problems — from finding last-minute access to deluxe ski locales to getting travelers to their African safari after they accidentally boarded the wrong flight. Stevens himself is a seasoned traveler, having been to all seven continents and ""most major cities."" His experience helps him and his team make sure their clients have the best trip money can buy. And while the average cost of a Wayfairer Travel vacation is more than $30,000 — with some vacation packages clocking in at more than $200,000 — Stevens says you don't need to be a high-powered CEO to have a great vacation. Instead, he says there are three ""common sense"" things anyone can do to make sure their next vacation is as good as it can be.

1. Look after your luggage

Packing an extra day or two's worth of clothing in your carry-on can save you a lot of hassle when dealing with lost luggage. Oatawa | Istock | Getty Images

Few things can derail a vacation like your baggage not being on the carousel when you arrive at your destination. For peace of mind, Stevens tosses a tracker, like an Apple AirTag, into his checked bag before embarking on a trip. ""I often transfer on long-haul flights,"" he tells CNBC Make It. ""I like to know that [my bag] made the first leg and then I can see it being loaded onto the aircraft for the second leg."" In the event that your bag gets lost in the shuffle, having a locator in it can help airline employees track it down. Stevens gave the example of a friend of his whose bag never made it from his connection in Istanbul to his flight to Bangkok. By telling airline workers where to look, he was able to get his belongings faster. ""If you don't have that level of visibility, they'll just go into the standard process,"" he says. ""But if you've got the visibility, they use a different process. You actually get a higher level of service for the recovery of your luggage."" And no matter what, Stevens recommends packing a day or two's worth of clothing into your carry-on bag. ""[Your missing bag] can come a day later or sometimes two days later, if it's not lost,"" he says. ""Travel with some basic amenities and a change of clothes.""

2. Be smart about how you spend

Before going on an international trip, do your homework about whether or not your destination takes U.S. dollars. ""You'd be amazed at how many countries still accept U.S. dollars with a big smile on their face,"" he says. But keep in mind that just because a country accepts your dollars doesn't mean they can provide change. Don't expect a cabbie in Bangkok to be able to give you change for a $50 or $100 bill on an $8 ride from the airport. If you plan on not using local currency, bring small denominations to make your life easier. Even better, he says, set up a multi-currency card, such as Wise, before you leave so that you can pay for everything without worrying about exchange rates or transaction fees. ""The minute you've left your home and gone to an international country [with a multi-currency card], you've saved money immediately,"" he says.

3. Get off the beaten path

For the week, the S & P 500 eked a 0.2% gain while the Nasdaq rose 0.5%. The Dow was the winner on the week, up 1.2%, after severe back-to-back weekly declines. It's no wonder March has been such a terrible month, with consumer confidence in the economy dwindling on uncertainty related to President Donald Trump 's tariffs and aggressive federal government downsizing. The Nasdaq remained firmly in a correction, defined a decline of 10% or more from its record high on Dec. 16. The S & P 500 dipped in and out of a correction the prior week but remains down nearly 8% from its Feb. 19 record. The Dow has not ventured into correction territory yet, finishing Friday down almost 7% from its all-time high close on Dec. 4 . The big market event last week came Wednesday when the Federal Reserve opted to hold interest rates steady, preferring to wait and see how Trump's policies would affect economic growth and inflation. Following its March meeting, the Fed also raised its inflation outlook and lowered its growth projection, which can be interpreted negatively. Central bankers kept projecting two rates cuts in 2025, where they were in December. The dot plots, however, showed an increasing number of members expect zero to one cut this year. The Fed reduced rates three times in the final months of 2024. Trump wants more rate cuts now to ease the impact of tariffs, which are due to be ratcheted up on April 2. That's the deadline Trump set for imposing reciprocal levies on a wider range of U.S. trading partners and ending tariff exemptions on select Canadian and Mexican imports. On Friday, the president ambiguously said ""there'll be flexibility"" on tariffs. Last week also featured Nvidia 's highly anticipated annual product showcase event, GTC, and what CEO Jensen Huang told Jim Cramer about the stock. Facing a skeptical investor base, Nvidia showed it is doing everything it can to defend its artificial intelligence chip crown. Jensen on Tuesday during his keynote checked all the boxes he had to — unveiling the second half timeline for the release of Blackwell Ultra; sharing information on Vera Rubin, the successor to Blackwell; and introducing a new type of networking product. He also threw in some unexpected good news — announcing Nvidia Dynamo software; picking a name, Feynman, for the next big thing after Vera Rubin; and unveiling a slew of partnerships, including one with General Motors on self-driving cars. In a CNBC interview Wednesday, Jensen told Jim that he does not expect tariffs to hurt business and investors should stop worrying about that. Shares of Nvidia lost ground last week after getting an 8% pre-GTC lift the prior week. The back-and-forth stock market this week, with no help from a fairly neutral S & P Short Range Oscillator , yielded only one trade this week following the prior week's buying spree when the market was oversold. On Wednesday, we added to our Goldman Sachs position. We took the other side of an Oppenheimer downgrade to hold. The analysts cited Trump policy headwinds for freezing the potential for dealmaking that the market got so excited about after the election. We think Goldman's stock decline since its February highs reflects that disappointment, which is starting to thaw. We added venerable tech stock Dell Technologies to our Bullpen watchlist Thursday as expectations are finally moving down to more appropriate levels, according to Jeff Marks , director of portfolio analysis for the Club. Jim added Dell is ""exceptional"" and said he would be a buyer if not for how poorly tech names are trading in the current market environment. Looking at the week ahead, it's all about the economy and earnings. Economy : The main economic event of the week comes Friday, with the release of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge. February's personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index is expected to show a 0.3% month-over-month gain and a 2.5% year-over-year gain, according to FactSet. Both numbers would be pretty much in line with the increases seen in the prior month. The report comes on the heels of two softer-than-expected inflation reports in mid-March, and the Fed's revised price outlook Wednesday. Updated inflation readings are always important for investors because they can influence the market's expectation for interest rates. Lately, the concern that Trump's tariffs could be inflationary has added another wrinkle, though Fed Chair Powell said this past Wednesday that their impact could be transitory. The week also is set to bring two more looks at consumer sentiment, which has shown more pessimism in recent surveys and contributed to Wall Street's worries about a slowdown in the economy. On Tuesday morning, the Conference Board is slated to release its March consumer confidence index. The other closely followed survey of consumer attitudes is conducted by the University of Michigan, which on Friday posts its final March survey. The preliminary data out on March 14 showed sentiment at its lowest since November 2022 and inflation expectations at their highest since November 2022. Earnings : It's a pretty light week on the corporate calendar, with no Club holdings set to report, attend industry conferences, or hold annual meetings. Outside the portfolio, though, there are a few scheduled reports worth highlighting because the respective companies can advance our understanding of the economy and certain industries in which Club names operate. The first of these reports is KB Home on Monday night. Executives at the California-based homebuilder can provide commentary on the U.S. housing market, which has implications for Club name Home Depot . There are a few housing releases next week — new and pending home sales on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively — but as Jim often preaches, the ability of companies to provide real-time insights can in certain instances be more helpful than backward-looking reports. Housing is fast-moving, so we're looking forward to the latest thoughts from KB Home executives. On Wednesday, we'll hear from Paychex , a payroll processor for small and medium-sized businesses, and Cintas , a supplier of uniforms, first aid kits, and other services to businesses. Both companies offer a window into the economy and the labor market. On Wednesday night, investment bank Jefferies should provide a glimpse at where merger and acquisition activity stands, which would be relevant for Club name Goldman Sachs .

""It was a real head-scratcher for them,"" he tells CNBC Make It. ""I'm a huge talker and I am not naturally a great listener."" In Biswas-Diener's upcoming book ""Radical Listening: The Art of True Connection,"" which he co-authored with positive psychology professor Christian van Nieuwerburgh, he wants to teach readers that just because a skill isn't second-nature, doesn't mean you can't cultivate it. ""Listening is just full of really learnable skills,"" he says. And honing it can pay off both professionally and personally. After all, listening is a great tool for influencing people, navigating conflict, and soothing relationship skirmishes. If you want to sharpen your listening skills, here is a three-step guide to get you started.

1. Set an intention

A good conversationalist doesn't listen to one-up the other person, compare experiences, or give advice. Instead, they listen to validate the other person's feelings. ""If I am listening in order to appreciate you or connect with you, I'm going to pay extra special attention to your emotion words, your tone of voice, to potential shared experiences or mutual enjoyment or hobbies,"" Biswas-Diener. Knowing and naming the purpose of your conversation beforehand will help your focus on what's important or as Biswas-Diener says, ""your intention directs your attention.""

2. Observe and notice

Keeping the purpose in mind, notice what seems important to the other person. If they keep circling back to the same point again and again that might tell you they don't feel heard. ""They need to keep bringing it up or they need to keep processing it,"" Biswas-Diener says. The good news is most people are pretty good at observing their surroundings, he says: ""Humans are naturally geared towards noticing, whether you think you're a good listener or not.""

3. Ask questions",cnbc
https://cnbc.com,49-year-old quit her lawyer job to be a full-time writer: Now she’s a 4-time New York Times bestseller,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/23/novelist-jasmine-guillory-on-quitting-law-to-be-a-full-time-writer.html,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Romance novelist Jasmine Guillory always intended to be a lawyer.

After graduating from Wellesley College with a degree in history, she attended Stanford Law School and ultimately worked on securities law and intellectual property. But when she hit her 30s, Guillory, now 49, realized she needed a creative outlet.

""I have always been a person who loved reading books and loved fiction,"" she says, so she decided to try writing a novel. ""And I realized that I loved it,"" she says.

Guillory tried to get that first book published but couldn't find an agent to take her on. Her second book, however, ""The Wedding Date,"" landed her an agent and got published in 2018. ""Flirting Lessons,"" out April 8, will be her ninth published work and four of her books have become New York Times bestsellers. Guillory quit her job as a lawyer in January 2019 to dive into writing full-time.

Here's how she built her career as an author.

CNBC Make It: You started writing as a hobby. When did you decide you wanted to try to get that first book published?

Guillory: I think it just came gradually. I worked on it for so long and I could feel it getting better. I knew it wasn't good at the beginning. I think that was the biggest step was trusting myself when I read it and when I compared it to other books and feeling like this could be good enough.

I think that that is something that has stayed the same in every book that I've written throughout my career. There's always a point where I'm like, ""Okay, I really like this book.""

What drew you to romance as a genre?

I went through kind of a difficult period in my life and was reading a lot of books. I discovered that romance novels are really great during hard times because going in, no matter what happens in this book, it's going to be a happy ending. And that was what I really needed.

And I sort of thought, this seems like it would be fun to write. Let's see if it will be. And then it turned out it was.

When did you feel like you could leave your career as a lawyer?

I wrote my first three published books while I was working full-time as a lawyer. My first book deal was a two-book deal, and then my second deal was another two-book deal.

And then I got an offer for another deal that was significantly more than my first two had been. And that was when I knew at least I could afford to stop working full time.

I am, as many lawyers are, conservative at heart. So, I'm never sure that this is forever. But at least for now, I can afford to keep doing this.

Do you feel like you've made it?

Oh my gosh, no, never. [Laughs] If you had asked me seven or eight years ago at what point will you have thought you made it, I think I probably would have thought being a full-time writer would have been making it or hitting the New York Times bestseller list would have been making it. And those are definitely achievements that I am delighted by and I'm very proud of.

One of the problems with this career — but I think any other — is you're always raising the bar for yourself.

What do you wish more people knew about being a full-time writer?

How up and down the career may be. Every year, my tax person is like, ""Oh, this has been a great year for you"" or ""Oh, this has been a different year for you."" And I think it's just because there are ups and downs in the career. There are years where it feels like everything's going great, and then there are years where it doesn't feel like that.

I think this goes back to the conversation of do you feel like you've made it. So many people who are full-time writers, other people see us as having made it, and we see ourselves as still clawing our way up.

What would you like to achieve down the line?

More writing! That's the thing that I have to always hold onto is the rest of this is nothing I can control, but the writing is something that I can. Every time I sit down to write, I remind myself that I started doing this because I loved it. I never started doing this in order to make a career out of it. It was because I thought maybe I would enjoy it, and then I loved writing.

https://cnbc.com,A Chinese EV maker's bet on driver-assist tech is finally paying off — its shares are up more than 80% this year,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/23/chinese-ev-maker-xpengs-bet-on-driver-assist-tech-is-finally-paying-off.html,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","As driver-assist systems gain traction in China, one local startup that invested in the tech years ago is finally seeing results. Xpeng , listed in the U.S. and Hong Kong, has delivered more than 30,000 cars a month since November. The company last week said it expects that pace to continue for a doubling in sales versus 2024 — and that it will achieve profitability in the fourth quarter. What's selling is the company's lower-priced Mona M03 and its Xpeng-branded P7+ car, which includes advanced driver-assist software at no extra cost. With the automaker's plans to upgrade the P7 and release other new cars this year, Bank of America analysts on March 18 said they ""expect the strong model pipeline to support Xpeng's strong volume growth in 2025-26."" The analysts raised their price target on the stock to $27, up from $18.60 previously. That's upside of more than 20% from Thursday's close. Bank of America rates Xpeng a buy. The electric car company's shares have pulled back slightly after briefly doubling in price on a year-to-date basis earlier this month. Xpeng has ""turned around its sales momentum"" in the last 12 months thanks to its lower-priced Mona-branded M03 and Xpeng-branded P7+ launches, Barclays analysts said in a Thursday report. ""While the product pipeline looks impressive, needless to say the ultimate customer acceptance of these new models depends on many factors in the highly competitive Chinese EV market,"" the analysts said. They raised their price target to $20, from $7 previously, while maintaining an underweight rating. The price target increases come as industry giant BYD last week announced ultra-fast charging technology, on top of its launch in February of driver-assist systems for a range of its cars — signaling the once niche feature is going mainstream. BYD shares are up around 45% year-to-date in Hong Kong. The ""Chinese market is [at] an autonomous driving turning point,"" said Shay Natarajan, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity fund that invests in transportation. She pointed out that electric car companies in China are offering not only basic driver-assist known as L2, but moving on to more autonomous features known as L3. Fully autonomous driving without a human driver is called L4. ""What this means for automakers who don't offer free L2 autonomy in China today (like Tesla), is that they will most likely start to offer L2 autonomy for free and start to release and charge fees for L3 autonomy features in the [near] future,"" she said. Xpeng made driver-assist its selling point from its early days; in 2023 its former head of autonomous driving even went to work at Nvidia, which sells chipsets for assisted driving. Xpeng cars use some of those chips. But despite the tech features, the startup's early cars didn't gain significant traction in China until the launch of mass-market brand Mona last summer. A version of Xpeng's more advanced driver-assist system for navigating city streets is also coming for the Mona brand as a higher-end ""Max"" version of the M03 is due for release in May, Xpeng management said in an earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript. The car is set to be priced around 150,000 yuan ($20,690). ""Consensus 2025 earnings for Xpeng have been raised by 10% in the past one month and our forecasts remain above the street,"" J.P. Morgan Asia Pacific autos analysts said in a report Wednesday. They have an overweight rating on the stock. ""We revise our forecasts to reflect stronger sales volume but higher R & D expense as well as more conservative pricing,"" the analysts said. They lowered their price target to $31 a share, down from $35 previously. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",cnbc

The CNBC Magnificent 7 Index, consisting of Apple , Alphabet , Nvidia , Microsoft , Tesla , Meta and Amazon , is up 43.4% since the beginning of 2024. Berkshire has handily beaten the tech group by three percentage points, climbing 46.3% gain during the same period. ""Believe it or not, you would have been better off buying BRK/B than the Mag 7 to start '24,"" Chris Verrone, Strategas head of technical and macro research, said in a note to clients, referring to Berkshire's Class B stock. That's largely due to Mag 7's dramatic pullback in the new year, falling 13%. Technology stocks have come under pressure as economic uncertainty surged in the first two months of the Trump administration, driven by the impact of higher tariffs and concern about soaring investment in artificial intelligence. All seven stocks are lower in 2025. Berkshire, meanwhile, has rallied more than 15% in 2025, hitting several record highs along the way. The underperformance of the Mag 7 indicates a shift in market leadership, at least for now, as the questionable macroeconomic environment dents risk appetite, driving investors to safer corners of the market. Berkshire fits the bill given the the defensive nature of its huge Geico insurance empire and its unmatched balance sheet boasting hundreds of billions in cash. Tesla is the biggest loser in the Mag 7, tumbling nearly 50% just since its record high in December. Even Microsoft, the outperformer in the group, is down 13% from its recent peak. Apple, in which Berkshire still owns a large position, has sold off 14% this year. Coincidentally, the 94-year-old investment legend has slashed his Apple stake by two thirds over the past year, last reporting owning 300 million shares at the end of 2024. That's spared Berkshire billions of dollars in investment losses. ""The Magnificent 7 stocks are down more than twice as much as the rest of the S & P 500, highlighting the risks of chasing recent winners"" said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede. Fundamentally, the Omaha-based conglomerate is reporting stellar profits. Berkshire's operating profit, or earnings from the company's wholly-owned businesses, jumped 71% to $14.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Profits from insurance underwriting alone soared 302% from the year-earlier period, to $3.4 billion.",cnbc

While we often enter it with high expectations, the reality is that marriage is a lifelong learning process. As a psychologist who studies couples every day, I’ve worked with many people who only come to understand the toughest marriage lessons after they’ve experienced conflict, disappointment or a even divorce. If you can accept these five hard truths about marriage now, you're more likely to have a happy and successful relationship:

1. Love alone isn't enough to hold a marriage together.

Many couples believe that as long as they love each other, everything else will fall into place. But love doesn’t automatically solve differences in communication styles, personal values or long-term goals. What truly sustains a marriage is commitment, effort and the willingness to adapt. Love can help keep the spark going, but it's the daily choices that really make a difference. DON'T MISS: How to start a side hustle to earn extra money How do you respond to conflict? How do you show up for each other? How are you continuing to grow together? These are the questions that determine how strong your marriage really is.

2. You're going to fight ... a lot.

One of the biggest misconceptions about marriage is that truly compatible people don't argue. But not only is conflict inevitable, it’s also essential. In fact, the absence of conflict likely means that important issues are being swept under the rug. And it's not the fighting that damages relationships — it's how couples choose to handle their disagreements. Healthy conflict can bring partners closer by opening the door to deep, meaningful conversations about wants and needs, which can then lead to problem-solving. My advice is to learn how to fight fairly. No blame games, no stonewalling and no personal attacks. Create a safe space where you can both be honest and open without judgment.

3. Your partner won't — and can't — meet all of your needs.

Many people enter a marriage thinking that their spouse will be their ""everything"" — their best friend, emotional support system, cheerleader and problem-solver. While it’s natural to lean on each other for support, expecting one person to fulfill your every need is unrealistic. Healthy spouses recognize the importance of individuality. That means maintaining individual interests, friendships and goals. Nurturing a strong sense of self outside of the marriage helps prevent resentment and keeps the relationship from feeling suffocating. Always remember that a thriving relationship is built on two whole, complementary individuals — not two halves trying to complete each other.

4. Without constant maintenance, your marriage will crumble.

Many couples underestimate how much work it takes to have a healthy marriage. The honeymoon phase may feel effortless, but over time, life’s responsibilities — work, kids, finances, health — often puts the relationship lower on the priority list. You need to have regular check-ins and planned quality time together. Just as you wouldn’t expect a car to run forever without maintenance, you can’t expect a marriage to thrive without consistent care.

5. You are both going to change individually.",cnbc
https://cnbc.com,Op-ed: The groupthink mind virus has taken over Wall Street and Washington in the worst way,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/23/the-groupthink-mind-virus-has-taken-over-wall-street-and-washington.html,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","US President Donald Trump, alongside Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent (L) and Secretary of Commerce nominee Howard Lutnick (R), signs an executive order to create a US sovereign wealth fund, in the Oval Office of the White House on February 3, 2025, in Washington, DC.

What happens when irrational exuberance, groupthink, and wishful thinking begin to cloud narrative, dominate the rhetoric, and shape decision-making? Nowhere has this been more evident than in the weeks following Donald Trump's 2024 re-election, when many on Wall Street embraced the idea that tax cuts, deregulation, and Trump's focus on stock market performance would unleash another round of so-called ""animal spirits.""

At that time, the mood was exuberant and very few voices urged caution. Fewer still engaged in serious downside planning or worst-case scenario analysis. Instead, the prevailing belief was that Trump's aggressive rhetoric on tariffs and his promise to upend the global trading system were primarily negotiating tactics — a maximalist stance aimed at securing ""better deals"" for the U.S., although few could articulate anything specific about those deals while still insisting that this was Trump's approach.

Those of us in Washington who fought through the bruising first Trump trade war knew better. We understood that Trump's tariffs and trade threats weren't posturing. They are, and have always been, central to his worldview, in which tariffs are instruments to regain control over a global trading system that he feels have disadvantaged America. Tariffs are not merely rhetorical bargaining chips — they are hammers and hatchets to bludgeon trade partners. This time around, as early evidence has shown, he intends to go much further than in 2018.

One key moment is fast approaching: April 2, a date Trump himself has called ""the big one"" and in a Truth Social post on Wednesday declared as ""Liberation Day in America!!!""

On that day, there is a strong likelihood that the centerpiece of his America First Trade Policy, outlined in an executive order signed on his first day back in office, will begin to take effect. The policy would implement sweeping across-the-board tariffs, expand retaliatory authority, and grant the administration wide latitude to impose punitive trade actions with minimal consultation or public comment. It's a serious escalation, and yet, there remains a sense among many market participants that this, too, will be moderated or softened through private conversations or early market signaling. It is always possible, but the signs suggest otherwise.

Compounding this is a continued hope that figures like Trump's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick will somehow wake up — although woke is not what this administration is about — and moderate the administration's economic approach. Bessent, a former hedge fund manager, and Lutnick, a Wall Street CEO, were expected to be the financial calming influence — the ""adults in the room"" with market credibility. Instead, both Bessent and Lutnick have emerged as prominent advocates for Trump's aggressive trade agenda, unapologetically supporting all of the early tariff actions. They are surely likely to support the April 2 tariff rollout, and explain away the likely fiscal contraction and broader economic realignment, even as markets continue to wobble.

In recent appearances on ""Meet the Press"" and other outlets, Bessent has dismissed concerns about market correction, calling recent pullbacks ""healthy"" and reiterating the administration's commitment to its course. Lutnick has been no less emphatic. These voices aren't subtle nudges — they are bullhorns amplifying the administration's commitment to fundamentally reshape U.S. trade policy.",cnbc

Fast-food chains are going all in on fun beverages to attract younger consumers. Chick-fil-A, known for its straightforward menu of fried chicken and waffle fries, is selling seasonal Pineapple Dragonfruit drinks. Yum Brands' Taco Bell installed a beverage concept called Live Mas Café inside one of its California locations. McDonald's is in its second year of testing its drinks-focused spinoff, CosMc's. Restaurant operators are betting that drinks with exotic flavors, bright colors and high caffeine and sugar counts will mean higher sales — and better margins. Fast-food chains are increasingly adding beverage options and widening the number of items within that segment. Refreshers and agua frescas are increasingly showing up on menus, while fast-food chains expand their specialty iced coffee, hot chocolate and energy drink options, according to market research firm Datassential. Fast-food chains' recent focus on drinks mirrors the broader restaurant industry as the number of beverage-focused concepts climbs. More regional coffee shops are coming for Starbucks' crown. Plus, consumers have embraced buying drinks beyond coffee, such as bubble tea and ""dirty soda,"" the Utah trend of adding syrups, creamers and juice to soda that has spread nationwide. More and more full-scale establishments are basing their entire businesses on the growing segment. Beverage chains Swig, 7 Brew Drive Thru Coffee and Gong Cha are among the 10 fastest-growing quick-service restaurant chains by sales, according to restaurant market research firm Technomic. The trend also follows the decadeslong decline in soda consumption since its peak in 2000. ""As the consumer moves away from the traditional soda, there's an opportunity for operators and different brands to bring something signature to the table that is more in line with their brand in certain instances, but also an opportunity to potentially charge a little more,"" said Michael Parlapiano, managing director of the Culinary Edge, a consulting firm that has helped Noodles & Company , McDonald's and First Watch on menu offerings.

Attracting Gen Z

Restaurants are hoping hot chocolate and flavored lemonades can help build loyalty with Gen Z consumers. Compared to previous generations, Gen Z is the most open to new flavors and comes from the most diverse backgrounds. Gen Z's openness gives fast-food chains more latitude to explore more unusual offerings, such as butterfly pea or ube, according to Parlapiano. Monin, a French company best known for its flavored syrups, tapped yuzu, an East Asian citrus fruit, as its flavor of the year for 2025. Traditionally, large fast-food chains are less likely to experiment with such audacious flavors, but even they have stepped outside of their comfort zones. For example, Wendy's current lemonade lineup includes blueberry pomegranate and pineapple mango — two choices that have paid off for the burger giant. ""Our premium craft lemonades are also incredibly loved by our customers, and this product over-indexes with Hispanic consumers and Gen Z,"" Wendy's U.S. Chief Marketing Officer Lindsay Radkoski said at a recent investor event.

Restaurants have also been inspired to mix different drink trends favored by Gen Z, hoping that the unique mashups will attract adventurous consumers. For example, the soaring popularity of bubble tea, with its chewy tapioca balls, has inspired restaurant chains to add their own boba-inspired touches to drinks beyond tea. CosMc's, the McDonald's spinoff, offers dried blueberries and fruity popping boba as customizations for some of its drinks. Shake Shack's tropical kiwi lemonade includes tiny pieces of kiwi inside the drink, adding a new texture and evoking the chewiness of boba pearls, Parlapiano said. While different than a traditional soda, restaurants' foray into drink innovation often means just as much sugar, if not more, depending on the syrups and add-ons. But that doesn't change Gen Z's appetite for them. ""We think of it as 'little treat' culture. What I can spend is in the grand scheme of things, not a huge sum of money, and yes, I can splurge on this big sugary drink,"" said Claire Conaghan, trendologist and associate director for Datassential. ""I think the younger consumer is pretty aware that they're full of sugar, but they're OK with that as their preference for where they get their sweet treat.""

Beyond the soda fountain

For some chains, beverages have taken center stage as an area for improvement — and future sales growth. ""We recognize that it's not just about carbonated sodas anymore,"" El Pollo Loco CEO Liz Williams told CNBC. ""So we did a deep dive in beverage innovation this year."" El Pollo Loco's expanded drink offerings now include more flavors of its Aguas Frescas, which are fruit-infused waters. Future drink innovation could mean following the mashup trend, such as selling horchata coffee, Williams said. Wendy's also wants more of its customers to order drinks. Roughly 30% of Wendy's customers do not add a beverage to their order, according to a recent investor presentation. ""This is an opportunity for growth when these are highly profitable,"" Wendy's U.S. President Abigail Pringle told analysts. In many cases, beverages generate higher profits and are easier to add to menus than a new food item. While a customer sees a new flavor, for the workers making the drinks, it's just swapping out a syrup flavor or adding a new drizzle on top. With just a little more labor, restaurants can charge a lot more. Plus, syrups also usually have longer expiration dates than food items and are easier to store, according to Datassential's Conaghan. Wendy's new focus on beverages dovetails with its strategy to keep growing its breakfast sales. When the chain launched its breakfast menu nationwide for the first time in early 2020, the early morning menu featured only a few coffee options, such as its Frosty-ccino, which has since been replaced by the Frosty Cream Cold Brew. ""Our next horizon of growth at breakfast is in beverages,"" Radkoski said.

https://cnbc.com,"A 'very rare trend' is taking place in the fixed-income market, led by a booming trade in AI data center bonds",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/23/theres-a-very-rare-trend-in-fixed-income-led-by-boom-in-ai-bonds.html,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","The S&P 500 eked out a gain last week after four straight weeks of losses for stocks, but the market correction has sent many investors running for cover in bonds.

The move into bonds is no surprise given the ongoing market volatility and uncertainty over the impact of President Trump's policies on the U.S. and global economy this year. But in the world of ETFs, the size of the recent migration into bonds is eye-opening, with bond funds taking in almost as much money as stock funds.

Bond fund inflows of $90 billion in the past month are not far off the $126 billion taken in by equity funds, a ""very rare"" trend in the ETF world which was the starting point for discussion among fixed-income experts on last week's CNBC ""ETF Edge.""

Two fixed-income categories that have been big beneficiaries of the flight to safety are actively managed core bond funds and short-duration bond funds, including the shortest of U.S. treasuries, ""ultra-shorts.""

Ultra-short bond ETFs have gained over 40% of all flows into fixed-income ETFs this year, according to data from ETFaction.com. Actively managed enhanced core bond funds, meanwhile — which seek to outperform the broad corporate bond index, ""the AGG "" — have taken the lion's share of the new money from investors in their asset class, five times as much as passively managed enhanced core bond index ETF counterparts, according to ETFaction.

For years of the bull market, as stocks raged and the Federal Reserve pushed up yields in bonds in its fight against inflation, the classic diversified stock and bond portfolio was dead. But Jeffrey Katz, TCW managing director, says the ""60-40 portfolio"" — 60% stocks and 40% bonds — ""is doing its part"" again, and that's despite all the narrative about yields.

During a time of high stock market volatility, ""it's performing as it should,"" Katz said on CNBC.

But his bet is that investors will do better by not only investing in bonds, but ditching the AGG and allowing an active manager like TCW to find better than index-matching opportunities to generate excess returns. One place the TCW Flexible Income ETF has been attempting to do that is aligned with the AI boom, where $35 billion in bonds have been issued to fund the construction of AI data centers.

""We have a pretty strong secular tailwind from the AI boom, in addition to some of the cloud storage demand,"" Katz said.

TCW's views is that the corporate credit market as whole is ""fully priced,"" Katz said.

""Data centers are a new phenomenon, two years of issuance related to AI and the big demand for cloud computing and computing power,"" he said.

In addition to being overweight the AI data center bonds, the TCW Flexible Income ETF has made bigger bets on residential single family housing market bonds, a market which in undersupplied and where the level of equity built up in the housing stock limits the risk of default. The TCW ETF has also prioritized commercial real estate in what's called the Class A market, with the call of workers back to offices leading the ""Park Avenue type"" to see a strong rebound. ""We've leaned into that,"" Katz said.

The most widely used bond benchmark remains the AGG, the old Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index that is now the Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate Bond Index, and over the long-term, actively managed strategies in both stocks and bonds have struggled to outperform indexes. But Katz said the active approach has been paying off for investors in bonds as active managers can deviate from an outdated AGG approach to bond market representation, with as much as $26 trillion in bond market opportunities that the AGG never touches.

Katz said the TCW Flexible Income ETF has outperformed the AGG since inception in 2018 by nearly 500 basis points, with a return of 6.51% versus 1.82% for the AGG.

""The indices are old and they don't represent how we trade today,"" said Alex Morris, chief investment officers at F/m Investments. ""It's been three decades,"" he said on ""ETF Edge.""

""Bond indices get bloated with tens of thousands of issuances,"" Morris said. ""The AGG is so big, it's un-investable.""

Ultra-short options for inflation and uncertain times

At F/m Investments, another way the bond team is looking to attract investors seeking a safe haven is at the very short-end of the fixed-income market. Investors are skittish on stocks but have too much sitting in cash, Morris said, with over $7 trillion in money market funds and over $18 trillion sitting in bank deposits, ""not even CDs, just deposit accounts,"" he said.

F/m Investments offer access to short-duration treasury bonds, such as its TBIL ETF , and recently launched an ultra-short ETF, the Ultrashort Treasury Inflation-Protected Security ETF, focused on treasury-inflation protected securities, otherwise known as ""TIPS.""

The risk that investors take with bond duration increases during times of uncertainty, Morris said, and may not deliver the safety that investors are seeking from fixed-income, one reason his firm has a focus on shorter duration bonds.

Policies such as tariffs are inherently inflationary, Morris said, ""until they become depressionary.""

""They can just destroy growth in a way we don't want to think about,"" he added.

As investors become more concerned about inflation — inflation expectations have been rising again, though the Fed said last week it expects any tariffs impact to be ""transitory"" — ""we like staying short and liquid,"" Morris said.

That means treasury issues no longer in duration than two-year and five-year bonds, where ""you don't have to worry about aging out and not trading well.""

TIPS, he says, became ""a dirty term for a lot of folks,"" but ultra-short duration TIPS are not an area of the bond market that has been represented in the bond fund space and can limit some of the risks that hurt investors in recent inflation history, Morris said.

The short-duration bonds are linked to CPI (the consumer price index), and reset every month to reflect inflation. Investors didn't get what they expected from TIPS in the recent past, Morris said, because they bought the wrong asset at the wrong time. ""People buy when they see inflation coming and that's how they get burned ... that's when the Fed hikes, and that's drives duration assets down,"" he said. ""Even shorter-term tips, even two-, three-year, got absolutely smoked.""

The new F/m ETF holds TIPS with 13 months or less to maturity, and an average duration ""well under one year,"" according to the firm.

U.S. Republican Senator Steve Daines met Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing with a group of seven American executives on Sunday, following an annual business summit in the Chinese capital attended by top foreign CEOs.

Daines was accompanied by Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, Cargill CEO Brian Sikes, Boeing Global Senior Vice President Brendan Nelson, and other executives at Beijing's Great Hall of the People, according to a foreign media pool report.

Daines' trip marks the first time a U.S. politician has visited China since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January. Beijing is seeking high-level dialogue with the new administration, with hopes of reaching a deal to avert further tariff pressure from Washington.

Daines, a staunch supporter of Trump and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was heavily involved in negotiations over U.S.-China trade during Trump's first term, and has made multiple trips to China as a senator.

He lived in Guangzhou and Hong Kong in the 1990s while working as an executive for Proctor & Gamble , which he referenced in his opening speech.

""Collectively, these seven companies have over 275 years of experience of doing business in China,"" Daines said as he introduced the American CEOs, according to a pool transcript.

""These companies have each been here decades, growing the businesses, contributing significantly to growing the businesses and creating success.""

Beijing has been trying to attract foreign investment to offset U.S. tariff pressure and its slowing domestic economy.

The U.S. executives were granted an audience with Li Qiang, who will not meet separately with other foreign CEOs at the China Development Forum for the second year in a row.

The annual closed-door meeting with the premier was traditionally viewed as a summit highlight by foreign CEOs, who saw it as an opportunity to air their concerns.",cnbc
https://cnbc.com,Top analysts are upbeat on these 3 dividend stocks for stable income,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/23/top-analysts-are-upbeat-on-these-3-dividend-stocks-for-stable-income.html,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Uncertainty over the economy and tariff wars have been fueling volatility in the stock market, but dividend-paying stocks can offer investors some stability.

Investors looking for stable income in this shaky backdrop can consider adding stocks of dividend-paying companies to their portfolios. To that end, the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can inform investors who are on the hunt for the right names.

Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros on TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Vitesse Energy

This week's first dividend pick is Vitesse Energy (VTS), a unique energy company that owns financial interests, mainly as a non-operator, in oil and gas wells drilled by leading U.S. operators. Earlier this month, Vitesse completed the acquisition of Lucero Energy. The company expects this deal to increase dividends and provide additional liquidity to bolster its ability to make accretive acquisitions.

Recently, Vitesse announced its fourth-quarter results and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.5625 per share, payable on March 31. This payment marks a 7% rise from the prior quarter. VTS stock offers a dividend yield of 9.3%.

Following the Q4 print, Jefferies analyst Lloyd Byrne reiterated a buy rating on VTS stock with a price target of $33. The analyst noted that the Q4 EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) modestly lagged the consensus estimate due to marginally lower-than-expected production and the one-time costs related to the Lucero acquisition.

Byrne noted the planned increase in Vitesse's dividend following the completion of the Lucero acquisition. The analyst stated that increasing the dividend is consistent with VTS' strategy of raising its payout as the expected operating cash flow grows. He added that management aims to keep the dividend coverage ratio at about 1.0x.

The analyst highlighted that the Lucero deal adds to the company's operated production in the Bakken and nearly 25 net locations, which Vitesse believes equates to about 10 years of inventory life. Byrne views the Lucero deal positively, as it is accretive to Vitesse's earnings, dividend, free cash flow, and net asset value.

""While the deal is a departure from VTS's non-op strategy, adding an operated leg gives VTS incremental control over its capital and potential additional deal flow,"" said Byrne.

Byrne ranks No. 166 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 54% of the time, delivering an average return of 20.1%. See Vitesse Energy Stock Charts on TipRanks.

Viper Energy

We move to Viper Energy (VNOM), an oil and gas company that is a subsidiary of Diamondback Energy (FANG). Viper was formed by Diamondback to own, acquire, and exploit oil and natural gas properties in North America. It is focused on owning and acquiring mineral and royalty interests in oil-weighted basins, mainly the Permian Basin.

The company announced a base cash dividend of 30 cents per share and a variable cash dividend of 35 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2024. The total Q4 2024 capital return of 65 cents per share represents 75% of the cash available for distribution.

Recently, JPMorgan analyst Arun Jayaram reiterated a buy rating on VNOM stock but lowered the price target to $51 from $56 as part of an update to his firm's exploration and production models. The update reflected natural gas supply-demand analysis, stronger than expected LNG (liquified natural gas) demand-pull and the possibility of further decline in oil prices. The decline would be due to the combination of record U.S. oil supply, the return of OPEC+ barrels in April and global trade risk amid tariffs.

Explaining his bullish stance on VNOM stock, Jayaram said that mineral companies like Viper own the perpetual royalty interests under oil and gas leasehold, which gives them exposure to growth with no capital or operating expenses.

The analyst highlighted Viper's policy of returning about 75% of all distributable cash flow to shareholders through base and variable dividends and share buybacks. Jayaram thinks that Viper is unique due to its relationship with Diamondback Energy. Notably, Diamondback operates a major portion of Viper's acreage, which gives visibility and reduces a key uncertainty that is usually associated with companies in the minerals space.

""In Viper's case, between EBITDA growth and FCF yield, we see an attractive total return proposition,"" the analyst said.

Jayaram ranks No. 677 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 53% of the time, delivering an average return of 8.3%. See Viper Energy Stock Buybacks on TipRanks.

ConocoPhillips

Jayaram is also bullish on ConocoPhillips (COP) and reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock but lowered the price target to $115 from $127 as part of his update to his firm's exploration and production models. As mentioned above, the analyst is concerned about the possibility of a further decline in oil prices. ConocoPhillips announced a dividend of 78 cents a share for Q1 2025. COP stock offers a dividend yield of 3.1%.

The analyst said that since ConocoPhillips' 2016 strategy reset, the company has been one of the best exploration and production players. Jayaram noted multiple counter-cyclical transactions executed by COP that have lowered its cost of supply and significantly enhanced the durability of the company's ""Lower 48"" inventory, bolstering its balance sheet and portfolio optionality to LNG.

Jayaram added that on a normalized basis, ConocoPhillips' corporate break-even would be at the low-end of the peer group, given that it has much lower sustaining capital requirements than its peers. However, the combination of the company's long-cycle investments like Willow and Port Arthur, as well as the Marathon Oil merger, have modestly increased the oil beta of COP stock.

He expects ConocoPhillips to be one the few exploration and production companies in JPMorgan's coverage that could increase their cash return in 2025, including stock buybacks of $6 billion.

""We view COP as a core E&P holding given its portfolio strength, inventory durability, and shareholder friendly cash return framework,"" said Jayaram. See ConocoPhillips Hedge Fund Trading Activity on TipRanks.",cnbc
https://cnbc.com,Trump allies press the White House to dial back Elon Musk's media interviews over his Social Security jabs,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/23/trump-allies-press-the-white-house-to-dial-back-elon-musks-media-interviews-over-his-social-security-jabs.html,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick walks with Tesla CEO Elon Musk on the South Lawn, at the White House, in Washington D.C. U.S., March 14, 2025.

After his election, Donald Trump told NBC News that ""we're not touching Social Security,"" other than to make it more efficient. But Elon Musk, who now wields enormous power in his role cutting government spending, has recently made comments critical of the program that are coming into conflict with Trump's promise and worrying members of the president's own party.

Those concerns have prompted some Trump allies to question whether the billionaire should continue to do so many media interviews, four people familiar with the matter told NBC News.

A particularly problematic remark came during Musk's conversation with media personality Joe Rogan in late February, in which he described Social Security as ""the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time."" A couple of weeks later, the billionaire once again went after Social Security, this time in an interview with Fox Business host Larry Kudlow. Musk, when discussing entitlement spending he deemed wasteful or fraudulent, said the program was ""the big one to eliminate.""

Musk pointed to a 2024 report from the Government Accountability Office that estimated the entire federal government could lose between ""$233 billion and $521 billion annually to fraud.""

""The waste and fraud in entitlement spending, which is most of the federal spending, is entitlements, so that's the big one to eliminate,"" he said.

A Trump adviser acknowledged that they were aware of ""outside concern"" around Musk's comments. Trump allies — including some on Wall Street, in corporate America and Congress — have conveyed to the White House and even the president directly that Musk either has to be taken off air or needs to be more scripted.

A White House official who, like others in this article, requested anonymity to speak candidly, said they were sympathetic to the views of some Republicans who see Musk's comments on Social Security as potentially problematic and worrying to some senior citizens.

""Of course they don't want their Social Security cut,"" the person said. ""So if they hear something on the news that Elon Musk is saying, that we should do something with Social Security — of course there might be some concerns. But the only concern they have to worry about is what the president of the United States is saying and what he's doing. We haven't touched Social Security. We're not going to touch Social Security.""

The White House official said Musk's personal opinions about Social Security have no impact on Trump's policies.

""At the end of the day, President Trump has full trust in Elon Musk's decisions,"" the official said. ""The reality is everything that Elon is doing when it comes to Social Security is just to improve it.""

""Any American receiving Social Security benefits will continue to receive them,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. ""The sole mission of DOGE is to identify waste, fraud, and abuse only … DOGE has already identified billions of dollars in savings for American taxpayers, and President Trump will continue to direct this effort until our government is truly for the people, and by the people.""

A Republican lawmaker who was not familiar with the calls to the White House said Musk's disparagement of Social Security has unnerved people nevertheless.

""It does need to be reformed,"" the lawmaker said. ""Without reforming Social Security and Medicare, both programs will collapse and take the government down with it. But the last thing we need to talk about is disparaging the system. It's not a Ponzi scheme, it's just an entitlement program that needs to be reformed.""

""The more of these Musk interviews, the more discussion we'll have. I think the entire 2026 campaign will be a referendum on Musk"" if the billionaire's poll numbers continue to drop, this person added. ""You will see ad after ad with the chainsaw.""

Musk and his U.S. DOGE Service have taken a chain saw to plenty in the federal government, including the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Department of Education. But Social Security is a tougher target.

Long known as the ""third rail"" of American politics, the popular retirement and disability program has now been hit by Musk's downsizing effort as DOGE closes some Social Security offices and curtails telephone services — moves that even Republicans are beginning to push back on. Meanwhile, Democrats are salivating as Musk opens a new political front that pops in their own polling.

""Social Security is the most successful government program in American history,"" said Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., the top Democrat on the Budget Committee. ""It's an earned benefit that people paid into over their entire lives. If Elon and Trump go after it, I promise you this will be their undoing.""

The Democratic firm Blueprint tested 20 different political messages about Musk, and the four that were most ""concerning"" to registered voters were all about Social Security. The top two were about Musk's proposals to fire Social Security Administration employees and dismantle phone services. By contrast, voters said the messages least concerning to them were about his personal life, such as Musk fathering children with five different women. The survey was conducted last week and released Thursday.

Policy experts close to the White House said despite Musk's rhetoric and proximity to the president, Trump remains sensitive to the political risk of touching Social Security. He's been so unequivocal about maintaining benefits that even administration officials who would like to retool or cut the program are not challenging his edict.

""Even beyond the president, the White House itself has made crystal clear that they're not touching Social Security,"" one former Trump White House official said.

Another former top Trump aide also said given Musk's prominent role in the administration, the administration needs to consistently remind voters of Trump's own promise not to cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid benefits and that Musk's opinions are not the official policies of the Trump administration.

But the former official said Trump may be more amenable to tweaks that can be sold as eliminating waste, fraud and abuse — a sentiment the president hinted at in falsely asserting to a joint session of Congress that millions of dead people are receiving Social Security checks. That assertion came after Musk promoted similar misinformation online. The billionaire White House adviser has also claimed hundreds of billions of dollars in Social Security payments are being funneled to undocumented immigrants — framing that could appeal to Trump.

Musk's promise to cut between $1 trillion and $2 trillion in federal spending is virtually impossible without touching entitlement spending. And while Trump insists he wants to root out fraud, that's unlikely to dent the program's spending. The Social Security inspector general found that improper payments from fiscal year 2015 to 2022 totaled less than 1% of benefits paid over that time — and most of those were overpayments.

The rhetoric has been matched with policy shifts at the agency — even though Trump's pick to serve as commissioner has yet to be confirmed. Leland Dudek, the acting commissioner, recently outlined his vision in a lengthy memo to staff members, talking up exploratory efforts to incorporate artificial intelligence into its phone services and enhance its anti-fraud efforts.

The agency is also moving forward with a plan to no longer allow beneficiaries to change their bank information over the phone, necessitating a visit to the office or the creation of an online account — which Social Security employees told NBC News would make it more difficult for some elderly recipients to maintain their benefits.

Already, Dudek and the Social Security Administration have had to backtrack on a couple of unpopular decisions after public outcry.

The agency scrapped plans to end phone service for filing disability and retirement claims entirely, The Washington Post reported. Dudek also rescinded and apologized for an order that would have no longer allowed parents in Maine to sign up for their newborns' Social Security numbers at hospitals, instead having them register at federal offices.

The one-two punch of office closures and new limits on phone service have drawn concerns across the political spectrum. On Thursday, Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., described the choice to close a Social Security hearing office in his district as ""a slap in the face to thousands of my constituents who rely on these services.""

""This office handles over 2,000 backlogged cases and conducts hundreds of in-person hearings every year,"" Lawler, who represents a swing district, added in a statement. He said it was ""completely unacceptable"" to tell his constituents that they need to travel farther to receive the same service.

Other Republicans are publicly warning Musk and DOGE to tread lightly when slashing Social Security employees, as that carries negative impacts for seniors.

""First, we are not going to cut Social Security benefits. Secondly, we need to be so cautious [about] how we cut the workforce because customer service is inadequate now as it is,"" Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who represents an Omaha-based swing district and is a perennial Democratic target, told NBC News. ""Our goal needs to be improving the customer service. I know this firsthand. We had a death on our family and it has been hard to get someone to stop the payments.""

Yet amid those concerns, Republicans said they did not remember Social Security being a subject of conversation in private meetings with Musk. Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said he did not recall Musk bringing up Social Security with senators during the billionaire's closed-door meeting with them last month. A senior Senate GOP aide echoed Cramer, saying he did not think Musk ""has really addressed Social Security much with senators at all.""

Social Security employees who spoke with NBC News, meanwhile, said Musk's entitlement rhetoric and the administration's recent moves have them increasingly concerned the administration will move to privatize Social Security.

""The stuff that [Musk is] saying is untrue, and he must know that what he's saying is untrue, but he's saying it to move the needle and turn public sentiment against Social Security so that privatization or vastly downsizing the workforce will seem like a good idea,"" said one employee at the agency, who requested anonymity out of fear of reprisal.

A second Social Security employee said wait times are increasing for services, and employees are telling people to try and get any bank information changes in as soon as possible.

This person noted that elderly Social Security recipients who might not be tech-savvy and live far from a Social Security office are going to be most affected by the changes.

""It's going to prevent people from getting their benefits,"" this person said, adding that the effort amounts to ""a very stealthy, very covert hostile takeover.""

Nancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, argued that the Trump-Musk moves to slash and overhaul the Social Security Administration can do grave harm to benefits — even if Congress doesn't act to change the program.

""What I see happening is that Donald Trump gets the politics, which is why he flooded the swing states with flyers saying he wouldn't cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid,"" Altman said. ""So what is happening is an effort to undermine Social Security from within — with the idea that the benefits could be disrupted. It's with the endgame, certainly, of outsourcing and privatizing the administration of it.""

Altman said giving Musk's ""DOGE teenagers and 20-year-olds in control of the Social Security Administration"" access to seniors' personal data creates data safety concerns that leave the program vulnerable to hackers and scammers — ""a con artist's dream,"" she said. She argued that new rules requiring in-person office visits to register could mean that seniors who are disabled or immobile don't end up getting benefits. And she warned that the removal of Social Security Administration workers will lead to weaker customer service and longer wait times for benefits.

At a time of division for Democrats, the battle to prevent Trump and Musk from shrinking the Social Security Administration is a unifying force.

At a press conference Tuesday in Brooklyn, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., faced questions about his disagreements with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on the GOP funding bill, but he said they're united on protecting Social Security.

""We all align on the fights that are in front of us on behalf of the people that we represent here in Brooklyn and New York City and across the country,"" Jeffries told reporters. ""And that's saving Medicaid, saving Social Security, saving Medicare — all of which Elon Musk and Donald Trump and the Republicans, they want to take a chain saw to Medicaid. They want to take a chain saw to Social Security.""

First-term Rep. Janelle Bynum, D-Ore., who flipped a competitive district last fall, said she's hearing from constituents who are anxious about Social Security changes, office closures and potential impacts to their benefits due to Musk's actions.

""Maybe it's good for billionaires like him, but it isn't good for my constituents,"" Bynum said. ""And we have an unelected billionaire trying to cut what we know is an essential program for millions of Americans.""",cnbc
