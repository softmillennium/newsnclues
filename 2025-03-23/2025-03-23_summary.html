Gaza's Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Experts say the official death toll is probably an undercount.

More than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip, the enclave's Health Ministry said Sunday — a grim indicator of the conflict's continued lethality less than a week since Israel shattered a nearly two-month-old ceasefire, launching airstrikes and ground incursions into the territory.

Israel launched the war in Gaza in response to the deadly Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed about 1,200 people and took roughly 250 people hostage. Most of those hostages have been released through negotiated exchanges, and of the 59 Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza, 24 were believed to be alive before the conflict resumed.

Despite over a year of heavy bombardment of a strip of land of roughly 140 square miles, Israel has been unable to completely destroy Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007.

The two parties agreed to a ceasefire in January that paused hostilities and saw 33 Israeli hostages exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli detention. The first phase of what was supposed to be a three-phase path to a permanent end to the war lapsed on March 1, and the parties could not agree on an extension of that phase.

While Hamas wanted to immediately open talks for the second phase, in which Israel would fully withdraw from the enclave and Hamas would release remaining living hostages, Israel refused to engage in those talks and instead opted to extend the ceasefire.

Israel began bombing Gaza again Tuesday, breaking the fragile truce. The renewed Israeli attacks have killed more than 673 people since then, Gaza's Health Ministry said midday Sunday, more than a third of whom were children. An additional 233 people who were killed previously were added to the roster of the dead after a committee tracking the missing confirmed their deaths, the Health Ministry added.

Many of the casualties over the past week have been women and children, according to medical workers and eyewitnesses. The strikes have targeted senior political figures in Hamas, killing acting prime minister Essam Al-Da'alis and high-ranking officials in the Hamas-run justice and interior ministries.

Among the 41 people killed between Saturday afternoon and late Sunday morning was senior Hamas leader Salah al-Bardawil, a member of the movement's political bureau, who was killed overnight, according to a statement from Hamas. The statement, which described the attack as an “assassination,” said Bardawil was killed alongside his wife when an Israeli airstrike hit his tent in al-Mawasi, an area of Khan Younis, as the couple was praying.

In a joint statement Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces and Israel Security Agency, or Shin Bet, said they carried out the strike that killed Bardawil, describing him as the head of Hamas's “planning and development office.” It was unclear what role, if any, he had in the group's military operations.

Ibrahim Madhoun, a Palestinian political analyst who is close to Hamas, said Sunday that Bardawil was not involved in the activities of the group's military wing. He called Bardawil, who previously served as spokesman for the Hamas bloc in the Palestinian Legislative Council, a “symbol” within the movement and said his death was a “great loss.”

Also Sunday, the IDF said its troops had encircled the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood in Rafah in southern Gaza. “During the night, the troops encircled the area, eliminated several terrorists, and conducted a targeted raid on a terror infrastructure site that was used over the past few months as a command and control center of Hamas terrorists,” the statement said.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society said Sunday morning it had lost contact with a team of paramedics trapped in Rafah and was “awaiting clearance” to try to reach the group. Gaza's civil defense force later said some of its crews were stuck in the same area after trying to rescue the Red Crescent staff and that they had also gone silent. Some 50,000 people living in the area encircled by Israeli troops faced “imminent danger” to their lives, the civil defense said.

The IDF said it was allowing civilians to evacuate, and image Sunday showed families fleeing toward central Gaza, lugging babies, pillows and their few possessions by foot or by cart.

Sunday also marked three weeks since Israel blocked all aid from entering Gaza in an effort to force Hamas to compromise. The siege has reversed progress made during the ceasefire, which brought a surge of aid into Gaza, toward alleviating the dire humanitarian crisis there.

“Every day without food inches Gaza closer to an acute hunger crisis,” Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, wrote on X. “Banning aid is a collective punishment on Gaza: the vast majority of its population are children, women & ordinary men.”

Mediators have scrambled to drag the two sides back to the negotiating table, but current and former officials said the intensity of the renewed Israeli airstrikes has complicated their ability to revive a diplomatic solution to the conflict.

The official figure of 50,021 killed since Oct. 7, 2023, does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but Gaza's Health Ministry says the majority of the dead are women and children. More than 113,000 people have been injured, according to the Health Ministry.

The Washington Post could not independently verify the ministry's figures; Israel has not allowed international journalists into Gaza since the start of the war. But Palestinian journalists, first responders, international aid workers and war-casualty watchdogs all say the official death toll in Gaza is probably an undercount, with the chaos of war upending what experts and researchers say was once a robust reporting system for tracking and identifying the dead.

During the nearly two-month ceasefire in Gaza, some people managed to recover the bodies of loved ones trapped beneath the rubble, but thousands more remain unaccounted for, according to Gaza's civil defense.

Israel's military launched a large-scale bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, breaking the fragile ceasefire with Hamas that has been in place since late January. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.

Pontiff says he has ‘had the opportunity to experience the Lord's patience' and pays tribute to ‘tireless care' of medics

Pope Francis greeted a large crowd of pilgrims gathered outside Gemelli hospital in Rome in his first public appearance in more than five weeks, before being discharged from the hospital on Sunday.

The pontiff, who is recovering from pneumonia in both lungs, made the brief greeting and blessing from the balcony of his hospital room shortly after the release of the text for his Sunday Angelus.

“Thank you to everyone”, Francis, 88, told the crowd. He then made his way home to Casa Santa Marta in the Vatican City, where he will convalesce for at least two months.

“Our pope is coming back,” one of the pilgrims told Rai news.

The health of Francis, who was admitted to hospital on 14 February and subsequently diagnosed with a respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia, was steadily improving, Sergio Alfieri, a general surgeon at Gemelli hospital, told reporters on Saturday. However, it would still take “a lot of time” for his body to fully heal.

Francis suffered two critical breathing crises in hospital before his doctors declared on 10 March that he was no longer in imminent ­danger.

In the Angelus, the pope reflected on his “long period” of hospitalisation. “I have had the opportunity to experience the Lord's patience, which I also see reflected in the tireless care of the doctors and healthcare workers, as well as in the care and hopes of the relatives of the sick,” he said. “This trusting patience, anchored in God's unfailing love, is indeed necessary in our lives, especially when facing the most difficult and painful situations.”

He expressed his sadness at Israel's renewed bombing of the Gaza strip and called for an “immediate halt to the weapons and for the courage to resume dialogue, so that all hostages may be released and a final ceasefire reached”, while urging people to pray “for an end to wars and for peace, especially in tormented Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Myanmar, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.”

La Repubblica reported that Francis had insisted he return home, where he will need to continue his recovery and rest. “The hope is that he will soon be able to resume a work schedule,” Alfieri said. However, he cautioned that the pope would not immediately be able to meet groups of people. It remains unclear if an audience with King Charles and Queen Camilla, scheduled for 8 April, will take place.

Despite his health challenges, on some days Francis continued to lead the Vatican from his hospital room, including approving individuals for sainthood and writing a letter to the editor of Corriere della Sera newspaper reiterating his appeal for peace and disarmament.

Francis is prone to lung infections because he developed pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed while training to be a priest in his native Argentina.

He has suffered ill health in recent years and has often alluded to resigning if bad health prevents him from doing his job. Speculation over an imminent resignation was vehemently dismissed last week by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state.

In a shocking turn of events, two Tesla Cybertruck owners who participated in a Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans were left distraught after their vehicles were vandalised by members of the crowd. The incident occurred while they were participating in the Orpheus parade, carrying parade marshals, Business Insider reported. 

Joshua Hazel, one of the Tesla Cybertruck owners, described the experience as "aggressive," "hateful," and "violent." Initially, Mr Hazel and his group of Tesla owners were thrilled to be participating in the Mardi Gras celebration, proudly showcasing their Cybertrucks adorned with American flags and custom wraps.  However, as they progressed deeper into the parade route, a segment of the crowd turned hostile, subjecting the vehicles to harassment and vandalism. 

Mr Hazel vividly recalled the moment when he saw someone sprinting up to his Cybertruck and aggressively hurling a handful of thick Mardi Gras beads, striking his wife on the head. The impact not only left his wife shaken but also resulted in significant damage to the vehicle, including a smashed glass panel covering the truck's camera area.

Meanwhile, Christina's Cybertruck also fell victim to the vicious attacks, sustaining major damage as a group of individuals "pummeled" her vehicle with a heavy, unidentified object. 

Following the vicious attack, both Mr Hazel and Ms Christina reported the incident to the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD). In the meantime, both of them have been left to contend with the costly aftermath of the vandalism. Mr Hazel estimates that repairing the shattered glass rim on his Cybertruck will set him back around $360 while redoing the aftermarket wrap will add another $7,000 to the bill.

Ms Christina has already incurred significant expenses, having spent over $2,000 to replace her Cybertruck's broken top glass. She faces further costs for repairing the damaged wrap.

Notably, this incident is part of a larger trend of attacks on Tesla facilities and vehicles across the US, with some incidents involving vandalism, graffiti, and even shootings. President Trump has condemned the attacks, suggesting that they be classified as domestic terrorism. 

A few days back, multiple Tesla vehicles were set on fire and shot at a Las Vegas service centre, according to a CNN report. The attack, which occurred at the Tesla Collision Center, resulted in at least five vehicles being damaged, with two of them fully engulfed in flames. 

According to authorities, the perpetrator used Molotov cocktails and fired gunshots at the vehicles. The investigation is ongoing, with the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department working together to identify the perpetrator.

Meeting comes as China hopes to reach a deal to avert further tariff pressure from Washington

Republican senator Steve Daines, a staunch supporter of Donald Trump, met Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing on Sunday, as China hopes to reach a deal to avert further tariff pressure from Washington.

The meeting marks the first time a US politician has visited China since Trump took office in January. Earlier this month, China's ministry of foreign affairs promised that China will “fight to the end” with the US in a “tariff war, trade war or any other war”.

Daines, a Montana Republican, met Li with a group of seven American executives on Sunday, following an annual business summit in the Chinese capital attended by top foreign CEOs.

Daines was accompanied by Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, Cargill CEO Brian Sikes, Boeing Global Senior Vice President Brendan Nelson, and other executives at Beijing's Great Hall of the People, according to a foreign media pool report.

Daines, a member of the Senate foreign relations committee, was heavily involved in negotiations over US-China trade during Trump's first term, and has made multiple trips to China as a senator. He lived in Guangzhou and Hong Kong in the 1990s while working as an executive for Proctor & Gamble.

Beijing has been trying to attract foreign investment to offset US tariff pressure and its slowing domestic economy.

Relations between China and the US have come under new strain after Trump slapped additional tariffs on Chinese goods, accusing Beijing of not doing enough to stem the flow of fentanyl into the United States.

In early April, Trump is expected to unleash a round of tariffs on all countries that tax US imports, potentially including China. A US review of whether China has fulfilled promises made during the “phase one” trade deal from Trump's first administration is set to conclude on 1 April. “Currently, US-China relations have come to an important juncture,” Li told Daines in their meeting, stressing the need to choose dialogue over confrontation.

“Our two sides need to choose dialogue over confrontation, win-win cooperation over zero-sum competition,” Li said.

The US executives were granted an audience with Li Qiang, who will not meet separately with other foreign CEOs at the China Development Forum for the second year in a row.

The annual closed-door meeting with the premier was traditionally viewed as a summit highlight by foreign CEOs, who saw it as an opportunity to air their concerns.

Other Chinese officials present at the meeting with Daines and the US executives included Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, Executive Vice-Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu and the director of China's state planner, Zheng Shanjie.

Daines met Vice-Premier He Lifeng in Beijing on Saturday. He discussed the need for China to stop the flow of fentanyl precursors and “expressed hope that further high-level talks between the US and China will take place in the near future,” according to a post he put on the social media platform X.

The Israeli government had failed to coordinate with Jewish communities about the invitation of controversial right-wing European political leaders to Thursday's International Conference on Combating Antisemitism, Diaspora Jewish leaders charged at a Sunday morning Knesset Aliyah, Absorption, and Diaspora Committee hearing, though the Diaspora Ministry argued that it had invited representatives from across the political spectrum and had operated according to the Foreign Ministry's diplomatic relations parameters.The hearing regarding the impact of the government's policies on Diaspora communities, organized by committee chairman MK Gilad Kariv following a surge of conference cancellations by major Diaspora figures and organizations, saw European Jewish Congress President Dr. Ariel Muzicant relate that European communities were "extremely frustrated by [Diaspora] Minister [Amichai] Chikli and what he is doing."  The Diaspora Ministry was not speaking with Jewish communities, and they were, in turn, not reaching out, said Muzicant, whose organization pulled out of the conference. He expressed the belief that they may not be able to work with the current Israeli government, highlighting that a May World Jewish Congress conference would explore the topic of how "the Israel-Diaspora relationship does not work."This [antisemitism] conference is stabbing Jews in the back," said Muzicant. "You are helping our enemies, you are giving fuel to those criticizing Israel. By joining with the extreme right, you help those who criticize Israel." AdvertisementMuzicant said that it was important for the Israeli government to coordinate with European Jewish leaders as well as the disparate communities that had particular situations. Before inviting National Rally President Jordan Bardella, the Diaspora Ministry should have consulted with the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France (CRIF), explained Muzicant, as the Jewish body has refused interactions with the far-left or far-right.MK Gilad Kariv seen at the Knesset, in Jerusalem, on March 11, 2025 (credit: YONATAN SINDEL/FLASH90)Antisemitism was not the only consideration when engaging with these parties, argued Muzicant, who contended that the participants invited to the conference did not respect democratic values such as an independent judiciary and free speech. Former Bundestag member and Germany-Israel Friendship Society chairman Volker Beck, who had withdrawn from the conference last Friday, explained to the committee that Germany's friendship with Israel was not only due to its support for Jewish self-determination but also common democratic values.The parties that were invited did not appreciate its status as a Jewish state, said Volker, and only saw it as the enemy of its enemy, Jihadist Islam. These parties did not respect Judaism domestically, Volker warned and sought to ban ritual slaughter and circumcision.   Stay updated with the latest news!

Volker highlighted that growing closer to these parties, therefore, jeopardized Israel's security, as Russia was an ally of Iran, which had orchestrated many of the war's assaults against Israel.Diaspora Ministry Director-General Avi Cohen-Scali assured that the ministry wasn't waiting until any conference to speak to Diaspora communities and was in contact with them all the time about various programs and initiatives against antisemitism.  Ministry requested participation of politicians across the spectrumHe rejected the idea that the ministry only invited far-right governments, noting that they had requested the participation of politicians across the spectrum, including the ruling parties of the French and British governments. Many of the organizations had withdrawn not because of right-wing politicians, argued Cohen-Scali, but because of the pressure that had been created in the media.Cohen-Scali said that the conference was not a right-wing event but a professional fair for opponents of antisemitism to explore the challenges and tools available in the fight against anti-Jewish animus. People were invited not because of their political orientation but because they had come out after the October 7 Massacre as strong proponents of Israel, explained the director-general. Bardella was one of these figures, said Cohen-Scali, supporting Israel even in the face of public backlash.The conference did not invite any member of a party which the Foreign Ministry had already established a relationship with, said Cohen-Scali. According to the Foreign Ministry Europe department head Ahuva Spieler, the ministry had a "green light" for engagement with National Rally, Sweden Democrats, and the Spanish Vox party after assessment through long-standing parameters.The parameters assess suitability for interaction with political bodies based on their stance on the Holocaust, Nazis, and Neo-Nazis, their relations with local Jewish communities, and their position on Israel and anti-Israel movements.Since the October 7 Massacre, banning Hamas as a terrorist organization and condemning the attacks had been added to the parameters. Not all of the parameters were met by different bodies all of the time, and ongoing assessments were held, giving weight to different items. Spieler noted that they had not approved the relations of parties from Germany and Austria based on a file provided by the EJC.Kariv asked about the importance placed on liberal democratic values and coordination with the Diaspora communities in the parameters, and when Spieler explained that the relations were advised to proceed with Diaspora consultation and that values were considered but not officially part of the parameters, the chairmen urged the addition of democratic values as an element of the document.Kariv was skeptical about how interactions could be approved with political actors coming to an official government conference within three months. He demanded to know if the prime minister had intended to meet with Bardella in the wake of the fresh approval of relations.Another French politician invited to the conference became a topic of concern when it was noted that she used to be part of Eric Zemmour's Reconquete party, which the Foreign Ministry had not yet approved. Cohen-Scali explained that Jean-Marie Le Pen's granddaughter Marion Maréchal was invited because she was an MEP for an approved European Parliament party.'Government must take a clear stand'The Israeli government must take a clear stand against extremist political parties with antisemitic roots, said Kariv. He warned that “we will not accept ties with antisemitic parties—whether on the Right or the Left,” but that the left was not on the agenda today.Kariv pointed to the Israeli Labor Party's past decision to sever ties with the British Labour Party during Jeremy Corbyn's leadership due to antisemitic rhetoric.“I expect the Israeli government and the Knesset to take just as clear a stand,” he said.Kariv accused the Diaspora Ministry of mishandling the conference, which led to the withdrawals of the Anti-Defamation League, UK Chief Rabbi Mirvis, UK politician and antisemitism adviser Lord John Mann, Goldsmiths University professor David Hirsh, French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy, and German antisemitism czar Felix Klein due to the controversial guests.

The Diaspora Ministry was not speaking with Jewish communities, and they were, in turn, not reaching out, said Muzicant, whose organization pulled out of the conference. He expressed the belief that they may not be able to work with the current Israeli government, highlighting that a May World Jewish Congress conference would explore the topic of how "the Israel-Diaspora relationship does not work."This [antisemitism] conference is stabbing Jews in the back," said Muzicant. "You are helping our enemies, you are giving fuel to those criticizing Israel. By joining with the extreme right, you help those who criticize Israel."

Before inviting National Rally President Jordan Bardella, the Diaspora Ministry should have consulted with the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France (CRIF), explained Muzicant, as the Jewish body has refused interactions with the far-left or far-right.MK Gilad Kariv seen at the Knesset, in Jerusalem, on March 11, 2025 (credit: YONATAN SINDEL/FLASH90)Antisemitism was not the only consideration when engaging with these parties, argued Muzicant, who contended that the participants invited to the conference did not respect democratic values such as an independent judiciary and free speech.

People were invited not because of their political orientation but because they had come out after the October 7 Massacre as strong proponents of Israel, explained the director-general. Bardella was one of these figures, said Cohen-Scali, supporting Israel even in the face of public backlash.The conference did not invite any member of a party which the Foreign Ministry had already established a relationship with, said Cohen-Scali. According to the Foreign Ministry Europe department head Ahuva Spieler, the ministry had a "green light" for engagement with National Rally, Sweden Democrats, and the Spanish Vox party after assessment through long-standing parameters.The parameters assess suitability for interaction with political bodies based on their stance on the Holocaust, Nazis, and Neo-Nazis, their relations with local Jewish communities, and their position on Israel and anti-Israel movements.Since the October 7 Massacre, banning Hamas as a terrorist organization and condemning the attacks had been added to the parameters.

'I was astonished to see nearly only, with some exceptions, being invited from the far-right."Both Muzicant and Volker cautioned that the controversial parties invited by Israel were aligned with Russia. Volker highlighted that growing closer to these parties, therefore, jeopardized Israel's security, as Russia was an ally of Iran, which had orchestrated many of the war's assaults against Israel.Diaspora Ministry Director-General Avi Cohen-Scali assured that the ministry wasn't waiting until any conference to speak to Diaspora communities and was in contact with them all the time about various programs and initiatives against antisemitism.  Ministry requested participation of politicians across the spectrumHe rejected the idea that the ministry only invited far-right governments, noting that they had requested the participation of politicians across the spectrum, including the ruling parties of the French and British governments. Many of the organizations had withdrawn not because of right-wing politicians, argued Cohen-Scali, but because of the pressure that had been created in the media.Cohen-Scali said that the conference was not a right-wing event but a professional fair for opponents of antisemitism to explore the challenges and tools available in the fight against anti-Jewish animus. People were invited not because of their political orientation but because they had come out after the October 7 Massacre as strong proponents of Israel, explained the director-general. Bardella was one of these figures, said Cohen-Scali, supporting Israel even in the face of public backlash.The conference did not invite any member of a party which the Foreign Ministry had already established a relationship with, said Cohen-Scali. According to the Foreign Ministry Europe department head Ahuva Spieler, the ministry had a "green light" for engagement with National Rally, Sweden Democrats, and the Spanish Vox party after assessment through long-standing parameters.The parameters assess suitability for interaction with political bodies based on their stance on the Holocaust, Nazis, and Neo-Nazis, their relations with local Jewish communities, and their position on Israel and anti-Israel movements.Since the October 7 Massacre, banning Hamas as a terrorist organization and condemning the attacks had been added to the parameters. Not all of the parameters were met by different bodies all of the time, and ongoing assessments were held, giving weight to different items. Spieler noted that they had not approved the relations of parties from Germany and Austria based on a file provided by the EJC.Kariv asked about the importance placed on liberal democratic values and coordination with the Diaspora communities in the parameters, and when Spieler explained that the relations were advised to proceed with Diaspora consultation and that values were considered but not officially part of the parameters, the chairmen urged the addition of democratic values as an element of the document.Kariv was skeptical about how interactions could be approved with political actors coming to an official government conference within three months.

A Russian drone strike in Kyiv has killed three people, including a child, and caused fires in high-rise buildings, Ukrainian officials say

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urges his allies to apply "new pressure" on Moscow to bring the war to an end

Russia's defence ministry says it brought down nearly 60 Ukrainian drones overnight and that one person was killed in a car fire

In Saudi Arabia, officials from the US and Ukraine will hold talks on Sunday evening, as Russia says "difficult technical talks need to be held" ahead of their separate meeting with the US delegation on Monday

Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory

Earlier, we heard US envoy Steve Witkoff say that he is hopeful for "real progress" in Ukraine peace talks over the next two days.

The US has taken a leading role in negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. 

But the UK and EU have been working on plans for what peace could look like, including putting peacekeeping troops on the ground in Ukraine. 

US envoy Steve Wtikoff dismissed this plan as "a posture and pose" in an interview with pro-Trump journalist Tucker Carlson. 

Witkoff said the idea was based on a "simplistic" notion from the UK prime minister and other European leaders.

"Russians are going to march across Europe. That is preposterous by the way. We have something called Nato that we did not have in World War Two."

Starmer also welcomed Schoof to Downing Street ahead of a bilateral meeting back in February

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Prime Minister Dick Schoof of the Netherlands spoke today about Ukraine, Downing Street says.

The pair agreed that "continued political momentum and action driven by the members of the Coalition of the Willing, is vital to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position for a secure and lasting peace," a statement from No 10 says.

They also agreed that much closer cooperation in Europe on defence capabilities will be "vitally important" in the coming decades in order to protect Europe and secure its future, the statement adds.

Speaking on Air Force One on Saturday night, US President Donald Trump told sports journalist Clay Travis, external that there's nobody in the world that can stop Putin "except me".

In the interview, he says: "I think I'm going to be able to stop him."

"We've had some very rational discussions, and I just want to see the people stop getting killed," Trump adds. 

US envoy Steve Witkoff says that the United States is expecting to see "real progress" at the next round of peace talks, beginning with Ukraine today in Saudi Arabia.   

In an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Witkoff says "our job is to narrow the issues, bring the parties together and stop the killing".  

He says progress is expected on issues like the Black Sea and shipping. "And from that, you'll naturally gravitate into a full on shooting ceasefire." 

Witkoff thinks Russian President Vladimir Putin "wants peace" and says lots of progress has already been made in calls between Trump and his Russian counterpart over the past week.

Last night, Witkoff praised Putin and told journalist Tucker Carlson that he "liked" the leader.  

Saudi Arabia will host more peace talks on Sunday and Monday this week, with delegations from Ukraine, Russia and the US all expected to attend - though not all at the same time.

Ukraine's team will first meet the US delegation on Sunday evening, a member of the Ukrainian delegation told AFP.

The US team will then meet their Russian counterparts in Saudi Arabia on Monday.

Kyiv says it wants an end to strikes on its energy infrastructure, and to retain control of its land. Moscow is calling for an end of military aid and intelligence sharing in Ukraine.

Following the deadly strikes in Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says that "new decisions and new pressure on Moscow are needed to bring an end to these strikes and this war".

The Ukrainian president adds "these attacks are a daily reality". 

He calls for  "more effective" sanctions against Russia as the weapons used against his country use foreign parts.

"Every loophole that allows them to bypass the sanctions regime must be eliminated."

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov

Vladimir Putin's spokesperson has described a phone call this week between the Russian president and his US counterpart Donald Trump as  "constructive" and "very respectful".

Dmitry Peskov told Russian state media that the call was another step towards organising a face-to-face meeting between the two leaders.

"Such a meeting must be adequately prepared. First,
difficult technical talks must be held. And just on Monday, our negotiators will go
to Riyadh to start this complex process," Peskov adds.

Trump earlier said his call with Putin was "a very good and productive one", with an agreement reached on "an immediate ceasefire on all energy and infrastructure".

The Russian Defence Ministry says it shot down 59 Ukrainian drones overnight. 

It says these were across a number of regions in the south of the country, and in Crimea, a peninsula illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. 

In the aftermath of heavy shelling on Ukraine overnight, one Kyiv resident tells Reuters they want a ceasefire agreement because there is "constant stress" from "being under attack all the time". 

Mykhailo Krytsiuk adds that the quality of life has deteriorated too, and a ceasefire would help economically.  

"If the war freezes, then there is a hope that it will bring at least some comfort," he says.  

"But I do not believe in a full ceasefire, I do not believe in total safety because we have seen how our bad neighbour (Russia) behaves," he says.   

It's a sentiment echoed by another local, Serhiy Kolomiiets, who says talks continue between officials "while ordinary people... ordinary children will be suffering."

In the aftermath of drone strikes on Ukraine overnight, which killed three people in Kyiv, debris from damaged buildings has piled up.

President Zelensky says a father and his five-year-old daughter were among the casualties.   

Drone debris hit an apartment block, which caused fires in the residences.    

The Ukrainian Air Force says it shot down 97 of 147 drones, with 25 others being successfully diverted.

Russian strikes on Ukraine overnight have killed three people in Kyiv and left several injured, local officials say. One witness has said "everyone started screaming and running" as debris hit an apartment block.

Ukraine's air force says it has shot down 97 of 147 drones launched into the country.

Meanwhile, Russia's defence ministry says it shot down almost 60 Ukrainian drones and say one person was killed after a car caught fire following strikes.

Following the attacks in his nation's capital, Ukrainian President Zelensky has called for fresh pressure on Russia. 

It comes as the Kremlin says they are a step closer to a face-face meeting between Trump and Putin - but a spokesperson says "difficult" technical talks need to be had before this can progress. 

US and Ukraine delegations will meet in Saudi Arabia on Sunday, as Washington seeks to negotiate to a potential end to the conflict. On Monday, the US is expected to meet with Russian counterparts.

Putin has rejected a joint US-Ukrainian call for a full and immediate 30-day pause, proposing instead to halt attacks only on energy facilities.

England will be without Anthony Gordon for Monday night's World Cup qualifier against Latvia at Wembley.

Gordon came on as a late substitute in the 2-0 victory over Albania on Friday night, which marked the start of the Thomas Tuchel era.

However, the winger needed treatment on the pitch after the full-time whistle and has since returned to Newcastle to be assessed.

With Bukayo Saka and Cole Palmer already missing through injury, it means Eberechi Eze and Jarrod Bowen are Tuchel's wing options should he want to refresh his side, after Marcus Rashford and Phil Foden started against Albania.

Speaking ahead of the Latvia game, Tuchel hinted that there will be a degree of rotation in his second lineup.

“We have reasons to let all of them play again and do stuff a bit better and find a rhythm together,” Tuchel said. “But we have reports from the physical department where some players are flagged with slight concerns.

“Let's see, it's only the second day after the match and we have to be cautious and could make sense to put some fresh players in who deserve to play. It could be a mix between both.”

Marc Guehi will hope to start at centre-back having been surprisingly overlooked for the Albania game. Guehi was one of England's standout performers at Euro 2024 last summer. but was left out of Tuchel's first XI in favour of debutant Dan Burn, who endured a somewhat shaky debut.

England predicted XI: Pickford; James, Konsa, Guehi, Lewis-Skelly; Rogers, Rice, Bellingham; Foden, Kane, Rashford

Injured: Gordon, Palmer

Time and date: 7.45pm GMT on Monday, March 24, 2025

ROME (AP) — Pope Francis returned home to the Vatican on Sunday after he was hospitalized for five weeks with a life-threatening bout of pneumonia.

The 88-year-old pope suffered two life-threatening crises while hospitalized, but by the beginning of the fourth week doctors said he was no longer in critical condition. After two weeks of stable condition, they said he was well enough to continue his convalescence at the Vatican. 

Here are highlights of the longest hospital stay of Francis' 12-year papacy, based on details provided by the Vatican:

Pope Francis is hospitalized with bronchitis and a slight fever immediately following a morning of audiences. Doctors diagnose a respiratory tract infection.

Pope Francis is diagnosed with polymicrobial (bacterial, viral and fungal) infection in the respiratory passages, marking a setback.

An X-ray indicates Pope Francis has developed pneumonia in both lungs, marking another setback; cortisone and antibiotic treatments are confirmed.

Pope's doctors say at a news conference that the pope remains in critical condition and isn't out of danger, but that his condition isn't imminently life-threatening. Doctors say the pope has developed steroid-induced diabetes that is being treated. Prognosis is guarded.

Pope in critical condition after experiencing a respiratory crisis and requires high-pressure oxygen through nasal tubes, in the first mention of assisted breathing. Francis also receives two blood transfusions after tests show signs of anemia and low platelet count that are later resolved. Setback.




Doctors report that the pope has gone into onset of slight kidney failure, in a setback. No repeat of the respiratory crisis, but he remains in critical condition.

The mild renal failure has regressed, in an improvement.

Pope suffers  isolated coughing spasm during which he inhaled vomit, in a setback requiring noninvasive aspiration. Responded well. Placed on a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask to pump supplemental oxygen into his lungs. Prognosis remains guarded.

Two acute bronchospasm episodes in a setback requiring bronchoscopies, or a camera-tipped tube with a device to remove mucus plugs, yielding abundant secretions. Pope remained alert, oriented and collaborative during maneuvers. Prognosis remains guarded.

Pope records an audio message that is broadcast to the faithful in St. Peter's Square thanking them for their prayers. His voice is weak and he's out of breath.

Doctors declare Francis is no longer in imminent danger of death from pneumonia, but keep him in the hospital for further treatment

Chest X-ray confirms improvement in pope's condition.

Pope marks 12th anniversary of papacy from the hospital, where he receives a cake and hundreds of messages and drawings with good wishes. No medical update. 

Pope marks one month in the hospital. Vatican announces it will cease issuing morning updates about the pope's rest overnight and will issue fewer medical bulletins in a sign of the continuing improvements in the pope's medical condition. 

The Vatican released the first photograph of Pope Francis during his hospitalization. The photo shows the pope seated from behind in front of the altar in the private chapel in the papal apartment at Gemelli hospital. No breathing tube is visible. 

Doctors announced that the pope will be dismissed from the hospital the next day, and that he will have a period of conavelesce of at least two months during which he is discouraged from meeting with large groups. 

A weak and frail Francis leaves Gemelli hospital for the Vatican after making a brief appearance on the hospital's balcony.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — More than 50,000 Palestinians have now been killed in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, the territory's Health Ministry said Sunday, as new Israeli airstrikes killed at least 26 Palestinians overnight, including a Hamas political leader and several women and children.

Israel's military also sent ground troops into part of the southern city of Rafah as thousands of Palestinians fled after new evacuation orders.

Israel ended the latest ceasefire last week with a surprise wave of strikes that killed hundreds, and it has launched ground incursions in northern Gaza. The military claimed to have “eliminated” dozens of militants in recent days.

Israel's Cabinet late Saturday approved a proposal to set up a new directorate for advancing the “voluntary departure” of Palestinians in line with U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to depopulate Gaza and rebuild it for others. Palestinians say they do not want to leave their homeland, and rights groups say the plan could amount to expulsion in violation of international law.




The military ordered people to leave Rafah's already heavily destroyed Tel al-Sultan neighborhood on foot along a single route to Muwasi, a sprawling area of squalid tent camps. The war has forced most of Gaza's population of over 2 million to flee within the territory, often multiple times.

“It's displacement under fire,” said Mustafa Gaber, a journalist who left with his family. He said tank and drone fire echoed nearby.

“The shells are falling among us and the bullets are (flying) above us,” said Amal Nassar, also displaced from Rafah. “The elderly have been thrown into the streets. An old woman was telling her son, ‘Go and leave me to die.' Where will we go?”

“Enough is enough. We are exhausted,” said a fleeing Ayda Abu Shaer, as black smoke rose in the distance.

The Palestinian Red Crescent emergency service said it lost contact with a team of medics responding to the strikes. Spokesperson Nebal Farsakh said some were wounded.

There was no immediate comment from Israel's military, which says it only targets militants. Israel blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas.

Hamas said Salah Bardawil, a well-known member of its political bureau, was killed in a strike in Muwasi that also killed his wife. Israel's military confirmed that.

Hospitals in southern Gaza said they received a further 24 bodies from strikes overnight, including several women and children.

Gaza's Health Ministry said 50,021 Palestinians have been killed in the war and over 113,000 have been wounded. That includes 673 people killed since Israel's bombardment on Tuesday shattered the ceasefire.

Dr. Munir al-Boursh, the ministry's general director, said the dead include 15,613 children, with 872 of them under 1 year old.

The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but says women and children make up over half the dead. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 fighters, without providing evidence.

The ceasefire that took hold in January paused more than a year of fighting ignited by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage. Most captives have been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

In the latest ceasefire's first phase, 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others were released in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces pulled back, allowing hundreds of thousands of people to return to what remains of their homes. There was a surge in humanitarian aid until Israel cut off all supplies to Gaza earlier this month to pressure Hamas to change the ceasefire agreement.

The sides were supposed to begin negotiations in early February on the ceasefire's next phase, in which Hamas was to release the remaining 59 hostages — 35 of them believed to be dead — in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal. Those talks never began.

Hundreds of Israelis gathered outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office in Jerusalem on Sunday to protest his handling of the war and his attempt to dismiss the head of the Shin Bet internal security service.

“I'm worried for the future of this country. And I think it has to stop. We have to change direction,” said one protester, Avital Halperin.

Israel's cabinet passed a measure Sunday creating 13 new settlements in the occupied West Bank by rezoning existing ones, according to Bezalel Smotrich, Israel's far-right finance minister, who is in charge of settlement construction.

This brings the number of settlements, considered illegal by the majority of the international community, to 140, said anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now. They will now receive independent budgets from Israel and can elect their own local governments, the group said.

In a separate development, Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who are allied with Hamas, launched another missile at Israel overnight. The Israeli military said it was intercepted, and there were no reports of casualties or damage.

The Houthis resumed attacks on Israel after it ended the Gaza ceasefire, portraying them as an act of solidarity with the Palestinians. Trump ordered the renewal of U.S. strikes on the rebels last week over its previous attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea.

Most of the ships the rebels have targeted have no connection to the conflict.

Private understanding ensures tending of British military graves in Russia and Crimea, and Soviet graves in UK

In graves at Murmansk, Arkhangelsk and Vladivostok, in Russia, lie the bodies of 663 British military personnel. Most of the dead lost their lives in the period just after the first world war, when allied troops were sent to support rightwing White forces in the Russian civil war against the Bolsheviks, while 41 are casualties from the second world war Arctic convoys.

Their resting places have been tended over decades by the Russian military and by private contractors, paid by the UK's Commonwealth War Graves Commission. But after Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, economic sanctions meant Britain could no longer pay for the graves to be maintained.

The two countries appear to have come to a private understanding, however. The commission has continued to maintain 674 Soviet graves in its cemeteries in the UK and around the world and, although it cannot be certain, it believes that the Russians are doing the same for the 663 British military personnel.

“We haven't seen the graves but we think they are still being maintained,” said Gareth Hardware, the commission's area director for the UK and northern countries. “We are maintaining their graves in our cemeteries.”

Officials at the commission, which is funded by Britain and other Commonwealth nations, think the majority of the graves are tended by the Russian navy, while a private contractor has continued to oversee plots in Arkhangelsk. “Although we are currently unable to pay him, we have written confirming we will when able to do so,” a spokesperson said.

Last summer, an amateur Russian historian took photographs of the graves in Arkhangelsk and they appeared to be in good condition. “The cemetery looks very well maintained. Someone is taking care of it, even in these difficult times,” he wrote in a blog post.

A British diplomat from the embassy in Moscow also went to Murmansk on Remembrance Day last year with a Russian counterpart and reported back that the cemetery there was in good condition.

At a commission conference at the Royal United Services Institute in London last week, the Russians' apparent respect for the British dead was welcomed. V Adm Peter Hudson, vice-chair of the commission, said: “It transcends even those very fraught national relationships which exist between our two countries today.”

Relations between London and Moscow have become so strained that earlier this month Britain was labelled Russia's public enemy number one after the country's foreign intelligence service accused the UK of trying to derail Donald Trump's attempts at a peace deal.

John Foreman, who served as Britain's defence attaché in Moscow from 2019 to 2022 and visited all but one of the eight Commonwealth war cemeteries or memorials in the country, said it was a sign of how bad relations were between the two nations that there was no treaty governing the upkeep of graves. “This is all a very difficult issue with Russia, as we don't have the treaties in place for all casualties of the 20th century,” he said. “I argued for a formal agreement while I was there.”

It is even more difficult in the Russian-occupied Crimea region of Ukraine, where mass burial grounds housing the remains of British soldiers from the Crimean war had already been built on or desecrated. “We've had no sight of those,” Foreman said, adding that British diplomats from Moscow and Kyiv had been prevented from getting there during the war.

Dirk Backen, general secretary of the German war graves commission, the Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge eV, still works with the Russians despite his country's strained relationship with Moscow. “It's the only thing still working,” he said. His commission oversees 600,000 German graves in Russia and other former areas of the eastern front. About 760,000 Soviet citizens were buried in Germany as a result of the second world war.

“We still recover Red Army soldiers in Germany each year and will provide them a proper grave in Germany,” he said. “And the Russian ambassador is invited, but is not allowed to give a speech in front of the TV camera because he will misuse this [to repeat] a narrative which explains why everything in Ukraine is justified.”

The commission's cemeteries around the world have immaculate green lawns designed to be a reminder of English gardens. As well as international relations, climate change is a challenge and the commission said cemeteries will be redesigned over time to be more sustainable, with local plants and, in many locations, a less manicured look.

“Israel has been in a constant baby boom since independence.”This comes from a normally understated source, Wikipedia. And it's true! Even in wartime.  From day one, Israelis have loved babies. For the past 76 years, we brought lots of them into the world – relatively more than in other Western country, where a baby bust has long been prevalent. And we continue to do so.This drive for procreation endures even during hard times. Despite it all, a new wartime baby boom is underway in Israel. AdvertisementMany countries have experienced baby booms after wars. Israel may be among the first to experience a baby boom during an ongoing war. Baby (Illustrative) (credit: Luma Pimentel/Unsplash)Writing in the Israeli daily Haaretz, Rachel Fink noted that despite 15 months of war, “Israel is experiencing a 10 percent increase in births during the final months of 2024 – after recent indications that Israel is experiencing a downturn in fertility.” She quoted Shlomo Winker, head of the Leumit Health Care Services medical division, who noted that a surge in the birth rate after a period of war or national tragedy is a known phenomenon. Yet “…the current baby boom is surprising, given that such surges usually occur after the war has come to an end.”Take my own family, for instance. My wife and I have been blessed with the birth of three great-grandchildren in the past year or so. We are sad when we think of friends, grandparents, in countries where babies are rather rare.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Let's look at the data. AdvertisementIsrael's fertility rate (children per woman) in 2024 was almost three. The comparable figure for the US is roughly half that. Same for Europe. Same for Russia (1.46), and lower for Japan (1.26).Declining birth rates create a paradox. It results in a shrinking labor force, hence a shortage of workers. Yet, in many countries – the US, the UK, the EU – there is a massive backlash against immigrants, a key source of labor, as seen in a sharp turn to the Right in politics.There is a more subtle effect related to national energy. When I visit countries with low birth rates, I sense a noticeable paucity of national energy. These countries feel like giant homes for the aged.  The US, Europe, Russia, China, and Japan are all below replacement – that is, natural increase is not enough to maintain the population. In China, the fertility rate, 1.18, reflects the one-child policy that China is desperately trying to reverse, in light of a labor shortage and shrinking population. Israel's fertility rate is at present double that of the world average, 1.5.China, Japan, and some European countries have sought to offer monetary incentives for couples to have children. But so far, the plan has failed. The birth rate needle has not budged.True, Israeli Ultra-Orthodox fertility is 6.1, boosting the average. But secular women's fertility rate still far exceeds that in Western countries.A baby (illustrative) (credit: INGIMAGE)Baby booms in historyDemographers claim that post-war baby booms date back to the early 1700s.In the 1930s to early 1940s, new births in the United States averaged 2.3 to 2.8 million annually. In 1946, the first year of the post-war baby boom, new births spiked to 3.47 million. New births continued to increase, leading to a peak of 4.3 million births in 1957 and 1961.During the US baby boom in 1946-64, some 78 million babies were born. The oldest among them are now reaching retirement age.I wrote my PhD thesis on the US baby boom, observing that the deer-in-the-python bulge of births continually surprised US governments as the boomers grew into adulthood, even though their impact – their need for schools, colleges, health care, and jobs over time – was easily predictable as the boomers grew from children to adults.Japan too had a baby boom, in 1947-49, and then an echo-effect boomlet in 1971-74, when the boomers themselves had children. Same for the US. These “echo boomers,” Generation Y, or millennials, make up nearly one-third of the US population.Russia's baby boom followed not war but the recovery after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 2012, the number of births outnumbered deaths for the first time since the Soviet Union was established. Ukraine, too, had a modest baby boom following the Orange Revolution in 2004-5, when mass protests finally brought a pro-West leader to the presidency.Not only wars can bring baby booms in their wake. So can pandemics.Ireland saw the birth rate rise sharply in 2021, the first annual increase since 2009. COVID brought “lockdown babies” into the world.More boys than girlsThere is a curious statistic regarding baby booms. In normal times, on average 5% more boys are born than girls. In post-war baby booms, that rises to 8% – the boy-girl ratio increases by 60%.Nobody knows why male births spike after wars. One theory is that babies conceived early in the woman's cycle tend to be male – and baby boom babies tend to be conceived early in the cycle.In Israel, in age groups of 15-64, men and women are roughly equal in numbers. The way this works is interesting. Some 10% more boys than girls are conceived. But more male embryos than female ones die before birth. Five percent more boys than girls are born.The life expectancy of women exceeds that of men by four years: 84.7 years for women, 80.7 years for men. The result is that at age 65 and older, there are 22% fewer men than women. This means there are more widows than widowers – a social problem not currently well addressed.A baby sits up, hands out (Illustrative) (credit: SHIR TOREM/FLASH90)Post-war baby booms in IsraelA Taub Center study by its research director Prof. Alex Weinreb examines birth rates after the Six Day War (1967), the Yom Kippur War (1973), and the Gaza War. He found that “in the aftermath of both of the earlier wars, there was an immediate positive impact on fertility, with fertility rising in 1968 and in 1974 back to the trendline, then climbing above the trendline for an additional two years.”Weinreb confirms a surprising fact about 2024. “Fertility in Israel took a new direction in the first five months of 2024, and instead of continuing to decline it returned to its 2022 level and even surpassed it.”Moreover, he adds, “the largest rise [in fertility] was among Jewish women.” The annualized total fertility rate of Jewish women between August and October 2024 was 3.19 children per woman, 0.4 children higher than in June-July, and 5% higher than during the same months in 2022.Weinreb also notes a not fully expected rise in aliyah in 2024. “…23,150 olim moved to Israel in the January-August 2024 period. That was higher than the number of olim in the equivalent period in any year in the 2012-2021 period other than 2019. …Israel sustained higher than average numbers of olim during the first year of war. That is an accomplishment.”How can we best understand Israel's baby boom? I believe it is related to the notion of the Jewish people as an am segula (“a unique moral nation”).The Egyptian, Persian, Roman, Greek, Ottoman, and Mongol empires have all fallen. The Jewish people emerged from the Holocaust, and we thrived.A strong theme of our Bible is that of continuity. “Choose life,” the Torah says. We are taught to pass our values on to our descendants, and we are taught why it is vital to have descendants. Holocaust victims survived against the odds and built new families, many of them in Israel.Babies are beautiful, every single one. It is what we live for. With them, we build our future. Without them, there is no future.■The writer heads the Zvi Griliches Research Data Center at S. Neaman Institute, Technion. He blogs at www.timnovate.wordpress.com.

In 1946, the first year of the post-war baby boom, new births spiked to 3.47 million. New births continued to increase, leading to a peak of 4.3 million births in 1957 and 1961.During the US baby boom in 1946-64, some 78 million babies were born. The oldest among them are now reaching retirement age.I wrote my PhD thesis on the US baby boom, observing that the deer-in-the-python bulge of births continually surprised US governments as the boomers grew into adulthood, even though their impact – their need for schools, colleges, health care, and jobs over time – was easily predictable as the boomers grew from children to adults.Japan too had a baby boom, in 1947-49, and then an echo-effect boomlet in 1971-74, when the boomers themselves had children. Same for the US. These “echo boomers,” Generation Y, or millennials, make up nearly one-third of the US population.Russia's baby boom followed not war but the recovery after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 2012, the number of births outnumbered deaths for the first time since the Soviet Union was established. Ukraine, too, had a modest baby boom following the Orange Revolution in 2004-5, when mass protests finally brought a pro-West leader to the presidency.Not only wars can bring baby booms in their wake. So can pandemics.Ireland saw the birth rate rise sharply in 2021, the first annual increase since 2009. COVID brought “lockdown babies” into the world.More boys than girlsThere is a curious statistic regarding baby booms. In normal times, on average 5% more boys are born than girls. In post-war baby booms, that rises to 8% – the boy-girl ratio increases by 60%.Nobody knows why male births spike after wars. One theory is that babies conceived early in the woman's cycle tend to be male – and baby boom babies tend to be conceived early in the cycle.In Israel, in age groups of 15-64, men and women are roughly equal in numbers. The way this works is interesting. Some 10% more boys than girls are conceived. But more male embryos than female ones die before birth. Five percent more boys than girls are born.The life expectancy of women exceeds that of men by four years: 84.7 years for women, 80.7 years for men. The result is that at age 65 and older, there are 22% fewer men than women. This means there are more widows than widowers – a social problem not currently well addressed.A baby sits up, hands out (Illustrative) (credit: SHIR TOREM/FLASH90)Post-war baby booms in IsraelA Taub Center study by its research director Prof. Alex Weinreb examines birth rates after the Six Day War (1967), the Yom Kippur War (1973), and the Gaza War. He found that “in the aftermath of both of the earlier wars, there was an immediate positive impact on fertility, with fertility rising in 1968 and in 1974 back to the trendline, then climbing above the trendline for an additional two years.”Weinreb confirms a surprising fact about 2024. “Fertility in Israel took a new direction in the first five months of 2024, and instead of continuing to decline it returned to its 2022 level and even surpassed it.”Moreover, he adds, “the largest rise [in fertility] was among Jewish women.” The annualized total fertility rate of Jewish women between August and October 2024 was 3.19 children per woman, 0.4 children higher than in June-July, and 5% higher than during the same months in 2022.Weinreb also notes a not fully expected rise in aliyah in 2024. “…23,150 olim moved to Israel in the January-August 2024 period. That was higher than the number of olim in the equivalent period in any year in the 2012-2021 period other than 2019. …Israel sustained higher than average numbers of olim during the first year of war. That is an accomplishment.”How can we best understand Israel's baby boom?

The Jewish people emerged from the Holocaust, and we thrived.A strong theme of our Bible is that of continuity. “Choose life,” the Torah says. We are taught to pass our values on to our descendants, and we are taught why it is vital to have descendants. Holocaust victims survived against the odds and built new families, many of them in Israel.Babies are beautiful, every single one. It is what we live for. With them, we build our future.

This drive for procreation endures even during hard times. Despite it all, a new wartime baby boom is underway in Israel. AdvertisementMany countries have experienced baby booms after wars. Israel may be among the first to experience a baby boom during an ongoing war. Baby (Illustrative) (credit: Luma Pimentel/Unsplash)Writing in the Israeli daily Haaretz, Rachel Fink noted that despite 15 months of war, “Israel is experiencing a 10 percent increase in births during the final months of 2024 – after recent indications that Israel is experiencing a downturn in fertility.” She quoted Shlomo Winker, head of the Leumit Health Care Services medical division, who noted that a surge in the birth rate after a period of war or national tragedy is a known phenomenon. Yet “…the current baby boom is surprising, given that such surges usually occur after the war has come to an end.”Take my own family, for instance. My wife and I have been blessed with the birth of three great-grandchildren in the past year or so. We are sad when we think of friends, grandparents, in countries where babies are rather rare.

Take my own family, for instance. My wife and I have been blessed with the birth of three great-grandchildren in the past year or so.

The US, Europe, Russia, China, and Japan are all below replacement – that is, natural increase is not enough to maintain the population.

The US, Europe, Russia, China, and Japan are all below replacement – that is, natural increase is not enough to maintain the population. In China, the fertility rate, 1.18, reflects the one-child policy that China is desperately trying to reverse, in light of a labor shortage and shrinking population. Israel's fertility rate is at present double that of the world average, 1.5.China, Japan, and some European countries have sought to offer monetary incentives for couples to have children. But so far, the plan has failed. The birth rate needle has not budged.True, Israeli Ultra-Orthodox fertility is 6.1, boosting the average. But secular women's fertility rate still far exceeds that in Western countries.A baby (illustrative) (credit: INGIMAGE)Baby booms in historyDemographers claim that post-war baby booms date back to the early 1700s.In the 1930s to early 1940s, new births in the United States averaged 2.3 to 2.8 million annually. In 1946, the first year of the post-war baby boom, new births spiked to 3.47 million. New births continued to increase, leading to a peak of 4.3 million births in 1957 and 1961.During the US baby boom in 1946-64, some 78 million babies were born. The oldest among them are now reaching retirement age.I wrote my PhD thesis on the US baby boom, observing that the deer-in-the-python bulge of births continually surprised US governments as the boomers grew into adulthood, even though their impact – their need for schools, colleges, health care, and jobs over time – was easily predictable as the boomers grew from children to adults.Japan too had a baby boom, in 1947-49, and then an echo-effect boomlet in 1971-74, when the boomers themselves had children. Same for the US. These “echo boomers,” Generation Y, or millennials, make up nearly one-third of the US population.Russia's baby boom followed not war but the recovery after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 2012, the number of births outnumbered deaths for the first time since the Soviet Union was established. Ukraine, too, had a modest baby boom following the Orange Revolution in 2004-5, when mass protests finally brought a pro-West leader to the presidency.Not only wars can bring baby booms in their wake. So can pandemics.Ireland saw the birth rate rise sharply in 2021, the first annual increase since 2009. COVID brought “lockdown babies” into the world.More boys than girlsThere is a curious statistic regarding baby booms. In normal times, on average 5% more boys are born than girls. In post-war baby booms, that rises to 8% – the boy-girl ratio increases by 60%.Nobody knows why male births spike after wars. One theory is that babies conceived early in the woman's cycle tend to be male – and baby boom babies tend to be conceived early in the cycle.In Israel, in age groups of 15-64, men and women are roughly equal in numbers. The way this works is interesting. Some 10% more boys than girls are conceived. But more male embryos than female ones die before birth. Five percent more boys than girls are born.The life expectancy of women exceeds that of men by four years: 84.7 years for women, 80.7 years for men. The result is that at age 65 and older, there are 22% fewer men than women.

I wrote my PhD thesis on the US baby boom, observing that the deer-in-the-python bulge of births continually surprised US governments as the boomers grew into adulthood, even though their impact – their need for schools, colleges, health care, and jobs over time – was easily predictable as the boomers grew from children to adults.Japan too had a baby boom, in 1947-49, and then an echo-effect boomlet in 1971-74, when the boomers themselves had children. Same for the US. These “echo boomers,” Generation Y, or millennials, make up nearly one-third of the US population.Russia's baby boom followed not war but the recovery after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 2012, the number of births outnumbered deaths for the first time since the Soviet Union was established. Ukraine, too, had a modest baby boom following the Orange Revolution in 2004-5, when mass protests finally brought a pro-West leader to the presidency.Not only wars can bring baby booms in their wake. So can pandemics.Ireland saw the birth rate rise sharply in 2021, the first annual increase since 2009. COVID brought “lockdown babies” into the world.More boys than girlsThere is a curious statistic regarding baby booms. In normal times, on average 5% more boys are born than girls. In post-war baby booms, that rises to 8% – the boy-girl ratio increases by 60%.Nobody knows why male births spike after wars. One theory is that babies conceived early in the woman's cycle tend to be male – and baby boom babies tend to be conceived early in the cycle.In Israel, in age groups of 15-64, men and women are roughly equal in numbers. The way this works is interesting. Some 10% more boys than girls are conceived. But more male embryos than female ones die before birth. Five percent more boys than girls are born.The life expectancy of women exceeds that of men by four years: 84.7 years for women, 80.7 years for men. The result is that at age 65 and older, there are 22% fewer men than women. This means there are more widows than widowers – a social problem not currently well addressed.A baby sits up, hands out (Illustrative) (credit: SHIR TOREM/FLASH90)Post-war baby booms in IsraelA Taub Center study by its research director Prof. Alex Weinreb examines birth rates after the Six Day War (1967), the Yom Kippur War (1973), and the Gaza War. He found that “in the aftermath of both of the earlier wars, there was an immediate positive impact on fertility, with fertility rising in 1968 and in 1974 back to the trendline, then climbing above the trendline for an additional two years.”Weinreb confirms a surprising fact about 2024. “Fertility in Israel took a new direction in the first five months of 2024, and instead of continuing to decline it returned to its 2022 level and even surpassed it.”Moreover, he adds, “the largest rise [in fertility] was among Jewish women.” The annualized total fertility rate of Jewish women between August and October 2024 was 3.19 children per woman, 0.4 children higher than in June-July, and 5% higher than during the same months in 2022.Weinreb also notes a not fully expected rise in aliyah in 2024. “…23,150 olim moved to Israel in the January-August 2024 period. That was higher than the number of olim in the equivalent period in any year in the 2012-2021 period other than 2019. …Israel sustained higher than average numbers of olim during the first year of war. That is an accomplishment.”How can we best understand Israel's baby boom?

Weinreb confirms a surprising fact about 2024. “Fertility in Israel took a new direction in the first five months of 2024, and instead of continuing to decline it returned to its 2022 level and even surpassed it.”Moreover, he adds, “the largest rise [in fertility] was among Jewish women.” The annualized total fertility rate of Jewish women between August and October 2024 was 3.19 children per woman, 0.4 children higher than in June-July, and 5% higher than during the same months in 2022.Weinreb also notes a not fully expected rise in aliyah in 2024. “…23,150 olim moved to Israel in the January-August 2024 period. That was higher than the number of olim in the equivalent period in any year in the 2012-2021 period other than 2019. …Israel sustained higher than average numbers of olim during the first year of war.

        At least three people were killed in drone attacks on Kyiv, and another four were killed in drone attacks in Donetsk region, local officials said.
    

The attack on Kyiv came ahead of ceasefire negotiations in Saudi Arabia in which Ukraine and Russia are expected to hold indirect U.S.-mediated talks on Monday to discuss a pause in long-range attacks targeting energy facilities and civilian infrastructure.

The Ukrainian delegation is expected to meet with U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia a day ahead of the indirect talks, Ukrainian President Voldoymyr Zelenskyy said. Ukraine is planning to send technical teams to discuss the details of the partial ceasefire.

Russia launched 147 drones across Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian Air Force. Ukrainian air defences shot down 97 and 25 others didn't reach targets due to Ukrainian countermeasures. The attacks struck the Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, Odesa and Donetsk regions, as well as the capital, Kyiv.

Three people, including a 5-year-old child, were killed and 10 others were injured in a drone attack on Kyiv, the city's military administration said. Extended sounds of explosions were heard across the city in the early hours of the night as the air raid blared for over five hours. Russian drones and debris from shot-down drones, which were flying at lower altitudes to evade air defenses, fell on residential buildings.

Ukrainians at the scene of the attacks in Kyiv surveyed the damage done to their homes and neighbourhoods on Sunday morning. Many were disparaging of the upcoming ceasefire talks, pointing to the burnt-out homes destroyed in the drone attack, saying these were more indicative of Russia's true intentions.

In an old multistory building on Kyiv's left bank that was damaged in the overnight attack, Dmytro Zapadnya, 37, said he had no faith in Russia upholding any ceasefire agreement.

“There is no point in signing anything (with Russians), because it will not be worth the cost of paper where you put this signature. Well, the only thing that is not very pleasant is that now the United States seems to have little understanding of our situation,” he said.

Elsewhere, four people were killed in Russian attacks on Ukraine's Donetsk region, regional Gov. Vadym Filashkin said, including three who died in a strike on the front-line Ukrainian town of Dobropillya.

In a statement on social media, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said attacks such as the one in Kyiv were a daily occurrence for Ukraine.

“This week alone, more than 1,580 guided aerial bombs, almost 1,100 strike drones and 15 missiles of various types were used against our people,” he said. “New solutions are needed, with new pressure on Moscow to stop both these strikes and this war.”

Also on Sunday, Russia's Ministry of Defence said it had shot down 59 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 29 over the region of Rostov and 20 more over southwestern Astrakhan. In Rostov, one person was killed and a car caught fire due to the Ukrainian drone attack, according to the area's temporary governor, Yuri Slyusar.

A woman also died in the Russian border village of Novostroyevka-Pervaya in the Belgorod region when a Ukrainian drone hit a car in which she was traveling.

The driver, the woman's daughter, was also seriously injured in the attack, said local Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov.

The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Sunday that at least 50,021 people have been killed in the Palestinian territory since war with Israel began in October 2023.

"The toll for the Israeli aggression has reached 50,021 martyrs and 113,274 wounded since October 7, 2023", a ministry statement said, referring to the day Hamas launched the attack on Israel that triggered the war. The territory's civil defence agency, citing its own records, also said the death count had topped 50,000 deaths.

Standing beside the bodies of two men lying on the ground, blood pooling around one of them, in the Syrian village of Qabo Al-Awamiya in the Latakia countryside, a woman shouts in despair: “God won't forgive you.”

“Are those your sons? God won't forgive you,” one of the men she's speaking to, who is out of frame and appears to be holding the camera, responds. “You started it,” he says, as he issues a chilling threat: “I swear, we're going to crush every Alawite.”

The exact circumstances surrounding the footage were not immediately clear. But it is one of more than 15 videos geolocated and verified by NBC News capturing the deadly violence that unfolded in Syria last week after fighters loyal to the ousted Assad regime attacked government forces on March 6, setting off a wave of revenge killings largely targeting the Alawite community, the small Islamic sect to which the Assad family belongs.

In one video, an armed man can be seen pummeling and taunting another man, before setting him free only to shoot him as he runs away; in another, men are forced to crawl on their hands and knees before being shot. In several others, bodies can be seen amassed on streets and in mass graves in areas across Latakia, a former stronghold of ousted Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.

A sweeping response from security forces has stabilized the violence, but imagery has laid bare the deep divisions coursing through Syrian society after more than a decade of civil war, with the deadly attacks highlighting the colossal challenge the country's interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, faces in his bid to fulfill his vow to lead a more unified and inclusive Syria.

More than 1,300 people were killed in a dayslong eruption of violence earlier this month after the retaliatory attacks were launched following the assault on security forces, with more than 970 civilians, mostly from the Alawite community, among those killed, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Hundreds of Syrian government soldiers and fighters loyal to Assad were also killed in clashes.

The majority of the killings were focused in the governorates of Latakia and Tartus along the Mediterranean coast, both former Assad strongholds and home to majority-Alawite populations. Hundreds of people were also killed in Hama, further inland, and elsewhere.

Some have accused government forces of being behind the retaliatory attacks, with the violence fueling doubts about Sharaa's own stance as his past life as a jihadi leader continues to hang over his future ambitions.

Those accusations have come despite Sharaa's own calls for peace amid the violence, as well as his decision to launch an investigation into the violence, vowing to bring those responsible to justice.

One member of the Alawite community, who spoke on the condition of anonymity over fears for his safety, told NBC News that promise gave him little reassurance.

The 24-year-old man described how he and his neighbors in a town in the governorate of Hama were forced out of their homes on March 7 by “masked groups.” He said he noticed one white vehicle with the words “Public Security” emblazoned on it.

“They forced us out of the house and made us kneel on the ground, warning us, ‘Be quiet and don't say a word, or I will shoot you,'” he said in messages on Monday. He said at least two of his neighbors were taken by the men and later found dead, sharing images with NBC News showing the two men lying on the ground bloodied, one with a severe wound through his left eye.

NBC News was not able to independently verify the details of his account. But now, he said, he lives in fear of another attack and is “considering seeking asylum in another country because of the fear and terror.”

The man said he was not an Assad supporter but that under the regime, he had felt more protected as an Alawite. He said he felt convinced that the current government had at least some role in the attacks against his community.

It's a sentiment many are likely to share in the Alawite community, said Tim Eaton, a senior research fellow in the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House.

He noted that Assad's ties to the Alawite community, as well as the community's strong presence within the regime, created a “kind of dependency,” while also exacerbating “the animosity of those opposing the regime.”

The deadly violence in recent days marks a major turning point in Syria following Assad's ouster, led by Sharaa's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, rebel group, highlighting the difficulties Syria's leader faces in navigating a complicated security landscape rife with sectarian divisions that simmered for months before coming to a boil.

Muhsen al-Mustafa, a research assistant at the Istanbul-based Omran Center for Strategic Studies, said in a phone interview Monday that while he felt the security situation in Syria was more stable now, there was still widespread “confusion” about the state of “peace inside the country.”

“This feels to be a major test of rule of law and the rhetoric of Sharaa's leadership,” Eaton said in a separate phone interview Thursday.

But, he said, “I feel like the response to it is going to be the more decisive part to it, because is he going to be able to rein these elements in? Is he going to actually walk the talk in terms of holding [those responsible for the violence] accountable?”

“The challenges are so incredibly steep,” he said.

A South Korean family of three, including Jiyeon Lee, 33, her mother Taehee Kim, 59, and aunt Junghee Kim, 54, have mysteriously vanished while on a trip to the Grand Canyon. They were last seen heading from the Grand Canyon to Las Vegas earlier this month, the New York Post reported. 

According to the Coconino County Sheriff's Office, GPS data from their rented white BMW showed they were last on Interstate 40 in Williams, Arizona, about 35 minutes west of Flagstaff. The family's disappearance has been reported to the authorities, and a search is currently underway.

The Coconino County Sheriff's Office issued a missing person alert for the South Korean family and released a poster on Facebook on March 21. The poster includes their photos, and details about the missing individuals and urges anyone with information to come forward and assist in the investigation.

Here is the Facebook post:



On the same day, a snowstorm on the highway led to a 22-car crash, resulting in two deaths and 16 injuries. The incident has raised suspicions that the crash might be connected to the disappearance of three South Korean women. 

"A major accident occurred on the highway around the same time their phone's location signals were picked up, so the missing people might be connected to it," a local police officer said.

While police haven't confirmed their involvement, Coconino Sheriff's spokesman Jon Paxton stated that it's a possibility being investigated, as per ABC News. 

After losing contact with the trio, who were supposed to return to South Korea on March 17, their family members contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for assistance. An official from the Republic of Korea Consulate General in Los Angeles said, "We supplied all relevant information to local authorities and sent staff to the area to assist with the swift search for the missing family."

The sheriff's office conducted a thorough search of the area, service roads, and hospitals over three days but has now exhausted all leads.

        Despite huge investment and award-winning shows, Apple TV+ is still struggling to make a mark and reportedly losing up to a billion euros a year.
    

Apple is reportedly losing $1 billion (€923 million) a year on its streaming service. As the last episode of the second season of its hit show ‘Severance' airs this week, it's a damning indictment of the tech firm's Netflix competitor. 

Two sources close to the company confirmed to The Information that the tech firm has spent $5 billion (€4.62 billion) a year on Apple TV+ since it launched in 2019. 

Apple's huge investment into the video streaming market hasn't reaped a similarly sized subscriber base. Despite shows like ‘Severance' and ‘Ted Lasso', it lags significantly behind competitors Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+. 

Netflix has the largest number of subscribers at just over 300 million. While Amazon Prime Video operates on a slightly different model, allowing non-subscribers access to individual titles to rent and buy, it's estimated to have around 200 million subscribers. Disney+ also is estimated to have around 125 million subscribers. 

Although Apple hasn't officially revealed its subscriber count, as it doesn't release it as an individual statistic separate from other services like Apple Pay, The Information reports it at a lowly 45 million subscribers. 

Given Apple is one of the biggest companies on the planet, something is going disastrously wrong for the tech firm's foray into video streaming content. 

It's not like they haven't heaped piles of cash on impressive shows. Chiefly, there's ‘Severance'. The dark sci-fi series about office workers with split consciousnesses was nominated for 14 Emmys after its first season in 2022. The Ben Stiller-produced show returned to screens this year and has immediately been in contention for the prestige TV gongs alongside ‘The White Lotus' and ‘Adolescence'. 

Similarly, Apple has had other hits in shows like ‘Ted Lasso', an upbeat football comedy series, and ‘The Morning Show', a satire of network broadcasting shows. Across its original programming, Apple TV+ shows have earned more than 2,500 award nominations and 538 wins, Tim Cook, Apple CEO said in January. 

On the film front, Apple has also been no slouch. It achieved its first Best Picture win at the Oscars with CODA. It has since supported multiple high-profile directors to produce bold award season-friendly work like Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, Ridley Scott's Napoleon, and Steve McQueen's Blitz. 

Yet somehow, all this money isn't translating into subscribers. Apple is watching its investment pour straight down the drain. 

A major part of the problem is in the lack of social caché Apple TV+ seemingly has. Major stars sign up for expensive projects just for them to be dumped on the service without enough hype for it to drum up the kind of publicity that is innate to an HBO release. 

“Water Cooler Television” is a term in the industry to describe the kinds of shows that would leave such a widespread cultural impression, it would inevitably become the topic of conversation in offices around the world the next morning. 

Classic examples of water cooler TV are the slick big budget shows that came out of the beginning of the 21st century like ‘The Sopranos', ‘Breaking Bad' and most recently ‘Succession'. Through its decades-long reputation and weekly release schedule, HBO has been a master at capturing the ephemerality of a water cooler moment. 

‘Severance' is Apple's first show that has somewhat replicated that level of cultural significance. Thanks to its deeply mysterious plot and confusing cliffhangers, each week it has become a genuine competitor for people's attention. 

It's the first time Apple has managed this feat though. There are countless examples of shows that had all the making of cultural impact only to land on entirely deaf ears.

Last year, the platform premiered ‘Disclaimer', the first TV series from Oscar-winning Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón starring Cate Blanchett. With such an impressive roll-sheet, it's no surprise that the show debuted at the Venice Film Festival. Alas, even Blanchett couldn't save ‘Disclaimer' from the rubbish heap of unexciting Apple shows. 

Adaptations of beloved novels like ‘Lessons in Chemistry', ‘Pachinko' and ‘Shantaram' couldn't move the needle. Nor could ‘Band of Brothers' spiritual successor ‘Masters of the Air' make ratings soar. On the flip-side, Apple has angered fans by cancelling shows early, as with the musical comedy series ‘Schmigadoon!' which lasted a paltry two series – make ‘Into the Schmoods', you cowards. 

As with TV where streamers are loath to release viewership figures, it's hard to gauge the success of its film output even with box office figures. Killers of the Flower Moon, for example, was officially a commercial flop, grossing $158.8 million (€146.7 million) worldwide against a roughly $215 million (€198.6 million) budget. 

Napoleon, which also benefited from a theatrical release in late 2023, at least managed to make around $221.4 million (€204.6 million) against its budget of approximately $200 million (€184.5 million. While industry papers estimated it fell way short of breaking even, Apple insisted the film was profitable. 

Both films from highly-esteemed directors were given a rare chance for streaming service films. They were given theatrical releases and only appeared on the streaming platforms many months later. 

Apple is also clearly not ready to throw in the towel when it comes to investing in big-budget film. Coming up this year alone is the hyped F1 film from Top Gun: Maverick director Joseph Kosinski, as well as the newest films from Guy Ritchie, Spike Lee, and Paul Greengrass. 

Concerns over cultural impact of shows dumped on streamers is not a problem solely owned by them. Time and again, Netflix releases a show to huge fanfare the week it airs only for it to fall out of conversation almost immediately. ‘Severance', which has just been officially renewed for a third season, may see a tide change for the tech company's nascent streaming venture. But whether Apple's big financial gambit on streaming success will pay off remains to be seen.

Both the national police and a UN-backed security force have failed to staunch the year-long insurgency, with more than a million people displaced

By day, the stressed-out Haitian police officer patrols the streets of his beleaguered city with an Israeli assault rifle to do his bit to resist the onslaught of the gangs. By night, the 28-year-old returns home to his increasingly empty neighbourhood wondering what calamity may unfold as he rests.

“Yesterday afternoon … there was panic, heavy gunfire ... It was tense … there was continuous gunfire throughout the day,” the officer said this week as the battle for control of Port-au-Prince raged on.

“I wondered if by the time I woke up the next morning, I would still recognise the city,” added the officer, a member of a specialised rapid-response unit tasked with thwarting the advance of the gangs. “I fear we'll wake up to the announcement that Port-au-Prince has fallen.”

The officer, who asked not to be named, is not alone in his trepidation.

The year-old criminal insurrection in Haiti's capital has plumbed new depths in recent days, fuelling speculation that the entire city – the third-largest in the Caribbean – may be on the verge of falling into the hands of a coalition of heavily armed gangs called Viv Ansanm (Live Together).

Frantz Duval, the head of Haiti's oldest newspaper, Le Nouvelliste, warned in a despondent editorial that the fall of Haiti's capital could be imminent. “Like Phnom Penh overrun by the Khmer Rouge, Saigon swallowed by north Vietnamese troops, Tripoli after Muammar Gaddafi's fall, Sana'a seized by the Houthis, or Kabul taken by the Taliban – Port-au-Prince has been hanging by a thread for long enough that one must now fear the rumours and cries of anguish are not mere echoes, but the sound of its final collapse,” he wrote.

Duval said that since the criminal uprising began in February 2024 “the situation has spiralled completely out of control”. Just over a year later, Port-au-Prince is on the brink, with at least 60,000 people fleeing their homes over the past month to escape the fighting, according to UN estimates. More than a million have been displaced since the mutiny was launched.

“In recent hours, countless ministries, public services and families have fled areas that were once considered safe,” Duval reported, as gang combatants continued to advance, burning buildings and threatening to completely commandeer Haiti's capital.

“The gangs' assaults, punctuated by bursts of automatic gunfire … leave flight as the only option,” Duval wrote. Yet for most Haitians, escape is now impossible, he added: “Every exit from the capital is under the control of armed groups.”

“Fear is written all over people's faces,” said Rosy Auguste Ducéna, a human-rights activist who works with the victims of gang violence and has spent recent days watching displaced people stream past her group's offices carrying suitcases and bags. “It feels like the population is suffering while the authorities stand by and do nothing.”

The disintegration of Port-au-Prince has been a torturous and gradual process, rooted in centuries of colonial exploitation, foreign meddling, brutal dictatorship, political corruption and dysfunction, and a series of devastating natural disasters such as the 2010 earthquake.

Now, some fear the security situation could be close to completely unraveling, with a succession of once-safe areas such as Solino and Nazon falling under the control of gangs, aid workers from the medical group Médecins Sans Frontières coming under fire, and the headquarters of Haiti's oldest radio station being torched.

Earlier this month, the city's mayor, Youri Chevry, admitted that his government only controlled about 30% of the city, with several key areas “in a state of war”.

On Wednesday, thousands of protesters took to the streets to denounce the violence – and the government's failure to contain it. “We are ready to die to defend our neighborhoods, our families, and our homes. We are ready to take responsibility. If we must die, we will die standing, without surrendering,” one protester told Le Nouvelliste, as armed self-defense groups erected roadblocks to defend communities yet to be conquered by the gangs.

William O'Neill, a UN human-rights expert who visited Port-au-Prince earlier this month, saw no exaggeration in comparisons with Saigon or Kabul: “The sense of fear is palpable. The sense [that] the city is on the edge of totally falling into the hands of the gangs is really strong.”

“This is really dramatic. I can't overstate it. It's incredibly urgent and frightening,” warned O'Neill, who said the wealthy hilltop districts around Pétionville were now “pretty much the last safe areas in the capital”. “But [for] how long? That's the question,” he added.

Things were supposed to have turned out differently.

When a transitional government was set up last April, after the prime minister, Ariel Henry, was ousted by the criminal rebellion, its members voiced optimism that the situation could be reversed. “Today is an important day in the life of our dear republic. This day in effect opens a view to a solution,” declared Henry's temporary replacement, Michel Patrick Boisvert.

Three months later, the first members of a planned 2,500-strong, UN-backed security force were deployed, with its commanders also insisting peace could be restored.

But so far only about 1,000 members of that Kenya-led operation have reached Haiti. Experts say they are woefully ill-equipped for their fight against Haiti's powerful, politically linked gangs, as is the country's embattled national police force.

Last week, a 26-year-old Kenyan police constable, Samuel Tompoi, was buried in Kenya after being shot dead while patrolling – the first member of the mission to die in the line of duty. He left a 23-year-old wife and two children.

“They're outnumbered and outgunned … They need helicopters to move around easily and safely … they need night-vision goggles, body armour, you name it – and they need more people,” O'Neill said, also calling for an arms embargo to stop guns being smuggled to Haiti from the US.

In their desperation, Haitian police have started employing dramatic tactics similar to those used on the battlefield in Ukraine.

Recent weeks have seen reports of a series of suicide drone attacks, targeting gang bosses who live deep in Port-au-Prince's maze-like shantytowns, surrounded by barricades and guards. “With kamikaze drones we can reach places police officers can't go,” the police officer explained.

Françoise Ponticq, a French dentist who works in a clinic near the partly deserted Champ de Mars plaza, heard “loud blasts” last week as those drones were detonated, although precisely where she could not say.

Of one thing Ponticq was sure: Port-au-Prince had reached a perilous crossroads. “It's either the gangs take us, or we take them,” she said. “It's a coin toss, in my opinion.”

Five of the United States' NATO allies, including Canada, issued fresh travel warnings as President Donald Trump's immigration officials repeatedly detained several tourists at the border. Denmark, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Finland have revised their guidelines.

Some of the warnings note that the State Department has suspended its policy allowing transgender, intersex and nonbinary people to update the sex field on their passports.

Ottawa updated its travel advisories for the US and China. Citizens staying in the United States for over 30 days will need to register, or face penalties. Canada's update on China comes after Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joy confirmed that China executed four Canadians in recent months.

President Donald Trump's administration had made the registration mandatory. Earlier, Canadians were not required to carry a visa or register to travel to the US.

“Canadians and other foreign nationals visiting the United States for periods longer than 30 days must be registered with the United States Government. Failure to comply with the registration requirement could result in penalties, fines, and misdemeanor prosecution,” the advisory states.

German Foreign Office is warning citizens that using the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) or a visa does not guarantee the right to enter the US, local media website DER SPIEGEL reported.

The report added that the foreign office states that only US border officials have the final authority to let a tourist enter the country.

“The final decision as to whether a person can enter the United States rests with the American border authorities. But that's no surprise; it's the same in Germany,” a spokesperson told the outlet.

The UK foreign office warned citizens that they ‘should comply with all entry, visa and other conditions of entry'.

“The authorities in the US set and enforce entry rules strictly. You may be liable to arrest or detention if you break the rules. If you're not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the US Embassy or a consulate in the UK,” the advisory states.

In their advisories, Denmark and Finland warned citizens. Finland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the US recognizes only two sexes and if the gender listed on an applicant's passport ‘does not match their gender assigned at birth, their travel permit or visa application can be denied'.

Denmark issued a similar warning. It adds that travelers risk being detained.

        A court formally arrested Ekrem Imamoglu, a key rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan early on Sunday and ordered him jailed pending the outcome of a trial on corruption charges.
    

Imamoglu was detained following a raid on his residence earlier this week, sparking the largest wave of street demonstrations in Turkey in more than a decade. It also deepened concerns, among Turks and outside Turkey, over democracy and rule of law.  

His imprisonment is widely regarded as a political move to remove a major contender from the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. 

Government officials reject accusations that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated and insist that Turkey's courts operate independently. 

The formal arrest came as his opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP, began holding a primary presidential election to endorse Imamoglu as its presidential candidate despite the arrest. 

The party has also set up symbolic ballot boxes nationwide — called “solidarity boxes” — to allow people who are not party members to express their support to the mayor. 

“Honestly, we are embarrassed in the name of our legal system,” Ankara Mayor Mansur Yavas, a fellow member of Imamoglu's CHP, told reporters, criticising the lack of confidentiality in the proceedings. 

“We learned from television pundits about the allegations that even lawyers did not have access to, showing how politically motivated this whole ordeal has been,” he said. 

A post from Imamoglu's X account requested his followers "run to the ballot" on Sunday: 

"I invite my 86 million citizens to run to the ballot box and announce their struggle for democracy and justice to the entire world."

Before his detention, Imamoglu had already faced multiple criminal cases that could result in prison sentences and a political ban. He was also appealing a 2022 conviction for insulting members of Turkey's Supreme Electoral Council. 

Earlier in the week, a university nullified his diploma, citing alleged irregularities in his transfer from a private university in northern Cyprus some 30 years ago. The decision effectively bars him from running for president, since the position requires candidates to be university graduates. Imamoglu had vowed to challenge the decision.  

Imamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey's largest city in March 2019, in a major blow to Erdogan and the president's Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. Erdogan's party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities. 

The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won. 

The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which the CHP made significant gains against Erdogan's governing party.  

On Saturday clashes had erupted between police and protesters in Istanbul on the fourth day of demonstrations following Imamoglu's detention.

Police used pepper spray and tear gas to disperse crowds and push back hundreds of protesters who were hurling flares, stones and other objects at officers.

The Istanbul governor's office announced it was expanding a ban on demonstrations until 26 March, and imposed restrictions on the entry and exit of vehicles deemed to be transporting people “likely to participate in unlawful activities”; protesting.

Erdogan addressed the protests that have taken part across the country over the past four days calling for Imamoglu's release, in an Iftar – the meal eaten to break fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan – speech.

The Turkish president accused the opposition of trying to create “an atmosphere of tension and chaos”.

“I believe it is worth reminding once again that the days of going out into the streets, taking left-wing organisations, extremists, and Vandals with you, and threatening the national will are now behind us,” said Erdogan.

“The days when politics and justice were directed through street terror are now completely a thing of the past, along with old Turkey.”

Other protesters gathered outside Istanbul city hall – Imamoglu's designated office – where protests have been taking place daily since the mayor's arrest.

The demonstrations mark the largest wave of protests in Turkey in more than a decade.

Protests were largely peaceful, but a group of protesters, trying to break through barricades to reach Istanbul's main square, threw flares, stones and other objects at police.

Protesters say pepper spray was used against them, along with water cannons, tear gas and some even claim officers fired rubber bullets.

Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya says 343 suspects were detained in nationwide protests in major cities on Friday night.

He also added that “there will be no tolerance for those who seek to violate societal order, threaten the people's peace and security, and pursue chaos and provocation.”

A Delhi-based content creator almost got away with a free meal at a five-star hotel by pretending to be a guest, until her ploy was caught and she was forced to pay ₹3,600 for the meal she had just enjoyed. Nishu Tiwari dressed up in pyjamas and drove to a fancy hotel in the national capital, where she gave a fake room number to the staff and tricked them into leading her right to the breakfast buffet area.

Here, Tiwari and her team member enjoyed a huge breakfast and would have gotten away with it too - if not for her team member forgetting their phone inside the breakfast area. When staff called the room number provided by Tiwari, they realised they had been taken in. The Delhi woman was stopped and asked for an explanation, after which she then offered to pay for the breakfast.

“The hotel staff was laughing with us. They were also surprised to realise someone could trick them like this,” Tiwari told HT.com over a telephonic conversation.

According to Tiwari, the video is part of her ‘Unethical Life Hacks' series where she tries things that fall in the moral grey area. Earlier this month, Tiwari and her team member dressed up in pyjamas and drove to a five-star hotel in Delhi's posh Chanakyapuri area to see if they could get away with a free breakfast by pretending to be hotel guests.

To complete the deception, the content creator even carried a robe with her. Outside the five-star hotel's breakfast area, she provided the number of a room where she was not actually staying.

In her video, Tiwari explained that she got a room number through a blog post on the hotel.

The hotel staff did not question her claims. Instead, she was led into the breakfast room, where she tucked into a full spread, not believing her luck. “Mujhe vishwas nahi ho raha ki ye hack sach mein kaam kar gaya (I can't believe this hack actually worked),” she tells the camera at one point.

Tiwari told HT.com that her team member forgetting their phone inside led to their ploy being found out. Already out on the street after the successful scam, they had to turn back and return to the hotel. When staff asked her to confirm her room number, Tiwari told them 3206.

The staff then informed her that a guest by another name was staying in that room. Tiwari tried to play it off as an honest mistake, saying they had travelled to the wrong hotel. Admitting they were not guests at the hotel, the Delhi-based influencer ended up paying more than ₹3,600 for the meal.

Her video prompted censure and amusement in equal measures.

“What type of joker are you?” asked one person. “Haha it was fun watching this,” another wrote.

“It is possible you might have made this video as a joke, but the people who are watching your video can get such idea. So why should we give such a message that people get inclined to do such things?” asked one Instagram user. “I did not find this video funny from any angle, I hope that your video did not send the wrong message to anyone, otherwise, many people get into trouble and such names also get spoiled.”

Some even raised doubts about the authenticity of the video, with one person writing: “You briefed the hotel about this reel isn't? No hotel buffet or lounge allows video shoots like that.” Tiwari countered this by saying hotel staff does not stop people from filming themselves.

Bharatiya Janta Party's Twitter handle is sharing their appreciation for John Abraham's latest film. Titled The Diplomat, it stars Abraham in the role of diplomat JP Singh, who steps in to rescue an Indian woman named Uzma from Pakistan. Now, the Twitter handle for the BJP has shared a long thread on the real incident that the movie is based on.

“India's diplomatic strength was on full display in May 2017 when the Modi Government rescued Uzma Ahmed from a forced marriage in Pakistan. Recently dramatised in the John Abraham-starrer 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑡, this real-life operation showcased swift governance, led by former EAM Late Smt Sushma Swaraj Ji and diplomat J.P. Singh, ensuring Uzma's safe return,” they wrote and followed it with multiple tweets on the real story.

"Uzma Ahmed's ordeal began when she was deceived by a Pakistani man in Malaysia and lured to Pakistan, where she was drugged, forced into marriage at gunpoint, assaulted, and held captive in Buner, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In her own words, after returning to India, Uzma described Pakistan as a ‘well of death,' stating, 'It's easy to go to Pakistan, but tough to return'."

“Trapped in Pakistan, Uzma tricked the greedy Ali into taking her to the Indian High Commission under the pretext of collecting dowry. Once inside, she revealed her ordeal to Deputy High Commissioner J.P. Singh, who acted swiftly, ensured her safety and informed the-then EAM Sushma Swaraj. Upon verifying her Indian citizenship, Swaraj firmly declared, '𝐸𝑣𝑒𝑛 𝑖𝑓 𝑤𝑒 ℎ𝑎𝑣𝑒 𝑡𝑜 𝑘𝑒𝑒𝑝 ℎ𝑒𝑟 𝑎𝑡 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝐻𝑖𝑔ℎ 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑎 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 𝑜𝑟 𝑡𝑤𝑜, 𝑤𝑒 𝑤𝑖𝑙𝑙.'”

“Amidst a tense legal battle, diplomat J.P. Singh became a warrior who oversaw Uzma's legal fight, overcoming Pakistan's laws requiring a husband's permission to leave. On May 24, 2017, the Islamabad High Court ruled in her favour. The next day, she crossed the Wagah Border, ending her three-week ordeal and marking a major diplomatic victory for India.”

“Uzma Ahmed's rescue showcased the Modi government's commitment to protecting Indian citizens abroad, irrespective of their social status, caste, creed, gender or religion. Sushma Swaraj's hands-on diplomacy and J.P. Singh's swift intervention ensured her safe return. Grateful upon reaching India, Uzma declared, ‘I'm proud to be Indian. Sushma madam saved me; they could've sold me!' highlighting the life-saving impact of India's decisive action.”

The thread added, "This is PM Modi's India, where leadership is defined by action, diplomacy by resolve, and citizens' safety remains paramount. From Uzma's daring rescue to large-scale evacuations like Ukraine, India has proven time and again that no citizen is ever alone. As Sushma Ji once said, '𝐸𝑣𝑒𝑛 𝑖𝑓 𝑦𝑜𝑢 𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑐𝑘 𝑜𝑛 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑠, 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛 𝐸𝑚𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑦 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑤𝑖𝑙𝑙 ℎ𝑒𝑙𝑝 𝑦𝑜𝑢.' Indians are never alone!"

The film, which was released on March 14, received acclaim from critics and audiences and has earned Rs. 4.03 crore on day one at the domestic box office.

US President Donald Trump announced that Boeing has been awarded the contract to produce the US Air Force's next-generation fighter jet, the F-47. The aircraft, classified as a sixth-generation fighter, is expected to be the most advanced fighter jet ever developed."I'm thrilled to announce that, at my direction, the United States Air Force is moving forward with the world's first sixth-generation fighter jet, and nothing in the world comes close to it," Trump said at the White House.  The new aircraft, named the F-47, reportedly acknowledged Trump's second term as the 47th president of the US.Trump also revealed that an experimental version of the aircraft has been in secret development and flight testing for the past five years. "Our enemies will never see it coming," he added. AdvertisementAdvanced capabilities and strategic impactThe F-47 incorporates advanced stealth technology, artificial intelligence systems, and autonomous command and control capabilities. It is expected to achieve supersonic speeds without the use of an afterburner, allowing for extended and quieter operations in contested airspace. The aircraft will also feature high-precision weapons, hypersonic missile capabilities, aerial refueling, and next-generation electronic warfare systems.

A tragic shooting at a convenience store in the US state of Virginia has claimed the lives of a 56-year-old man of Indian origin and his 24-year-old daughter, as per a report by PTI. One individual has been taken into custody in connection with the case. Both of them were working at the store in Accomack County when the attack happened. Authorities have arrested the suspect and investigations are going on, as per the US media report. The victims, identified as Pradipkumar Patel and his daughter were at the workplace on the Lankford Highway when the incident took place in the early morning of March 20. Accomack County Sheriff's Office stated that deputies responded to an emergency call at 5:30 am related to a shooting at the location, as per Shore Daily news.

After reaching the accident site, officers found the male suffering from gunshot wounds and was unresponsive. A search of the premises led to the discovery of a female victim who was also severely injured. That man was declared death on the scene while the woman was transported to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, where she later lost her life because of the injuries.

Authorities have confirmed the arrest of 44-year-old George Frazier Devon Wharton of Onancock on March 21. He is currently detained without bond in Accomack Jail. Sheriff W. Todd Wessells stated that Wharton has been charged on account of first-degree murder, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, attempted murder, and more. No motive has been revealed yet behind the gruesome act.

Paresh Patel, the owner of the store and a relative of the victims informed local station WAVY-TV, ‘'My cousin's wife and her father were working this morning when someone came in and shot them. I don't know what to do,'' as quoted by PTI.

The incident has caused deep sorrow among the Indian-American community, with many having expressed shock and condolences on the social media platform Facebook.

Ukraine's much-hyped 2023 counteroffensive against Russia was doomed from the start, Czech President Petr Pavel has said. 

Pavel, a former senior military commander, made the comments in an interview with European Pravda published on Saturday. He warned that, given the diminishing foreign aid and acute personnel shortages, Ukraine will not be able to win back any territory “without huge losses.” 

“That is why my quite realistic assessment was that this conflict, without changing the [existing] parameters, will most probably end up with some compromise. And now we are heading to such a compromise,” he said. Pavel went on to suggest that Kiev's much-hyped 2023 counteroffensive was destined to fail. 

“Even before Ukraine started its big counteroffensive two years ago, it was not well equipped to really succeed,” Pavel said. “For a successful offensive, the military theory says that you need a ratio of at least two – or preferably five – to one.”

At that time, the force ratio between Ukraine and Russia was still in favor of Russia. So it was quite obvious that the counteroffensive will not be as successful in liberating all of the territories.

The former general argued that Kiev and its Western backers need to come to terms with the prospect that “part of the territory of Ukraine is and will for some time be temporarily occupied by Russia.” He stressed, however, that the EU should not recognize Crimea or the Donbass regions as Russian territory. 

According to Pavel, the EU must continue to support Ukraine to the extent that it will not lose more land and to “create conditions for a ceasefire and subsequent peace.”

In early June 2023, Ukraine launched its ill-fated push using newly formed brigades and Western-trained crews operating Challenger 2 and Leopard 2 tanks. The troops attacked the Russians on multiple sections of the front line but failed to penetrate through heavy fortifications and thick minefields, losing many men and pieces of Western-supplied armor. The Ukrainian army only managed to capture several small villages, all of which have since been recaptured by the Russians.

This past week chief, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a video that mistaken removals will be quickly rectified. (Photo: Bloomberg)


	Every day over the past few weeks, the Pentagon has faced questions from angry lawmakers, local leaders and citizens over the removal of military heroes and historic mentions from Defense Department websites and social media pages after it purged online content that promoted women or minorities.


	In response, the department has scrambled to restore a handful of those posts as their removals have come to light.


	While the pages of some well-known veterans, including baseball and civil rights icon Jackie Robinson, are now back up on Pentagon websites, officials warn that many posts tagged for removal in error may be gone forever. 


	The restoration process has been so hit or miss that even groups that the administration has said are protected, like the Tuskegee Airmen, the first Black military pilots who served in a segregated World War II unit, still have deleted pages that as of Saturday had not been restored.


	This past week chief, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a video that mistaken removals will be quickly rectified. History is not DEI, he said, referring to diversity, equity and inclusion.


	But due to the enormous size of the military and the wide range of commands, units and bases, there has been an array of interpretations of what to remove and how as part of the Pentagon directive to delete online content that promotes DEI.


	Officials from across the military services said they have asked for additional guidance from the Pentagon on what should be restored, but have yet to receive any.


	The officials, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations, said, for example, they were waiting for guidance on whether military firsts count as history that can be restored. The first female Army Reserve graduate of Ranger School, Maj. Lisa Jaster, or the first female fighter pilot, Air Force Maj. Gen. Jeannie Leavitt, both had their stories deleted.


	Some officials said their understanding was it did not matter whether it was a historic first. If the first was based on what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth found to be a disqualifying characteristic, such as gender or race, it had to go, they said.


	One Army team has taken a very deliberate approach. 


	According to the officials, the team took down several major historical heritage sites that had many postings about women and various ethnic or racial groups. They are now going through them all and plan to rework and repost as much as possible on a new website focused on Army heroes. The process, the officials said, could take months.


	Overall, tens of thousands of online posts that randomly mention dozens of key words, including gay, bias and female have been deleted. Officials warn that the bulk of those images are gone for good. Even as complaints roll in, officials will be careful about restoring things unless senior leaders approve.


	The officials described the behind-the-scenes process as challenging, frustrating and emotionally draining. Workers going through years of posts to take down mentions of historic accomplishments by women or minorities were at times reduced to tears or lashed out in anger at commanders directing the duty, the officials said.


	Others were forced to pull down stories they were proud of and had worked on themselves. They were often confused about the parameters for removal once a key word was found, and they erred on the side of removal, according to the officials.


	Not complying fully with the order was seen as dangerous because it could put senior military service leaders at risk of being fired or disciplined if an errant post celebrating diversity was left up and found. Officials said the department relied in large part on a blind approach using artificial intelligence computer commands to search for dozens of those key words in online department, military and command websites.


	If a story or photo depicted or included one of the terms, the computer program then added DEI into the web address of the content, which flagged it and led to its removal.


	Purging posts from X, Facebook and other social media sites is more complicated and time intensive. An AI command would not work as well on those sites.


	So military service members and civilians have evaluated social media posts by hand, working late into the night and on weekends to pore over their unit's social media pages, cataloging and deleting references going back years. Because some civilians were not allowed to work on weekends, military troops had to be called in to replace them, as the officials described it.


	The Defense Department is publicly insisting that mistakes will be corrected.


	As an example, the Pentagon on Wednesday restored some pages highlighting the crucial wartime contributions of Navajo Code Talkers and other Native American veterans. That step came days after tribes condemned the removal. Department officials said the Navajo Code Talker material was erroneously erased, 
	The previous week, pages honoring a Black Medal of Honor winner and Japanese American service members were also restored.


	The restorations represent a shift from early, adamant denials that any deletion of things such as the Enola Gay or prominent service members was happening at all. At least two images of the Enola Gay, the plane that dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II, are still missing.


	This is fake news and anyone with a pulse knows it! the Defense Department's new Rapid Response social media account asserted March 7. We are NOT removing images of the Enola Gay or any other pictures that honor the legacy of our warfighters.


	Over time, the Pentagon has shifted its public response as more examples of deleted pages came to light.


	On Thursday, Parnell acknowledged in a video posted online that: Because of the realities of AI tools and other software, some important content was incorrectly pulled off line to be reviewed. We want to be very, very clear: History is not DEI. When content is either mistakenly removed, or if it's maliciously removed, we continue to work quickly to restore it.


	But others have seen the widespread erasure of history.


	Most female aviator stories and photographs are disappearingincluding from the archives. From the WASPs to fighter pilots, @AFThunderbirds to @BlueAngels they've erased us, Carey Lohrenz, one of the Navy's first female F-14 Tomcat pilots, posted to X. It's an across the board devastating loss of history and information. Among the webpages removed include one about the Women Air Service Pilots, or WASPs, the female World War II pilots who were vital in ferrying warplanes for the military, and the Air Force Thunderbirds.


	Parnell, Hegseth and others have vigorously defended the sweeping purge despite the flaws.


	I think the president and the secretary have been very clear on this that anybody that says in the Department of Defense that diversity is our strength is, is frankly, incorrect, Parnell said during a Pentagon media briefing. Our shared purpose and unity are our strength.

Canadians are now facing updated travel advisories to the world's two largest economies, after Ottawa warned travellers who stay in the United States for more than 30 days to make sure they register as required.

The advisory for the United States follows another update for travel to China, where Canadians with dual citizenship have been warned to use Canadian credentials when presenting to Chinese authorities.

"Canadians and other foreign nationals visiting the United States for periods longer than 30 days must be registered with the United States Government," the latest travel advisory to the United States said. 

"Failure to comply with the registration requirement could result in penalties, fines, and misdemeanor prosecution."

The updated advisory said visitors can consult the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website to check if they need to register and how to do so.




It said people can see if they have been automatically registered on entry to the U.S. by looking up their I-94 admission form on the U.S. Customs Border Protection website.

Many Canadians have changed travel plans to avoid the U.S. as President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs against Canada and repeatedly suggested it become the 51st state. 

Experts have said Canadian travel to the United States could be further stifled after a Vancouver woman was detained earlier this month for more than a week by U.S. authorities after having her work visa application denied while trying to enter at the Mexican border near San Diego, Calif.

Meanwhile, Canada has also updated its travel advisory to China after Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly said earlier this week that the country has executed four Canadian nationals in recent months.




The updated advisory warned that Canadians should exercise "a high degree of caution" in China, especially those with dual citizenships — who may be denied access to Canadian consular services if they entered the country on a Chinese passport or identity card.

"Our ability to provide consular assistance in China is limited due to the level of transparency in China's judicial system," the advisory said. "It may also impact your ability to obtain effective legal assistance."

Joly had said that all four of the Canadians recently executed in China were dual citizens and, according to Chinese authorities, facing charges linked to drugs and criminal activities.

Canada has condemned the executions, saying the death penalty "is irreversible and inconsistent with basic human dignity."




China's embassy in Ottawa has said "Chinese judicial authorities have handled the cases in strict accordance with the law," adding that Beijing has a "zero tolerance" approach to drug crime.

China does not recognize dual citizenship.

The Canadian travel advisory to China also warned that non-violent acts such as financial crimes may incur "severe punishment" in the country. It adds that travellers may also face an exit ban if they are linked to people "in any open civil or criminal investigations, including business disputes."

Ottawa said the affected travellers may not realize an exit ban has been placed on them until they go through Chinese customs and immigration controls when trying to leave China.

This report by The Canadian Press was first published Mar. 22, 2025.

Penn State's Carter Starocci won an unprecedented fifth national title and Oklahoma State's Wyatt Hendrickson stunned Olympic gold medalist Gable Steveson 5-4 in the heavyweight final at the NCAA men's wrestling championships with President Donald Trump in attendance

Penn State's Starocci Wins Record 5th National Title; Hendrickson Stuns Steveson for 285-Pound Title

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Penn State's Carter Starocci won an unprecedented fifth national title and Oklahoma State's Wyatt Hendrickson stunned Olympic gold medalist Gable Steveson 5-4 in the heavyweight final Saturday night at the NCAA men's wrestling championships with President Donald Trump in attendance.

Hendrickson, a transfer from Air Force, trailed in the last match of the evening until scoring on a takedown in the final minute — the only takedown Steveson allowed all season.

Hendrickson saluted Trump after his victory. With a United States flag draped over his shoulders, he then walked over and shook Trump's hand and hugged him as part of his celebration. Trump attended the event, just as he did as a candidate in 2023 when the tournament was in Tulsa, Oklahoma. 

“It's bigger than worlds, Olympics, anything," an emotional Hendrickson said moments after the win. 

Minnesota's Steveson, seeking his third national title, was on a 70-match win streak. The 2021 and 2022 national champion retired at the end of the 2022 event, but returned this year after stints in World Wrestling Entertainment and the National Football League. 

Steveson entered the third period with a 3-2 lead before giving up the takedown with about 20 seconds remaining. The crowd erupted when Hendrickson scored and as time expired. 

Starocci's Nittany Lions claimed their third four-peat, running away from the field to claim their 12th men's Division I men's wrestling national title under coach Cael Sanderson.

Starocci defeated Northern Iowa's Parker Keckeisen 4-3 in the 184-pound final. Keckeisen was the defending champion in the class. 

Starocci kept it all in perspective.

“It means a lot to me, but as for me — I never want to down play the moment — but I mean, it's always cool, but one thing that Coach Cael really instills in us, this is all just preparation for the next thing."

Penn State, just the second program to have 10 All-Americans in one season, scored 177 points to top its record from last year. The Nittany Lions picked up another championship when Mitchell Mesenbrink won the 165 final 8-2 over Iowa's Michael Caliendo. Mesenbrink finished unbeaten this season after losing in the national final a year ago.

Nebraska finished second with 117 points and closed out it's best tournament ever with Ridge Lovett winning at 149 and Antrell Taylor at 157. Oklahoma State finished third with 102.5 points and Iowa was fourth with 81.

North Carolina State freshman Vincent Robinson defeated Oklahoma State's Troy Spratley 2-1 at 125, and Illinois' Lucas Byrd defeated Iowa's Drake Ayala 3-2 at 133.

At 141, Ohio State's Jesse Mendez rallied from a 5-0 deficit to beat Nebraska's Brock Hardy 12-9 and claim his second straight national title. Hardy was the No. 1 seed.

At 149, Lovett toppled the defending champion, Virginia Tech's Caleb Henson, 1-0. Lovett became the first Cornhusker national champion since Jordan Burroughs in 2011.

Nebraska's Taylor hung on to defeat Purdue's Joey Blaze 4-2.

Oklahoma State's Dean Hamiti defeated Missouri's Keegan O'Toole 4-1 in overtime to win at 174. O'Toole, the national champ at 165 in 2022 and 2023, challenged a takedown during regulation that was reversed and allowed him to get to overtime. In sudden victory, another takedown was challenged, but this time, it was upheld, and Hamiti celebrated with first-year coach David Taylor.

Iowa's Stephen Buchanan defeated Penn State's Josh Barr 5-2 in the 197 final. He's been an All-American at Wyoming, Oklahoma and now Iowa.

In the new A&E special, "Casey Anthony's Parents: The Lie Detector Test," George accuses his wife of being controlling when she asks the production crew to move the couch they are sitting on.

"America's most hated mom," Casey Anthony, is now promoting a new video series on TikTok in which she intends to speak about legal issues and "advocate" for her daughter, Caylee, whom she was accused of killing in 2008.

Anthony, now 38, was accused of killing her 2-year-old daughter in 2008 but has alleged that her father is the real perpetrator. 

"This is my first of probably many recordings on a series I am starting," Anthony said in a March 1 video posted to TikTok. "I am a legal advocate. I am a researcher. I have been in the legal field since 2011, and in this capacity, I feel that it's necessary if I'm going to continue to operate appropriately as a legal advocate that I start to advocate for myself and also advocate for my daughter."

She continued: "For those of you who don't know, my name is Casey Anthony. My daughter is Caylee Anthony. My parents are George and Cindy Anthony. This is not about them. This is not in response to anything that they have said or done. … The whole point of this is for me to begin to reintroduce myself."

CASEY ANTHONY'S PARENTS TOOK POLYGRAPH TEST TO ‘CLEAR THEIR NAME,' EXPERT SAYS

Casey Anthony has become a household name over the last 17 years, inspiring multiple TV series and documentaries, including Peacock's "Casey Anthony: Where The Truth Lies," which premiered in 2022. A jury found Anthony guilty of lying to law enforcement but not guilty of first-degree murder, aggravated manslaughter and aggravated child abuse after a trial in 2011. Caylee's death remains unsolved.

Here is the timeline of events leading up to and after Caylee Anthony's disappearance: 

9 a.m. to 1 p.m.

Casey Anthony said she dropped her daughter off at her nanny's apartment — a claim that was later revealed to be false, according to court documents.

Casey said she then left for her job at Universal Studios Orlando — another claim later determined to be false.

5 p.m. to 7 p.m.

Casey said she left her job around 5 p.m. and drove back to her nanny's apartment complex to pick up Caylee. She apparently tried to contact her nanny, but her phone had been disconnected. Casey later alleged that no one was home, so she drove to Jay Blanchard Park.

Casey said she went to her then-boyfriend Anthony Lazzaro's apartment and stayed with him from then on as she searched for her daughter.

Casey alleged she received a "quick call" from her daughter's nanny on June 12, but she still did not know the whereabouts of the 2-year-old. She also said in a statement ahead of her trial that she had not called police at this point out of fear of her family.

Casey later revealed that the last time she saw her daughter was on June 16, 2008.

She said she and Caylee had been resting together in her bed that day because she "wasn't feeling that great." She said she thought she had locked the door of the room they were in but was awoken by her father, George, asking her where Caylee was.

"She would never even leave my room without telling me," Casey told filmmakers in an interview featured in the 2022 Peacock documentary.

She continued: "I immediately started looking around the house. … I go outside, and I'm looking to see where she could be. She's not in her playhouse. Where is she?"

When filmmakers asked if she looked inside the pool, Casey said she "didn't have to."

12 p.m.

Casey alleged that over a month after her daughter's disappearance, on July 15, 2008, she received a phone call from Caylee.

"Today was the first day I have heard her voice in over four weeks," Casey wrote in a 2008 statement. "I'm afraid of what Caylee is going through. After 31 days, I know that the only thing that matters is getting my daughter back."

Evening

Casey's parents, George and Cindy Anthony, called law enforcement multiple times to report their granddaughter missing and other nefarious activity.

"In the first two calls, Cindy Anthony requested police assistance in recovering a vehicle and money allegedly stolen by [Casey]," court records state. "In the third 9-1-1 call, Cindy Anthony reported that her granddaughter, Caylee, had been missing for approximately thirty days. Cindy Anthony testified that she made these phone calls because [Casey] would not tell her where Caylee was."

In the 911 calls, Cindy apparently told police that Casey's car smelled like a "dead body," according to Click Orlando.

"I called a little bit ago to the deputy sheriff's and I've found out that my granddaughter has been taken — she has been missing for a month," Cindy told emergency services. "Her mother had finally admitted that she had been missing."

"We are talking about a 3-year-old little girl," Cindy continued. "My daughter finally admitted that the baby sitter stole her. I need to find her."

"There is something wrong. I found my daughter's car today and it smells like there's been a dead body in the damn car."

The 911 operator then asked for clarity on the missing girl's location.

"She said she took her a month ago and my daughter has been looking for her," Cindy said. "I told you, my daughter has been missing for a month and I just found her today. But I can't find my granddaughter. She just admitted to me that she's been trying to find her by herself. There is something wrong. I found my daughter's car today and it smells like there's been a dead body in the damn car."

CASEY ANTHONY'S PARENTS TAKE LIE-DETECTOR TEST ABOUT GRANDDAUGHTER'S DEATH: ‘SOME WOUNDS ARE JUST TOO DEEP'

Law enforcement arrived at the Anthony family home that evening, separated the family members and got statements from each of them. Casey Anthony willingly gave a statement to police at the time, telling them she last saw her daughter with the nanny.

A detective arrived at the Anthony residence around 3:30 a.m.

Around 4:10 a.m., the detective spoke with Casey in a spare bedroom with the door open. The interview, which reaffirmed her written statement, was recorded with Casey's consent.

The detective then drove with Casey to the nanny's apartment complex and two other locations where she believed the nanny may have lived later that morning, according to court documents.

Casey was arrested later that day for child neglect, obstruction and making fraudulent statements after authorities determined that her claims about dropping Caylee off with her nanny and working at Universal Studios were determined to be false.

Police name Casey as a person of interest in her daughter's disappearance.

A grand jury indicts Casey Anthony on a murder charge in connection with her daughter's presumed death. She is detained in jail until her trial in 2011.

A utility worker located Caylee's skeletal remains in a wooded area about a half-mile from the Anthony family's home on Dec. 11, 2008. Casey Anthony's attorneys would later file a court motion implicating the utility worker in connection with the crime. He would file a defamation suit years later in 2013.

Jose Baez, who represented Athony during her trial, argued that Caylee accidentally drowned in the family's above-ground swimming pool in June 2008 and Casey's parents then attempted to cover up her death and dispose of her remains, which George and Cindy have vehemently denied.

Casey's murder trial began on May 24, 2011, and lasted more than six weeks. Her parents and her brother were among those called as witnesses.

Prosecutors argued that Casey Anthony suffocated her daughter with chloroform and taped the 2-year-old's mouth shut. 

After deliberating for 11 hours, a Florida jury found Anthony not guilty of first-degree murder, aggravated manslaughter and aggravated child abuse. She was convicted of lying to law enforcement.

Anthony admitted to The Associated Press in 2017 that she did lie about Caylee being with a babysitter, about speaking with Caylee over the phone one day before the girl disappeared, about working for Universal Studios and about telling people that her daughter was missing.

Oops, something went wrong

Barry Ritholtz, co-founder and chief investment officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management and a longtime adviser, digs into the things that have made him “less stupid” in his latest book.

"How Not to Invest: The Ideas, Numbers, and Behaviors That Destroy Wealth — and How to Avoid Them" isn't a navel-gazing reveal of his savvy investing philosophy, but rather a playbook on the theme that steering clear of errors is much more important than scoring wins.

I asked Barry to share the mistakes that trip most of us up and what we can do about it. Below are excerpts of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.

Kerry Hannon: Why are most of us better off sticking to a simple investing strategy?

Barry Ritholtz: Historically, simple beats complex. If you're going to make something more complicated, there has to be an absolutely compelling reason. The more complicated things are, there are more things to break. Think about how much money has been attracted to Vanguard and Blackstone's core indexing because it's simple and it works.

What are some of the pitfalls of building long-term wealth?

The biggest single pitfall is our tendency to interfere with the markets' compounding.

When I ask people, what is a thousand dollars invested a century ago worth today? They say, oh, a million dollars, $2 million. When you tell them it's $32 million, their heads explode. It's shocking to people. But that's the power of compounding.

Please try not to get in the way of your own money compounding. It's the single best thing you can do.

What are other common mistakes investors make?

The more active you are, the more transactions you engage in, and the worse you tend to do because you're just creating more opportunities to be wrong.

And we believe a lot of nonsense. Some of it is just myths that get repeated from generation to generation or ping around trading desks. I always laugh whenever I flip on TV and the market is down 2% and someone says, markets hate uncertainty. Do they really? Because there's got to be a buyer and a seller. That means that there's a disagreement as to the value of that asset.

We are wildly overconfident in our abilities to do things that the professionals can't do. You know, no one would say to themselves, yeah, I could play Michael Jordan one-on-one in basketball. Nobody thinks that way.

But when you step into the marketplace, you imagine that you're going to beat the house, that you're going to beat Michael Jordan. But trust me, you're not. Something like half of all the trades are done by institutions — highly qualified, deeply motivated with the latest, greatest, fastest tools. To imagine that you're going to step in and beat them on their home fields is just another mistake.

It's also a mistake to not be selective when you dip into the fire hose of media that comes out about investing. You have to be a little discerning and discriminating. Curate viciously. You have to create your own team of people who you either watch or listen to or read. I don't mean you literally have to hire them, but hey, these are the people who have a defendable process. They've lived through a few cycles. They have a good track record. And it's not just dumb luck.

On my all-star team are Morgan Housel, Jason Zweig, and Sam Ro. They have just consistently added value and been more right than wrong. They don't run around with their hair on fire when we're in the midst of a huge volatility spike.

What are some questions we can ask to avoid a lot of investment mistakes?

Always ask yourself, what are the risks of this trade? Is this tailored to me, or is this for a general audience? What's this going to cost — not just the outright costs, but fees, taxes, and, of course, lost opportunities. And who is giving me this advice?

What's their track record and do they have a conflict of interest? Do they have a fiduciary interest to zealously represent you and to perform their duties with diligence?

They can't guarantee you what the market or the economy's going to do in the future, but can they say to you, this is a reasonable portfolio that is defendable and rational and increases the odds that you'll have a successful outcome down the road?

You quote John Bogle, founder of Vanguard, as saying, “just buy the haystack.” In other words, stick with index funds. Why is that still a great philosophy?

In any given year, a majority of active fund managers underperform their benchmark, say, the S&P 500. Go 10 years and you're in the single digits of managers who earn their keep and outperform the benchmark. Take it to 20 years, and it's virtually nobody. You end up with a handful of outlier names and they become household names because they're unicorns — Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, Bill Miller.

With the indexes, you get diversification especially if you invest in a bunch of different indexes. You are guaranteed to find the Nvidias, the Apples, the Amazons, whatever are the biggest winners. And you get them in increasing stakes as they do better and better.

You say this is the golden age for investors. What do you mean by that?

You can move money around effortlessly. You can trade for free. You can buy anything. Back in the old days, if you wanted to own international stocks, it was expensive.

To say nothing of the power of walking around with this stuff in your phone, it's really amazing. Software and technology give investors tools that are just so simple and so inexpensive and so effective. That's why I call this the golden age of investing. We can do things people dreamed about 25 years ago.

Everybody gets second-by-second, tick-by-tick updates. You want to see how you're doing today, this week, month, year to date, the past 12 months — it's all right there. It's instantaneous.

But please don't look at your portfolio tick by tick. It'll make you crazy.

What is the importance of having a financial plan and working with an adviser?

There are ways to improve your life satisfaction with money. But a lot of people don't go about it that way. One of the ways that helps to get away from the money chase is that when you put a financial plan together, one of the things that ends up coming out of that process is the answer to: What is this money going to? Why do you want to put money in the market?

Maybe you're saving for your kids' college, buying a house, or retirement. Now we know how much risk to take in order to achieve your goals. That draws down stress.

When you put a financial plan together, you take as much risk as necessary, but not more, to achieve your goals. You're working with intentionality, you're working toward a purpose. If you're not saving toward a goal, you end up taking on too much risk. That's how people lose sleep at night.

Having someone to talk you off the ledge and keep you focused on your plan is worth about 2% to 3% a year. That's a huge amount of returns that simply comes about because someone is preventing you from shooting yourself in the foot. And we, as investors, are our own worst enemies. If we can stop our bad behaviors, we're all so much better off.

Oops, something went wrong

The Federal Reserve continued to signal it will cut interest rates two more times this year, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell adopting a perceived dovish stance, a pleasant surprise for investors who came into Wednesday's policy decision with heightened fears over "stagflation" and the possibility of a US recession.

"It's a clearing event," Dennis DeBusschere, president of 22V Research, told Yahoo Finance following the decision. "You didn't get a Fed that was going to accelerate the downside in markets."

One big reason stemmed from the Fed's "base case" that tariff-induced inflation will be "transitory" and have a short-term "one-off" effect on price growth. This was reflected in the central bank's projections, which forecast year-end PCE inflation rising to 2.7% before reaching its 2% target by 2027 — "a relief to investors" who had been bracing for stickier prices, according to DeBusschere.

But some experts warn that "transitory" inflation remains an unrealistic expectation — and that the projections for two rate cuts this year could unravel as the Trump administration continues to flip-flop on trade policy. Powell himself said "there is a level of inertia" to stay consistent with prior forecasts until greater clarity emerges.

"Uncertainty was a highlight of the statement," Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, wrote in response to Wednesday's decision. "Like market participants, the Fed is at a highly uncertain point, and it is in need of time and data to determine the next course of action."

Both consumer and producer inflation showed a deceleration in price growth over the month of February. But details under the surface pointed to a potential stalling out in reaching the Fed's 2% target, with tariffs serving as the greatest threat to Powell's "transitionary" base case.

There are also concerns the Fed may cut rates because of a weakening labor market and slowing economic growth — a move that wouldn't be cheered by investors.

"Everybody wants two cuts, three cuts, four cuts. You don't want any cuts. You want earnings growth. You want a strong economy," Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, told Yahoo Finance on Thursday. "Be careful what you wish for."

Despite a slightly more hawkish tilt from the central bank, with more FOMC members forecasting interest rates to either hold steady or come down by just 0.25% instead of the consensus 0.50%, traders still boosted their own expectations of where interest rates could end the year.

According to the latest data from Bloomberg, markets are now pricing in three cuts instead of two. But Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird, pushed back on reading too far into the projections.

"The 'dot plot' and [the Fed's] projections have not been super reliable over the last five years," Mayfield said, stressing that the uncertainties within the current economic and political environment add another layer of confusion when it comes to future policy.

"When the path forward is so unclear, you just take it with a grain of salt, go back to basics, and focus on the drivers of either the individual equities or the sectors in the market that you own," he said. "In this case, thinking about things like earnings and long rates, rather than what the Fed is doing at the short end of the curve."

Following the Fed's decision on Wednesday, markets experienced what Mayfield described as a "relief rally," citing the lack of downside surprises in the forecasts. But the move higher was short-lived, with all three major indexes slipping into the red the following trading session.

Still, the S&P 500 and Dow were able to eke out gains over the five-day period, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which has struggled as its "Magnificent Seven" leaders fail to deliver outsized returns, ultimately fell short.

"If you're going to really climb your way out of this hole, you need either clarity on the tariffs, which, who knows? Or you need some other sort of nice catalyst," Mayfield said. "That could come in the form of next earnings season, or maybe it's a really strong jobs report that comes out of nowhere."

"For now, we're kind of bouncing around and Powell's presser just wasn't enough to give the market the juice it needed to really get over the hump."

Oops, something went wrong

A fraught word resurfaced in the Federal Reserve's lexicon again this week: "transitory."

It came from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who told reporters Wednesday his "base case" is that higher inflation stemming from President Trump's tariffs will be "transitory" — reviving memories of how central bank policymakers talked about inflation during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Because Fed officials expected pandemic-era inflation to be transitory, they argued there was no reason to raise rates aggressively — an expectation that turned out to be misguided as inflation rose to a four-decade high in 2022. The Fed eventually mounted the most aggressive campaign to bring inflation down since the 1970s.

The new admission from Powell this week sparked questions about whether the central bank will make the same mistake again.

"I would have thought that, particularly after the big policy mistake of earlier this decade and given all the current uncertainties, some Fed officials would show greater humility," Mohamed El-Erian, president of Queens' College and chief economic adviser at Allianz, said on social media.

"It's simply too early to say with any regress of confidence that the inflationary effects will be transitory, especially given that companies and households still have fresh in their minds the recent history of high unanticipated inflation."

To be fair, Powell did qualify his statement. When asked during a press conference following the Fed's interest rate meeting whether he views the impact of tariffs on inflation as transitory, Powell said, "I think that's kind of the base case. But as I said, we really can't know that. We're going to have to see how things actually work out."

Other Fed watchers were more sympathetic, noting that Powell's overall commentary on the topic did, in fact, show some humility about past mistakes.

"I agree the word transitory is probably not ideal given they used it last time," 22V Research president Dennis DeBusschere told Yahoo Finance, but Powell also made it quite clear that Fed officials "weren't sure what was going to happen."

The modern US economy, DeBusschere said, has not been through such an aggressive slate of tariffs before, and therefore stating that inflation could be transitory because of the tariffs "seems like a fair way to think about it."

Powell does have a Trump administration ally in the transitory base-case view: Scott Bessent. In a speech earlier this month, the US Treasury secretary urged the Fed to look at any tariff-related price hikes that way — while also digging the Fed for its handling of inflation during the pandemic.

"I would hope that the failed 'team transitory' could get back together and think that nothing is more transitory than tariffs," Bessent said at the Economic Club of New York on March 6.

On Wednesday, Powell did acknowledge the Fed's past "transitory" faux pas, noting that "we're well aware of what happened, obviously, with the pandemic inflation. In real time, as we know, it's hard to make that judgment."

He also pointed out that the last time the US had tariffs imposed, during Trump's first term last decade, the effects did indeed prove to be temporary.

Back then, he said, "the inflation was transitory."

Powell noted the Fed has to look at the present environment as a "different situation," underscoring that the central bank hasn't gotten back to its 2% inflation goal and consumers aren't in a position to swallow higher prices, as businesses intend to pass on higher prices from tariffs.

Wilmington Trust chief economist Luke Tilley said he is encouraged that the Fed is talking about tariffs as being transitory in terms of inflation.

"They are a one-time increase in the price level of imported goods," Tilley said.

Tilley, however, believes the tariffs could ultimately hurt growth. "Once fully implemented, they amount to a significant tax hike and more likely to weaken consumer spending on all other goods and services."

Matt Luzzetti, chief US economist for Deutsche Bank Securities, noted that even though the central bank textbook suggests the Fed should look through one-time price level shocks such as those driven by tariffs, the reality is more complicated for at least two reasons.

The first, Luzzetti said, is it will be impossible to identify inflation driven by tariffs versus organic price pressures in real time.

If inflation rates for auto repairs and car insurance rise in the coming months, he asked, is that because of ripple effects from duties on steel and aluminum or autos? Or would that represent something more fundamental?

The second reason, he said, is that inflation expectations are not clearly firmly anchored. Most other measures of inflation expectations show heightened uncertainty — something Luzzetti said could be a precursor to higher expectations if inflation stays elevated.

"In short, it is too early to brush aside elevated inflation this year as transitory," Luzzetti said.

Oops, something went wrong

Capping credit card interest rates is starting to look like the hot policy idea of the season for populist lawmakers on both the left and right.

This month, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive star from New York, and Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a MAGA favorite from Florida, teamed up to introduce a bill to limit credit card APRs at 10%. It follows similar legislation from Sens. Bernie Sanders, the independent of Vermont, and Republican Josh Hawley of Missouri, which would put in place the same 10% rate ceiling for five years.

The cost of credit has become a more pressing issue in recent years thanks to rising interest rates, which have helped fuel increasing delinquencies: The average APR was about 21.5% at the end of last year, up from 14.7% in 2020, according to the Federal Reserve.

For now, these bills mostly seem to be political signaling exercises that are unlikely to go anywhere soon. Democrats may also see them as a way of challenging President Trump to make good on his campaign-season promise to pass a credit card cap, an idea mostly embraced by progressives in the past. (In 2019, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez unveiled the Loan Shark Prevention Act, which would have imposed a 15% limit on all interest rates.)

But the bipartisan enthusiasm suggests that limiting what card issuers can charge their customers may have legs down the line. For many voters, it's a pressing pocketbook concern: About half of credit card accounts revolve a balance from month to month, while 13% of cardholders make only the minimum payment due, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

As they've hiked interest rates, credit card companies' margins have hit all-time highs. To some, that's a sign that companies could continue lending profitably to most of their customers even with a rate cap cutting a bit into their profits.

The challenge, as almost any economist will note, is that limiting rates will likely mean less access to credit for Americans with weaker credit scores since lending to them won't be as profitable.

That might be for the best for some households if it saves them from overborrowing. But many could be forced to resort to other, even less affordable types of debt to cover emergency expenses. And even without the aid of a high-APR credit card, some still find ways to make unaffordable purchases on credit, such as through buy now, pay later plans.

The question is how low is too low before restrictions do more harm than good. A 10% rate might be overly strict. But what about a 25% cap? Or 35%?

“At the end of the day, it's a trade-off,” said Breno Braga, an Urban Institute senior fellow who has studied the impact of interest caps. “You want to maximize the number of people that benefit from it and minimize the number of people that suffer from it.”

Usury laws are nothing new. At least 76 countries impose limits on lending rates, according to World Bank researchers, and at least 26 have chosen to place caps on all types of credit. In the US, dozens of states place restrictions on payday lenders, or try to ban them outright.

Studies on the impact of payday loan limits have yielded conflicting results. Some have found that the rules backfire by pushing customers to rely on other, expensive and less regulated types of credit, like bank overdrafts, without improving their overall finances. Others suggest the laws cut back on payday loan use without those drawbacks.

What would happen if the government tried to limit what Visa or Mastercard can charge? In the US, there's at least one recent real-world example we can draw conclusions from: The Military Lending Act, which originally capped the interest rates on payday and other loans for active-duty service members at 36%. In 2015, the law was expanded to cover revolving products like credit cards.

The change had a fairly limited impact on troops' wallets, according to a paper by Braga and his colleagues at Urban. The 36% cap didn't seem to affect credit access for people in the military community who had subprime credit scores, but didn't improve their finances much either, measured by factors like delinquency rates or debts going into collections.

The absolute riskiest borrowers appear to have felt the change more. After the reform passed, people with Vantage credit scores under 500 were less likely to have a credit card and saw their borrowing limits lowered. At the same time, their credit ratings and delinquency rates didn't improve, suggesting the group lost access to credit without much benefit.

One reason the 36% cap might not have had much effect overall is that, during the time period studied, relatively few people had credit cards with an APR above 36%. Today, with rates higher, the impact might be wider.

The cap Ocasio-Cortez and Luna have proposed would certainly bite much harder, and likely cut off access to credit for many millions more. Even among superprime borrowers with credit ratings above 720, average APRs are typically higher than 10%. There's also concern that companies might try to skirt a severe limit by charging new fees, though the bill tries to prohibit that.

Still, it's possible to imagine looser limits making some headway in Washington.

In 2019, for instance, a bipartisan bill that would have extended the Military Lending Act's 36% rate cap to all Americans was nearly reported out of committee but derailed by the pandemic. Politically, a bill like that could one day be ready for a comeback.

Howard Lutnick, the billionaire Secretary of Commerce, is being pummeled online over his comments on Thursday that his 94-year-old mother-in-law would not complain about a missed Social Security check and that someone who would is a "fraudster."

"Let's say Social Security didn't send out their checks this month — my mother-in-law, who's 94, she wouldn't call and complain," Lutnick told All-In Podcast host Chamath Palihapitiya. "A fraudster always makes the loudest noise, screaming, yelling, and complaining."

Based on a fact sheet published by the Social Security Administration, more than 7 million Americans 65 and older receive at least 90% of their income from benefits checks.

Social Security employees have been warning that the Trump administration's plan to cut 7,000 SSA staff will result in delayed benefit checks and could extend the wait time by two to three times.

According to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index, Lutnick's net worth was at least $2.2 billion as of February 2025.

Below are reactions to Lutnick's comments from prominent business leaders, commentators, and political leaders. Howard Lutnick and the Department of Commerce did not respond to requests for comments.

In a post on Bluesky, Cuban reposted a screenshot of a news article about Lutnick's comments on missed Social Security checks and asked, "Has Howard Lutnick done anything of value as Commerce Secretary?"

The reality show billionaire, who identifies as an independent in politics, congratulated Trump for winning the election in November and, in a 2016 interview with Rolling Stone, called his association with the President a "love-hate relationship."

"Social Security is a lifeline to millions of Americans," O'Malley said Friday night on The Rachel Maddow Show. "40% of seniors living alone depend entirely on Social Security to keep themselves out of poverty."

"The cavalier disregard, utter ignorance of how so many Americans live on a day-to-day basis, is stunning, is appalling, and is a cruel-heartedness at the center of our government that we've never seen before," he added.

At the Hands Off Social Security rally in White Plains, New York, where the Trump administration is set to shutter a Social Security office, Weingarten, president of the second largest teacher's labor union, began her speech by vowing that "the people will win" over Elon Musk and Lutnick.

"We didn't vote for Elon Musk to call Social Security a Ponzi scheme," she said. "We didn't vote for Howard Lutnick to say, 'Oh don't worry, no elderly people, including my mother, would care if they don't get their checks from Social Security.'"

In a post on X, Clyburn, representative of South Carolina's 6th congressional district, wrote that "the billionaires in the Trump administration have no idea what it's like to rely on Social Security earned through a lifetime of hard, honest work."

The post also features a now-viral clip of Lutnick's comments on the All-In Podcast, where show hosts Chamath Palihapitiya and David Friedberg did not directly dispute him on the spot.

The longtime MSNBC host played a video of Lutnick's Social Security comments on the All-In Podcast, and said it "is such a political disaster" she almost had to close her eyes because she "can't bear to watch it."

"How does that comport with what you understand of the reality of getting a Social Security check, and who in your life you know gets a Social Security check?" she asked before playing Lutnick's clip for the second time.

According to TV Insider, The Rachel Maddow Show averaged more than 1.7 million total viewers in primetime in January and has remained one of the most popular shows on MSNBC for years.

Schumer reposted Lutnick's now infamous clip from the All-In Podcast on X and called the Secretary of Commerce "an out-of-touch billionaire" who is "clueless or heartless."

"Howard Lutnick does not understand what a missed Social Security check means to a senior on a fixed income," he added.

Schumer has recently faced criticism from Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that he isn't doing enough to fight Republican policies over his decision to vote for the House GOP funding bill to avert a government shutdown.

Collins, the CEO of the satirical news website, posted on Bluesky a hypothetical response from Lutnick to a person in need, in contrast to how he hypothetically would react to an AI defense contractor asking $10 billion.

"80-year-old, starving to death: money? for food please?

lutnick: avast, grifter!

defense contractor who met Peter Thiel once and makes AI bazookas that shoot stray dogs on sight: I need $10 billion... for reasons

lutnick: say less sir, yes sir, right this way sir"

Changes are coming to the student loan system as the Trump administration works to do away with the Department of Education, a move that cannot fully happen without Congress.

However, the White House said on Friday that it is making the move to shift student loans to the Small Business Administration.

"I've decided that the SBA, the Small Business Administration, headed by Kelly Loeffler, a terrific person, will handle all of the student loan portfolio," President Donald Trump said on Friday.

As Trump tries to dismantle the Department of Education, he said he'll shift oversight of $1.7 trillion in federal student loans to the Small Business Administration, which has also just announced it is slashing staff as part of federal workforce reduction efforts.

Approximately 44 million people across the U.S. have some kind of federal student loan.

On Friday, NewsCenter 5 got insight and advice from Betsy Mayotte, the founder of the Institute of Student Loan Advisors, whose life work is to help students and families navigate the system.

Mayotte said her staff is now being bombarded with borrowers seeking help.

"Borrowers need more help, not less," Mayotte said. "The word 'overwhelmed' comes up [from them] all the time."

Mayotte said the staff layoffs at the Department of Education are the biggest hardship for borrowers for now.

She said regardless of the agency overseeing federal loans, the terms of those loans are set by federal statute and will not change. 

Federal loans are largely administered by contracted services and vendors, and those databases won't change either.

"Nobody should be making any panicked decisions about their student loans based on a headline," Mayotte said. "Take a deep breath, see how things play out and you will have time to make decisions because there are no deadlines out there for anything."

However, Mayotte is closely watching how Congress might change the terms for federal borrowing in the future.

"You know, one of the things is reducing the federal student loan funding that's available to families," Mayotte said. "They could cut off parent plus loans altogether, which would mean that lower and middle-class families that need those loans to cover the gap are going to have to look at private loans."

Mayotte said it is smart to stay engaged with what is happening and not to hesitate to reach out to local representatives on Capitol Hill and let them know that loan programs that help families afford college are important.

For more information on student loan advice, Mayotte recommends visiting freestudentloanadvice.org or studentaid.gov.

Guests at Walt Disney World in Florida were caught by surprise on Saturday evening when a fire broke out at the EPCOT park.

Videos shared across social media on Saturday show different angles of black smoke billowing across the sky.

DISNEY SHAREHOLDERS WIDELY REJECT ANTI-DEI PROPOSAL

A Walt Disney World official confirmed to FOX Business that the fire occurred at the EPCOT's World Showcase and was extinguished around 7:20 pm local time. There were no injuries.

The blaze started when a walk-in cooler caught fire in a backstage area of the French Pavilion, FOX Business learned. No buildings were damaged due to the fire.

The same official also confirmed that there were evacuations on the Remy's Ratatouille Adventure ride, which is part of EPCOT's World Showcase in its France area.

DISNEY REVEALS DETAILS FOR NEW THEME PARK RIDES BASED ON BELOVED FRANCHISES

Disney World describes Remy's Ratatouille Adventure as a "4D ride experience," where guests can "join Chef Remy on a daring culinary caper that will captivate all your senses as you zip, dash and scurry through the bustling kitchen, dining room and walls of Gusteau's famous Paris restaurant."

The US-based Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) have been on a negative streak of capital outflows in the past few weeks, reflecting dwindling appetite and worsening sentiment amongst investors. However, the latest daily performances of these crypto-based financial products suggest that fresh demand might be growing among investors.

According to the latest market data, the Bitcoin ETFs in the United States continued their hot streak of capital influx, registering a daily total net inflow of $83.09 million on Friday, March 21. This fresh capital inflow marked the sixth consecutive day of net daily inflows for the crypto products.

On Friday, only two of the Bitcoin ETFs witnessed any form of investor activity. BlackRock saw the highest amount of value ($104.99 million) added to its exchange-traded fund iShares Bitcoin Trust (with the ticker IBIT); while Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) posted a daily net outflow of $21.9 million to close the week.

Nevertheless, this $83.09 million performance brought the Bitcoin ETFs' weekly record to a staggering $744.35 million weekly total net inflow. Interestingly, this previous week's record put an end to five consecutive weeks of total net outflows from the exchange-traded funds.



Data from SoSoValue shows that the US Bitcoin ETF market witnessed a total withdrawal of $5.39 billion over those five weeks of negative outflows. Specifically, the crypto-based financial products witnessed a daily total net outflow of over $1.14 billion on February 25.

The magnitude of outflows witnessed by the Bitcoin ETFs has been associated with the uncertain climate of the US financial markets. Since the United States President Donald Trump resumed office, the markets have been plagued with fears of a global trade war, interest rate decisions, and so on.

Since their launch, there has been a discussion around the impact of US Bitcoin ETFs' performance on the price of the flagship cryptocurrency. As seen in the recent consecutive weeks of net outflows, the Bitcoin price tends to struggle whenever ETF investors are leaving the market.

However, the premier cryptocurrency seems stuck in a consolidation range despite the fresh demand for the US Bitcoin ETFs. However, a sustained demand for its exchange-traded funds might be the positive catalyst for the Bitcoin price to resume its upward trend.

As of this writing, the price of BTC is hovering around the $84,000 mark, reflecting no significant change in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the market leader has barely recorded any notable movements in the past week.

 Ether price is positioned to rally toward $3,400 by June as it retests a key support zone that previously triggered 2,000% and 360% bull runs. 

Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), has lost half of its value in the past three months, crashing from $4,100 in December 2024 to as low as around $1,750 in March 2025. Nevertheless, it is now well-positioned for a sharp price rebound.

From a technical standpoint, Ether's price is eyeing a potential breakout as it retests a long-term support zone. Historically, bounces from this multi-year support have led to explosive rallies — most notably gains of over 2,000% and 360% during past cycles.

As of March 23, the ETH/USD pair was hovering near $2,000, close to the given support area. A bounce from this zone can lead the price toward $3400 by June—up 65% from current prices. 

This level coincides with the lower boundary of Ether's prevailing descending channel resistance.

Conversely, a decline below the support zone could push the ETH price toward the 200-2W exponential moving average (200-2W EMA; the blue wave in the first chart) at around $1,560.

Ether's bullish outlook appears as institutional confidence in Ethereum grows stronger. 

BlackRock's BUIDL fund now holds approximately a record $1.145 billion worth of Ether, up from around $990 million a week ago, according to data from Token Terminal.

The fund primarily focuses on tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), with Ethereum remaining the dominant base layer. While the fund diversifies across chains like Avalanche, Polygon, Aptos, Arbitrum, and Optimism, Ethereum remains its core allocation.

BlackRock's latest addition of ETH signals rising institutional confidence in Ethereum's role as the leading platform for real-world asset tokenization.

Ethereum's bullish case also coincides with a sharp uptick in whale accumulation. 

The latest onchain data from Nansen shows that since March 12, 2024, addresses holding 1,000–10,000 ETH have grown their holdings by 5.65%, while the 10,000–100,000 ETH cohort has risen by 28.73%.

Though addresses holding more than 100,000 ETH remain relatively stable, this accumulation trend underscores rising conviction among large investors.

Binance CEO Richard Teng says the Trump administration has been a "fantastic" reset for the cryptocurrency industry.

"It's an extremely different environment that we're operating in," Teng told CNBC on Tuesday.

In the span of 16 months, Binance has gone from a political outcast to a possible power broker in Washington. Once the poster child for regulatory defiance – Binance was slapped with a record $4.3 billion settlement with regulators and forced to oust billionaire founder Changpeng "CZ" Zhao – the crypto exchange is now navigating a dramatically friendlier political landscape under President Donald Trump's second administration, Teng said.

"We've benefited from this shift," said Teng, who was appointed Binance's CEO in November 2023. 

Teng's comments come as the crypto exchange is in talks to have the Trump family take a financial stake in the company, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal earlier this month. That same day, Bloomberg reported that World Liberty Financial, a Trump-linked crypto bank that has not yet launched, is engaged in talks with Binance to launch a dollar-pegged stablecoin. 

If such deals were reached, it would mark a staggering reversal for a company that was once a pariah in Washington. 

Teng, a soft-spoken former regulator, was careful with his words when addressing the reports.

"I believe both World Liberty Financial as well as CZ himself have tweeted and denied the reports," said Teng, who runs the exchange's operations outside the U.S. 

As for the rumors about a Trump stake in Binance.US, Teng demurred. 

".US and .com are quite different animals, right?" he said. "They have different sets of shareholders, different boards of directors, and different CEOs running the show."

Binance structured the two exchanges as independent entities in response to regulatory scrutiny, aiming to ring-fence its U.S. operations from the broader international business.

Still, Teng is bullish on what the new political environment means for crypto.

"We went from four years of Operation Choke Point 2.0 to now – you have a very pro-crypto, pro-AI president," he said. While Binance.com doesn't operate in the U.S., he said, "We have benefited from all these pro-crypto policies."

Choke Point 2.0 is how industry insiders refer to an alleged crackdown by legacy banks on digital asset firms during the Biden administration.

Teng described a rapid global expansion that brought Binance from 170 million to 265 million users in just one year.

"We have received a lot of approaches from different governments around the world," Teng said, citing regulatory progress in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Brazil, Argentina and the United Arab Emirates.

Binance is now licensed in 21 jurisdictions, and its influence extends well beyond the reach of any one country. That includes sovereign wealth funds, some of which are starting to quietly allocate to crypto, Teng said.

In the background of all this optimism is the reality of Binance's checkered past.

Zhao, the company's founder and former CEO, was criminally charged, forced to step down and served a short prison sentence. Binance paid the multibilllion-dollar settlement – finalized in late 2023 – to resolve a raft of violations with U.S. regulators, including the Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

One major front remains open: The Securities and Exchange Commission's civil case against Binance and Zhao. 

The SEC and Binance in February agreed to a 60-day pause in proceedings as both sides consider a potential resolution. The stay comes amid a broader pullback by the SEC from several high-profile crypto lawsuits—signaling a potential regulatory reset under the new administration.

"We under-invested in compliance in those very early days," Teng said. "But what's important as a responsible institution is to acknowledge those early mistakes, make amends for it and invest greatly into compliance, which we are doing now."

Binance now employs more than 1,300 professionals in compliance, roughly a quarter of its total workforce, Teng said. "The direction of travel is very clear. It's one of compliance."

The Nigerian government might disagree. 

One of Binance's top compliance officers, Tigran Gambaryan, was recently imprisoned under harsh conditions. In Nigeria, Binance faced charges of alleged non-payment of value-added tax and company income tax, failure to submit tax returns and complicity in aiding customers to evade taxes through its platform. 

Alongside Gambaryan, who is a U.S. citizen and a former employee of the Internal Revenue Service, Nigeria has also imprisoned fellow executive Nadeem Anjarwalla, who is British-Kenyan. Both were charged and remanded in custody by Nigerian authorities. Anjarwalla escaped custody in March 2024, and Gambaryan was released several months later.

"The treatment he went through in Nigeria is not warranted," said Teng about Anjarwalla. "We have always tried to liaise and work cooperatively with governments around the world."

Since taking over as CEO, Teng has shifted the company from a founder-led startup to a board-governed organization. 

"Now I report to the board of directors," Teng said. "We have a board of seven members, including three independent directors and an independent chairman."

For all the scrutiny Binance faces, Teng insists the platform remains dominant.

"At any point in time, we have more than 40% of global market share," he said.

He dismissed concerns about Coinbase's growing political clout and the momentum behind crypto exchange-traded funds, arguing that ETFs are a gateway into crypto trading. 

"A lot of users that start trading through ETFs subsequently advance to cryptocurrency platforms," Teng said, noting that while crypto trades nonstop, ETFs are limited to business hours.

Binance took on its first institutional investment earlier this month in a $2 billion deal with Emirati state-owned investment firm MGX, which is an AI and advanced tech fund that counts BlackRock and Microsoft as partners. It's the largest investment ever made into a crypto company and the biggest to be fully paid in stablecoins.

Teng said he sees the investment as a way to bridge crypto and AI. 

"We are utilizing AI on an extensive basis," said Teng, noting that Binance uses artificial intelligence for customer service, security and compliance monitoring. "This is the blockchain sector. We have to continue to utilize technology to achieve efficiency."

Asked what keeps him up at night, Teng rattled off a list: Security, compliance, product innovation and opportunities for mergers and acquisitions.

"We want to make sure we run a very robust, operational, best-in-class platform," he said.

Bitcoin and crypto prices have dropped after surging in the aftermath of Donald Trump's election victory (though a White House official has just revealed how Trump could spur the bitcoin price higher).

The bitcoin price has fallen to around $85,000 per bitcoin, down from a peak of $110,000 per bitcoin in January, as traders scramble to protect their bitcoin from a new, mystery threat.

Now, after the Federal Reserve confirmed expectations it could be about to open the “floodgates," Fed chair Jerome Powell has warned the risk of recession is rising—something BlackRock's head of bitcoin and crypto has predicted could be a “big catalyst” for the bitcoin price.

Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said the risk of recession has ticked up—something ... More BlackRock's head of bitcoin and crypto thinks could fuel a bitcoin price boom.

“I don't know if we'll have a recession or not, but a recession would be a big catalyst for bitcoin,” Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock's head of digital assets, told Yahoo Finance in an interview, pointing to how recession responses such as increased fiscal spending, deficit accumulation, lower interest rates and monetary stimulus have historically boosted the bitcoin price.

"And it's catalyzed to some extent over fears of general social disorder,” Mitchnick said. “And that, too, unfortunately, is something that can happen in a recession.”

This week, the Fed downgraded its economic growth outlook while raising its inflation projection while leaving interest rates on hold.

"If you look at outside forecasts, forecasters have generally raised … their possibility of a recession somewhat, but still at relatively moderate level … [it] has moved up, but it's not high,” Fed chair Jerome Powell said during his post-interest rate decision press conference.

Ahead of Powell's comments, Moody's Analytics' chief economist Mark Zandi told CNN it “feels like we're being pushed into recession” by Donald Trump's international trade tariffs. “The recession risks are uncomfortably high and they're rising,” Zandi said.

The bitcoin price has fallen back in recent weeks but remains far higher than before Donald Trump's ... More election victory despite the Federal Reserve warning recession risks are rising.

Meanwhile, UCLA Anderson School of Management has published an official “Recession Watch” for the first time in its 73 years of economic forecasts, with its chief economist Clement Bohr predicting Trump “could very well be the author of a deep recession.”

Earlier this month, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink warned Trump's trade policies will stoke inflation—dampening expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates through 2025 and invoking the specter of “stagflation”—characterized by an economic slowdown coupled with spiraling price rises.

Fink, who has become one of the most bullish voices supporting bitcoin on Wall Street, led BlackRock in its campaign to get a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approved in the U.S. through 2023, with a fleet of bitcoin funds making their debut in January 2024 before surging to become some of the fastest growing ETFs of all time.

U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets for the first time in November, with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now boasting around $50 billion in assets under management.

Earlier this month, President Trump reinvigorated crypto markets with his announcement of five cryptocurrencies for U.S. strategic reserves: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). In making this announcement, Trump has opened the door to a new financial era and created an opportunity for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to go toe-to-toe with the leader in global reserve fiat currency, the US dollar.

How did Bitcoin get here? The Bitcoin revolution started and grew as a reactionary movement to another global financial event, the 2008 financial crisis that was driven by an unsustainable housing bubble propped up by poor lending practices and toxic assets. The interventions made by central banks to correct the problem—including the bailout of institutions “too big to fail”—demonstrated to Bitcoin whitepaper writer and “inventor” Satoshi Nakamoto what they had already long believed about the fundamental problems of centralized economics and the need for a decentralized “e-cash.” The Bitcoin blockchain itself went live when Satoshi embedded the following message in the genesis block: 

“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”

The current era might be even more auspicious for driving the second wave of the Bitcoin revolution, especially if you believe Bitcoin is strong enough to become something like digital gold or a global reserve currency. The problem presented by the current era is not that of the bailout but the fundamental problem of fiat currency itself, that sticky problem of inflation.Prone to centralized currency manipulation and with countries still drowning in the fiat pumped out during and after the COVID-19 crisis, inflation has proven to be a fundamental complication that has bedeviled leaders across the globe and the political spectrum. Even with a number of political incumbents in different countries falling in defeat to the problem, inflation is proving to be especially resilient, even for the many disruptors who came in on the anti-inflation, anti-incumbent sentiment.In some cases, it is a problem isolated to a few products and sectors facing unique and probably temporary supply challenges, such as in the case of the price of eggs. However, if the problem persists, a crypto reserve, and especially a Bitcoin reserve, could present an elegant solution to at least partly halting inflation. This will be a good thing not only for those governments, but for the evolution of the one truly free and fair digital currency, the one that has been with us since 2009.

Is this even workable, especially here in the United States?Generally, a Bitcoin-led reserve would present a hedge against inflation, with the drawback being that governments would lose some flexibility around these holdings in the customary fiat-driven toolkits that have helped those governments heat up or cool down economies as needed. 

It makes sense that governments would look at Bitcoin as some portion of a reserve, particularly as a small, high-risk, high-reward portion of reserves, even as those governments missed out on the initial march to $100,000. There could be other rewards as well. As Senator Cynthia Lummis has pointed out to Elon Musk, now a top advisor to President Donald Trump, a crypto reserve could also be an automatic solution for governments to better audit those reserves, digitally. 

State governments in the US have actually been leading the way on this issue, providing a sort of roadmap for the federal government to use. Nearly half of all state governments have either put money into crypto reserves or are beginning that process. If Bitcoin continues to grow through this increased demand on its fixed supply, that makes it an even more attractive option to the U.S. federal government and other governments like it.If Bitcoin is to truly become part of the US national reserves, there must be clear regulatory frameworks, robust custody solutions, and bipartisan political will. From a monetary policy standpoint, the Federal Reserve would face an asset it cannot directly manipulate, potentially altering how we manage interest rates and national debt.

But what would all these governments diving in do for Bitcoin itself? We've already seen the temporary price bump on just the news itself, but the actual ramifications if it's implemented will be more far-reaching.

For one, Bitcoin would immediately be tied to fundamental avenues of public investment, especially retirement and pension funds. That is real attention and institutional interest that goes beyond online message boards, Telegram, and the Robinhood app.

The US federal government following the states' lead would, in turn, create a ripple effect where large companies in the private sector would follow the public sector's lead. If Bitcoin were in national reserves, it would legitimize Bitcoin as an institutional-grade asset, prompting companies to hold it more confidently on their balance sheets. In practice, we'd see new liquidity strategies—like crypto-backed lending—become mainstream, and corporations would more actively integrate Bitcoin into their long-term capital planning.

If Bitcoin were deemed a national reserve, its credibility as collateral would also skyrocket. Bitcoin-backed loans would become as standard as borrowing against gold, adding a modern dimension to liquidity in times of crisis. Its digital nature offers global 24/7 markets, which can provide flexibility and speed that gold or treasuries can't match, although volatility remains a consideration.

A national BTC reserve would cement Bitcoin's status as “digital gold.” We'd see broader acceptance by banks and alternative lenders offering BTC-collateralized loans, lines of credit, and treasury management solutions. New financial tools—like Bitcoin-based municipal bonds or sovereign BTC ETFs—could also become viable.

There would still be risks, including price volatility, but that can be a benefit, not a bug, especially if it were incorporated as just one segment of a diversified portfolio with different risk thresholds. Policymakers must balance both perceived and real concerns with the massive upside of holding a finite digital reserve asset.

On the flip side, Bitcoin provides an uncorrelated hedge against inflation and can attract global capital if the US is seen as Bitcoin-friendly, truly positioning it as the best reserve asset in the world. It behooves the federal government to follow President Trump's lead and begin to seriously explore this option while Bitcoin is still at a relatively low and investment-friendly price.

BlackRock's tokenized US Treasury fund, BUIDL, has seen a sharp rise in adoption, with the fund's assets under management (AUM) surging past the $1 billion milestone this month.

This growth highlights a strong shift toward real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, even as broader crypto markets face headwinds.

According to data from RWA. XYZ, BUIDL's AUM, has increased by almost 129% over the last 30 days, bringing it to $1.4 billion.

This milestone means that it took only one year for the fund, which launched on the Securitize platform in March 2024, to cross the $1 billion mark.

While BUIDL has expanded to multiple blockchains, the majority of its supply—over $1 billion, or 86.46%—remains on Ethereum. This indicates strong minting activity on the network.

Other chains, such as Avalanche and Aptos, each hold about $56 million of the fund's supply, or roughly 3.6%. Ethereum Layer-2 networks like Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism host the rest.

Meanwhile, investor participation has also grown. In the past month, the number of holders rose by 19%, bringing the total to 62.

Market observers pointed out that these numbers highlight the growing trust in blockchain-based financial products and the rising institutional interest in tokenizing bonds and credit.

BUIDL's milestone comes as asset management firm Fidelity also moves into the tokenization space.

Over the past week, the firm filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a blockchain-based version of its Treasury money market fund. The new share class, named “OnChain,” will operate using blockchain as a transfer agent and settlement layer.

“The OnChain class of the fund currently uses the Ethereum network as the public blockchain. In the future, the fund may use other public blockchain networks, subject to eligibility and other requirements that the fund may impose,” the filing added.

Fidelity's move mirrors a broader trend. Financial institutions are turning to blockchain to tokenize bonds, funds, and credit instruments. This shift offers improved efficiency, round-the-clock settlement, and better transparency.

Meanwhile, the filing comes as institutional interest in RWAs continues to rise, despite a sluggish crypto market. While Bitcoin is down 11% year-to-date, RWA tokens have seen sustainable growth in 2025.

On-chain data shows the total RWA market has grown 18.29% in the past 30 days, reaching $19.23 billion. The number of RWA holders also increased by 5%, now nearing 91,000.

BlackRock's BUIDL leads the RWA space by market cap. It's followed by Hashnote's USDY at $784 million and Tether Gold (XAUT) at $752 million. 

Meanwhile, US Treasuries make up $4.76 billion of the total, while private credit dominates with $12.2 billion.

Key Takeaways:

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has made a historic move by formally incorporating cryptocurrencies into its global economic data systems. The new standards are provided in the seventh edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual (BPM7), released on March 20, 2025, and represent the first time the IMF has offered detailed guidance to the international statistical community on how to capture digital asset activity in its global statistical standards. This inclusion reflects the increasing prominence of digital assets in global trade and financial transactions, making it imperative for institutions to develop clear methodologies for data reporting.



The new IMF standards offer a framework to help countries consistently monitor and report on crypto activity. One such distinguishing feature in the BPM7 is the classification of digital assets. The framework distinguishes between fungible and non-fungible tokens and categorizes them based on the liabilities they incur. The framework has been developed with input from 160 countries. This illustrates the importance of identifying the worldwide impact of digital assets on an economy, even if the implementations may vary. Standardized classification of these assets ensures that policymakers have accurate data to make informed economic decisions.



The practical upshots of the new IMF classifications are not trivial. For example, cross-border transactions in Bitcoin will now be recorded in the capital account as acquisitions or disposals of non-produced assets. Such granularity paints a better picture of capital flows and the absorption of cryptocurrency into the global financial system.

To add to the complexity, the IMF recognizes staking and crypto yields. This move acknowledges the evolving nature of digital finance and highlights the growing influence of decentralized finance (DeFi) in the global monetary landscape. Rewards from holding tokens, they argue, are akin to dividends on equity, and as such should be reported as income depending on the size and purpose of the holdings. The IMF considers activities such as mining and staking—processes that secure and validate crypto transactions—as services. These will form a part of the computer services exports and imports.

IMF official recognition of crypto in its dataset signifies the fact that the world's financial institutions can not turn a blind eye to digital assets any longer. There is also a growing realization that these assets must be included in economic policy and regulation. As governments seek to balance innovation with financial stability, the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in official economic metrics marks a significant step forward.

The IMF recognizes these challenges and this acknowledgment can drive the harmonization of regulations cross-border. This enables governments to better formulate policies on taxation of cryptocurrency, anti-money laundering, and consumer protection.

One of the biggest challenges in the crypto space has been the lack of regulatory clarity. The work that the IMF does may help promote such an environment, which could in turn lead more institutions to embrace cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.

It also enhances the transparency of cryptocurrencies in the IMF's standards, which has a significant impact. Imagine a scenario where, in the near future, a small island nation experiences a crypto boom. With the IMF's standards in place, the national economy will be better prepared to recognize and mitigate risks.

The IMF's manual represents a major shift in the way global economic statistics are collected and interpreted, paving the way for future guidelines on digital currencies.

Coinbase is in advanced talks to acquire Deribit, the biggest platform for trading Bitcoin and Ethereum options. Deribit has a key operating license in Dubai, and the deal, which could greatly increase Coinbase's derivatives footprint.



Bloomberg estimated the deal could be worth $4 billion to $5 billion.



Deribit is licensed to operate in Dubai and has a strong institutional clientele as the biggest platform for trading Bitcoin and Ethereum options.

Bloomberg report highlighted that the companies informed Dubai's regulators about the talks. Coinbase may be making a calculated move with the possible acquisition as the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency company.

Deribit reportedly hired a financial advisor in January to investigate possible acquisition possibilities. A credible source said that although Kraken had been mentioned as a potential candidate, no talks between the two companies occurred.

Coinbase stated “We have a bold mission to increase economic freedom in the world, and are constantly exploring opportunities around the world to build, buy, partner, and invest to accelerate our roadmap,”

The American-listed exchange declined to confirm any ongoing deal discussions.

It is still unclear if Coinbase and Deribit have reached a definitive agreement although the most recent report indicated that talks are moving forward. This is one of the biggest acquisition discussions in the cryptocurrency industry as the options trading platform was previously estimated to be worth between $4 billion and $5 billion.

Coinbase's choice to pursue this acquisition deal seems to be a calculated step to enter the Middle Eastern market in light of this. The US and EU's initial tough stance on cryptocurrency regulations in recent years has contributed to the rise of the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, and Singapore as the three unofficial global hubs for blockchain events and resident stakeholders.

Now that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) is a formal government policy, its administrators are scrambling for ways to build and potentially sustain the plan. 

With an order to use budget-neutral strategies to manage the reserve, Bo Hines, US President Donald Trump's Executive Director on Digital Assets, suggests using gold certificates.  

Hines shared many creative ideas on possible “budget-neutral” ways to buy more Bitcoins, and he sees gold certificates as one of the best options. He added that these certificates are priced less than actual gold, making it possible for the US government to realize gains when using them to buy Bitcoins.

Trump's announcement of the executive order on the crypto reserve was met with mixed reactions. Although many expected the government to approve the BTC reserve, many were disappointed with the initial plan not to buy new Bitcoin. Instead, its administrators are tasked with tapping digital assets already owned by the government or acquiring new ones through “budget-neutral approaches.”

According to Hines, one creative and budget-neutral way to fund Bitcoin acquisition is to use gold certificates. As a guest on the Crypto in America podcast, the exec expects potential gains using gold certificates since they're cheaper than actual gold. Hines continued by pointing to the Lummis Act, where Senator Cynthia Lummis suggested tapping the potential of the gold certificates.

According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, all gold certificates are assessed at their statutory price of $42.22 per troy ounce. In contrast, spot gold is priced at more than $3k per ounce. In Senator Lummis' Bitcoin Act 2025, the Federal Reserve System's gold certificates can potentially fund future purchases.

Lummis' bill requires the Fed banks to transfer their outstanding gold certificates under custody to the office of the Treasury Secretary. The secretary will then issue new certificates reflecting gold's current and fair market value.

Hines added that he welcomes additional suggestions and recommendations on how to grow and manage the Bitcoin reserve, provided they are not a burden on taxpayers. He said this is the primary intent of Trump's crypto executive order signed on March 6th. Hines is looking to convene an inter-agency working group, and they will solicit information and suggestions from everybody.

Currently, the government holds around 207,000 Bitcoins that were seized through civil and criminal proceedings. With 207k Bitcoin holdings, the US has the biggest BTC holdings among nation-states.

An inaugural report by the New York City Health Department aimed at cracking down on sky-high prices hospitals charge patients has gaping holes in it because the Big Apple's largest public-employee insurer refuses to turn over records, officials said.

The 263-page report quietly released Friday through the agency's new Office of Healthcare Accountability says hospital prices are wildly inconsistent. The study focused on payments made through the city's health care provider, Anthem Blue Cross, and not private-sector insurance plans.

The city's GHI-Comprehensive Benefits Plan through Anthem paid on average $45,150 for inpatient services last fiscal year at New York's top 10 hospital systems, the report said.

The highest prices for full in-patient treatment were at New York-Presbyterian ($92,727) and Montefiore Medical Center ($83,573), while Stony Brook University Hospital was the lowest ($36,876).

The report noted the city spent $3.3 billion paying for employee hospital care during the fiscal year ending June 30, and half went to three hospital systems: Northwell Health ($759 million), New York-Presbyterian ($485 million) and NYU Langone Health ($443 million).

New York-Presbyterian had the highest prices for 11 of 12 inpatient procedures analyzed and 14 of 27 outpatient procedures, the report said.

Prices at hospital systems ranged widely, from $940 to $12,000 for a colonoscopy, and $7,000 to $58,000 for a cesarean-section delivery.

And the city is now spending more on hospital outpatient care than inpatient.

The report cited Anthem — which the city pays a whopping $3 billion yearly to provide insurance to roughly 900,000 employees — for refusing to provide the OFA the full costs of health care at hospitals and other data it needs to determine whether these prices are warranted.

Anthem claimed releasing some of the pricing data would violate confidentiality agreements it has with hospitals that predate a 2021 federal rule requiring hospitals to disclose their prices to the public.

However, Councilwoman Julie Menin (D-Manhattan), who sponsored legislation creating the first-of-its-kind health care watchdog office in 2023, isn't buying it.

“It's a slap in the face to the City of New York when federal rules require hospital pricing be made public, but Anthem won't comply with city law due to so-called ‘preexisting agreements,'” she said. “This health care industry cat-and-mouse game is costing the city billions, and we need full transparency now.”

“It's so distressing to see these prices,” added Menin. “It's extremely high and is why we need price transparency. Why should New York City be paying so much for health care? It's sickening and unsustainable.”

The city's health care insurance contract is up later this year, and the city “must require full disclosure of pricing” to whoever gets it,” said Menin. Anthem is among the bidders for the new deal.

The Post two years ago reported on analyses by 32BJ SEIU, the city's building-services employee union, showing the Big Apple could save taxpayers as much as $2 billion annually by auditing exactly how much municipal workers pay for care at various hospitals and making recommendations on ways to lower the prices.

Manny Pastreich, president of 32BJ, said his union pushed hard to create the OFA but added it's unfortunate the “inaugural report is more noteworthy for what is missing.”

“It's clear that hospitals and insurers are still exerting their influence to block sharing certain data the city needs to reverse the trend of exorbitant health care costs,” he said.

The OFA was created in large part to offer greater transparency to patients on costs of medical procedures at a private hospital vs. city-run medical facilities as it has the authority to publicly release hospital pricing citywide. It operates with a $2 million budget and 15 staffers.

“Health insurance companies and New York City hospitals must remove arbitrary barriers to data access that would otherwise support transparent and equitable pricing of medical services,” said Henry Garrido, executive director of District Council 37, the city's largest municipal employee union. 

“We must utilize every tool at our disposal to fight these unfair practices, including ensuring the Office of Healthcare Accountability is adequately staffed to fulfill its primary purpose of tackling disparity pricing that exploits the vulnerabilities of New Yorkers in need of care.”

Anthem reps did not immediately return messages.

WADENA — Sen. Amy Klobuchar's team, including Senior Regional Outreach Director Chuck Ackman, and Outreach Director Allie Glass, visited Astera Health on March 5, to engage with health care professionals, and local advocates on critical issues facing seniors. 

The meeting focused on preserving and strengthening programs essential to seniors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the growing need for support systems for caregivers.

Klobuchar, a champion for policies benefiting Minnesota's aging population, emphasized how crucial it is to safeguard and enhance the health care and retirement programs that millions of seniors rely on. 

"We must ensure that Medicare and Medicaid continue to provide quality care to those who have worked hard their whole lives, and we need to address the increasing demands on families who are stepping up to care for elderly loved ones," Klobuchar said in her address via Zoom.

Local health care professionals shared insights into how current policies are impacting care delivery for seniors, as well as the growing strain on caregiving systems. A notable theme throughout the meeting was access to transportation and housing.

Cheri Dodds, community-based services supervisor for Wadena County Human Services, attended the meeting and echoed that transportation is an important piece of helping seniors gain access to the support they need.

“Transportation, as they said in the meeting, there is a huge lack of transportation in our area to get people to medical appointments,” said Dodds, who noted that Friendly Rider is a huge asset to senior residents. “But with senior citizens, and even some people with disabilities, accessing the bus can be difficult." 

Additionally, seniors with health issues need assistance with getting to and from appointments as well as everyday needs such as grocery shopping and yard maintenance and housekeeping, Dodds said.

Wadena County human services provides support and resources for seniors including working with home health providers, clinics, transportation providers, mental health providers to create a supportive environment for seniors. The goal, Dodds said, is to help seniors with a wide range of needs, including housing to transportation.

“We need more individualized transportation services where they can come at an exact time and just serve them individually based on some of their challenges,” said Dodds, who added the lack of supportive services in the community is an obstacle.

As Minnesota's population ages, the conversation about how to best meet the needs of seniors is becoming increasingly urgent, Klobuchar said. She concluded the event with a commitment to continue working in Washington, D.C. to advocate for policies that protect and support seniors and their families.

Today, the Obesity Action Coalition (OAC) and The Obesity Society (TOS) sent a letter to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA), along with more than 20 leading organizations and providers across the healthcare continuum, urging the agency to enforce federal regulations around compounding following the recent resolution of GLP-1 medicine shortages. Among the signatories include: the Alliance for Women's Health & Prevention, the Association of Black Cardiologists, the National Hispanic Medical Association and the National Consumers League. 

The letter follows recent announcements from the FDA that Eli Lilly's tirzepatide, marketed as Zepbound for weight loss and Novo Nordisk's semaglutide, marketed as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss, are no longer in shortage. In addition, a federal court in Texas recently declined to issue an injunction blocking the FDA's tirzepatide decision – underscoring the "ceasing" of all copycats by compounders.  

Following the recent resolution of GLP-1 shortages, we applaud the FDA's clarification issued last week for GLP-1 compounders which indicates that outsourcing facilities making versions of tirzepatide have until March 19 to cease operations. Pharmacies must stop compounding semaglutide by April 22 while larger outsourcing facilities have until May 22, or until the district court rules on a pending injunction in the district court case – what comes first will take precedence. 

The letter also acknowledges that U.S. regulations permit some compounding pharmacies to produce versions of brand-name medications under limited circumstances, including when they are in short supply or where necessary to meet the individualized needs of a specific patient.  However, continued mass-production compounding of GLP-1s, in the absence of a shortage, undermines the regulatory framework designed to protect patients from potential risks associated with unapproved and unregulated drug formulations. 

To address this issue, the signatories urge FDA to take the following action: 

Enforce Existing Regulations: Ensure that compounding pharmacies adhere to federal regulations by discontinuing the production of GLP-1 medications now that the shortage has been resolved. 

Monitor Compliance: Implement measures to monitor and enforce compliance during and after the grace period to prevent unauthorized compounding of these medications. 

Educate Stakeholders: Provide clear guidance to healthcare providers, pharmacists, and patients about the transition back to FDA-approved medications and the importance of obtaining treatments through appropriate channels.  

Enforce Existing Rules Against Misleading Information: Ensure that companies promoting misleading information about compounded GLP-1s are held accountable under existing regulatory authority of the FDA. 

GLP-1 medications have made a transformative impact in the obesity care space. As these medicines continue to grow in popularity, regulatory action and enforcement is critically needed at the state and federal level to ensure that patients have access to safe, FDA-approved treatments."

Joseph Nadglowski, President and CEO of the Obesity Action Coalition

"Now that the GLP-1 shortage is resolved, FDA faces a critical juncture in upholding its commitment to patient safety," said Anthony Comuzzie, PhD, FTOS, CEO of TOS. "Our message is simple – FDA, the time is now to take decisive action by enforcing the existing regulatory framework around compounding."

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took time out of his controversial war to 'Make America Healthy Again' to enjoy a game of tennis with Novak Djokovic.

Donald Trump's Secretary of Health and Human Services posted a picture on court alongside the 24-time Grand Slam champion, who is currently competing in the Miami Open. 

'Novak Djokovic. First in tennis. First in integrity. First in courage. Guess who won this match?' RFK Jr. posted alongside the picture.

The image quickly flooded social media with former presidential candidate - and keen tennis player - Vivek Ramaswamy among those to reply. 'Love this,' he wrote.

Djokovic returns to the court on Sunday, when the No 4 seed takes on Camilo Ugo Carabelli in the round of 32. 

Kennedy has previously lauded Djokovic over his stance on the Covid-19 vaccine.

Back in 2022, Djokovic was sensationally deported ahead of the Australia Open because he was not vaccinated against the virus.

Later that year, the former world No 1 withdrew from the US Open in New York due to travel restrictions imposed during the pandemic.

He later claimed: 'People tried to declare me as an anti-vax. I'm not anti-vax, nor am I pro-vax. I'm pro-freedom to choose.'

That prompted praise from Kennedy, who ran for president before suspending his campaign and backing Trump for a return to office.

'Djokovic nails it. That's my position too. Your body, your choice,' he wrote on social media in December 2023. 

The Serbian is well known for taking an alternative approach to medicine and training. He has been known to perform yoga, Tai chi and capoeira, a combination of dancing and fighting.

Djokovic previously revealed he had gone gluten-free in his book ‘Serve to Win, the 14-day gluten-free plan for physical and mental excellence'. 

At Wimbledon in 2022, Djokovic was seen inhaling a mystery substance, which he later called a ‘magic potion', from a water bottle.

For those of you who missed it, Joe's vacation officially started after he survived a budget flight to Florida with minimal issues and filed Screencaps on Saturday morning.

For the next week he'll be enjoying all that Florida has to offer. He'll be back cranking out content, and doing his best to keep me out of trouble, a week from Monday.

Until then, I'll be holding things down. This is day one of a Sunday to Sunday run.

No, it's not as impressive as the 20-straight-day run, or whatever the exact number came out to be, that Joe went on in February. But it's no easy task either. Joe is a machine.

St. John's won 31 games this season. They won the Big East tournament championship for the first time in 25 years. It was the sixth time Rick Pitino had turned around a program in two years, and they were a 2-seed in the NCAA Tournament.

This was the year. A Final Four appearance was within their sights and then Pitino and company ran into an old friend, John Calipari. He had the slicked-back hair, the jacket, and his 10-seed Arkansas team ready to go.

Then it happened, Calipari and the Razorbacks went out and beat St. John's 75-66. The season for the Red Storm and Pitino finished early.

There was no Final Four appearance to take place. There wasn't even a Sweet 16. A deep run wasn't in the cards for Pitino this year. Calipari stood in his way.

The Razorbacks are in and so are Texas Tech, BYU, Purdue, Houston, Tennessee, Michigan, and Auburn. There's a full slate of Second Round action on Sunday to determine the other eight spots.

I don't necessarily have a team or a specific game to watch, but it would be fun to see Saint Mary's advance by beating Alabama. The Gaels in the Sweet 16, who doesn't want to see that?

Once a Florida man, always a Florida man.

Nobody drives this point home better than Arthur Nixon Bates IV. He died on March 5 after he "succumbed to a life of drugs, Marlboros, fast women, and Ford Broncos."

That's right. That's all in the first sentence of his obituary, which was published in the Tampa Bay Times last week. Bates was a Florida man in life and in death.

The full obituary reads, "March 5, 2025 Nick succumbed to a life of drugs, Marlboros, fast women, and Ford Broncos. He is survived by three daughters, none of whom know how they will get by without dad calling to ask for $20 for cigarettes and methadone, one last time."

What a run. Drugs, Marlboros, fast women, and Ford Broncos should be on t-shirts in every gas station in the state of Florida.

It's official. Hooters and NASCAR are no more. Zach Dean, OutKick's NASCAR guy, broke it all down on Saturday. It's, as he points out, a sad day.

Hooters has had conflicting reports about their finances, with closures of restaurants and even bankruptcy being discussed the news overall hasn't been great.

That goes for their relationship with NASCAR, where they weren't paying their bills as the main sponsor for Chase Elliott. That can't happen. When it did, the Hooters girls were sent packing.

Isn't there a way to salvage this relationship without having to kick the Hooters girls off the track? Not when the bills aren't paid.

Last week, the two sides, Hendrick Motorsports - who were getting stiffed by the nonpayment - and Hooters, came to an agreement on a settlement.

The breastaurant, who is trying to hold on to all the brand has built over the years, agreed to pay Hendrick Motorsports, who was suing Hooters for more than $1.7 million, $900k.

Let's hope this is a step in the right direction towards getting the ladies back on the track. Hooters doesn't need to be the main sponsors of a driver or anything.

It's a sad time for the brand. Let's hope they can figure things out.

Hey Sean,

As with years past on selection Sunday I grilled up some wings. I tossed them in Blues Hog Raspberry Chipotle BBQ sauce. Wish I would have taken a picture of the flats I did in the air fryer for my wife, as they looked even better. Happy St Patrick's Day!

SeanJo

Bill, this is a great Selection Sunday tradition. Wings on the grill don't get enough attention or love. We should all be doing it more often.

I hope you had an awesome St. Patrick's Day as well.

I'm grilling tonight

SeanJo

I don't know if there's anyone out there hitting the grill as often as Homebrew Bill. It's an inspiration. I think I'm going to have to fire mine up later this evening for the first time this season.

One of my coworkers recommended S3:E1 as required Office watching. Personally love the show and enjoy the humor.

Still grilling

SeanJo

Hey John, thanks for The Office recommendation. If, and that's a big if, I watch another episode or give the show yet another chance, I'll check this one out.

The meat looks fantastic!

------------

That's all for this Sunday's Screencaps. Before I hand things over to some of Instagram's finest, I did finish the gazebo I was working on last weekend.

It was a huge pain in the ass, but I made it through without a complete disaster and, most importantly, it's still standing.

So with that, my Naked and Afraid-style handyman ranking, I'm happy to report, is now above a five. Maybe a 5.3 or so out of 10.

Again, I'm working an adjusted schedule all week while Joe enjoys a well-deserved vacation, so send me all you have from now until next Sunday.

Let's have a week and get those grills fired up. The inbox is always open sean.joseph@outkick.com.

Senior Miray Konar can be seen doing two of her favorite interests on the tennis court since coming from Izmir, Turkey. During games, she is contributing to the Elon University women's tennis team's 8-3 record. When the tennis team isn't playing, she is attracting a huge following online as a social media influencer.

Konar regularly posts content of her daily life on her Instagram and TikTok accounts which have generated over 320,000 combined followers. Her reels on Instagram regularly get hundreds of thousands of views, sometimes millions.

She said her mom was a big reason why she became interested in this hobby after seeing her enjoyment of social media.

“My mom was a huge social media person,” Konar said. “She has whole albums and everything, and I was always a big fan of posting. She was always a big role model and that's what really gave me the love for posting things.”

Konar said she realized how impactful social media can be as her platform continued to grow. She was amazed by the number of people she could actually reach out to within a month through posting content. With her ability to utilize a large platform, Konar said she sometimes looks to reach out to as many as 60 million a month.

Konar said that she also wants to be truthful in her posting regardless of whether she's having a good or bad day. She pointed out how most people will post as if everything is perfect.

“When you look at social media, you'd think everyone has perfect lives,” Konar said. “I felt like if I wanted to post my life, it has to be more realistic. It's normal to have a bad day but also a good day too.”

Konar said this approach allows her to continue keeping up with her content.

“I think it's made me a lot more sustainable,” Konar said. “I don't know anyone out there who is constantly happy and having a perfect life.”

Konar's teammates such as junior Madison Cordisco have also admired her work on social media. Cordisco said she initially didn't know about Konar's platform, but immediately recognized Konar's creativity as an influencer once she found out about it.

“The way she does all her videos, we really enjoy it,” Cordisco said. “She always has these great ideas and different TikToks we can post on our tennis Instagram account.”

Cordisco also said Konar's ideas generate attention for the team, which has been beneficial for recruiting new members.

Cordisco said she is most impressed by Konar's ability to devote time to both activities. She praised Konar for excelling in both areas.

“It's very inspiring that she can do all of these things and still have a very good performance on the court,” Cordisco said. “It shows all of her dedication to tennis and her hobbies outside of tennis.”

Konar said she believes there are lessons that can be translated from social media to tennis. She explained the importance of being consistent in both areas and sticking to habits that are beneficial.

“Consistency is a big thing,” Konar said. “Posting every day and interacting with your followers is like tennis. We got to practice every day. We go out there, hit tennis balls, and do the same things.”

She has been a key factor in the Elon University women's tennis team's strong start so far, and remains undefeated in singles with a 4-0 record and is 4-4 in doubles.

Konar said her increased confidence has played an integral role in her performance. She said this helped her learn from her initial struggles.

She also credited assistant coach Ashe Ray. She said he's improved her skills during doubles matches, particularly when she plays closer to the net. He has focused on helping her keep her confidence, Konar said.

Konar said she hopes to be an inspiration for Turkish athletes who are also playing sports and attending a university. She said her account can let athletes know that it is possible to balance out multiple responsibilities even with the demands of being an athlete.

“I was always seeing this as a chance to give younger athletes in Turkey sports a way,” Konar said. “It is very hard to do a professional sport and university classes at the same time, so I was always trying to inspire them.”

Konar said she plans to continue enjoying both activities for the remainder of her senior year.

“I just want to do the things I love, and tennis and social media are two things that are always going to be in my life,” Konar said.

                Elon women's golfer senior Andrea Asmundsdottir is one of six international students on her team, but the only one who has played Iceland's midnight golf. From the hometown of the “world's most northerly 18- hole golf course,” the Icelander has teed off her final collegiate season. Golfing didn't start as a personal interest for Asmundsdottir. Her grandfather started playing golf and brought her grandmother onto the range as his team member for partner golf. At the age of 6, Asmundsdottir began playing with her family, transitioning to competitive tournaments at 12 years old.

Naomi Osaka has continued her superb run at the Miami Open, with the former world number one now into the round of 16.

The 2025 Miami Open has already witnessed plenty of shocks across the WTA and ATP tours, including Carlos Alcaraz losing his opener.

But Osaka has now won all three of her Miami Open matches so far, with Jasmine Paolini now awaiting in the last 16.

Osaka was proud of her movement against Yuliia Starodubtseva in round one, where she won 3-6, 6-4, 6-3.

The four-time Grand Slam champion then stormed past Liudmila Samsonova 6-2, 6-4, before a battling 7-6(8-6), 3-6, 6-4 win over Hailey Baptiste.

She is now on her best run since reaching the ASB Classic final in January, but wasn't entirely satisfied with the latest win.

“I think I am a little embarrassed about how much I threw my racket today, but I don't know I had so many nerves I didn't really know how to let it out and that was one of my outlets, which wasn't the greatest way,” Osaka told Tennis Channel.

“I think I tried to be more positive than I was negative and I think that did help me over the edge towards the end.”

Osaka was forced to retire hurt from that ASB Classic final earlier this season, with that same fate suffered at the Australian Open.

After battling very hard to reach the third round in Melbourne, she couldn't continue against Belinda Bencic.

A very disappointing first round exit was then suffered at Indian Wells, but Osaka is now back on form, and is fully aware of that.

Discussing her form after reaching the last 16 of the Miami Open, she said: “I mean, I definitely would say that I am playing good tennis.

“I do think my match against Samsonova was really great tennis but I think overall compared to last year I feel like I am fighting for matches that I wouldn't have fought for and that is what I am most proud of and I am getting the reputation of if you are going to beat me you are going to fight harder than me, which should be quite difficult.”

Since 2022, Swiatek has always won a title or two by this point in the season, and is rounding into Roland Garros form. This time we're still waiting for the unbeatable version of Iga to stick around for an entire tournament. There have been flashes of her over the past month—until she has run into Mirra Andreeva.Swiatek played well enough in her Miami opener to beat Caroline Garcia 6-2, 7-5, but Mertens may offer a tougher test. The 29-year-old hits hard and flat and could potentially rush or handcuff Swiatek on her forehand side. A nine-time singles title winner, Mertens is also one of the WTA's more obstinate competitors. She doesn't cave mentally, no matter what the score is.The two have played once, on clay last year, and Swiatek won in straight sets. The quicker hard courts in Miami should give Mertens a better chance of making her presence felt in the rallies. As always with Swiatek, the first few games will matter. If Mertens can avoid an early break, keep some doubt in Iga's mind, make it a dogfight, she'll have a chance when the clutch moments come.

Just under a week after pulling off the greatest achievement of his career so far, the next task for Jack Draper was to cast all thoughts of his sublime Indian Wells title run to the back of his mind while maintaining the form that had taken his tennis to new heights.

Performing at the highest level week after week regardless of circumstances and conditions remains one of the toughest challenges in professional tennis and on Saturday it proved a step too far. Draper fell back to earth with an unsatisfying 7-6 (2), 7-6 (3) defeat to the 19-year-old Jakub Mensik of the Czech Republic in the second round of the Miami Open.

Draper's Indian Wells title run had begun with him demonstrating his experience against the 18-year-old João Fonseca, the youngest player in the ATP top 100. This time, he was unable to escape another difficult draw against an extremely talented teenager. Mensik, who is ranked No 54, saw off Draper, the sixth seed, with an incredible serving performance that yielded 21 aces.

For a short while, Draper seemed to have picked up where he left off from last Sunday's demolition of Holger Rune in Indian Wells as he burst into the match lasering forehands and serving efficiently.

However, as Mensik warmed into the match, showing off his own potent serve and forehand, Draper's intensity sharply dropped. He spent much of the set audibly fighting with himself as he tried to reestablish his intensity and range on his groundstrokes. As Draper took those issues into the tie-break, Mensik served immaculately to snatch the set.

The second set followed a similar pattern as Draper was a step behind throughout. It took a significant effort from the British No 1 to hold on to his serve and save six break points throughout the set while Mensik rolled through most of his own games. The one-sided tie-break was a logical conclusion to a deceptively one-sided set.

Draper will leave Miami frustrated in his inability to maintain the momentum he built in Indian Wells, but a mental and physical letdown after such a breakthrough was always a possibility. With the humidity in Miami making for heavier balls and different conditions, the transition to Miami is challenging in many ways. For Draper, this should be a valuable lesson as he aims to perform at the highest level on a consistent basis.

Meanwhile, Jacob Fearnley's positive week in Miami came to an end in the second round as he was outclassed by an excellent Alexander Zverev, the top seed, who opened his tournament with a comfortable 6-2, 6-4 win. Fearnley had reached the second round by navigating the qualifying draw before registering the second-best win of his career by ranking against the No 63 Benjamin Bonzi in the first round. He will rise to a new career high ranking inside the top 75 and leapfrog Cameron Norrie as the new British No 2.

After an early exit in Indian Wells, Frances Tiafoe moved back on track Saturday with an opening win at the Miami Open presented by Itau. Playing in his 100th ATP Masters 1000 match, the American earned his 50th win at the prestigious level with a 7-5, 7-6(5) result against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.

Now 17-6 in the U.S. since July — including his run to his first ATP Masters 1000 final last year in Cincinnati — the No. 4 American in the PIF ATP Rankings will hope more success on home soil can kickstart his 2025 season. While Tiafoe is now 6-0 in his opening matches this year, he has yet to record multiple wins at the same event.

The 27-year-old earned his first Top 40 win since beating Daniil Medvedev at Laver Cup last September by improving to 3-1 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Davidovich Fokina, avenging a defeat to the Spaniard last month in Acapulco.

"Wins like that are big for me," said Tiafoe, who saved all four break points he faced after dropping serve in the opening game. "Any win right now is big for me, but especially the way I played. I was super aggressive, so I'm really happy with it."

With six of the top 13 seeds losing their opening match in Miami, including all four Indian Wells semi-finalists, the 16th-seeded Tiafoe avoided a similar fate on Saturday — though he was not overly concerned by the trend.

"I'm not even worried about the upsets. I've been getting upset every week," he said. "I keep saying it: I've been on Tour for a long time, and the depth of the game is at an all-time high. You've got old guys who are still hanging on, you've got young guys who are playing elite, trying to make their way into the Tour, and then you've got the top guys trying to hang on for dear life. The Tour is madness. Guys are good out here."

Tiafoe will next meet 17th seed Arthur Fils, who led lucky loser Gabriel Diallo 6-4, 2-3 before the Canadian retired with an ankle injury.



Andrey Rublev became the latest upset victim on Saturday night, with Belgium's Zizou Bergs knocking him out 7-5, 6-4. The 25-year-old Bergs earned his first Top 20 win by beating the No. 9 in the PIF ATP Rankings to advance to his first ATP Masters 1000 third round.

Seeking his Top 50 debut, Bergs is up two places to No. 49 this week in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. The Auckland finalist is the first player outside of the Top 20 to record 15 tour-level singles wins this season (15-7).

Bergs will seek to score another upset against Matteo Berrettini in the third round, after the Italian opened his Miami campaign with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 win against Hugo Gaston. In a rematch of the 2024 Kitzbuhel final, the 29th-seeded Berrettini beat lucky loser Gaston with a dominant serving performance. With an 81 per cent (43/53) win rate on first serve, according to Infosys ATP Stats, the Italian faced just one break point in the victory.

Lily Allen is opening up about a decision she made after splitting from her husband David Harbour.

The 39-year-old It's Not Me, It's You singer opened up about her decision on the latest episode of her Miss Me? podcast.

While talking to co-host Miquita Oliver, Lily addressed a recent procedure she had done after her separation from the 49-year-old Stranger Things star after four years of marriage.

“Oh, how do I feel about aging? Well, I just got some additions to the family. I don't know if you've noticed,” she said, referring to her breasts.

Her co-host admitted it wasn't easy to miss the work, after Lily “pulled your f--king top off a month ago and showed them to me quite starkly.”

“I was like, absolutely incredible,” she noted.

“Yeah. They look really incredible when I take my top off and my bra off, but there's definitely a contrast in age between my breasts and my face," Lily said.

“I'm like, 40, 18,” she joked, comparing how she looks her age in the face but half her age in her chest. 

She added she “might get the BBL next," referring to a Brazilian butt lift procedure.

“I mean, there's a thing that happens a few months after you get them, which is that they drop and fluff,” Lily explained. “So they're still quite high and they're still quite hard. When they drop and fluff, they become like, you know, they feel like normal boobs.” 

“So I haven't got to drop and fluff yet,” she admitted. “I'm very much looking forward to that. But I feel like it's really fun.”

Lily says she's also been “buying fancy lingerie that my boobs can actually fit in” and “taking pictures on my phone.”

“Haven't sent them to anyone yet, but, it will hopefully get there at some point,” she joked.

She also addressed some of her own red flag behavior.

TV shows and movies have pushed boundaries over the years by exploring incest on screen.

The White Lotus is the most recent example, with Patrick Schwarzenegger‘s Saxon and Sam Nivola‘s Lochlan confusing Us with a kiss that should not be taking place between brothers. Luckily, HBO's hit show is known for messing with its audience by throwing out crazy story lines as conversation-starters about bigger topics.

“I think that one of the things that we worked on as a group, as a family, was to try to create that dynamic. The closeness, but the oddness, the weirdness [that] we thought was normal, the older brother to younger brother relationship,” Schwarzenegger told RadioTimes in March 2025. “But I think that Saxon actually really does care about his brother. He cares about his sister. And I think that the relationship with his brother – although it's very odd and weird, which is what [creator] Mike [White] wanted — it's still very loving at the same time.”

Before The White Lotus there was Netflix's Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menéndez Story making headlines for sexually charged moments between a fictional version of real siblings. The series was released in late 2024 and viewers immediately questioned why Monsters was marketing convicted murderers Lyle and Erik Menéndez as sexual partners.



Erik subsequently slammed the show for how it approached their story.

“I believed we had moved beyond the lies and ruinous character portrayals of Lyle, creating a caricature of Lyle rooted in horrible and blatant likes rampant in the show,” read a statement from Erik that was shared on Lyle's Facebook page in September 2024. “I can only believe they were done so on purpose. It is with a heavy heart that I say, I believe Ryan Murphy cannot be this naive and inaccurate about the facts of our lives so as to do this without bad intent.”

Keep scrolling for more instances when TV shows and movies shared incest story lines:


A&E's Bates Motel had five seasons to dig into the origins of Psycho‘s Norman Bates (Freddie Highmore). And there would be no Norman without his mother Norma (Vera Farmiga). Their connection didn't fully cross the line into romantic but the emotional undertones were enough to make Us feel uneasy. By the end of the series, Norma came to realize how dangerous Norman's devotion to her was — but it was ultimately too late.

Game of Thrones' Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and sister Cersei's (Lena Headey) romance walked so House of the Dragon could run. If there was any show that found a way to make the audience root for a love story between an uncle and his niece, it's House of the Dragon. Daemon (Matt Smith) and Rhaenyra's (Emma D'Arcy) chemistry spanned years until they finally got together after crossing paths again when she was an adult.

The 2018 film took a chance on a few changes from Darcey Bell‘s book of the same name. The biggest was Stephanie (Anna Kendrick) admitting that, as a teenager, she had sex with her half-brother, Chris (Dustin Milligan), at her father's funeral. Good thing Blake Lively‘s Emily never let her — or Us — forget it.

Ryan Murphy is no stranger to creating a show that starts a conversation. But Monsters became a pop culture phenomenon in part because of the backlash to scenes between Lyle Menéndez (Nicholas Alexander Chavez) and brother Erik Menéndez (Cooper Koch).

In the first episode, which premiered in 2024, Lyle — who was on drugs — kissed Erik on the lips. The show later featured a sequence where the brothers were seen taking a shower together. (The real Erik and Lyle never claimed to have been involved in a romantic or sexual relationship. Lyle specifically testified at his murder trial in 1994 that he never had a sexual relationship with his brother.)

As soon as Saxon asked Lochlan what porn he was into, the vibes were off in season 3. Then Lochlan watched Saxon walk around their hotel room naked. Then Saxon made it his mission to help his younger brother lose his virginity and it all went downhill from there. The good news? The White Lotus still has time to push the envelope even further.

During the third season of the hit FX series, Jax (Charlie Hunnam) almost slept with Trinity (Zoe Boyle) before finding out that she is his half-sister. Sons of Anarchy narrowly avoided going down the incest rabbit hole, but they were close enough that we are still talking about it.

Holly J. (Charlotte Arnold) wasn't the only one with questions about the twincest kiss heard around the world. Fiona (Annie Clark) caught just about everyone off guard when she pulled brother Declan (Landon Liboiron) in for a kiss. But, it was never explained whether there was actually a plan to touch on that close connection between the siblings.

Sometimes there is no better way to put a stop to a TV couple than by making them first cousins. Take Jess (Zooey Deschanel) and Robby (Nelson Franklin), for example. They were never meant to last while Nick (Jack Johnson) existed, so New Girl took the easy way out by making them related and moving the story along.

Based on V. C. Andrews' book series, Flowers in the Attic, If There Be Thorns and Seeds of Yesterday, the show played with the idea of forbidden romance spanning generations in one family. Kiernan Shipka and Mason Dye kicked it off as siblings Cathy and Christopher, respectively.

While Whitney (Brook Kerr) and Chad (Donn Swaby and Charles Divins) were ultimately not blood relatives, the spiral they went through on the soap opera makes them worthy of being on this list. Whitney was so guilt-ridden about potentially dating her half-brother — with whom she has a child — that she briefly became a nun. Talk about memorable.

Prateik Babbar, son of Raj Babbar and Smita Patil, recently married OTT actor Priya Banerjee, which made a lot of headlines. It was said that the actor did not invite anyone from his family including his father and brother. The couple tied the knot in the presence of friends and some relatives. Then a small event was held in Goa. Now the actors have given a joint interview to ETimes, where they candidly spoke about their relationship with Prateik's family. 


Prateik's grandparents attended the wedding

Prateik Babbar married his longtime girlfriend Priya Banerjee on February 14, 2025. On this occasion, he did not invite anyone from his family, including his father Raj Babbar and brother Arya Babbar. He tied the knot at mother Smita Patil's house. Prateik said that Priya Banerjee's becoming a bride was the most beautiful moment for him. The actor said, 'We both cried together. We were crying but we did not let the tears come out because Priya had done makeup. Priya said, 'We had family with us. The wedding took place at home. It was very special. And I wanted this because I was never a girl who dreamed of a big wedding. Everything happened well. Our wedding was very meaningful. It had a lot of emotional value for everyone involved. This marriage was blessed by my mother and my grandparents.'

Priya Banerjee reacts to Raj Babbar not attending the wedding

Priya Banerjee said that the Babbar family never existed. Without taking Raj Babbar's name, she said that he was never in Prateik's life. 'Some people get limelight by talking about other people. When you talk about people, you get a little attention here and there. People will talk. We don't need to listen to this. We have to live our lives. We have to be happy. We don't need to sit and explain ourselves to the whole world. We are not here to answer anyone. Nobody pays our bills,' the actor said. 

'Whoever spoke during our marriage, be it a troller, be it a family member, anyone, no one has lost their mother at the age of two weeks, right? No one has the right because no one can understand what this person has suffered. Whenever he (Prateik) feels that it is the right time to speak about it, to speak about those things which he has never spoken about, then he will speak,' she added

Priya Banerjee on Arya Babbar's allegations

During their wedding, several people including Prateik's stepbrother Arya alleged that whatever Prateik is doing, it is under the influence of Priya. On this, Priya revealed that it did not bother her at all. But Pratik said, 'It was bothering me because people were pointing fingers at her, saying she was the reason.' Priya further added, 'This is not new for us, not new for you, not new for the world. We know that whenever something happens, they always point fingers at a woman.'

Who was Prateek Babbar's first wife? 

For the unversed, Prateik was earlier married to producer Sanya Sagar. She was born on May 1, 1990 in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. After completing her studies, she came to Mumbai in 2008. After this, she got a degree in Fashion Communication from the National Institute of Fashion Technology. Sanya Sagar went to London for further studies. She earned a diploma in filmmaking from the London Film Academy. In 2017, she started working as the director of ZEE Entertainment Enterprise Limited. In the same year, Sanya Sagar set up her own production house, Pinkmoss Media Pvt Ltd. She is the daughter of Pawan Sagar, a close aide of Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati. Her father is employed as a special officer in the Mayawati government.

Sanya married Prateik Babbar on January 23, 2019. According to reports, Prateik and Sanya had known each other for nine years and were dating each other for two years before marriage. In a conversation with 'Mumbai Mirror', he had said that he wanted to date for a year or two before getting married. The love of Sanya Sagar and Prateik Babbar, however, did not last long as problems arose between them. Just a year after marriage, the news came that they were separating. However, they worked on their relationship. Tried to fix it. But fate had something else in store, due to which they got divorced in January 2023.

In a recent interview, Aamir Khan spoke openly about his son Junaid Khan's Loveyapa and shared his thoughts on the film's failure.

Aamir further added that Loveyapa did not do anything special at the box office and 'it's good'. He explained in detail that failures are necessary to learn and move forward. He said, 'I think he is doing well and he will continue to learn.'

Aamir praised Junaid's acting skills

Despite the film's failure, Aamir praised Junaid's acting talent. He said that the debutant is dedicated towards his work. The superstar also said that he completely immerses himself in his characters. Comparing his work in Maharaj and Loveyapa, Aamir emphasised how Junaid played both the characters successfully and showed his biggest strength as an actor.

Aamir acknowledged Junaid's weaknesses

While praising Junaid, Aamir also pointed out some of his weaknesses. He admitted that like him, Junaid is also not a great dancer and finds social gatherings challenging. He revealed that Junaid often gives strange and different answers during interviews, which makes the conversation a little awkward. Although Aamir is confident that Junaid will improve with time, he said that the failure of Loveyapa can prove to be a big learning for him.

What is similar between father and son?

When asked if he sees a reflection of himself in Junaid, Aamir admitted that he does. He recalled that in the early days, he too was shy like Junaid and was not very comfortable giving interviews. 

For the unversed, Aamir Khan will next be seen in Sitare Zameen Par featuring Darsheel Safari. The film is said to be releasing this year, during Christmas.

Soap opera fans, buckle up! Jack Wagner is still turning heads decades after his General Hospital debut, reminiscing about his legendary run as Frisco Jones and opening up about the grind of being a soap star. Meanwhile, Charles Mesure is saying goodbye to Port Charles after a short but memorable stint, with soap veteran Chris McKenna stepping in to keep the drama going. Chad Duell‘s fiery exit as Michael Corinthos shocked viewers, marking the end of the actor's 14-year journey.

On the flip side, Sebastian Roché teases fans with the possibility of Jerry Jacks making a triumphant (and probably scheming) return, though nothing's set in stone just yet. Lastly, Jonathan Jackson temporarily steps away as Lucky Spencer, leaving fans eager for his quick return while Guy Wilson fills in for some exciting new family drama. The soap world is heating up, and we're here for every twist and turn!

 It's been over 40 years since Jack Wagner made his debut on General Hospital, but soap opera fans still make the actor feel like a fresh-faced young star.  

Charles Mesure is closing the chapter on his time with General Hospital.

Chad Duell‘s exit from General Hospital was shocking, fiery and epic. 

Sebastian Roché hasn't ruled out a General Hospital return just yet. “Never say never,” Roché told Us Weekly exclusively.

onathan Jackson will be missing from General Hospital beginning on Tuesday, February 18, but fans have no reason to fear — Lucky Spencer will be back in Port Charles soon.

The second Formula 1 race of the season is taking place on Sunday (March 23) in Shanghai, China. 

Ahead of the 2025 Formula 1 Heineken Chinese Grand Prix, the drivers, team principals and more took time before the drivers parade to pay tribute to the late Eddie Jordan, who passed away this past week. 

Eddie was a racecar driver before starting his own Formula 1 team, Jordan Grand Prix in 1991, where he gave Michael Schumacher his debut season.

Current F1 drivers, including Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton and reserve driver Zhou Guanyu, Mercedes' George Russell, Alpine's Jack Doohan and more all took a moment prior to the race to honor the late, iconic team owner. 

“We are deeply saddened to hear about the sudden loss of Eddie Jordan,” F1 President and CEO Stefano Domenicali previously shared in a statement. “With his inexhaustible energy he always knew how to make people smile, remaining genuine and brilliant at all times. Eddie has been a protagonist of an era of F1 and he will be deeply missed. In this moment of sorrow, my thoughts and those of the entire Formula 1 family are with his family and loved ones.”

The 2025 Chinese Grand Prix is the second of 24 races this year, with McLaren's Oscar Piastri starting in first, followed by George in second and Lando Norris in third.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed separate closure reports in two cases related to the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput. One case is related to abetting Sushant to suicide, registered by his father KK Singh, while the second case has been registered by the actor's alleged girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty against his sisters. The CBI filed a closure report before a special court in Patna in the case filed by Sushant's father, while the closure report in the second case was presented before a special court in Mumbai.

In the above, officials said that now the courts will decide whether to accept the report or order the agency to investigate further. On this, actress Rhea Chakraborty's lawyer Satish Maneshinde praised the closure report and thanked the CBI for 'thoroughly investigating every aspect of the case from all angles'.

Postmortem report says suffocation was the cause of death

Sushant Singh Rajput was found hanging in his flat in Bandra, Mumbai on June 14, 2020. He was 34 years old. The postmortem conducted at Cooper Hospital concluded that the actor died due to suffocation.

CBI investigated two separate cases

CBI investigated two separate cases. One was a case filed by Sushant's father KK Singh with Patna Police, in which Rhea was accused of abetting suicide and withdrawing Rs 15 crore from the actor's bank account and the second case was filed by Rhea in Bandra, in which Sushant's sisters have been accused of giving him medicines based on a fake prescription issued by a Delhi doctor.

Rhea alleged that the death was due to the medicine

In the case registered before the Bandra police and later taken over by the CBI, Rhea had alleged that Sushant died five days after these medicines were given to him in the wrong manner.

There is no evidence to prove the allegation

Officials said that based on the opinion of experts, crime scene analysis, witness statements and forensic reports, the CBI concluded that there is no evidence to prove the allegation that someone might have forced the actor to commit suicide. They also added that the agency has finally decided to file its final report, which will put an end to the five-year-long conspiracy speculation surrounding the death of the Bollywood star.

Spreading false stories is completely unfair, says actor's lawyer

Rhea Chakraborty's lawyer Satish Maneshinde praised the closure report filed by the CBI. He said in a statement, 'We are grateful to the CBI for thoroughly investigating every aspect of the case from all angles and closing the case. It is completely unfair to spread false stories in social media and electronic media.'

Brennan Elliott has shared the sad news that his wife Camilla Row has passed away.

The 49-year-old actor, best known for his work in Hallmark shows and movies, revealed the news on Saturday (March 22), in a tribute post on Instagram. 

“There is no easy way to say this but I know my wife @camilla_row would have wanted me to thank every person from all over the world who prayed for her overthe last 8 years she suffered immeasurably trying to survive and live with #stage4gastriccancer,” Brennan started off his post. “It is with a soul crushing devastated heart that my beloved wife #cami passed away at 5:28 this morning. Our babies and I lost our rock, a person who not only was the love of my life,my soulmate,my best friend and lover but the toughest strongest fearless person I have ever met in my life and the greatest mother to her babies.”

“The pain she endured only I might know but assure all who loved her she is in peace with no more pain. You are with the lord now my queen!🙏🙏. You are free! Heaven is a far better place with you in it my love,” he continued. “THANKYOU for being the best wife,mother and friend I've ever known. What you did for the #gastriccancer community was immeasurable, but what you did for me as a man will last forever. For any of you who met or knew her your life was blessed because of her presence.”

“I love and am in love and will always be in love with you my baby! I know u r dancing and are on vacation in heaven and free from the grips of cancer. When the lord calls me and it's my time I will c u in heaven and we will start dancing again.!!🙏🙏 I will always be your hot mess!😂 missing you on this plane forever but will c u soon! THANKYOU Cami for being YOU!” Brennan concluded his post.

Our thoughts and condolences go out to Brennan Elliott‘s family during this difficult time.

A walk-in cooler ignited the fire at the Orlando resort, EW has learned.

Disney;Ryan/x

 A large fire broke out Saturday evening at Disney World's Epcot theme park in Orlando with a walk-in cooler igniting inside a backstage area, Entertainment Weekly has learned.


 The cooler was located in Epcot's France area, specifically in an employees-only section not accessible to guests. The device caught on fire and was quickly extinguished before the blaze spread further. No one was injured in the fire.


 Footage from the incident (below), captured by a park guest riding the Skyliner attraction, shows large black smoke billowing up from an area between the Remy's Ratatouille Adventure ride within the park's France pavilion and walkways deeper into the park's Morocco pavilion. "Oh my God, it's right there!" says a shocked onlooker in the footage which shows a large cloud of billowing black smoke and a line of orange flames.


 EW has reached out to representatives for the Walt Disney World Resort as well as the Orlando Fire Department for more information.


 Other footage circulating online shows clouds of smoke rising into the sky, visible from the nearby Boardwalk area just outside Epcot's gates.


 The Epcot fire isn't the first major blaze at a Disney parks property. In recent years, the Maleficent dragon figure at California's Disneyland park also caught fire during a Fantasmic! show performance in early 2023, leading to the removal of the pyrotechnic effect later that year.

 Epcot is one of four major theme parks currently operating at Walt Disney World. It opened as the second of the Florida resort's lineup of parks, with the first being Magic Kingdom, which opened in 1971. It was followed by Disney's Hollywood Studios (which opened as the Disney-MGM Studios in 1989) and Animal Kingdom in 1998.
