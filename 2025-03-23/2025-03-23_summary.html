Among the 41 people killed between Saturday afternoon and late Sunday morning was senior Hamas leader Salah al-Bardawil, a member of the movement's political bureau, who was killed overnight, according to a statement from Hamas. “Every day without food inches Gaza closer to an acute hunger crisis,” Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, wrote on X. “Banning aid is a collective punishment on Gaza: the vast majority of its population are children, women & ordinary men.” Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.</p>

The health of Francis, who was admitted to hospital on 14 February and subsequently diagnosed with a respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia, was steadily improving, Sergio Alfieri, a general surgeon at Gemelli hospital, told reporters on Saturday. “The hope is that he will soon be able to resume a work schedule,” Alfieri said. However, he cautioned that the pope would not immediately be able to meet groups of people. It remains unclear if an audience with King Charles and Queen Camilla, scheduled for 8 April, will take place. Speculation over an imminent resignation was vehemently dismissed last week by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state.</p>

It is a message that has resonated with many Canadians who have been worried about the country's housing crisis, stagnant wages and high cost of living. His party overwhelmingly chose him - with more than 80% of the vote - to succeed Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader earlier this month. Justin Trudeau led Canada for almost 10 years, from his first election as Liberal leader in the fall of 2015 to now. After Trudeau announced he would step down, the Liberal party voted for Mark Carney to replace him. He is scheduled to speak with Canada's governor general in about 1.5 hours' time, and has a media conference not long after that.</p>

Initially, Mr Hazel and his group of Tesla owners were thrilled to be participating in the Mardi Gras celebration, proudly showcasing their Cybertrucks adorned with American flags and custom wraps. Mr Hazel vividly recalled the moment when he saw someone sprinting up to his Cybertruck and aggressively hurling a handful of thick Mardi Gras beads, striking his wife on the head. Ms Christina has already incurred significant expenses, having spent over $2,000 to replace her Cybertruck's broken top glass. Notably, this incident is part of a larger trend of attacks on Tesla facilities and vehicles across the US, with some incidents involving vandalism, graffiti, and even shootings. President Trump has condemned the attacks, suggesting that they be classified as domestic terrorism.</p>

Republican senator Steve Daines, a staunch supporter of Donald Trump, met Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing on Sunday, as China hopes to reach a deal to avert further tariff pressure from Washington. Daines, a member of the Senate foreign relations committee, was heavily involved in negotiations over US-China trade during Trump's first term, and has made multiple trips to China as a senator. In early April, Trump is expected to unleash a round of tariffs on all countries that tax US imports, potentially including China. A US review of whether China has fulfilled promises made during the “phase one” trade deal from Trump's first administration is set to conclude on 1 April.

Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said he expected “some real progress” at the talks in Saudi Arabia, “particularly as it affects a Black Sea ceasefire on ships between both countries, and from that you'll naturally gravitate into a full-on shooting ceasefire.” Asked about concerns that Russian President Vladimir Putin may be looking beyond Ukraine and could press further into Europe, even if Russia is awarded territory within Ukraine now, Witkoff said he has been asked his opinion on what Putin's motives are on a large scale. “There is no point in signing anything (with Russians), because it will not be worth the cost of paper where you put this signature. Vadym Filashkin said, including three who died in a strike on the frontline town of Dobropillya. “This week alone, more than 1,580 guided aerial bombs, almost 1,100 strike drones and 15 missiles of various types were used against our people,” he said.</p>

More US states are reporting measles cases as the Texas outbreak expands, surpassing last year's total, amid vaccine misinformation and hesitancy. The outbreak has spread to New Mexico, where 42 cases, two hospitalizations, and one death of an unvaccinated adult have been confirmed. There's social pressure against getting vaccinated and misinformation has taken root over the past two decades, she says. Two children hospitalized in Lubbock tested positive, which meant there was more community spread happening under the radar. In Ohio, an unvaccinated resident tested positive for measles after international travel, according to the state department of health.</p>

V Adm Peter Hudson, vice-chair of the commission, said: “It transcends even those very fraught national relationships which exist between our two countries today.” Relations between London and Moscow have become so strained that earlier this month Britain was labelled Russia's public enemy number one after the country's foreign intelligence service accused the UK of trying to derail Donald Trump's attempts at a peace deal. His commission oversees 600,000 German graves in Russia and other former areas of the eastern front. About 760,000 Soviet citizens were buried in Germany as a result of the second world war.</p>

A South Korean family of three, including Jiyeon Lee, 33, her mother Taehee Kim, 59, and aunt Junghee Kim, 54, have mysteriously vanished while on a trip to the Grand Canyon. According to the Coconino County Sheriff's Office, GPS data from their rented white BMW showed they were last on Interstate 40 in Williams, Arizona, about 35 minutes west of Flagstaff. The Coconino County Sheriff's Office issued a missing person alert for the South Korean family and released a poster on Facebook on March 21. While police haven't confirmed their involvement, Coconino Sheriff's spokesman Jon Paxton stated that it's a possibility being investigated, as per ABC News. After losing contact with the trio, who were supposed to return to South Korea on March 17, their family members contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for assistance.</p>

The dark sci-fi series about office workers with split consciousnesses was nominated for 14 Emmys after its first season in 2022. It has since supported multiple high-profile directors to produce bold award season-friendly work like Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, Ridley Scott's Napoleon, and Steve McQueen's Blitz. Thanks to its deeply mysterious plot and confusing cliffhangers, each week it has become a genuine competitor for people's attention. While industry papers estimated it fell way short of breaking even, Apple insisted the film was profitable. Concerns over cultural impact of shows dumped on streamers is not a problem solely owned by them.</p>

The U.S. has lifted bounties on three senior Taliban figures, including the interior minister who also heads a powerful network blamed for bloody attacks against Afghanistan's former Western-backed government, officials in Kabul said Sunday. Sirajuddin Haqqani, who acknowledged planning a January 2008 attack on the Serena Hotel in Kabul, which killed six people, including U.S. citizen Thor David Hesla, no longer appears on the State Department's Rewards for Justice website. The FBI website on Sunday still featured a wanted poster for him. “These three individuals are two brothers and one paternal cousin,” Qani told The Associated Press.</p>

A 38-year-old German tourist was apprehended at the ancient Mayan site of Chichen Itza in Mexico for disregarding rules and scaling a centuries-old pyramid. According to Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History, the tourist trespassed into a restricted area around 5 pm and climbed the pyramid. He's clearly in good physical condition," one security agent said, as reported by Mexico Daily News. However, the German national was still met with hostility, being jeered, physically assaulted, and left bloody after receiving a blow to the forehead, according to a witness who spoke to EFE.

To combat the depopulation in its villages, Trentino, an autonomous province in northern Italy has rolled out a tempting offer: relocate to its stunning Alpine region and receive a one-time grant of Rs 92 lakh (100,000 euros). "The goal is to revitalise local communities and promote territorial cohesion," said Maurizio Fugatti, president of Trento. Last week, a town named Penne, located in Italy's central region of Abruzzo, announced it was selling off abandoned homes for as low as one euro or little over a dollar. "There are potentially over 40 empty buildings in town looking for new owners, and they're all located in the historical center which has been declining since families started emigrating decades ago," said Penne's mayor Gilberto Petrucci.

William O'Neill, a UN human-rights expert who visited Port-au-Prince earlier this month, saw no exaggeration in comparisons with Saigon or Kabul: “The sense of fear is palpable. Three months later, the first members of a planned 2,500-strong, UN-backed security force were deployed, with its commanders also insisting peace could be restored.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said “new pressure” was needed to halt daily Russian attacks on Ukraine, as an overnight drone attack killed three people in Kyiv. Putin has said any talks must address what he frames as “the root causes” of Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022, primarily his concerns around an expanding Nato alliance. Putin also said during his call with Trump that any long-term deal would require an ending of intelligence sharing and military aid to Kyiv from its allies. Zelenskyy has accused Russia of making “unnecessary demands” that will drag out the war, and said Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure had not stopped despite Putin's claims about his readiness to halt them. My colleague Pjotr Sauer has written this useful explainer on when the ceasefire is expected to take effect and what happens if Russia or Ukraine breaks their word.</p>

From well-known adaptations such as Akira Kurosawa's Ran and Vishal Bhardwaj's Shakespearean trilogy to lesser-known works such as Belarus Free Theatre's King Lear and Sulayman al-Bassam's The Speaker's Progress, Shakespeare has long possessed a global presence. As virtually all the documents quoted were several years old, it is unclear why this should be a news story now. “Decolonisation” has become such a voguish movement in recent years, with universities and museums tapping into the trend, and calls to decolonise everything from counselling to photography, that even some of its advocates now decry the “bandwagon”. “The notion of universality,” writes Helen Hopkins, an academic whose work has helped shape SBT's decolonising project, “is deeply intertwined with imperial logic” that “privileges white Anglo-centric, Eurocentric” views. It was through reading “Marx, Freud, TS Eliot, Pound, Gertrude Stein and Hemingway”, and “books which seldom, if ever, mentioned Negroes” that he had been able to “release” himself “from whatever ‘segregated' idea I might have had of my human possibilities”.</p>

In a separate statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he and Defense Minister Israel Katz ordered the military “to act forcefully against dozens of terror targets in Lebanon.” Netanyahu added that the Lebanese government is responsible for “everything taking place within its territory.” Hezbollah has denied involvement, calling the accusations a pretext for further aggression. Earlier raids on Touline left five dead, including two children, with 11 others injured. The fighting began when Hezbollah opened fire on Israeli positions in support of Gaza, following West Jerusalem's military response to Hamas' October 7 attack, in which 1,200 people were killed and 250 were taken hostage. Cross-border clashes later escalated into a full Israeli offensive that killed senior Hezbollah figures, destroyed weapons stockpiles, and caused mass civilian casualties.</p>

Vivian Jenna Wilson, the 20-year-old estranged daughter of Elon Musk, has made it clear that she wants nothing to do with her father- or his social media platform, X (formerly Twitter). Vivian Wilson has been highly active on Meta's Threads and Bluesky, a decentralised social media platform that many see as an alternative to Elon Musk's X. Musk acquired Twitter (now X) in 2022 - the same year Wilson legally changed her name, writing in a petition that she no longer wished to be "related to [her] biological father in any way, shape, or form." Bluesky, originally launched as a side project by Twitter's co-founder Jack Dorsey in 2019, gained traction after Musk's takeover. In a 2024 interview with manosphere influencer Jordan Peterson, Musk repeatedly deadnamed Wilson and claimed she had been "killed by the woke mind virus." His remarks echoed how she was portrayed in Walter Isaacson's biography of Musk - as an angry, rebellious child with radical political views.</p>

Before his detention, Imamoglu had already faced multiple criminal cases that could result in prison sentences and a political ban. Other protesters gathered outside Istanbul city hall – Imamoglu's designated office – where protests have been taking place daily since the mayor's arrest. Protesters say pepper spray was used against them, along with water cannons, tear gas and some even claim officers fired rubber bullets.</p>

Earlier this month, Tiwari and her team member dressed up in pyjamas and drove to a five-star hotel in Delhi's posh Chanakyapuri area to see if they could get away with a free breakfast by pretending to be hotel guests. “Mujhe vishwas nahi ho raha ki ye hack sach mein kaam kar gaya (I can't believe this hack actually worked),” she tells the camera at one point. “I did not find this video funny from any angle, I hope that your video did not send the wrong message to anyone, otherwise, many people get into trouble and such names also get spoiled.”</p>

Sources in Meerut police have said they will seek their custody for detailed questioning as part of the investigation. Saurabh had come home last month to celebrate the birthday and his six-year-old daughter. Muskaan's relationship with Saurabh's family was strained and the couple had moved out to a rented home. Saurabh's family has alleged Muskaan married him for money and they did not like her from the beginning.</p>

It has also seen protests over political representation and land, including a particularly violent outbreak in 2020. Others who have been here for decades are forced to live illegally because the immigration authorities will not renew their documents.

Euronews Tech Talks goes beyond discussions to explore the impact of new technologies on our lives. These statements often appear during decisive events, like elections, or in war-related posts, influencing users' opinions and behaviour. Another significant concern is the use of AI-generated content, which makes it even harder for users to differentiate between real and fake information. Jones said that while deepfakes and AI-generated images can look incredibly realistic, there are key ways to identify them. Rajczyk stressed a similar need for media literacy and how crucial it is to compare news from multiple sources.</p>

Key scientific lessons learned during the Covid-19 pandemic are being forgotten, UK scientists have warned. “Every winter, even before Covid, hospitals were run very close to the edge,” said Prof Rowland Kao of Edinburgh University. It might have been moderately effective for reducing infection but it underestimated the need for connection, contact and community, said Dominic Abrams, professor of social psychology at Kent University: “There seemed to be almost no strategy to meet those fundamental needs. “My big regret is that we still have not reached scientific consensus on the value and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions [NPIs],” he said. During the pandemic, richer nations pressured low-income and middle-income countries to introduce lockdowns, with disastrous consequences.</p>

But having experienced that lockdown, it is now pertinent to ask, five years later, what did we learn? During lockdown the public was asked to give up freedoms that, until March 2020, we had taken for granted. This would not be the case with Covid as Professor Adam Finn, a paediatrician at Bristol University, pointed out. This did not happen, though worries that reopening schools could threaten teachers with serious illness picked up from pupils persisted. This was echoed by Andrew Shepherd, director of the Chronic Poverty Advisory Network, who said: “Lockdowns are not suitable for every country.</p>

From nutritionists to fitness coaches, it is highly recommended for muscle repair, immune function, and overall wellbeing. Dr Khamsera dispelled the common notion that eating more protein would automatically turn you into a bodybuilder. In fact, overloading protein can strain your kidneys, especially if you have pre-existing kidney issues. Exceeding this consistently can lead to digestive discomfort, nutrient imbalances, and even dehydration, as protein metabolism requires extra water.” Plant-based proteins, like lentils or quinoa, are healthier for your heart but may require combining sources to get all essential amino acids.”</p>

"If the intention is to scare, we are not deterred, but stop this cowardly act," Setri said in a statement. He later clarified his remark, telling news site Kompas on Saturday that press freedom must be upheld and such acts taken "seriously". The magazine has published in recent weeks stories criticising Prabowo's policies, including widespread budget cuts that stoked protests last month. Tempo was banned twice -- lastly in 1994 -- under Suharto, who ruled Indonesia with an iron fist for more than three decades.

For tourists from France, Uzbekistan, and Argentina interviewed by AFP in New York's Times Square, Trump's stance has not upended their plans. Some 77.7 million foreign tourists were expected in 2024, up 17 percent year-on-year, according to the National Travel and Tourism Office, which does not yet have final figures for last year. Tourists from Western Europe -- who made up 37 percent of visitors in 2024 -- are the most likely to choose other destinations, along with Canadians and Mexicans. She lowered her forecast for the year in February but said that so far, only Canadians are saying no to Trump's America. "This will make the US more expensive for inbound travelers, dampening both visitor volume and average length of stay," noted Tourism Economics.</p>

The arrest this week of Imamoglu has intensified political tensions and sparked widespread protests across Turkey, with demonstrators rallying in multiple cities to voice their opposition. Many view his arrest as a politically driven attempt to remove Imamoglu from the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. Authorities barred access to the courthouse using barricades on local roads and closing nearby metro stations. Imamoglu's arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People's Party's presidential candidate in a primary on Sunday. Ozel has said that the primary, where around 1.5 million delegates can vote, will go ahead as planned.</p>

An Indian-origin woman has been charged with allegedly murdering her 11-year-old son after a three-day vacation to Disneyland.

"The life of a child should not hang in the balance between two parents whose anger for each other outweighs their love for their child," Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said.

The Liberals said on Saturday that Carney would run to represent the suburban riding, or district, of Nepean, noting in a social media post that Ottawa is where he raised his family and devoted his career to public service. Carney replaced Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January but remained in power until the governing Liberal party elected Carney on 9 March following a leadership race. Carney, sworn in as Canada's 24th prime minister on 14 March, has said the government in a time of crisis needs a strong and clear mandate. But after decades of stability in US-Canada relations, the vote is expected instead to focus on who is best equipped to deal with Trump. The party and Poilievre had been heading for a huge victory in Canada's federal election this year until derailed by Trump's behaviour.</p>

Over the following 17 years, a small number of billionaires grew ever richer and more influential. As Tett, who is also the provost of King's College, Cambridge observes: “Every single person assumes that the intellectual framework they grew up with and built their careers around is natural, normal, inevitable and should be universal. But efforts to devise a new model have been slow and unproductive, despite increasing public unease. They  have developed thick skins from being outsiders whose ideas were marginalised and shouted down. Over that time the guiding paradigm of economics and social organisation have changed, as old models imploded, or collapsed with war.</p>

However, earlier this week, Ms Garcia discovered that the platform was hosting several bots, based on her late son. “Our team discovered several chatbots on Character.AI's platform displaying our client's deceased son, Sewell Setzer III, in their profile pictures, attempting to imitate his personality and offering a call feature with a bot using his voice,” the lawyers said. When opened, the bots based on Setzer featured bios and delivered automated messages to users such as: "Get out of my room, I'm talking to my AI girlfriend", "his AI girlfriend broke up with him", and "help me".

At least three people were killed, including a five-year-old child, and at least 10 others injured as Russia launched an overnight drone attack on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, hitting apartment buildings and causing several fires throughout the city, Ukrainian officials said on Sunday. Russia said one person died when a drone hit a car in the Rostov region, while at least 59 Ukrainian drones were launched at Russian areas, including Rostov, Astrakhan, Voronezh, Volgograd, Kursk and Saratov, as well as over illegally Russian-occupied Crimea. Russian authorities made their usual broad claim that all Ukrainian drones were shot down. Talks between US and Ukrainian officials are scheduled to begin on Sunday in Saudi Arabia. Authorities in southern Russia's Krasnodar region brought in firefighting trains loaded with water on Saturday to help battle a blaze still raging at an oil depot after a Ukrainian drone attack.</p>

Pavel, a former senior military commander, made the comments in an interview with European Pravda published on Saturday.

NASA has scrubbed its public commitment to land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon under its Artemis lunar program. “In keeping with the president's executive order, we're updating our language regarding plans to send crew to the lunar surface as part of NASA's Artemis campaign,” a NASA spokesperson said in a statement. The Artemis II crew, which in 2026 will perform a lunar flyby without landing, still includes female astronaut Christina Koch and African American astronaut Victor Glover. NASA has been accused in the past of lacking diversity and has had a reputation of being staffed by “old, white men,” according to The Guardian. In January, Trump signed an executive order aimed at dismantling DEI programs and “restoring merit-based” hiring.</p>

Israel has renewed its fighting in Gaza since Tuesday, hitting targets across the war-ravaged territory and ending a weeks-long deadlock over extending the ceasefire that paused fighting in January, with Palestinian health ministry officials reporting hundreds of deaths. Two hospitals in southern Gaza said they had received 17 bodies from strikes overnight, including several women and children, according to an Associated Press report. Hamas' de facto government head Essam Addalees and internal security chief Mahmoud Abu Watfa were among those killed by Israeli strikes on Tuesday, apart from several other officials. Palestinian health officials said at least 400 people, more than half of them women and children, were killed on Tuesday. The war began with Hamas' cross-border attack on October 7, 2023, which killed approximately 1,200 people and took 250 hostages.</p>

TEL AVIV (AP) — Unlike many families who blame Israel's government for not getting their loved ones released from captivity in Gaza, Adi Alexander is hesitant to point fingers. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come under mounting domestic pressure, with mass protests over his handling of the hostage crisis. The arrest this week of Imamoglu has intensified political tensions and sparked widespread protests across Turkey, with demonstrators rallying in multiple cities to voice their opposition. Many view his arrest as a politically driven attempt to remove Imamoglu from the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. While the pages of some well-known veterans, including baseball and civil rights icon Jackie Robinson, are now back up on Pentagon websites, officials warn that many posts tagged for removal in error may be gone forever.</p>

It came from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who told reporters Wednesday his "base case" is that higher inflation stemming from President Trump's tariffs will be "transitory" — reviving memories of how central bank policymakers talked about inflation during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. "I would have thought that, particularly after the big policy mistake of earlier this decade and given all the current uncertainties, some Fed officials would show greater humility," Mohamed El-Erian, president of Queens' College and chief economic adviser at Allianz, said on social media. Other Fed watchers were more sympathetic, noting that Powell's overall commentary on the topic did, in fact, show some humility about past mistakes. The first, Luzzetti said, is it will be impossible to identify inflation driven by tariffs versus organic price pressures in real time. "In short, it is too early to brush aside elevated inflation this year as transitory," Luzzetti said.</p>

(In 2019, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez unveiled the Loan Shark Prevention Act, which would have imposed a 15% limit on all interest rates.) In the US, dozens of states place restrictions on payday lenders, or try to ban them outright. Some have found that the rules backfire by pushing customers to rely on other, expensive and less regulated types of credit, like bank overdrafts, without improving their overall finances. The 36% cap didn't seem to affect credit access for people in the military community who had subprime credit scores, but didn't improve their finances much either, measured by factors like delinquency rates or debts going into collections.

But considering what an unconventional prospect we're dealing with, it's reasonable to say that Flagg wouldn't thrive under the same conditions as a standard No. And, given how well-rounded his game already is, we probably want him on a winner sooner rather than later if possible. Collins -- on an expiring deal next season assuming he picks up his player option -- is the easiest to get off of if necessary. 16 overall pick (and former Duke Blue Devil) Jared McCain at shooting guard, but breakout deadline addition Quentin Grimes as well.

If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The good news for the Lakers is Luka Doncic continues to surge toward what feels like it could be a monster postseason for him. Dončić took a while to get settled with the Lakers, but he's been in full form for a bit and stormed out of the gates for 17 first-quarter points on Saturday. Dončić has always been a first-quarter sniper, and he really had it rolling on Saturday when he wound up with 29 points and seven 3-pointers in the first half. Luka is clearly starting to feel himself in a Lakers uniform.</p>

Sweet relief didn't come until Gonzaga's Khalif Battle tried a corner 3-pointer to tie it, but the shot was blocked by Houston's Ja'Vier Francis with two seconds left. It was the most points Houston had given up since its last loss, an 82-81 defeat on Feb. 1 at home against Texas Tech. It has now won 15 in a row, the last six this month by almost 11 points per game before Saturday. Houston will be accompanied by BYU and Texas Tech into the Sweet 16 with Sunday's second-round games still to play. That's what it looks like when Houston's bigs pitch out of a scramble underneath to Cryer at the perimeter.</p>

The Golden State Warriors have won 16 out of their last 20 games, but they have not been playing all that well of late and it bit them on Saturday in what Draymond Green called a "terrible loss" at Atlanta. The Warriors, who were playing without Stephen Curry, got down by 17 after the first quarter and were never really able to fight their way back in a 124-115 loss that wasn't as close as that score indicates. Other than that, they laid an egg against the Nuggets, who were playing without Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray and Christian Braun, and squeaked past a bad Toronto team before the loss to the Hawks (who, to be fair, have been playing better with six wins in their last eight games). That's how huge every game is at this point, and even though the next three look like they should be wins on paper (all on the road against Miami, New Orleans and San Antonio), nothing can be taken for granted without Curry. The Heat have lost 10 straight, but you can bet they'll be up for that one.</p>

Conference player of the year RJ Luis Jr. had nine points, half his season average, on 3-of-17 shooting. So many of those teams were built with a full-court defense and 3-point shooting. “Rick did a good job with his team all year,” Calipari said. “It's just a bitter pill to swallow with that type of performance.” Any commercial use or distribution without the express written consent of STATS LLC and Associated Press is strictly prohibited.</p>

When its offense needed a super-charge to catch up and play from behind, Luis -- one of the few live wires who can ignite an otherwise pedestrian offense -- looked on from the sidelines. In response, the coach singled out Kadary Richmond, Deivon Smith and Aaron Smith -- curiously omitting Luis -- as players who he appreciated for "giving them every single thing they had." Pitino noted that he would not "knock" one of his players in public, but he did read Luis' stat line and seemed to take issue specifically with the style of his team's offensive strategy and execution in perhaps a thinly veiled shot at Luis, who was the only guard over 20 minutes not to log an assist. More from Rick Pitino on why RJ Luis was benched for final 4:56 vs. Arkansas: — "He played 30 minutes. St. John's finished with just five assists to six turnovers and shot a woeful 2 of 22 from 3-point range and 21 of 75 from the field in the loss.</p>

PROVIDENCE, R.I. — When Arkansas beat Georgia 68-65 on Jan. 22 in Fayetteville, it was cause for an atypical in-season celebration. Saturday's second round battle was a compelling but unsightly game with 44 fouls, 58 free throws and abhorrent 3-point shooting: St. John's and Arkansas combined to shoot 4-of-41 from beyond the arc (9.8%), setting a record for the worst combined 3-point shooting display in NCAA Tournament history. Few, if any, coaches have been more maligned for their missteps in coaching and approach to roster-building like Calipari. In doing so, Calipari is only the fourth coach to ever win back-to-back tournament games against Naismith Memorial Hall-of-Famers. He decided to jump, just under different circumstances than ever before in his four decades of coaching.</p>

Behind him are seven players at 5 under, headlined by Thomas, who will have plenty of confidence going into Sunday after his third-round 65. After the round, Thomas made a quick pitch to U.S. Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley. "Hopefully, Keegan was watching; I think we had a good best ball today," Thomas joked. They'll need more than one or two good days at Innisbrook to book their tickets to Bethpage Black, but if they can find that feeling from Saturday regularly this year, perhaps we could get the return of a U.S. Ryder Cup staple pairing this fall.</p>
