Groundbreaking observations of a repeating explosion in space, the recurrent nova LMCN 1968-12a, reveal that it's the hottest burst of its kind ever recorded.

Located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a nearby satellite galaxy of the Milky Way , LMCN 1968-12a is the first recurrent nova outside our galaxy to have been studied in near-infrared light.

Beyond its extreme temperatures, this nova is also notable for being an extremely violent eruption with unique chemical properties that differ significantly from those observed in our galaxy, the researchers explained in a paper published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .

Seeing dead stars

When a white dwarf, the leftover core of a collapsed star, is in a tight orbit around another star, it can pull material from that star, leading to some pretty dramatic astronomical events. One of these is called a nova, which means ""new"" in Latin.

This event results in a bright flash in the sky, as if a new star had appeared, and lasts a few weeks or months before fading. When the dust clears, the original stars remain (unlike in a supernova , which happens when a star is completely destroyed).

In the binary system, as the white dwarf steals gas from its younger companion, the accumulated material forms an accretion disk around the white dwarf. Matter swirls in the disk, and when it reaches the white dwarf's surface and piles up, the pressure and temperature rise so high that it ignites a rapid burning of hydrogen into heavier elements. This is known as a thermonuclear runaway reaction.

This reaction produces a high-energy blast that expels a huge chunk of material from the white dwarf's surface — resulting in a nova. The nova is called ""recurrent"" when the white dwarf continues to pull more material from its companion, causing similar short-lived bursts of energy at regular intervals ranging from a few months to several years apart.

Not many recurrent novas have been observed in our galaxy, and even fewer have been found outside the Milky Way. Studying novas helps astronomers understand the dynamics of binary systems and the influence of surrounding conditions on these eruptions.

LMCN 1968-12a was the first recurrent nova to be found outside our galaxy. Discovered in 1968, the system consists of a white dwarf and a red subgiant star. It erupts every four years, and its eruptions have been observed regularly since 1990.

The most recent eruption occurred in August 2024. Following the initial observations, the Magellan Baade telescope and the Gemini South telescope — both in Chile — carried out follow-up observations of LMCN 1968-12a in near-infrared light nine days and 22 days after the outburst, respectively. The observations showed the light emitted by various elements that became highly energized during the eruption.

Reading the missing lines

The spectra from the Magellan telescope revealed a clear spike in ionized silicon that was 95 times brighter than the light emitted by the sun added up across all of its wavelengths. A similar dominance of silicon was seen in the spectra from Gemini, although the brightness was lower.

The brightness of silicon was unexpected, said study co-author Tom Geballe , an astronomer emeritus at NOIRLab, and the missing spikes were even more surprising.

""We would've expected to also see signatures of highly energized sulfur, phosphorus, calcium and aluminum,"" Geballe said in a statement .

Study co-author Sumner Starrfield , Regents professor of astrophysics at Arizona State University, added, ""This surprising absence, combined with the presence and great strength of the silicon signature, implied an unusually high gas temperature, which our modeling confirmed.""

According to the team's estimates, this is one of the hottest novas ever recorded, with the temperature of the expelled gas reaching 5.4 million degrees Fahrenheit (3 million degrees Celsius). The highly violent eruption, indicated by such extreme temperatures, suggests a connection to the conditions surrounding the nova.

The Large Magellanic Cloud has a lower metallicity than our galaxy, meaning it contains fewer elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. This results in a greater buildup of matter on the white dwarf's surface before ignition, leading to more violent nova explosions.

By contrast, in high-metallicity systems, heavy elements alter the process. Moreover, the ejected gas collides with the companion star's atmosphere, creating a shock that raises temperatures.

Starrfield predicted that low-metallicity material would cause more-intense nova events, and the observations have come through. The study authors emphasized that using large telescopes like Gemini South to study different galaxies will enhance our understanding of these processes in various chemical environments.",livescience

For the First Time, a Clinical Trial has demonstrate that tathing high doses of vitamin d may slow the progression of multiple sclerosis.

In general, too much vitamin d can be dangerous; However, The High Doses in the New Trial Were Taken in Controlled Conditions, Under the Supervision of Medical Staff, and by Patients for Whom It Was Deemed Safe.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune diSE that affects the brain and spinal cord. In Those with the Disease, Immune Cells Mistakenly Attack The Protective Layer Around Nerve Fibers, Causing Lesions, Or Scar Tissue, To Form. This leads to symptoms such as muscle weakness, changes in vision, nombness and memory problemms, which may eith eith and go or get worse over time.

There is no cure for ms. Existing Drugs can help patients manage their symptoms, but these medications often have nasty side effects, such as an increased risk of infections and gastrointestinal.

Related: Twin Study Reveals Signs of Ms That Might Be Detectable Before Symptoms

Studies suggest that vitamin d deficiency is a potential risk factor for ms. That's because Vitamin d can reduce inflammation in the central nervous system in numerous ways - for instance, by inhibiting the release of chessengers from immune cells that trigger inflammatory. Thus, Theory is that having too much vitamin d May Allow Runaway Inflammation to Ensue.

The link between low vitamin d and multiple sclerosis was first identified in the 1960s. Yet, over the Years, Various Clinical Trials have tried and failed to show that tathing high doses of vitamin d can help to reduce to patients' symptoms or disease progression.

PREVIOUS TRIALS MAY HAVE FAILED BECAUSE THESY INCLUDED TO Few participants and Monitored Patients for Only Short Periods of Time, Such As A Year, Said Dr. Eric Thouvenot, Co-Lead of the New Clinical Trial and A Neurologist at the University of Montpellier in France. Past trials also tested vitamin d Supplementation in Patients who we Already Taking Drugs to Manage Their Ms, He Told Live Science. This made it Harder to Determine How Effective Vitamin D was, in and of itself.

To overcome these HURDLES, Thouvenot and Colleagues Took A Different Approach in Their New Trial.

They Looked at the effects of high-dose vitamin D Supplementation in 303 patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Cis Describes when Patients Have Early Signs that are suggestive of multiple sclerosis but they have not yet developed the full-fledged disease and don meet the diagnosis Criteria. Signs of CIS include inflammation and damage to the protective layer surrounds nerve fibers.

Although not a given that cis will progress into multiple sclerosis, this is the case for approximately 85% of ms patients.

The Patients In The Trial Had Yet To Start Taking Other Drugs for Multiple Sclerosis, So The Researchers Had A Window in Which They Could Directly Investigate The Impact of Vitamin D Supplementation On Their Disease Progression.

DURING THE TRIAL, The Team Randomly Assigned 156 of the Patients to Take A High-Dose of A Form of Vitamin D Called cholecalciferol. They Took the Supplement ONCE EVERY Two Weeks for Two Years, or Until they showed signs of MS Symptoms or New Or Growing Lesions During Medical Visits. These visits occurred three months after starting supplementation, one year out and then Two Years Out, and they involved Brain and Spinal Cord Scans and Ms Symptom Assessments.

If Disease Activity was deteted, Patients WOULD BE Removed from the Trial and Immodely prescribed Disease-Modifying Drugs, Meaning Drugs that alleviate symptoms by targeting the root Causes of ms.

A Comparison Group of 147 Patients Underwent the Same Protocol But Took A Dummy Drug Institute of Vitamin D, Accord to A Report of the Trial Published March 10 in the Journal Jama.

The dose The Vitamin D Group Received was 100,000 International Units, Which is around 20 Times More Than What Common Drug Store Contain Per Dose.

Overall, The Researchers Found that Disease Activity Occurred in 60% of the vitamin d group with the Two-Year Study window, compared with 74% in the placebo group. The Time It Took for Symptoms to Emerge was also signaling in the training group Than the Latter - About 432 Days, Compared with 224 Days.

Taken Together, these findings suggest that supplementation with High-Dose Vitamin D May Help Slow the Progression of Cis to Multiple Sclerosis.

This is ""Important Research"" and supports The Use of High-Dose Vitamin D by Patients With Multiple Sclerosis, Said Dr. Klaus Schmierer, A Professor of Neurology at Queen Mary University of London who was not involved in the new trial. Many Doctors Already recommend such supplementation, Schmierer Told Live Science in an Email.

Many Clinicians recommend that ms patients Take Between 4,000 and 5,000 International Units of Vitamin D Each Day. Any more than this can cause on condition Called Hypercalcemia, in Which Too Much Calcium Builds Up in the body, Becuse Vitamin D Normally Regulates The Levels of this mineral in tissue. Hypercalcemia can weaken bones and potentialy lead to kidney and heart damage.

Despite Being Over the Recommended Limit for Vitamin D Supplementation, No One in the New Trial Who Received Vitamin D Developed Hypercalcemia. That hinted that this High dose May be in this context, and notably, the participants Took the Supplement Twice a Month, Rather Than Daily.

However, Ultimately, More Trials Are Needed To Corroborate These Findings.

Furthermore, The Aim of This Research Would Not Be To Replace Current Disease-Modifying Drugs for Ms But Rather to Provide Another Therapeutic Option for Patients who Otherwise Don't Have Access to the Drugs, for Example Because of Financial Reasons, Thouvenot Emphasized.",livescience

Or have a private conversation in public without other people hearing you?

Our newly published research introduces a way to create audible enclaves — localized pockets of sound that are isolated from their surroundings. In other words, we've developed a technology that could create sound exactly where it needs to be.

The ability to send sound that becomes audible only at a specific location could transform entertainment, communication and spatial audio experiences.

What is sound?

Sound is a vibration that travels through air as a wave. These waves are created when an object moves back and forth, compressing and decompressing air molecules.

The frequency of these vibrations is what determines pitch. Low frequencies correspond to deep sounds, like a bass drum; high frequencies correspond to sharp sounds, like a whistle.

Controlling where sound goes is difficult because of a phenomenon called diffraction — the tendency of sound waves to spread out as they travel. This effect is particularly strong for low-frequency sounds because of their longer wavelengths, making it nearly impossible to keep sound confined to a specific area.

Certain audio technologies, such as parametric array loudspeakers , can create focused sound beams aimed in a specific direction. However, these technologies will still emit sound that is audible along its entire path as it travels through space.

The science of audible enclaves

We found a new way to send sound to one specific listener: through self-bending ultrasound beams and a concept called nonlinear acoustics.

Ultrasound refers to sound waves with frequencies above the human hearing range, or above 20 kHz. These waves travel through the air like normal sound waves but are inaudible to people. Because ultrasound can penetrate through many materials and interact with objects in unique ways, it's widely used for medical imaging and many industrial applications .

In our work, we used ultrasound as a carrier for audible sound. It can transport sound through space silently — becoming audible only when desired. How did we do this?

Normally, sound waves combine linearly , meaning they just proportionally add up into a bigger wave. However, when sound waves are intense enough, they can interact nonlinearly, generating new frequencies that were not present before.

This is the key to our technique: We use two ultrasound beams at different frequencies that are completely silent on their own. But when they intersect in space , nonlinear effects cause them to generate a new sound wave at an audible frequency that would be heard only in that specific region.

Related: These noise-canceling headphones can filter specific sounds on command, thanks to deep learning

Crucially, we designed ultrasonic beams that can bend on their own. Normally, sound waves travel in straight lines unless something blocks or reflects them. However, by using acoustic metasurfaces — specialized materials that manipulate sound waves — we can shape ultrasound beams to bend as they travel. Similar to how an optical lens bends light, acoustic metasurfaces change the shape of the path of sound waves. By precisely controlling the phase of the ultrasound waves, we create curved sound paths that can navigate around obstacles and meet at a specific target location.

The key phenomenon at play is what's called difference frequency generation . When two ultrasonic beams of slightly different frequencies, such as 40 kHz and 39.5 kHz, overlap, they create a new sound wave at the difference between their frequencies — in this case 0.5 kHz, or 500 Hz, which is well within the human hearing range. Sound can be heard only where the beams cross. Outside of that intersection, the ultrasound waves remain silent.

This means you can deliver audio to a specific location or person without disturbing other people as the sound travels.

Advancing sound control

The ability to create audio enclaves has many potential applications.

Audio enclaves could enable personalized audio in public spaces. For example, museums could provide different audio guides to visitors without headphones, and libraries could allow students to study with audio lessons without disturbing others.

In a car, passengers could listen to music without distracting the driver from hearing navigation instructions. Offices and military settings could also benefit from localized speech zones for confidential conversations. Audio enclaves could also be adapted to cancel out noise in designated areas, creating quiet zones to improve focus in workplaces or reduce noise pollution in cities.

This isn't something that's going to be on the shelf in the immediate future. For instance, challenges remain for our technology. Nonlinear distortion can affect sound quality. And power efficiency is another issue — converting ultrasound to audible sound requires high-intensity fields that can be energy intensive to generate.

Despite these hurdles, audio enclaves present a fundamental shift in sound control. By redefining how sound interacts with space, we open up new possibilities for immersive, efficient and personalized audio experiences.",livescience

That explains why Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost mission, which launched Jan. 15, could sustain itself using solar panels for just over two weeks. After landing on March 2, it operated on solar power until transitioning to battery power on March 16. It finally ""went dark"" at 7:15 pm EDT that day, five hours after sending back its landmark images. In total, it operated during 346 hours of daylight on the moon, according to Firefly Aerospace .

As it went dark, Blue Ghost's mission came full circle, having begun with an image of a lunar sunrise on March 3. On March 14, the spacecraft took an iconic image of a ""blood moon"" total lunar eclipse as seen from Earth. From Blue Ghost's perspective on the moon, it saw a total solar eclipse — complete with a ""diamond ring"" effect — from a red lunar surface.

https://theconversation.com,Can Mark Carney truly connect with Canadian voters? Canada will now find out,https://theconversation.com/can-mark-carney-truly-connect-with-canadian-voters-canada-will-now-find-out-252365,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 16:38:11 GMT","After a busy two weeks as prime minister, Mark Carney has called an election for April 28.

As the first in Canadian history to be named prime minister without ever having held public office, Carney is hoping he can win the trust of Canadians. He’ll run for a seat in the Ottawa riding of Nepean.

Trustworthiness is awarded to those who are at least perceived as knowledgeable, transparent and concerned. Can Carney pull it off?

When it comes to economics, Carney is among the most knowledgeable in the country. After obtaining a PhD at the University of Oxford, Carney has had a distinguished public service career in the Canadian Department of Finance, the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England.

With such a high level of economic uncertainty today in the face of repeated threats from United States President Donald Trump, his supporters say he’s the right person to lead Canada. His chief rival, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, was first elected to the House of Commons at the age of 25 and has quite a different CV.

Is Carney empathetic?

Carney, however, might struggle more with the other characteristics of trustworthiness — seeming open and showing concern.

The Conservatives have criticized Carney for not being more transparent about his private financial interests. While Carney is following disclosure rules, the Conservatives argue Canadians need to know more about whether he’s in a conflict of interest when he makes decisions in government.

Carney’s answers to questions about his time at Brookfield Asset Management have on occasion been unsteady.

On the surface, this is about transparency, but in fact it’s just as much about empathy and whether Carney can relate to working-class voters. By alluding to Carney’s wealth and connections, the Conservatives are implying that Carney is an out-of-touch elite who doesn’t share the concerns of average Canadians.

Some of the early visuals of Carney can cut both ways.

His recent chummy embrace at the Élysée with French President Emmanuel Macron exemplifies how immediately comfortable he is with world leaders. Some will find this reassuring, given the state of geopolitics; others might find it privileged and off-putting. Even his hockey skills, which were part of a recent photo-op in Edmonton when he practised with the Oilers, were acquired partly during his time at Harvard University, an institution among the most elite in the world.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick

Empathy, instinct

Can Carney connect with people?

Arguably, he needs work on this front. He might consider some of his Liberal predecessors.

Former prime minister Justin Trudeau could certainly rally a crowd. Trudeau became a motivational speaker in the 2000s and used opportunities like the WE Charity to practise public speaking to what would become an important constituency for him — young voters — when he led the Liberals to victory in 2015.

Not everything can be taught at school. Political instinct is also crucial. It requires reconciling the knowledge of experts with the concerns of everyday citizens. There is no formula for this balance sheet.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang

Here again, Trudeau had insight. Bill Morneau, a corporate executive himself and the former federal finance minister, noted after the COVID-19 pandemic that government payouts had been too generous and driven more by Trudeau’s view of the politics of the moment than by the economic analysis provided to him by the Finance Department.

This may be so, but most would say Trudeau handled the early stages of the pandemic deftly.

Chretien’s skills

It was interesting that at the recent Liberal convention confirming Carney as leader, delegates gushed over former prime minister Jean Chretien, far from an elitist. A winner of three consecutive majorities, Chretien delivered a speech that went over at least as well with delegates as Carney’s.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick

Chretien had unparalleled political instincts. When Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney rolled out the GST in 1991, it was deeply unpopular. Despite Chretien later famously backtracking on his original opposition to the GST, the Liberal Party under his stewardship used the issue to exact maximum damage on the Progressive Conservatives, delivering them a near-fatal blow.

Chretien’s killer instincts trumped expert knowledge. While the Progressive Conservatives paid a heavy price for adopting the GST, the policy was largely advocated and shaped by business and economic elites, including in the Department of Finance. Good economics does not always make for good politics.

Emotions to run high

If the 1988 federal election that focused almost exclusively on free trade with the U.S. is any indication of what the next few weeks will look like in Canada, the election campaign is going to get heated quickly. Arguments may be more emotional than sensible.

The fact that Carney dropped the carbon tax and capital gains tax was an early sign that he’s not an economist anymore, he’s a politician.

The challenge for Carney — and for any politician in the heat of an election campaign battle — will be to find the sweet spot that reconciles expert opinion with public concerns and to articulate policies in a manner that voters will understand and support.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Trump threats: Is foreign policy the biggest issue for Canadian voters this election?,https://theconversation.com/trump-threats-is-foreign-policy-the-biggest-issue-for-canadian-voters-this-election-247065,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 16:38:51 GMT","Canadians are heading once again to the polls on April 28 to vote in a federal election.

This election will offer voters competing visions of Canada’s future at a time when it has become all but impossible to separate foreign policy from domestic politics.

There’s no question much of the conversation during the campaign will centre on how the next government will deal with United States President Donald Trump amid his continuing threats to Canadian sovereignty.

But even though the Trump administration has undermined the liberal democratic world order in which Canada has prospered for close to a century, it’s unclear whether threats of a global tariff war, an ongoing divisive conflict in the Middle East and continued Russian aggression in Ukraine will directly affect how Canadians cast their votes.

Most political scientists have traditionally argued that foreign policy does not matter to Canadians at the voting booth.

But a recent book by historian Patrice Dutil has claimed that “at least half of Canada’s national elections featured substantive discussions of Canada’s place in the world.”

So who’s right?

Foreign policy as an issue

My new report, “Foreign Policy and Canadian Elections: A Review,” finds truth on both sides.

Foreign policy is what people who study elections call an “issue,” just like the economy, national security or health care.

Issues compete with many other considerations — like ideology, perceptions of leadership and the need for change — to determine a voter’s ultimate decision.

Local candidates can affect how people vote, as can party affiliation. If you live in a riding where your preferred candidate is unlikely to win, you might vote strategically.

According to Canadian political scientist Elizabeth Gidengil, for an issue like foreign policy to really matter in an election, it must satisfy three conditions:

Political parties must position themselves on opposite sides of it;

Voters must be aware of the differences between the parties’ views;

The balance of opinion on the issue must clearly favour one side over the other.

That rarely happens in relation to Canadian foreign policy. Our political parties don’t typically differ significantly on world affairs. When they do disagree, it’s unusual for the public to overwhelmingly support one side over the other.

Handling the Trump threat

There are no real divisions between the election’s front-runners — Liberal Mark Carney and Conservative Pierre Poilievre — over how to deal with Trump.

Both have pledged that Canada will never become the 51st state and have promised to strike back at American tariffs with economic measures of their own.

Poilievre says he’ll manage Canada-U.S. relations more effectively than the Liberals would, but he has not proposed any different tactics to do so.

On the other hand, Poilievre was clearly onto something in his endless quest to make the election all about the Justin Trudeau government’s carbon tax and rebate.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Patrick Doyle

Until Carney replaced Trudeau, the differences between the Conservatives and the Liberals on carbon pricing were stark. Thanks to an extraordinary Conservative marketing campaign, the Canadian public was well aware of those differences — and a significant majority of Canadians sided with Poilievre.

Now that Carney has axed the tax himself, those differences have become much less significant.

Domestic politics aside, Trump will still loom large throughout the next five weeks.

But international and domestic issues have been, and remain, sufficiently interconnected that it’s hard to discuss one to the exclusion of the other.

Free trade with the United States was a key topic of debate during four election campaigns — 1891, 1911, 1935, 1988 — because of its impact on Canadians’ sense of independence.

Canadians were divided over conscription during the 1917 election campaign. They differed over support for Britain during the 1956 Suez crisis and throughout the election the following year.

Just as the American invasion of Iraq split the Liberals and the Canadian Alliance during the election of 2003, so did attitudes towards increased defence spending in 2000. Canadian support for Syrian refugees came up regularly during the 2015 election campaign.

Still, it’s not clear if these differences affected more than a small number of individual Canadians when they marked their ballots.

Voters tend to cast their ballots emotionally, and even though Trump is preoccupying the national consciousness at the moment, the leading political parties have not offered us specific policy alternatives to deal with him.

What’s ahead this election campaign

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick

Over the next five weeks, Canadians should expect to learn about the leading political parties’ views on relations with the U.S., the situations in the Middle East and Ukraine, foreign interference in the affairs of state and Canada’s global defence.

Voters can and should demand that those who wish to lead the country are thoughtful and literate on these and other international issues.

As then Prime Minister Stephen Harper reflected in 2011:

“Since coming to office — in fact, since becoming prime minister [in 2006] — the thing that’s probably struck me the most in terms of my previous expectations … is not just how important foreign affairs/foreign relations is, but in fact that it’s become almost everything. There’s hardly anything today of any significance that doesn’t have a huge international dimension to it.”

But expecting party views on foreign policy to shape the election’s outcome is probably unrealistic.

When we head to the voting booths, most Canadians will likely just listen to their gut.

The current iteration of Canada’s consumer carbon rebate is dead — which many view as a casualty of effective communication — yet climate policy remains a pressing topic for voters and a major battleground for political leaders.

As Canada grapples with intensifying climate-related challenges, the next government will not only need to implement evidence-based policies to meet international climate commitments, but also effectively communicate its vision to voters.

The public remains concerned about environmental issues, yet many are worried that bold climate policies have damaged the economy. This tension between environmental responsibility and economic growth will shape how each party formulates and communicates their climate policies in the upcoming campaign.

The Liberals: Navigating the middle ground

For Carney and the Liberal Party, the challenge is twofold. First, the Liberals must present a new climate plan after the collapse of the consumer carbon rebate, which has faced widespread public opposition in recent years.

While the new Liberal leader has already terminated the the carbon rebate, it still remains unclear what exactly his comprehensive climate plan will look like. Carney’s website states that his strategy will: “Provide incentives for consumers. Put more of the burden on big polluters. And help us build the strongest economy in the G7.”

This suggests his climate policy will hinge more on positive incentives for consumers to invest in sustainable approaches rather than putting a cost on polluting.

While the carbon rebate initially enjoyed broad support as a key tool for reducing emissions, it has become a lightning rod for political controversy.

Climate change is no longer just an environmental issue; it’s increasingly seen as a matter of economic survival, with green energy jobs and clean technologies representing an opportunity for Canada to position itself as a global leader in the sector.

Carney will have to make a convincing case that his policy will create jobs, stimulate innovation and provide a clear path toward a greener, more sustainable economy.

Failing to do so could lead to the loss of centrist and moderate voters, some of whom are wary of the perceived economic risks of aggressive climate action.

The Conservatives: Axing the rebate isn’t enough

On the opposite end of the political spectrum, federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has made axing the carbon rebate a central part of his platform.

Framing the carbon rebate as an economic penalty, Poilievre has played into populist sentiments by promising to “axe the tax” and relieve financial pressures on Canadian families and businesses.

However, even if the Conservatives are successful in eliminating the carbon rebate, they still face the challenge of needing a comprehensive climate policy that lowers emissions and meets Canada’s Paris Agreement targets. Poilievre has said he would not withdraw Canada from the accord, but he hasn’t addressed how he would meet Canada’s commitments.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Nathan Denette

Poilievre’s populist rhetoric may resonate with voters who feel economically squeezed, but it’s unlikely to be enough to win over voters concerned about the climate crisis — especially as he has voted against environmental and climate action in Parliament over 400 times in his career, a point his opponents will be sure to raise repeatedly.

For the Conservatives, the real challenge will be how to present a climate policy that appeals to both economic conservatives, who prioritize fiscal responsibility, and environmental conservatives, who are concerned about the future of the planet.

Poilievre will need to clearly articulate how his policies will preserve Canada’s environmental future without stifling economic growth or inflating costs for the average Canadian.

NDP and Green Party

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld

A key piece of the future of climate policy in Canada will be the NDP and Green Party, who are generally considered left-of-centre parties alongside the governing Liberals.

The NDP, which can siphon progressive votes away from the Liberals — which sometimes benefits Conservatives — have been clear as mud when it comes to their climate policy for the next election.

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh rescinded his party’s long-standing support for the Liberal carbon rebate in April 2024, but has not yet said what his party would put in its place.

Meanwhile, the Green Party, which has historically played a less significant role in electoral outcomes in terms of vote splitting, has generally maintained its support for the carbon rebate. Its website suggests the party supports the polluter-pays principle. However, the Greens have yet to take a clear stance on the shifting climate grounds on which this election could partially be fought.

Political communication the key to success

In the coming years, the future of climate policy in Canada will be less about crafting the perfect policy and more about crafting a message that addresses how people are feeling.

The Liberal Party has been open about the demise of the carbon rebate being a combination of a lack of their own effective communication strategy, mixed with harmful disinformation campaigns that led to the demise of their signature climate policy.

For the Liberals, Conservatives, NDP and Greens alike, the road to effective climate policy will lie in this communication. Political leaders will need to balance ambition and pragmatism, ensuring their policies align with Canadians’ economic interests.

With 71 per cent of Canadians suggesting they want the next government to do more to address climate change, leaders who can articulate a vision for a sustainable, prosperous future while addressing the immediate concerns of Canadians will be the ones who have the best chance of winning the public’s trust — and the next election.",theconversation

This observation triggered a fervid series of observations of the object — possibly as big as a football field — to determine that it will not hit. However, an impact on the moon cannot be ruled out.

Read more: What are the chances an asteroid will impact Earth in 2032?

Then in January of this year, the near approach of an asteroid perhaps a million times more massive went almost unnoticed.

Asteroid 2024 YR4 has a diameter between 40 to 90 metres and was referred to as a “city-killer” capable of causing regional damage and affecting the climate; the larger asteroid, 887 Alinda, is over four kilometres in diameter and could cause a global extinction event.

Alinda remains just outside Earth’s orbit, while 2024 YR4 does cross our orbit and still could impact Earth; however, this won’t occur in the foreseeable future.

Asteroid orbits

Both 887 Alinda and 2024 YR4 orbit the sun three times for every time the massive planet Jupiter goes around once. Since Jupiter’s orbit takes 12 years, the asteroids will take four years to be back on similar paths in 2028. These special kinds of asteroids are dangerous, since they come back regularly.

Alinda was discovered in 1918 and has made several sequences of near passes at four-year intervals. 2024 YR4 has made what NASA considers close passes every four years since 1948, but was only recently noticed.

Not since the 1970s has so much attention been paid to asteroids with a three-to-one relation to Jupiter. Such relationships had already been noted as a curiosity by American astronomer Daniel Kirkwood in the late 1800s. Working with very sparse data since few asteroids were known at the time, he noted none went around the sun twice for each Jupiter orbit, nor three times, nor in more complex ratios like seven-to-three or five-to-two.

These so-called Kirkwood gaps are not obvious since they show up only in plots of the average distance of asteroids from the sun. The gaps remained a mere curiosity of the solar system for about 100 years.

The employment of new computer technologies to calculate orbits revealed the effects of resonance to scientists in the 1970s. Resonance occurs when asteroids appear to move at the same, or a multiple of, the orbit speed of another external object — in this case, Jupiter.

The Kirkwood gaps are explained by asteroids similarly interacting with Jupiter to leave the asteroid belt, even while their average distance from the sun does not change. By dipping into the inner solar system, these asteroids are often removed from the gaps in a very simple way: by hitting an inner planet like Mars, Venus or Earth.

Scientists also found that these gaps were not completely empty; Alinda, for example, was in the three-to-one gap. Many more such asteroids have been found, and they are generically named “Alindas,” after the prototypical first discovery whose name origin is a bit obscure.

Return of the asteroids

If the bad news is that Kirkwood gaps are due to asteroids hitting inner planets, including Earth, can it get much worse? For Alinda-class asteroids it does. Alindas follow their pumped-up orbit every four years, so properly aligned Alindas get a chance to hit Earth about that often.

Near passes of these asteroids tend to happen spaced by longer intervals, but when aligned, they come back several times with four-year spacing. A limiting factor is how tilted their orbits are: if they are quite tilted, they are not often at a “height” matching Earth’s, so are less likely to hit.

The bad news about that is that both Alinda and 2024 YR4 are very nearly in the plane of Earth’s orbit, and are not tilted much, so are more likely to hit.

The resonant “pumping” stretching the orbit both inward and outward from the asteroid belt has already made 2024 YR4 cross Earth’s orbit, giving it a chance to impact. The much more dangerous Alinda is still being pumped: in about 1,000 years, it may be poised to hit Earth.

One piece of good news is that 2024 YR4 will miss in 2032, but by coming close it will be kicked out of its Alinda orbit. It will no longer come back every four years.

However, getting an orbital kick from Earth, its orbit will still cross ours, just not as often. The current orbit shows a somewhat close approach (farther than the moon) in 2052, and beyond that, calculations are not very accurate.

Other asteroids

Although Earth is a small target in a big solar system, it does get hit.

If 2024 YR4 managed to sneak up on us in 2024, can other asteroids also surprise us? The last damaging one to do so appeared undetected on Feb. 15, 2013, over Chelyabinsk, Russia, injuring many people when its shock wave shattered glass in buildings.

In 1908, a larger explosion took place over Tunguska, Russian Siberia, a remote region where huge areas of forest were devastated but few people injured.

Keeping watch

While astronomers work diligently to survey the night sky from Earth’s surface, space-based surveys like the upcoming Near-Earth Object (NEO) surveyor can be very efficient in detecting asteroids. They do so by their heat (infrared) radiation and, being in space, can also study the daytime sky.

According to Amy Mainzer, lead on the NEO surveyor, “we know of only roughly 40 per cent of the asteroids that are both large enough to cause severe regional damage and closely approach Earth’s orbit.” Once launched in late 2027, NEO will “find, track and characterize the most hazardous asteroids and comets,” eventually meeting the U.S. Congress-mandated goal of knowing of 90 cent of them.

Among asteroids, we must pay special attention to resonant ones, such as 2024 YR4, because eventually, they’ll be back.",theconversation

When people skip medications, it leads to more emergency room visits, costly hospital stays and worse health.

Ensuring people have coverage for essential medications is crucial. In October 2024, Canada took a step forward when Bill C-64, or the Pharmacare Act, received royal assent and became law.

The act will cover contraceptives for nine million Canadians, helping with family planning and managing conditions like endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome.

Read more: Pharmacare’s design could further fragment and politicize Canada’s health system

It will also cover diabetes medications for the 3.7 million Canadians living with the disease — critical for managing blood sugars and preventing complications like blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks and strokes.

Despite this historic passage of pharmacare legislation, its rollout remains uncertain. The government’s next steps are complicated by the Constitution Act of 1867, which gave provinces jurisdiction over health care.

The federal government must now negotiate agreements with each province to implement the plan — a task made more difficult because medication coverage varies widely across Canada. Without full co-operation, pharmacare’s impact could be limited, with coverage gaps persisting for millions of Canadians.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has also said he’ll scrap pharmacare.

Coverage differs among provinces

In many provinces — including B.C., Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Nova Scotia, P.E.I. and Newfoundland and Labrador — pharmacare coverage is provided universally with income-based deductibles. This means provincial coverage only kicks in after an individual reaches a spending threshold on medications. This threshold varies by age and income level.

Alberta and New Brunswick use premium-based systems, requiring monthly membership fees.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/ Patrick Doyle

Most provinces also use co-payments, meaning people must cover part of the cost of each prescription — for example, 20 to 30 per cent of the full cost, or a flat fee of $5 to $10. Only Québec mandates prescription insurance coverage, either privately or through its public plan.

Currently, a major driver of how much Canadians pay for their medications is arbitrary — it’s about where one lives. For example, a young Albertan living with diabetes and heart disease who earns $14,000 would need to pay $1,000 annually for medications. In Ontario, that same person would pay just $100.

Such differences can influence where people choose to live and can hinder interprovincial labour mobility. It’s a driving force behind the push for pharmacare — to ensure free access to the most important medications, regardless of where someone lives.

An opportunity for national pharmacare

Pharmacare could have been implemented nationally, like it was for the Canadian Dental Care Plan, offering federal coverage for essential medications like contraceptives and diabetes medications, while insurers and provincial plans cover the rest.

This would have been a simple approach that would have allowed for future changes, and could have been implemented by provinces much like vaccines are — paid for using people’s provincial health numbers, sidestepping the difficulty of enrolling people in a new plan.

But in the waning days of the current Liberal federal government, it appears the chosen direction has been to negotiate separate agreements with each province and territory to establish a minimum standard.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ryan Remiorz

Movement in this direction has already been seen in B.C., Manitoba and P.E.I. where deals have already been made with the federal government, while other provinces remain in talks.

The pace of these agreements remains uncertain, and it’s unclear when — or if — all the provinces and territories will sign on.

The fight for pharmacare isn’t over

As Canada takes its first steps toward pharmacare, many questions remain. For provinces with income-based deductibles, would the deductible simply shift to other drugs, meaning people with other health conditions won’t really save on their overall medication costs each year?

For those with premium-based coverage, how would those who don’t enrol in the public plan access coverage? How would this be rolled out in Québec where some form of medication coverage is already mandatory?

The push for universal drug coverage in Canada dates back decades. When medicare was first recommended in 1964 by the Hall Commission, it included a proposal for universal drug coverage that was ultimately never implemented.

Over the decades, multiple reports, including the 1999 Kirby Report and the 2019 Pharmacare For All Report, have called for its implementation.

Organizations like the Canadian Medical Association and the Canadian Nursing Association have similarly stressed its importance. Yet, despite decades of advocacy, Canada has remained the only country with a universal health-care system that doesn’t provide comprehensive drug coverage.

With negotiations on pharmacare officially underway, its success will depend on federal-provincial co-operation, which has been increasingly strained in recent years. Advancing pharmacare is in Canadians’ best interest — especially for the 7.5 million people who cannot afford the medications their doctor prescribes.

The question now is whether governments will act swiftly to implement pharmacare, or if political roadblocks will delay access to life-saving medications even further.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Could bullying be an evolutionary trait?,https://theconversation.com/could-bullying-be-an-evolutionary-trait-251237,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 13:11:00 GMT","Bullying is a serious problem that impacts hundreds of millions of young people across the world each year. Defined as the goal-directed, harmful abuse of a power imbalance, bullying can cause serious, long-term physical and mental health outcomes for victims.

As a result, countries around the world have mobilized anti-bullying efforts. Unfortunately, these efforts have had relatively little impact on bullying worldwide.

Why? One reason might be that bullying is, at least in part, an evolutionary adaptation that offers adolescent perpetrators benefits, like popularity, resources and even dates and sex.

But do these benefits extend beyond adolescence? This is what we set out to test at Brock University’s Research on Aggression and Victimization Experiences group. In particular, we wanted to know if the earlier and more frequent dating and sex that adolescent bullies experienced translated into having more children in later life.

An evolutionary trait?

There is very little data on whether bullying benefits like popularity or sex extend beyond adolescence, but early data suggested that might be the case. We sought to replicate that research using two studies.

The first was a longitudinal study of adolescents: approximately 600 Canadian boys and girls from age 14 until their mid-20s. The second was a retrospective study of more than 500 North American adults ages 18-35. We found that adolescents who bullied others reported having children earlier and having more children in total, compared to adolescents who did not engage in bullying.

While we note that a complete study should entail following adults into their mid-40s (the very end of most child births), we wanted to compile data now rather than waiting another 15-20 years for our longitudinal sample to mature. That means that while we can’t rule out that non-bullies might catch up with later reproduction, the data clearly shows that onset of reproduction is tied closely to total reproduction.

Is having children early, and more often, a good thing? Given that bullying does appear to be partly due to evolved genetics (with the environment still playing a pivotal role in its expression), reproduction is the ultimate currency of evolution. Passing on genes is, quite literally, the biological meaning of life. So this is strong evidence for the theory that bullying is, at least in part, an evolutionarily successful strategy in some contexts.

Socially, bullies are also more likely to be in the romantic relationship that is typically required to have children. We believe this is because bully’s power is related to potentially positive attributes, like attractiveness, strength and even social skills.

Our yet-to-be published data also indicates that former bullies end up investing more energy into their children than average parents. Think of the hockey or soccer parents yelling on the sidelines, bullying their child’s coach, referees or other players in order to benefit their own child. Bullying’s links with parenting go beyond purely quantitative considerations and impact both mating success and parental effort.

Why does this matter?

It matters because it helps explain why bullying is so ubiquitous and hard to prevent. Bullying appears to offer meaningful benefits to those who use it and that’s critical information if parents, teachers, schools and governments want to come up with strategies for preventing it.

What might some of those strategies look like? If bullying offers benefits, we want to reduce, replace and redirect those benefits. We can do so by getting peers to not reward bullies with the attention and popularity that they desire. We can replace benefits with costs by pointing out that while bullies gain popularity, they lose likeability. People might fear the bully’s power, but they generally don’t like them.

Finally, we can try to teach adolescents to replace bullying with more prosocial behaviour that might have equal or better outcomes with respect to peer support.

This also matters because our data shows bullying as a potentially intergenerational problem. We know that violence can be transmitted from parents to their children. It is possible that children of bullies will learn how to be bullies themselves, through directly experiencing bullying from their parents or through indirectly watching their parents bully others.

This generational transmission might very well be another reason why bullying is so hard to prevent — because it starts in the home. Given the seriousness of the consequences of bullying for its victims, we must all to take a good, hard look at why so many people continue to bully, or support bullies, so that we can understand how we to best stop this toxic and damaging pattern of behaviour.",theconversation

Ambiguous term, it often masks a relationship unbalanced in the prejudice of that which consents.

Consent is easily considered to be the foundation of any balanced social relationship and ultimate solution to regulate the evils. This hypervaluation of consent has its reasons. It should not hide its deep ambiguities. Several recent works strive to grasp its complexity and shed light on the risks it presents.

Do we really know what is granted? What is the sense of consent? How is it formed? How validly express it? What is the temporality?

A trompe-l'oeil consent

These questions take a new thickness in the contemporary context. It is an understatement to say that consent is a theme of great topicality. It is in fields with high social echo such as sexual relations, monitoring of vaccination prescriptions, compliance with the norm (which we think of the phenomenon of ""yellow vests"").

However, it is not in these contexts, which often include epidermal reactions that are hardly conducive to serene reflection, that we want to locate our words. Especially since many other areas, less publicized because of their technical dimension, such as the development of alternative disputes of disputes, or digital consent, and which however irrigate our daily lives, are particularly enlightening when we want to evoke the ambiguities of consent.

In reality, it is simply omnipresent in the feeling of increased tension between, on the one hand, the excess of consent associated with individualism (I am, so I must be able to consent), on the other hand, the degraded reality of a trompe-l'oeil consent (I freely convenient to share all my data or to buy an object impulsively (and mythified Consents, has it ever made forced weddings disappear?) ...

Consent, everywhere and nowhere. It would seem that nothing can exist without being granted. But does this trivialization of consent not sign its end?

No place for negotiations

The valuation of consent is flattering insofar as it exalts ambient individualism and claims to be rampart to abuse, to the domination of the one who wants to obtain an action from a third party. By demanding the objective and concrete expression of consent, highlighting the act to come, we would protect the person by adding a complementary step between their being and their behavior: take the time to objectify, materialize, their inclination for what comes. The reality of the implementation of consent obliges to moderate this playful vision.

Indeed, one cannot guarantee, by the only consent, the validity and the effectiveness of the protection of the interest of the person. Even less in consideration of a consent more and more often given in an emergency, or at least in instantaneity, without a process of reflection being committed or the properly discerned consent.

However, our social relationships sail between individualism and mass phenomenon, and their apprehension by law requires an increasing solicitation of consent presented as an alternative to the taxation of the norm. Rather than imposing behavior, we request the participation of the person concerned in the process, by his consent ... without giving way to negotiation, to the co -construction of what will happen, without leaving a real choice (we do not impose cookies on an online trade site, but without consent, no access to all these objects of desire).

Do we really know what we consent?

On the one hand, the use of consent, however fictional as it may be, is essential insofar as he empowers the person who will have to formalize positively, by law, his adhesion to such act, such action. It is also an insidious transfer of load to the individual: the one who consents engages his responsibility; No responsibility without consent, unless it is the opposite.

On the other hand, consent protects the freedom of the consent to a private, public or social constraint, even a ""model"" of society when in the name of certain values ​​or imperative reasons, we seek to impose a determined action. No freedom without consent, unless it is the opposite.

In fact, now invitations - injunctions? -Consent are multiplying, to the point that the domain of consent extends far beyond the traditional perimeter of the contract. But do we really know what we consent? Do we ensure the quality of consent? In light of a context of global technicalization of social relations and cognitive biases, it is imperative to question the risk of discrepancy between consenting and the meaning of what we consent.

The development of multiple forms of collection of consent, and obviously the expansion of the latter's field, opens up new paths of autonomy, but with what real freedom (s), what risks, what purpose?

Legal forms

Neuroscience sheds light on free will and its conditions. Philosophy reminds us that consenting is not wanting. Sociology reveals the social representation that is played out when consenting becomes giving in to the need (what is we ready to accept to integrate ""the group"", whatever it is?), While alert criminology: yielding is not consenting.

It is imperative to better understand consent, to better observe its legal forms, everywhere complexified, often presumed or even imposed, as in private business law.

Things are therefore less simple than it seems. Two elements will be highlighted.

First, requiring consent does not guarantee the authenticity of the expression of the will of the consenting. It is at best a ""euphemism of the will"" (M. Messu, ""The sense of consent"", in M. Cannarsa, Mr. Disant, Mr. Monot-Fouletier, F. Toulieux, Consent. Mutations and perspectives, Mare and Martin, 2024). Choosing to go in a direction without knowing where we are going, taking a risk by agreeing to partially ignore what we consent. Everyone regularly has the experience of ""accepting"" cookies, of ""consenting"" to data sharing, to access a digital service. As for the patient who suffers, does he perfectly master the choices in his health journey in the face of an expert medical profession?

There is no voluntarism in consent that we would like to see. On the contrary, there is, more and more, a form of passivity and follow-up, even a risk of artificial factory of consent (J.-PH. Pierron, the factory of consent), but which does not engage the consent. To place the individual safe from his consent is to put him in the open of his commitment. Being pronounced before the proposed social interaction occurs, he cannot know the contours very precisely: consent is not ratification, it is not always free and rarely perfectly lit, and yet it objectively marks the commitment of the one who grants it.

One of the main illusions of consent is the instantaneity in which it is expressed. It does not allow time for the desire to build and evolve. It is then all the more imperative to organize the ""advise"". It could be particularly useful on the internet, where we currently consent to the sharing of our data without time limits, without possible regret. Because, as it stands, the hypervaluation of consent amounts to preserving less the autonomous will of the consenting than maintaining in the shadow of the applicant, still considered as a third party who is not involved. What does he say precisely about his intention, his projects, what he will do with our consent?

The ""raw"" requirement of consent is therefore not as such a sufficient guarantee when you want to protect a potential victim. It is not an end, but simply a means; It is not a culmination, but a step of which one must think of vulnerability (how to collect it, can we ensure that it is free and enlightened?) And temporality (how to take into account the evolution of the context having given birth to consent?).

Second, elude consent and force a person to enter a contractual relationship can sometimes be desirable. Because consent is not just a lonely act. It can be an egalitarian, united act, conceived as involving the interests of third parties, or even a general interest.

Thus of a company in the dominant position which, in competition law, will have to contract with operators that it would not have chosen if its will could be expressed freely. Thus also forced consent, when access to a service deemed essential, reason to be, for example, for example, banking contracts for access to ""basic"" services.

It is still the general interest and the continuity of the execution of the public service which justify to assess in a differentiated manner the seriousness of the vices of consent in administrative contracts, allowing the judge to maintain a contract against the will of one of the contractors (H. Hoepffner, ""consent in administrative contracts"").

A certain objectivization of consent

Forcing consent can also be justified by the need to combat illegal discrimination: one cannot refuse to sign a contract, or refuse to maintain it, because of sex, origin, sexual orientation, place of domicile, age or family situation of the potential contracting partner.

Force consent against the contractor, how far? It is a concrete legal issue that crosses the borders, not without subtleties, illustrated by the case of an American florist who refused to sign a contract for the supply of bouquets for the marriage of a couple of the same sex (R. de Caria, ""Love All, Serve All (Coactively): the problem of the obligation for companies to contract against their will"" in Mr. Cannarsa, Mr. Toulieux, mutations in consent.

All this testifies to a form of objectivization of consent, which induces that consent is no longer what it has long seemed to be, the most obvious form of expression of individuality. It is undoubtedly time to consider his alternative to better name what he claims to designate: a simple authorization, the testimony of an acceptability in which the guarantee of loyalty, condition of confidence, must have its place.",theconversation

https://theconversation.com,Wealthy Africans often don’t pay tax: the answer lies in smarter collection - expert,https://theconversation.com/wealthy-africans-often-dont-pay-tax-the-answer-lies-in-smarter-collection-expert-252437,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 04:35:49 GMT","Faced with some of the worse debt levels in over a decade, African countries are struggling to find ways to balance their books. Increasing revenue sources from their citizens is an obvious place to look.

A good starting point for African countries would be to focus on the tax contribution of wealthy citizens. This is because the most under performing taxes across the African continent are those bearing on the income of wealthy individuals, namely personal income and property taxes.

The reasons for this are two fold: People who are better off in some countries often remain invisible to tax authorities. This is even though they have higher tax liabilities. Compare this with citizens who have formal labour contracts. Think of public school teachers or supermarket clerks. Their taxes are withheld by their employers. This makes tax evasion impossible. Most taxes on personal income in Africa are paid by citizens in these forms of employment.

In contrast, prior to 2015, only one of the top 71 Ugandan government officials and 17 of the country 60 most successful lawyers paid any personal income tax. Similarly, only 16% of all landlords identified in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, during a registration drive in 2021 had registered for taxes.

This shows that wealthy Africans face lower effective tax rates than average citizens, replicating a trend already demonstrated for the relative tax burden of small and large companies.

This situation is disheartening. But there are immediate steps that African revenue authorities can take to address this unfairness.

Research led by the International Centre for Tax and Development, to which I have contributed, shows that revenue increases from wealthy citizens can be obtained by focusing on better enforcement of existing taxes rather than by introducing new ones or hiking tax rates.

An effective approach to increase wealthy citizens tax contribution relies on three strategies:

their identification

a simplification of tax compliance processes, and

the effective enforcement of existing taxes.

While these suggestions might seem banal, they can lead to some quick revenue gains: as much as US$5.5 million in Uganda or US$900,000 in a single Nigerian state in one year, or tripling property tax revenue collection in Sierra Leone.

But these improvements require changes in the way African revenue authorities operate.

Tax collection services need change of focus

Revenue services in all African countries need to be better resourced. A typical tax officer on the continent might be responsible for as many as 10 times the number of taxpayers than a tax officer in the Global North.

First, their efforts need to be redirected away from the registration of small informal businesses. These efforts have been shown to contribute little revenue in countries as diverse as South Africa and Sierra Leone.

Instead their efforts should be directed a developing a definition of high-net-worth individual appropriate for their domestic context. In Uganda this includes criteria such as having performed land transactions of approximately US$300,000 over five years, or earning approximately US$150,000 in rental income in any given year.

Due to its federal structure, criteria in Nigeria vary across states, for example including an yearly income above Naira 2 million in Borno and Kano state, with the threshold raising to Naira 15 million in Imo state, Naira 20 million in Niger state and Naira 25 million in Lagos state.

However, in both countries criteria also cover less directly measurable assets, such as owning high-value commercial forestry or animal ranches in Uganda, or having received contracts from the government in Nigeria’s Kaduna state.

Property taxes are especially important. Research in Ethiopia and Rwanda shows that investing in real estate represents one of the main strategies to store wealth when inflation and foreign exchange fluctuation make bank deposits unattractive.

These properties then contribute to increasing the income of wealthy citizens who rent them out or resell them for profit. While we lack granular data on capital gains or rental income taxes, there are good reasons to think they are also significantly underperforming. Capital gains refers to the additional value which an investor accrues when disposing of assets such as houses or companies share previously bought at a lower price.

Second, this should be followed by the creation of an office to follow the affairs of high net-worth individuals. This already happens for large taxpayers. Most countries, including the majority of anglophone African countries, have a dedicated office following the tax affairs of large companies active in their territory.

Having dedicated resources for high net-worth individuals would be useful because using the international definition (a net worth of US$1 million) might be hard to operationalise. The reason for this is that most revenue authorities lack detailed data on assets owned by their taxpayers. Even when they know some information, such as the number of houses, estimates of their market value might be lacking.

African countries are better off relying on data already in their possession as they seek to collect further useful information on their taxpayers. This allows the establishment of a set of multiple core and non-core criteria.

Third, high-net worth individual units require substantial backing. In the first instance from revenue authorities’ senior management, who in turn needs to have the support of the government in pursuing often well-connected individuals. This backing is needed for actions as apparently easy as obtaining data from other government agencies, without which identification efforts could be quickly thwarted, and becomes crucial when its time to move to enforcement.

However, a cooperative approach should be the initial choice. One approach is voluntary disclosure programmes with associated tax amnesties. These are useful to obtain information about the assets of wealthy citizens. Additionally, they contribute substantial revenue – as much as US$296 million in South Africa and US$192 million in Nigeria.

Fourth, requiring candidates running for public office to obtain tax clearance certificates can also be an important source of information and revenue. This has been shown to work in both Uganda and Nigeria.

This set of actions represents an optimal starting point for African countries looking to improve the tax contribution of wealthy citizens.

Efforts to produce suitable guidance for wealth taxation for low-income countries by the United Nations, or to introduce a global wealth tax on billionaire by the Brazilian G20, are important to highlight the role of fiscal redistribution in addressing inequality. But many African countries are better off by first being bold about the basics of their tax systems, which can already make them more effective and progressive.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,African safaris and colonial nightmares: a visit to artist Roger Ballen’s latest show,https://theconversation.com/african-safaris-and-colonial-nightmares-a-visit-to-artist-roger-ballens-latest-show-251302,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 04:35:10 GMT","Born in the US, Roger Ballen, the internationally renowned photographer, has lived in South Africa since the 1970s.

He gained a cult following for his grotesque, surreal images of white poverty, captured on the rural fringes during apartheid. His work exposed not only the exploitation and marginalisation of his subjects but also the reality of apartheid’s failure to uplift even its privileged white minority.

Roger Ballen/Inside Out Centre For the Arts

Over time, Ballen’s practice has expanded beyond photography into a hybrid realm of exhibition, installation and performance. His new Johannesburg space, the Inside Out Centre for the Arts, serves as a theatre for this experimentation.

The name itself, Inside Out, is typically “Ballenesque”, evoking the psychological effect he seeks to instil in viewers: a blurring of perception and reality. His exhibition, End of the Game, is an arresting debut for the centre.

Ballen is committed to challenging perspectives on African narratives. Designed as a platform for thought-provoking exhibitions and educational programmes, Inside Out supports a range of artistic practices, including photography, painting, sculpture, installation, drawing and film.

On a recent visit to the centre, Ballen walks me through the exhibition. As a scholar of literature and visual cultures, I am fascinated with this epic engagement with colonial archives and the history of big game hunting in Africa since the 1700s.

Inside Out Centre for the Arts

Even though the show’s been up for over a year, there’s no rush to close it, Ballen tells me. It’s become the backdrop of many eclectic events at the centre – live tattooing, poetry performances, curatorial talks, music workshops, film screenings, panel discussions. The centre is also proving popular for school group visits.

End of the Game is a visual and psychological exploration of the African safari – an experience long entwined with adventure, exploration, and the exploitative legacies of colonialism. It delves into humanity’s deep-seated drive to control and assert dominance over nature and wildlife.

A call to action

Entering End of the Game, visitors are greeted by Tarzan posters and a room filled with photos, books and documentary material on colonial hunting. But down the stairs, the experience shifts dramatically.

Inside Out Centre For the Arts

Here, Ballen’s images merge with eerie, mechanised sculptures of taxidermied (stuffed) creatures and unsettling painted tableaus. It feels like a horror-infused natural history museum.

Ballen blurs the line between documentary and constructed imagery, creating existential psychological dramas within haunting interiors.

Through his depictions of people and animals on the fringes of existence, he invites us to confront both our own alienation from the natural world and also the devastating consequences of our destructive behaviour.

Over the years, the scenes in Ballen’s photography have become increasingly elaborate and theatrical. His props, masks, drawings and sculptures have come to feature more prominently than people. The results often look more like mixed media collages than photographs.

Some of these elements are present in End of the Game. It assembles historical artefacts, paintings, colonial and contemporary photographs, as well as carefully staged objects. The result is a critical interrogation of the ecological crisis to which we have contributed. In the context of climate change, the show stands as both a stark indictment and an urgent call to action.

Beyond photography

The impulse to compose images beyond the medium of the photograph is what leads Ballen to collect found objects. He explains the process this way:

I am always trying to find things that don’t necessarily belong together and in making them belong together in a new way … It takes the spectator’s mind on a journey in another direction, which is important in art.

Nothing is static. Everything is in constant motion. The exhibition is immersive. The viewer and the objects are circling each other. Walking through it feels like entering a jungle, the taxidermied animals look poised for confrontation.

Inside Out Centre for the Arts

For Ballen, this encounter is both physical and psychological – are animals enemies or figures of beauty? Perhaps coexistence is the question at the work’s core. As he explains it:

A central challenge in my career has been to locate the animal in the human being and the human being in the animal.

As the Tarzan posters make clear from the beginning, the idea of Africa has been hyped through Hollywood clichés. The image of it as a wild continent to be tamed and conquered, an unspoiled paradise, or a playground, has persisted. The romance of the African bush has filled the imagination of many foreign writers.

Kenyan writer Binyavanga Wainaina, in his essay How to Write About Africa, satirised this:

Always use the word ‘Africa’ or ‘Darkness’ or ‘Safari’ in your title.

Here, safari embodies the enduring thrill of conquest.

Inside Out Centre for the Arts

In the screen room, a collaged film is shown, made up of old hunting expedition clips found on YouTube. It is travel propaganda of famous hunting expeditions, led by colonialists and influential western figures.

Ballen, a US-trained geologist, was drawn to South Africa to study and work in the mineral extraction field. His deep engagement with the earth’s structure, materials and processes conceptually frames this exhibition, blending the scientific with the surreal.

The show sparks critical conversations on wildlife conservation, responsible tourism and environmental stewardship.

Inside Out

Inside Out was originally intended to be a photography centre, but during construction Ballen started imagining broader possibilities. It evolved into a multi-purpose venue that is a gallery, a theatre and an exhibition space, all in one.

Roger Ballen/Inside Out Centre for the Arts

However, the photography centre remains part of the plan. Ballen has bought the property next door, where the photography centre will now be established. Set to open in the last quarter of 2025, the centre will host photography exhibitions, talks and a bookstore, making it one of Africa’s few dedicated photography centres.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Nigeria offers free caesareans to save mothers’ lives – but it’s not enough,https://theconversation.com/nigeria-offers-free-caesareans-to-save-mothers-lives-but-its-not-enough-250082,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 04:34:18 GMT","Nigeria’s government launched an initiative in 2024 offering free emergency caesarean sections to poor and vulnerable women, in a plan to bring down the high number of mothers dying in childbirth.

Aduragbemi Banke-Thomas, a maternal and newborn health researcher, and Itohan Osayande, a teaching fellow in public health, discuss the initiative and how it can achieve its objectives.

How serious is the maternal mortality challenge in Nigeria?

Of the 287,000 pregnant women who died in 2020, almost a third were from Nigeria. At 1,047 deaths per 100,000 live births, Nigeria has the third highest maternal mortality rates globally. This is behind South Sudan and Chad.

The leading causes of maternal deaths are severe bleeding, infections, high blood pressure during pregnancy and unsafe abortions. These deaths are mostly preventable if pregnant women get emergency obstetric care, including caesarean sections.

What drives Nigeria’s maternal mortality?

There are several factors.

At an individual level, there is evidence that women delay seeking care, for various reasons. The cost of care and lack of awareness of danger signs are among them. There are also cultural norms that advise against lifesaving measures like caesarean section.

There are also issues related to Nigeria’s healthcare system. Research shows that women don’t always get the care they need when they get to a health facility. This might be because health facilities do not provide care as women cannot afford to pay. For others who cannot pay but receive care, some are unlawfully detained in the health facility until they pay. Other shortcomings include ineffective referral systems and a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals. In recent years, there has been a sharp increase in health professionals migrating to other countries.

Inability to pay means that some women do not even seek care in health facilities. They end up delaying presentation at health facilities or going to traditional birth attendants, putting them and their unborn babies at risk of complications and death.

Beyond the healthcare system, other factors include poor roads to care. Many pregnant women in Nigeria are left to travel to health facilities on their own even in an emergency. In rural areas, women face long travel distances to reach the nearest hospital.

Also, conflict displaces pregnant women and their families from their homes and disrupts access to healthcare.

Will the new initiative reduce deaths?

The initiative aims to increase health facility use and skilled birth attendance by 60%. It also aims to reduce maternal mortality by 30% within three years.

It recognises that Nigeria’s maternal mortality challenge is multi-faceted and only a multi-pronged approach can tackle it. It also recognises that though it is a national problem, solutions need to be driven at sub-national levels.

The scheme includes a suite of community-centred interventions to be implemented starting in the 17 states that contribute over half of the maternal deaths reported in Nigeria. These include:

empowering community-level leaders in Ward Development Committees to track and encourage pregnant women to use maternity services in primary health centres

advocacy by prominent people to promote safe delivery practices

partnering with traditional birth attendants to refer pregnant women to health facilities

revitalising the national emergency medical service and ambulance system

the offer of free caesarean sections for poor and vulnerable women.

The offer of free caesarean sections generated a lot of interest in the global community when it was announced.

What conditions are attached to the free caesarean scheme?

Pregnant women have to be enrolled in Nigeria’s national health insurance scheme to access free caesarean sections.

This is a double-edged sword.

Linking eligibility to health insurance registration offers the federal government and health facilities an opportunity to recoup some costs to sustain the free initiative. Nigerians who have health insurance pay a premium monthly.

However, those who are indigent and cannot afford a caesarean section are mostly not subscribed to the insurance scheme. Before the 2022 National Health Insurance Authority Act, which made health insurance mandatory for all citizens and legal residents, nationwide registration on a health insurance scheme was only 3%. Most of the subscribers work in the formal sector. However, only 19 in 100 Nigerians had health insurance in 2024.

Are there any countries with similar initiatives?

Some African countries have taken steps to improve access to lifesaving maternal healthcare interventions, including caesarean section, by removing user fees.

Examples are Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Morocco, Niger, and Senegal.

Though evidence on the impact of free caesarean section policies on reducing maternal mortality is not conclusive, there are now higher rates of caesarean section, particularly among women from lower-income, rural and less educated backgrounds.

Free delivery and caesarean section policies in Ghana and Burkina Faso led to a 45% reduction in the neonatal mortality rate and 54% reduction in infant mortality rate compared to Nigeria and Zambia where no such policies existed. This suggests that the benefits of such schemes go beyond pregnancy and childbirth.

What needs to happen to ensure the policy succeeds?

There are lessons from countries that have implemented similar schemes.

“Free” caesarean without free delivery may lead to more women being identified as needing a caesarean, since the vaginal childbirth might come at a higher cost to the pregnant woman. While a caesarean can be lifesaving, unnecessary surgeries are not advised, as it is not risk-free. Making both vaginal childbirth and caesarean “free” should be considered.

Free needs to truly mean free. Stockout of medications, blood and blood products, and consumables might force people to pay to get them.

Skilled health personnel must follow clear guidelines to assess whether a caesarean is necessary or not. Audit and feedback on the use of the procedure will help in identifying any patterns of abuse or misuse.

There’s a need to stem the tide of emigrating doctors and nurses so that those who can perform the procedure are in the facilities when pregnant women need care.

The Nigerian government will need to explore innovative financing mechanisms to sustain the policy. With the recent funding cuts and withdrawals in foreign aid from the US, help is unlikely to come from outside.

Giving verified private sector providers incentives to buy into the scheme should also be considered.

The scheme should also be extended to women on community-based health insurance schemes, which are more likely within the financial reach of poorer families.

Its implementation needs to be evidence-based and adaptable for the scheme to succeed.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,View from The Hill: 5 things to look for in the budget – and why we really need another budget soon,https://theconversation.com/view-from-the-hill-5-things-to-look-for-in-the-budget-and-why-we-really-need-another-budget-soon-252513,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 07:31:26 GMT","Jim Chalmers likes to boast, or marvel, that he is the first treasurer since Ben Chifley to deliver four budgets in a term.

If Labor wins the May election, the treasurer will reckon the budget will be done and dusted for this year. But actually, we really need another budget post election.

That’s for two reasons. First, because this one will be short on any hard reforms or big savings, because it is all about chasing votes.

From roads to health, this year has been give, give, give from the government. Much of the spending has been matched by the opposition. Just in recent days, the Coalition has said yes to the government’s initiatives to boost bulk billing and to reduce the price of pharmaceutical scripts. At the weekend, it instantly embraced the announcement to extend energy bill relief (A$150 dollars off bills in the second half of 2025).

Secondly, the budget could, to an extent, be quickly overtaken because it is being delivered days before the Trump administration’s April 2 tariff announcement. That announcement could have big implications for the world economy, which would flow through to the outlook for Australia.

The international fallout would be more serious for Australia than any direct hits we might take – there are worries around beef exports and pharmaceuticals – although the politics would centre on what happened to our industries.

Given the election context, you will have to look hard for specific “nasties” in this budget. The main negative is likely to be the overall uncertainty about the future.

So specifically, what should we look for on Tuesday? Independent economist Chris Richardson suggests, in an interview with The Conversation, five things to track.

1. The big ‘off-budget’ number

This is where the cost of initiatives does not directly show up in the underlying bottom line (which will be deficits through the forward estimates).

Putting large commitments off budget has increased over the years. Richardson says the Albanese government inherited about $33 billion off-budget spending (over the forward estimates), and in this budget it could be more than $100 billion. This includes spending on student debt relief, the NBN, some housing areas, and infrastructure programs.

Putting lots of items off budget “means less scrutiny and accountability,” Richardson says.

2. Tax reform (or lack thereof)

Richardson’s second item won’t involve much of a search. He asks rhetorically, “Will there be any hint the government is trying to do anything about the narrowing base of the tax take?” That is, anything to lighten the very heavy weight we place on personal and company taxes to raise revenue. As an advocate for tax reform, Richarson expects the budget will contain zero in this area.

3. NDIS spending

What is really happening with reining in spending on the National Disability Insurance Scheme? The government has made much of its progress towards bringing the growth in its share of spending on the scheme down to a projected 8% annually.

But Richardson says this is looking at only part of the story. Considerable responsibility is being pushed back onto the states; the federal government agreed to finance half the cost of new services to be delivered through state education and health systems for children with developmental disabilities to curb the burden on the NDIS. “To focus only on the federal spend on the NDIS is to miss the wider cost picture,” he says.

4. The mid-year mystery

How will the budget deal with the “mystery” that existed in its December mid-year update? That update did not seem to account for a rise in wages for public servants, even this was clearly in the pipeline.

5. The Trump factor

The budget will discuss the risks on the downside for the economy, but how will it deal with what is to come from Donald Trump? What assumptions will it contain on the likely actions of an unpredictable president?

With the election so close, there will be almost as much interest in Peter Dutton’s Thursday budget reply as in the budget itself.

The understanding is it will contain some new policy. It could hardly do otherwise. But will whatever Dutton announces stand up to scrutiny? If it is too thin, it will reinforce an impression the opposition is not presenting a credible alternative. In last year’s budget reply Dutton announced his proposed migration cuts and that quickly became mired in an argument about whether his numbers fitted together.

Under the spotlight in budget week, the opposition also has to be careful with precisely what is being said and committed to. We’ve seen the confusion over its divestiture policy and about a possible referendum to facilitate the removal of dual citizens.

On Sunday finance spokeswoman Jane Hume gave Labor some material for a scare campaign on the NDIS.

She told Sky, “The NDIS, for instance, is one of those areas in the budget that has run out of control; it was growing at 14% per annum.

""It’s been brought under control somewhat. We think that there’s more that can be done.”

Chalmers immediately jumped on her comments, demanding detail. Labor’s spinners and ad team would have been rubbing their hands.",theconversation
