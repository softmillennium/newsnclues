                <p>Strategy, the software company founded by Michael Saylor, has seen its stock price reach an all-time high in November due to its Bitcoin buying plan.

More than 70 companies have dived into Strategy's crypto-first business strategy at a time when Bitcoin is flying high: President-elect Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a national Bitcoin strategic reserve, and the coin hit an all-time high of $108,000 in January.

Here are 11 more publicly traded companies that are following in Strategy's footsteps and stacking Bitcoin.


Tesla has held Bitcoin for four years. The car maker first revealed it had invested $1.5 billion in the world's oldest cryptocurrency in February 2021, with plans to accept tokens as payment for its vehicles.

It backtracked on the latter plans after Elon Musk shared concern about the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, and sold some of the coins—but it still has a substantial stash with recent reports showing the firm holds 11,509 Bitcoin valued around $978 million.


Block owns more than 8,000 BTC worth at least $758 million as of writing time. The Jack Dorsey-founded company began buying Bitcoin just a few months after MicroStrategy.

Its first Bitcoin purchase came in October 2020, when it snatched up more than 4,700 BTC.


Rumble became one of the latest public companies to greenlight a Bitcoin treasury reserve strategy. Under the plan, Rumble will invest up to $20 million in the digital asset.

It is also aiming to reinvent itself as a go-to platform for the crypto community. To achieve that goal, the company has received a $775 million injection from stablecoin firm Tether.


LEEF Brands announced it would adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. The Canadian business plans to make the investment through a $5 million Bitcoin-backed debenture offering.


Semler Scientific began purchasing the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization last May, when it debuted its Bitcoin reserve treasury strategy.

Since then, the company has committed to purchasing up to 10% of its annual revenues in Bitcoin.</p></b>

                <p>There’s a new trend among AI enthusiasts, and it’s not chatbots or agents. We’re talking about "vibe coding"—a session in which a person simply talks to an AI, gives an idea of something they want to build, and starts iterating with the model, asking it to fix and improve things along the way.

It's supposedly as easy as talking to a friend, and simple enough for even laymen with extremely modest technical sophistication to do. I wrote about it here. But to get beyond the hype, I wanted to see if vibe coding could actually produce something useful.

Vibe coding a useful app?

I chose Claude 3.7 Sonnet as my AI partner after Decrypt’s tests showed it outperformed even Grok-3 for coding tasks.

My software project was pretty simple: I wanted to build a typing game in which words cascade down the screen, tasking players with typing them before they reach the bottom to survive.

We started with the most basic prompt possible: "Write a beautiful, relaxing game in which I must type out words fast to remain alive. The words are falling down and each letter has a vanishing effect as I type on them."

Within minutes, Claude pumped out what looked like a complete game... But when I tried to run it, nothing happened. The start button was dead.

I mentioned the error to Claude and it started to work assuring me it found the bug and was working to fix it.

Claude was done, and the new game was in front of our eyes. I tried it, and nope… still broken.

Rather than diving into the code ourselves (that's not vibe coding!), I just told Claude: "Nope. Nothing happens when I click the button. The game never starts."

The AI went back to work, and its second attempt actually launched.

I also cheated a bit and checked the code, noticing another issue: The game used only about 10 different words, which would get repetitive fast.

Instead of asking for a complete dictionary integration, I had Claude mix real words with made-up ones—a practical solution that kept the code simple.

I continued this back-and-forth with Claude, refining through natural language rather than code edits. Fourteen iterations later, I had something satisfactory enough for me to share without being ashamed.

When my colleagues tested the finished game, the reactions were mostly positive.

One journalist even beat my high score (which sucked), while others offered ideas for improvements.

The only "bugs" they found were actually intentional limitations: randomly generated words, but no mobile support.

You can try the game here.</p></b>

                <p>to fully understand its content.

The trend of "vibe coding" has taken the tech industry by storm, with many developers and experts weighing in on its potential benefits and drawbacks.

Andrej Karpathy's influence cannot be overstated. His initial posts describing his vibe coding workflow received thousands of likes and sparked widespread debate.

Given Karpathy's reputation in the AI community, his endorsement lent significant credibility to the approach.

Andrew Chen, general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, has been another evangelist of the trend.

Chen described vibe coding as "brilliant and enormously frustrating."

Most code will be written (generated?) by the time-rich," he said.

"Thus, most code will be written by kids/students rather than software engineers." This is the same trend as video, photos, and other social media."

Amjad Masad, CEO of Replit, has reported that "75% of Replit customers never write a single line of code" thanks to AI features—a statistic that underscores how vibe coding principles are already changing who can create software.

But not everyone is convinced. Many developers have raised serious concerns about vibe coding's potential drawbacks.

Code quality is the main criticism. Vibe coding could be a great tool for inexperienced people, but experts argue it is still not good enough to produce quality results.

Jonathan Blow, developer of acclaimed indie game Braid, weighed in on the trend in response to vibe coder Levelsio in a popular debate on X.

Getting stuff on the screen is not impressive, it's easy; it's making the game *good* that is hard," Jonathan Blow told vibe coder Pietier Levels (aka Levelsio) in a viral debate on X triggered after the latter shared a flight simulator built entirely with AI.

Security vulnerabilities represent another significant risk. AI assistants don't inherently understand security best practices that are specific to a particular application.

"AI makes shit up. Code written by AI is almost always flat-out wrong," said Reddit user Dw444 in a recent post.

Code quality is the main criticism. Vibe coding could be a great tool for inexperienced people, but experts argue it is still not good enough to produce quality results.

There's also concern about skill atrophy. If developers increasingly rely on AI for even moderate coding tasks, then their foundational skills might deteriorate over time."Ease of use is a double-edged sword," AI researcher Harry Law told Business Insider.

Debugging can also become particularly challenging when the original code wasn't human-written.

Overall, the best approach thus far appears to be AI-assisted coding.

"Suffice to say (vibe coding) is not mainstream and the first few attempts at generating useful code—in a few minutes—were completely wrong," AI developer Julian Harris wrote while describing his experience with vibe coding.</p></b>

                <p>As the crypto market gears up for another bullish cycle, smart investors are searching for the best opportunities to maximize their gains. Three crypto projects including Ripple, DTX Exchange, and PEPE have positioned themselves among the leading candidates through their unique values and prospects.

While XRP price is poised for another rally amid Ripple’s legal clarity, PEPE continues to thrive as a meme coin favorite. However, the biggest winner could be DTX Exchange, which offers a 4x potential through its exclusive “LIST2X” presale bonus.

DTX Exchange: 4x Gains With The Hybrid Trading Revolution

DTX Exchange is setting new standards in crypto trading by integrating traditional finance with blockchain technology. Unlike conventional exchanges, DTX allows users to trade crypto, stocks, ETFs, and forex on a single platform, offering seamless access to over 120,000 assets.

With 1,000x leverage, fractional trading, and enterprise-grade analytics, the exchange is shaping up to be one of the most innovative trading platforms in the space. However, the real opportunity lies in DTX’s presale phase. Investors have a unique chance to double their token holdings before the official exchange listing.

By using the LIST2X promo, early adopters can 4x their investment instead of just 2x, as the token moves from $0.18 to $0.36 at launch. This isn’t just another presale, it’s a game-changing offer that positions investors for maximum gains.

DTX Exchange’s proprietary Layer-1 VulcanX blockchain ensures ultra-fast transactions with 200,000 TPS. Additionally, security is a top priority, with it being audited by SolidProof, giving investors confidence in its long-term stability.

The official launch of DTX tokens will create immense market demand, transforming this presale into a top investment choice across the crypto market.

XRP Price Prediction: Can Ripple Skyrocket

XRP price movements have historically been volatile, but 2025 could mark a turning point. Ripple’s payment solutions continue to attract financial institutions into partnerships so the platform emerges as an attractive investment opportunity.

Despite SEC-related legal challenges Ripple has demonstrated strength and victory in such cases could drive the XRP price upward. Historically, XRP price has experienced rapid surges, with one of the most notable being in 2018.

The combination of rising institutional adoption and supportive market factors might drive Ripple toward $3 along with possibly surpassing this benchmark. Right now, the XRP price is hovering around $2.5, with a 14% increase in the last week.

While XRP price may see moderate growth if regulatory clarity improves, its potential pales in comparison to DTX, which is set for an immediate 2x listing increase and a fully decentralized trading model.

PEPE: A Meme Coin With Volatility Risks

PEPE, one of the leading meme coins, has shown strong exchange outflows in recent weeks, suggesting that investors are holding rather than selling. Technical indicators like the inverse head and shoulders pattern also signal potential gains.

However, PEPE growth remains highly speculative, relying purely on hype and market sentiment rather than fundamental value. While some traders may profit from short-term rallies, PEPE’s lack of utility and real-world adoption makes DTX a far better option.

Current technical indicator readings of MACD and RSI show bullish trends which forecast an upward movement in prices throughout the upcoming weeks. If PEPE can break past key resistance at $0.000008915, the next price target could be $0.00001457, marking a significant rally from its current level.

However, currently, PEPE is trading at $0.000007255.

While PEPE may see short-term gains, DTX’s structured growth model, real-world adoption, and guaranteed listing increase make it a far superior investment.

Ripple has strong utility, but its growth is slow and uncertain due to ongoing regulatory concerns. PEPE has meme coin hype but lacks long-term fundamentals and real-world adoption. However, the biggest potential lies in DTX Exchange, where the 2x listing increase is the focal point for investors looking to 4x their holdings before launch.

As the presale nears its end, investors have a final chance to secure tokens before the exchange listing at a higher price. With a secure, fully-audited trading platform and a massive market potential, DTX is shaping up to be one of the biggest winners in 2025.</p></b>

                <p>Let’s not sugarcoat it—if you missed the last bull run, you missed a generational wealth shift.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) turned early buyers into millionaires. Pepe Coin (PEPE) hit a $1.6 billion market cap practically overnight. That wasn’t luck, it was about being early.

Now we’re heading into the next exciting cycle, and the question isn’t if there will be another breakout—it’s which coin will lead the charge. BlockchainFX is setting up to be the next big play.

SHIB exploded onto the scene in 2020, following in the pawprints created by Dogecoin (DOGE). What started as an homage turned into a multi-billion-dollar ecosystem. SHIB is still a massive player in the broader crypto market, but it’s facing some structural problems:

High token supply = limited price movement.

Reliant on community hype rather than fundamentals.

Competing with other meme coins like FLOKI and PEPE.

SHIB remains one of the top 20 held and traded tokens. ShibaSwap and staking mechanisms keep community engagement high. If meme coins surge again, SHIB will likely lead the pack.

But here’s the problem: SHIB’s upside is capped by its supply and reliance on meme culture. Hype fades—but utility lasts.

PEPE was supposed to be a temporary flash in the pan. It wasn’t. After hitting a $1.6 billion market cap in 2023, it somehow survived the inevitable fall off that followed. Why? The community. PEPE’s meme status keeps it alive—and that’s hard to replicate.

But PEPE has limits:

No staking or revenue model—purely community-driven.

Hype-based price swings = unpredictable returns.

No real ecosystem development.

The meme coin market thrives on community strength. If the meme coin cycle returns, PEPE is positioned to lead. Massive liquidity = quick price moves during bullish runs.

PEPE is still alive because people want it to be alive. That’s powerful—but is it sustainable? Probably not.

BlockchainFX (BFX) – Utility + Passive Income = Next Big Play

This is where BlockchainFX changes the game. SHIB and PEPE thrive on hype. BlockchainFX is building a business model that rewards traders.

It’s the first trading super app where users can trade crypto, stocks, forex, ETFs, commodities, and bonds—all in one place. But the kicker? 70% of trading fees are redistributed to $BFX holders as staking rewards in $BFX and USDT.

Why BlockchainFX Could 1000x:

500+ tradable assets: Not just crypto—traditional finance too.

Instant multi-asset swaps: Trade Bitcoin for Gold or Solana for Tesla stock in seconds.

No staking fees: What you earn stays in your wallet.

Community governance: $BFX holders vote on platform decisions.

More trades = higher fees = bigger staking rewards. That’s just simple mathematics.

Which One Has the Most Upside?

Let’s break it down:

SHIB: Community strength will keep it alive, but the supply cap limits the upside.

PEPE: Meme power and community backing give it potential, but no utility = high risk.

BlockchainFX: Utility + staking rewards + passive income = scalable, sustainable upside.

PEPE and SHIB rely on momentum. BlockchainFX relies on actual business fundamentals.

An example of a blockchain is Bitcoin—a decentralized ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions in blocks, secured by cryptography and validated by network participants (miners).

BlockchainFX leverages blockchain technology to execute trades instantly and redistribute trading fees to $BFX holders—creating a system where token holders earn from platform activity.</p></b>

                <p>Solana has faced notable obstacles in recent months, with its network activity plunging by nearly 50% since the beginning of 2025.

The number of active addresses has dropped from 5.69 million to 2.76 million, indicating waning user engagement.

Additionally, a major outage in February resulted in a five-hour service disruption, raising concerns about Solana's long-term stability and scalability.


Despite these setbacks, Solana remains a major player in the crypto space, having processed over 400 billion transactions and exceeded $1 trillion in total trading volume.


However, investors searching for more stable and scalable alternatives are diversifying their portfolios, with Mutuum Finance emerging as a promising alternative in the DeFi sector.

Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that enables users to earn passive income by supplying assets or accessing liquidity through overcollateralized loans.

Unlike purely speculative assets, MUTM operates within a structured DeFi ecosystem, ensuring sustained demand and long-term value retention.


Mutuum Finance offers two distinct lending models, catering to different investor preferences:

Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Users can deposit assets such as ETH, USDT, and DAI into liquidity pools, earning variable APY based on borrowing demand.

For borrowers, Mutuum Finance provides access to liquidity while allowing them to retain asset ownership.

A user depositing $20,000 worth of ETH with a 65% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio can borrow up to $13,000 in USDT.


Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a key DeFi player, making MUTM an attractive investment for both short-term and long-term gains.

The team is working on launching an overcollateralized stablecoin, which will expand borrowing options and further solidify MUTM's utility within the DeFi space.</p></b>
