<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/302711/next-crypto-etfs-dogecoin-xrp-solana-trump'>Which Crypto ETFs Are Next? Dogecoin, XRP, and Solana Lead the List</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-23 16:46:18 <p>
The cryptocurrency industry notched two major victories last year when several fund issuers secured long-awaited approvals to offer spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and their Ethereum-based counterparts in the U.S. But that doesn't mean issuers are ready to rest on their laurels just yet. In recent months, fund managers have proposed new investment offerings directly tracking the prices of a variety of cryptocurrencies, from Dogecoin to XRP, Solana, and even Donald Trump’s meme coin. Spot Solana exchange-traded funds are one potential alternative to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs that could begin trading in the U.S. this year or next. In March, CBOE filed on behalf of Franklin Templeton for a rule change to list the proposed fund. However, both spot and futures Solana ETFs will likely not begin trading in the U.S. until 2026, according to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffert. That’s because the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission still has to assess a batch of spot Solana ETF applications. The SEC typically takes between 240 and 260 days to make decisions on applications. Nevertheless, if and when spot Solana ETFs are approved, the investor dollars they attract could be massive. Meanwhile, Bitwise Asset Management has registered a Dogecoin ETF entity in Delaware, a major step towards applying for permission to launch an exchange-traded fund based on Elon Musk's beloved cryptocurrency. Finally, crypto-focused investment firm Grayscale has also signaled its intention to launch a Dogecoin ETF. Shortly thereafter, Grayscale filed a 19b-4 form to convert that Trust into an ETF, joining several of its competitors in planning to roll out such a fund. The SEC acknowledged Grayscale's filing in February, but then in March delayed its decision, giving the agency until May 21 to make a call either way. Analysts are bullish that it won't take long for Dogecoin ETFs to hit the market, however. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in January that a spot Dogecoin ETF could theoretically launch as early as April, thanks to a rule that enables federal regulators to weigh in on investment offering proposals within an expedited 75-day timeframe, rather than the typical review period of eight to nine months. In early February, Chicago's Cboe Exchange applied with federal regulators to list and trade four spot XRP ETFs — a sign of growing investor interest in funds tracking Ripple Lab's crypto asset. The spot XRP ETFs would be issued by WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary Capital, respectively. However, it remains unclear whether the ETFs will be approved or not. If XRP ETFs are approved, then the funds could collectively bring in between $3 and $6 billion in investments, according to a January estimate from J.P. Morgan analysts. It remains unclear which assets the Bitcoin Plus ETFs would hold, if approved. Truth.Fi did not respond to Decrypt's request for comment and clarification. Crypto asset manager Bitwise submitted an S-1 filing with the Securities Commission in early March, signaling its plans to launch an exchange-traded fund tracking the price of Aptos (APT). Rex Shares and Osprey Funds teamed up in early March to file for approval to offer an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks MOVE, the native token of the Movement Network. Canary Capital filed for the first HBAR ETF last November. In an X post in December, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas expressed optimism about a spot HBAR ETF’s odds of receiving approval in the U.S., saying that such a fund could launch before its higher-profile Solana and XRP-based counterparts. Despite that, it remains unclear whether there is sufficient investor demand for such a fund, he said. The new filings came roughly two months after Canary Capital filed for its own Litecoin ETF, and days after Canary submitted an amendment to its application for the fund. Litecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency created to improve verification time for blockchain transactions. Much like its spot HBAR ETF counterpart, Canary Capital's Litecoin ETF is likely to get approved before Dogecoin, XRP, and Solana-based funds, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. That's because Litecoin's regulatory status is less disputed than that of other altcoins such as Solana, which remain at the center of a legal battle between the SEC and major crypto industry players, according to Balchunas. The regulator has recognized both submissions as of publication time. Investment firm Canary Capital filed in mid-March for a PENGU and Pudgy Penguins ETF. Pudgy Penguins is the fourth-largest NFT project based on market cap, according to CoinGecko data. Rex Shares filed with federal regulators in January to launch spot Trump and BONK-based ETFs, respectively. The proposed funds form part of a growing list of meme coin-based investment products spun up by issuers, who are apparently eager to capitalize on investors’ growing interest in the digital assets market amid the latest crypto bull run. Bloomberg analysts predict that TRUMP, BONK, and other meme coin-based ETFs could begin trading as soon as April—that is, if issuers’ proposals undergo and pass an expedited review process with federal regulators.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/300470/beyond-microstrategy-publicly-traded-companies-buying-bitcoin'>Beyond Strategy: 11 More Publicly Traded Companies That Are Stockpiling Bitcoin</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-23 14:57:00 <p>
Strategy's Bitcoin buying plan—once maligned by big businesses—has produced blockbuster profits for the software company amid the latest Bitcoin boom, pushing its stock price to an all-time high in November as its stash tops $42 billion worth of the coin as of this writing. And its success has inspired a crop of copycats, though Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor probably doesn’t mind—he’s been advocating for such a movement for years now. In recent months, several more publicly traded firms have greenlit corporate strategies to stack Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, while others that have already invested in the cryptocurrency are building up their holdings of the asset. More than 70 companies have dived headfirst into Strategy's crypto-first business strategy at a time when Bitcoin is flying high: President-elect Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a national Bitcoin strategic reserve, and the coin hit an all-time high of $108,000 in January. Tesla, the electric car-making company led by Dogecoin aficionado Elon Musk, has held Bitcoin for four years. Financial services conglomerate Block—the firm behind the Square payments platform—owns more than 8,000 BTC worth at least $758 million as of writing time, according to one estimate. The Jack Dorsey-founded company began buying Bitcoin just a few months after MicroStrategy. Its first Bitcoin purchase came in October 2020, when it snatched up more than 4,700 BTC. In November, video streaming platform Rumble became one of the latest public companies to greenlight a Bitcoin treasury reserve strategy. It is also aiming to reinvent itself as a go-to platform for the crypto community. To achieve that goal, the company has received a $775 million injection from stablecoin firm Tether. Cannabis company LEEF Brands announced in December it would adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Medical technology company Semler Scientific began purchasing the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization last May, when it debuted its Bitcoin reserve treasury strategy. “We plan to continue to purchase bitcoin with cash from operations and with cash proceeds from our sales under our ATM program., Semler Scientific CEO Eric Semler said in November. “We are exploring additional financing opportunities that will enable us to acquire even more bitcoin.” Semler Scientific Acquires 871 #bitcoins for $88.5 million and has generated BTC Yield of 152% since July 1, 2024. Adding Bitcoin to Banzai's balance sheet will diversify the assets in its treasury, in addition to enabling the company to profit off of the cryptocurrency's long-term value growth, Banzai CEO Joe Davy said last year in a statement. “Fold’s Bitcoin treasury serves a dual purpose: providing value to investors seeking Bitcoin exposure, while acting as a corporate strategic reserve to support our growing suite of Bitcoin-native financial products,” said company CEO Will Reeves after its most recent purchase. “Our business has been growing rapidly, with revenues up and margins steadily improving. We believe our strategic treasury plan is a low-risk approach to hedge inflation and potentially benefit from increasing regulatory clarity around cryptocurrencies,” said CEO Steven Rossi. Rossi added that the firm is taking a long-term approach to both BTC and XRP. Real estate technologies company Fathom Holdings announced a plan in January to use upwards of 50% of its excess cash to create a Bitcoin treasury. Nevertheless, company CFO Joanne Zach spoke positively about the company’s Bitcoin strategy, telling investors that it diversifies Fathom’s treasury holdings and “positions Fathom at the forefront of digital currency transactions in real estate today.” “BTC acceptance will promote more payment options for customers and suppliers with potentially less transactional friction inherent to digital currencies,” said company CEO and founder Gregory Poilasne.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/311183/we-built-game-vibe-coding-ai-claude'>Does Vibe Coding Really Work? We Built a Game With Claude—Here's How It Turned Out</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-23 12:54:31 <p>
We’re talking about "vibe coding"—a session in which a person simply talks to an AI, gives an idea of something they want to build, and starts iterating with the model, asking it to fix and improve things along the way. It's supposedly as easy as talking to a friend, and simple enough for even laymen with extremely modest technical sophistication to do. I chose Claude 3.7 Sonnet as my AI partner after Decrypt’s tests showed it outperformed even Grok-3 for coding tasks. My software project was pretty simple: I wanted to build a typing game in which words cascade down the screen, tasking players with typing them before they reach the bottom to survive. We started with the most basic prompt possible: "Write a beautiful, relaxing game in which I must type out words fast to remain alive. The words are falling down and each letter has a vanishing effect as I type on them." Within minutes, Claude pumped out what looked like a complete game... But when I tried to run it, nothing happened. Rather than diving into the code ourselves (that's not vibe coding! The AI went back to work, and its second attempt actually launched. I also cheated a bit and checked the code, noticing another issue: The game used only about 10 different words, which would get repetitive fast. Instead of asking for a complete dictionary integration, I had Claude mix real words with made-up ones—a practical solution that kept the code simple. I continued this back-and-forth with Claude, refining through natural language rather than code edits. Fourteen iterations later, I had something satisfactory enough for me to share without being ashamed. One journalist even beat my high score (which sucked), while others offered ideas for improvements. The only "bugs" they found were actually intentional limitations: randomly generated words, but no mobile support. As of now, Ryan Gladwin holds the record with 2,830 points, but hopefully I’ll claim my throne back anytime soon. After all this and other experiments, here are some things that can be useful for those willing to give vibe coding a try: Rapid prototyping works: We went from concept to playable game quickly, with minimal technical input. This is great for novices with minimal coding abilities. Iteration is key: The first attempt rarely works perfectly. In this stage, experienced coders could probably leave vibe coding behind and stick to normal debugging, using AI as it should be—a digital assistant that helps them with the process. Don't rush it: Knowing when to simplify requirements helps achieve a working product faster. Instead, think about the experience as adding different layers to a rough structure. Quality has limits: While we created a functional and enjoyable game, it lacked the polish and optimization of professionally developed software. Debugging is conversational: Rather than searching for problems in the code, we simply described what wasn't working and let the AI figure out how to fix it. Overall, vibe coding can indeed produce functional software if you're patient enough to guide the AI through multiple iterations. You'll still need proper debugging, optimization, and various specialized tools to build truly professional applications. But then again, the guy who built Flappy Bird made millions with a simple game that didn't need fancy architecture or complex systems.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/311144/vibe-coding-using-ai-create-apps-games'>Vibe Coding: How Devs and Laymen Alike Are Using AI to Create Apps and Games</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-23 12:51:04 <p>
He called this “vibe coding”—and all the AI guys loved it. There's a new kind of coding I call "vibe coding", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It's possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. The term immediately found product-market fit, and in just a few weeks, Merriam-Webster Dictionary had added "vibe coding" to its database, defining it as "writing computer code in a somewhat careless fashion, with AI assistance." Some think this is the future of technology, when anyone can bring into reality any idea using natural language, and giving machines the responsibility to code. Of course, critics see this trend as a recipe for disaster. “Vibe coding is like buying a kit to build a race car, paying your drunk uncle who ‘knows a thing or two about racing’ to build the kit for you, then telling all your friends that you built it,” said one Reddit user. At its core, vibe coding involves telling an AI what you want to build in plain language, then letting it generate the actual code. Rather than wrestling with syntax or poring over documentation, developers can simply say, "Create a login form with email validation and password requirements," and watch as the AI handles the implementation details. The vibe coding approach flips traditional software development on its head. People can't stop creating games with Grok, Windsurf, Cursor & Claude 3.7 Sonnet. This approach—where the AI is trusted to write working code without the developer fully understanding every line—is what distinguishes true vibe coding from simply using AI as a sophisticated assistant. Beyond the technical aspects, vibe coding has spawned its own distinct culture and aesthetic. On TikTok and YouTube, videos of vibe coding often feature developers in moody lighting with RGB keyboards, ambient music playing softly in the background as they chat with their AI assistant. This fusion of coding with a chill, creative atmosphere has made programming appear more approachable and emotionally engaging. Riley Brown, a social media influencer who calls himself a "Sr. Vibe Coder" on LinkedIn and is now fully dedicated to spreading awareness on this trend, has amassed over a million followers across platforms by posting videos where he builds functioning apps through voice commands alone. It's a stark departure from the buttoned-up, precision-focused culture traditionally associated with software development. Several high-profile tech figures have championed vibe coding, propelling it from niche concept to mainstream discussion in a matter of months. Andrew Chen, general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, has been another evangelist of the trend. "Thus, most code will be written by kids/students rather than software engineers. This is the same trend as video, photos, and other social media." random thoughts/predictions on where vibe coding might go: - most code will be written (generated?) Thus, most code will be written by kids/students rather than software engineers. This is the same trend as video, photos, and other social media - we are in the… — andrew chen (@andrewchen) March 9, 2025 Many developers have raised serious concerns about vibe coding's potential drawbacks. Vibe coding could be a great tool for inexperienced people, but experts argue it is still not good enough to produce quality results. Jonathan Blow, developer of acclaimed indie game Braid, weighed in on the trend in response to vibe coder Levelsio in a popular debate on X, which was triggered after the latter shared a flight simulator built entirely during a vibe coding session. “I'll put it this way: If you have never tried to make a game, I am sure it is fun to have a game-making experience. For those who have made games, even just simple ones, getting stuff on the screen is not impressive, it's easy; it's making the game good that is hard,” Jonathan Blow, developer of acclaimed indie game Braid, told vibe coder Pietier Levels (aka Levelsio) in a viral debate on X triggered after the latter shared a flight simulator built entirely with AI. I'll put it this way: If you have never tried to make a game, I am sure it is fun to have a game-making experience. For those who have made games, even just simple ones, getting stuff on the screen is not impressive, it's easy; it's making the game *good* that is hard. AI assistants don't inherently understand security best practices that are specific to a particular application. Blindly accepting AI-generated code could introduce security holes that might remain undetected until exploited. Code written by AI is almost always flat-out wrong," said Reddit user Dw444 in a recent post. "My employer pays for AI assistants we can use for work, and even the most advanced models are prone to start writing blatantly incorrect code at the drop of a dime. You really don’t want to use AI code in [production]." If developers increasingly rely on AI for even moderate coding tasks, then their foundational skills might deteriorate over time. "Ease of use is a double-edged sword," AI researcher Harry Law told Business Insider. "Beginners can make fast progress, but it might prevent them from learning about system architecture or performance." Debugging can also become particularly challenging when the original code wasn't human-written. As Andrew Chen noted, while getting the first 75% of a project done with AI might be trivial, refining and fixing it afterward can become extremely difficult. Overall, the best approach thus far appears to be AI-assisted coding. “Suffice to say (vibe coding) is not mainstream and the first few attempts at generating useful code—in a few minutes—were completely wrong,” AI developer Julian Harris wrote while describing his experience with vibe coding. But he concluded, "I found careful prompting with solid software engineering disciplines worked very well.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

While XRP price is poised for another rally amid Ripple’s legal clarity, PEPE continues to thrive as a meme coin favorite. However, the biggest winner could be DTX Exchange, which offers a 4x potential through its exclusive “LIST2X” presale bonus. DTX Exchange is setting new standards in crypto trading by integrating traditional finance with blockchain technology. Investors have a unique chance to double their token holdings before the official exchange listing. This isn’t just another presale, it’s a game-changing offer that positions investors for maximum gains. Additionally, security is a top priority, with it being audited by SolidProof, giving investors confidence in its long-term stability. Ripple’s payment solutions continue to attract financial institutions into partnerships so the platform emerges as an attractive investment opportunity. Despite SEC-related legal challenges Ripple has demonstrated strength and victory in such cases could drive the XRP price upward. Historically, XRP price has experienced rapid surges, with one of the most notable being in 2018. The combination of rising institutional adoption and supportive market factors might drive Ripple toward $3 along with possibly surpassing this benchmark. While XRP price may see moderate growth if regulatory clarity improves, its potential pales in comparison to DTX, which is set for an immediate 2x listing increase and a fully decentralized trading model. PEPE, one of the leading meme coins, has shown strong exchange outflows in recent weeks, suggesting that investors are holding rather than selling. However, PEPE growth remains highly speculative, relying purely on hype and market sentiment rather than fundamental value. While some traders may profit from short-term rallies, PEPE’s lack of utility and real-world adoption makes DTX a far better option. Current technical indicator readings of MACD and RSI show bullish trends which forecast an upward movement in prices throughout the upcoming weeks. If PEPE can break past key resistance at $0.000008915, the next price target could be $0.00001457, marking a significant rally from its current level. While PEPE may see short-term gains, DTX’s structured growth model, real-world adoption, and guaranteed listing increase make it a far superior investment. Ripple has strong utility, but its growth is slow and uncertain due to ongoing regulatory concerns.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Shiba Inu (SHIB) turned early buyers into millionaires. That wasn’t luck, it was about being early. BlockchainFX is setting up to be the next big play. BlockchainFX is building momentum through actual utility. Shiba Inu (SHIB) – The Billionaire Meme Coin What started as an homage turned into a multi-billion-dollar ecosystem. SHIB is still a massive player in the broader crypto market, but it’s facing some structural problems: Reliant on community hype rather than fundamentals. Competing with other meme coins like FLOKI and PEPE. SHIB remains one of the top 20 held and traded tokens. ShibaSwap and staking mechanisms keep community engagement high. If meme coins surge again, SHIB will likely lead the pack. But here’s the problem: SHIB’s upside is capped by its supply and reliance on meme culture. PEPE was supposed to be a temporary flash in the pan. After hitting a $1.6 billion market cap in 2023, it somehow survived the inevitable fall off that followed. The meme coin market thrives on community strength. If the meme coin cycle returns, PEPE is positioned to lead. Massive liquidity = quick price moves during bullish runs. BlockchainFX (BFX) – Utility + Passive Income = Next Big Play This is where BlockchainFX changes the game. BlockchainFX is building a business model that rewards traders. It’s the first trading super app where users can trade crypto, stocks, forex, ETFs, commodities, and bonds—all in one place. No staking fees: What you earn stays in your wallet. Community governance: $BFX holders vote on platform decisions. More trades = higher fees = bigger staking rewards. PEPE: Meme power and community backing give it potential, but no utility = high risk. BlockchainFX: Utility + staking rewards + passive income = scalable, sustainable upside. What Is an Example of a Blockchain? An example of a blockchain is Bitcoin—a decentralized ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions in blocks, secured by cryptography and validated by network participants (miners). BlockchainFX leverages blockchain technology to execute trades instantly and redistribute trading fees to $BFX holders—creating a system where token holders earn from platform activity. SHIB will spike if meme coins rally. PEPE could pop if the community holds strong. BlockchainFX will generate consistent returns through staking and platform growth. Early-stage buyers aren’t betting on hype, they’re betting on a system designed to pay them back.

Solana (SOL), once considered a top Ethereum rival, has recently encountered setbacks, including declining network activity and technical disruptions. Solana has faced notable obstacles in recent months, with its network activity plunging by nearly 50% since the beginning of 2025. However, investors searching for more stable and scalable alternatives are diversifying their portfolios, with Mutuum Finance emerging as a promising alternative in the DeFi sector. Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that enables users to earn passive income by supplying assets or accessing liquidity through overcollateralized loans. Unlike purely speculative assets, MUTM operates within a structured DeFi ecosystem, ensuring sustained demand and long-term value retention. Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Users can deposit assets such as ETH, USDT, and DAI into liquidity pools, earning variable APY based on borrowing demand . Peer-to-Peer (P2P): This model allows users to negotiate custom loan terms , making it ideal for volatile assets like SHIB or PEPE , which are typically excluded from conventional DeFi lending platforms. Lenders can set personalized interest rates , giving them greater control over their returns. For example, a user depositing $20,000 worth of ETH with a 65% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio can borrow up to $13,000 in USDT, enabling them to reinvest, trade, or cover expenses without selling their holdings. By integrating flexible lending models with a self-sustaining token demand mechanism, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a key DeFi player, making MUTM an attractive investment for both short-term and long-term gains. Mutuum Finance’s ongoing presale has been a massive success, raising over $4.25 million, with 55% of Phase 3 already sold out. Unlike many new projects that launch without a functional product, Mutuum Finance is set to introduce its beta lending platform alongside its official token debut, ensuring immediate real-world use and demand. With upcoming exchange listings on the horizon, Mutuum Finance is set to gain significant visibility and liquidity, attracting an even larger investor base. For those looking to enter before broader market adoption drives prices higher, the current presale phase presents a strategic investment opportunity.
