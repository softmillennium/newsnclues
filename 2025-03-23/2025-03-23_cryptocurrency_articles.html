The US-based Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) have been on a negative streak of capital outflows in the past few weeks, reflecting dwindling appetite and worsening sentiment amongst investors. However, the latest daily performances of these crypto-based financial products suggest that fresh demand might be growing among investors.

According to the latest market data, the Bitcoin ETFs in the United States continued their hot streak of capital influx, registering a daily total net inflow of $83.09 million on Friday, March 21. This fresh capital inflow marked the sixth consecutive day of net daily inflows for the crypto products.

On Friday, only two of the Bitcoin ETFs witnessed any form of investor activity. BlackRock saw the highest amount of value ($104.99 million) added to its exchange-traded fund iShares Bitcoin Trust (with the ticker IBIT); while Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) posted a daily net outflow of $21.9 million to close the week.

Nevertheless, this $83.09 million performance brought the Bitcoin ETFs' weekly record to a staggering $744.35 million weekly total net inflow. Interestingly, this previous week's record put an end to five consecutive weeks of total net outflows from the exchange-traded funds.



Data from SoSoValue shows that the US Bitcoin ETF market witnessed a total withdrawal of $5.39 billion over those five weeks of negative outflows. Specifically, the crypto-based financial products witnessed a daily total net outflow of over $1.14 billion on February 25.

The magnitude of outflows witnessed by the Bitcoin ETFs has been associated with the uncertain climate of the US financial markets. Since the United States President Donald Trump resumed office, the markets have been plagued with fears of a global trade war, interest rate decisions, and so on.

Since their launch, there has been a discussion around the impact of US Bitcoin ETFs' performance on the price of the flagship cryptocurrency. As seen in the recent consecutive weeks of net outflows, the Bitcoin price tends to struggle whenever ETF investors are leaving the market.

However, the premier cryptocurrency seems stuck in a consolidation range despite the fresh demand for the US Bitcoin ETFs. However, a sustained demand for its exchange-traded funds might be the positive catalyst for the Bitcoin price to resume its upward trend.

As of this writing, the price of BTC is hovering around the $84,000 mark, reflecting no significant change in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the market leader has barely recorded any notable movements in the past week.

 Ether price is positioned to rally toward $3,400 by June as it retests a key support zone that previously triggered 2,000% and 360% bull runs. 

Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), has lost half of its value in the past three months, crashing from $4,100 in December 2024 to as low as around $1,750 in March 2025. Nevertheless, it is now well-positioned for a sharp price rebound.

From a technical standpoint, Ether's price is eyeing a potential breakout as it retests a long-term support zone. Historically, bounces from this multi-year support have led to explosive rallies — most notably gains of over 2,000% and 360% during past cycles.

As of March 23, the ETH/USD pair was hovering near $2,000, close to the given support area. A bounce from this zone can lead the price toward $3400 by June—up 65% from current prices. 

This level coincides with the lower boundary of Ether's prevailing descending channel resistance.

Conversely, a decline below the support zone could push the ETH price toward the 200-2W exponential moving average (200-2W EMA; the blue wave in the first chart) at around $1,560.

Ether's bullish outlook appears as institutional confidence in Ethereum grows stronger. 

BlackRock's BUIDL fund now holds approximately a record $1.145 billion worth of Ether, up from around $990 million a week ago, according to data from Token Terminal.

The fund primarily focuses on tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), with Ethereum remaining the dominant base layer. While the fund diversifies across chains like Avalanche, Polygon, Aptos, Arbitrum, and Optimism, Ethereum remains its core allocation.

BlackRock's latest addition of ETH signals rising institutional confidence in Ethereum's role as the leading platform for real-world asset tokenization.

Ethereum's bullish case also coincides with a sharp uptick in whale accumulation. 

The latest onchain data from Nansen shows that since March 12, 2024, addresses holding 1,000–10,000 ETH have grown their holdings by 5.65%, while the 10,000–100,000 ETH cohort has risen by 28.73%.

Though addresses holding more than 100,000 ETH remain relatively stable, this accumulation trend underscores rising conviction among large investors.

Binance CEO Richard Teng says the Trump administration has been a "fantastic" reset for the cryptocurrency industry.

"It's an extremely different environment that we're operating in," Teng told CNBC on Tuesday.

In the span of 16 months, Binance has gone from a political outcast to a possible power broker in Washington. Once the poster child for regulatory defiance – Binance was slapped with a record $4.3 billion settlement with regulators and forced to oust billionaire founder Changpeng "CZ" Zhao – the crypto exchange is now navigating a dramatically friendlier political landscape under President Donald Trump's second administration, Teng said.

"We've benefited from this shift," said Teng, who was appointed Binance's CEO in November 2023. 

Teng's comments come as the crypto exchange is in talks to have the Trump family take a financial stake in the company, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal earlier this month. That same day, Bloomberg reported that World Liberty Financial, a Trump-linked crypto bank that has not yet launched, is engaged in talks with Binance to launch a dollar-pegged stablecoin. 

If such deals were reached, it would mark a staggering reversal for a company that was once a pariah in Washington. 

Teng, a soft-spoken former regulator, was careful with his words when addressing the reports.

"I believe both World Liberty Financial as well as CZ himself have tweeted and denied the reports," said Teng, who runs the exchange's operations outside the U.S. 

As for the rumors about a Trump stake in Binance.US, Teng demurred. 

".US and .com are quite different animals, right?" he said. "They have different sets of shareholders, different boards of directors, and different CEOs running the show."

Binance structured the two exchanges as independent entities in response to regulatory scrutiny, aiming to ring-fence its U.S. operations from the broader international business.

Still, Teng is bullish on what the new political environment means for crypto.

"We went from four years of Operation Choke Point 2.0 to now – you have a very pro-crypto, pro-AI president," he said. While Binance.com doesn't operate in the U.S., he said, "We have benefited from all these pro-crypto policies."

Choke Point 2.0 is how industry insiders refer to an alleged crackdown by legacy banks on digital asset firms during the Biden administration.

Teng described a rapid global expansion that brought Binance from 170 million to 265 million users in just one year.

"We have received a lot of approaches from different governments around the world," Teng said, citing regulatory progress in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Brazil, Argentina and the United Arab Emirates.

Binance is now licensed in 21 jurisdictions, and its influence extends well beyond the reach of any one country. That includes sovereign wealth funds, some of which are starting to quietly allocate to crypto, Teng said.

In the background of all this optimism is the reality of Binance's checkered past.

Zhao, the company's founder and former CEO, was criminally charged, forced to step down and served a short prison sentence. Binance paid the multibilllion-dollar settlement – finalized in late 2023 – to resolve a raft of violations with U.S. regulators, including the Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

One major front remains open: The Securities and Exchange Commission's civil case against Binance and Zhao. 

The SEC and Binance in February agreed to a 60-day pause in proceedings as both sides consider a potential resolution. The stay comes amid a broader pullback by the SEC from several high-profile crypto lawsuits—signaling a potential regulatory reset under the new administration.

"We under-invested in compliance in those very early days," Teng said. "But what's important as a responsible institution is to acknowledge those early mistakes, make amends for it and invest greatly into compliance, which we are doing now."

Binance now employs more than 1,300 professionals in compliance, roughly a quarter of its total workforce, Teng said. "The direction of travel is very clear. It's one of compliance."

The Nigerian government might disagree. 

One of Binance's top compliance officers, Tigran Gambaryan, was recently imprisoned under harsh conditions. In Nigeria, Binance faced charges of alleged non-payment of value-added tax and company income tax, failure to submit tax returns and complicity in aiding customers to evade taxes through its platform. 

Alongside Gambaryan, who is a U.S. citizen and a former employee of the Internal Revenue Service, Nigeria has also imprisoned fellow executive Nadeem Anjarwalla, who is British-Kenyan. Both were charged and remanded in custody by Nigerian authorities. Anjarwalla escaped custody in March 2024, and Gambaryan was released several months later.

"The treatment he went through in Nigeria is not warranted," said Teng about Anjarwalla. "We have always tried to liaise and work cooperatively with governments around the world."

Since taking over as CEO, Teng has shifted the company from a founder-led startup to a board-governed organization. 

"Now I report to the board of directors," Teng said. "We have a board of seven members, including three independent directors and an independent chairman."

For all the scrutiny Binance faces, Teng insists the platform remains dominant.

"At any point in time, we have more than 40% of global market share," he said.

He dismissed concerns about Coinbase's growing political clout and the momentum behind crypto exchange-traded funds, arguing that ETFs are a gateway into crypto trading. 

"A lot of users that start trading through ETFs subsequently advance to cryptocurrency platforms," Teng said, noting that while crypto trades nonstop, ETFs are limited to business hours.

Binance took on its first institutional investment earlier this month in a $2 billion deal with Emirati state-owned investment firm MGX, which is an AI and advanced tech fund that counts BlackRock and Microsoft as partners. It's the largest investment ever made into a crypto company and the biggest to be fully paid in stablecoins.

Teng said he sees the investment as a way to bridge crypto and AI. 

"We are utilizing AI on an extensive basis," said Teng, noting that Binance uses artificial intelligence for customer service, security and compliance monitoring. "This is the blockchain sector. We have to continue to utilize technology to achieve efficiency."

Asked what keeps him up at night, Teng rattled off a list: Security, compliance, product innovation and opportunities for mergers and acquisitions.

"We want to make sure we run a very robust, operational, best-in-class platform," he said.

Bitcoin and crypto prices have dropped after surging in the aftermath of Donald Trump's election victory (though a White House official has just revealed how Trump could spur the bitcoin price higher).

The bitcoin price has fallen to around $85,000 per bitcoin, down from a peak of $110,000 per bitcoin in January, as traders scramble to protect their bitcoin from a new, mystery threat.

Now, after the Federal Reserve confirmed expectations it could be about to open the “floodgates," Fed chair Jerome Powell has warned the risk of recession is rising—something BlackRock's head of bitcoin and crypto has predicted could be a “big catalyst” for the bitcoin price.

Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said the risk of recession has ticked up—something ... More BlackRock's head of bitcoin and crypto thinks could fuel a bitcoin price boom.

“I don't know if we'll have a recession or not, but a recession would be a big catalyst for bitcoin,” Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock's head of digital assets, told Yahoo Finance in an interview, pointing to how recession responses such as increased fiscal spending, deficit accumulation, lower interest rates and monetary stimulus have historically boosted the bitcoin price.

"And it's catalyzed to some extent over fears of general social disorder,” Mitchnick said. “And that, too, unfortunately, is something that can happen in a recession.”

This week, the Fed downgraded its economic growth outlook while raising its inflation projection while leaving interest rates on hold.

"If you look at outside forecasts, forecasters have generally raised … their possibility of a recession somewhat, but still at relatively moderate level … [it] has moved up, but it's not high,” Fed chair Jerome Powell said during his post-interest rate decision press conference.

Ahead of Powell's comments, Moody's Analytics' chief economist Mark Zandi told CNN it “feels like we're being pushed into recession” by Donald Trump's international trade tariffs. “The recession risks are uncomfortably high and they're rising,” Zandi said.

The bitcoin price has fallen back in recent weeks but remains far higher than before Donald Trump's ... More election victory despite the Federal Reserve warning recession risks are rising.

Meanwhile, UCLA Anderson School of Management has published an official “Recession Watch” for the first time in its 73 years of economic forecasts, with its chief economist Clement Bohr predicting Trump “could very well be the author of a deep recession.”

Earlier this month, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink warned Trump's trade policies will stoke inflation—dampening expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates through 2025 and invoking the specter of “stagflation”—characterized by an economic slowdown coupled with spiraling price rises.

Fink, who has become one of the most bullish voices supporting bitcoin on Wall Street, led BlackRock in its campaign to get a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approved in the U.S. through 2023, with a fleet of bitcoin funds making their debut in January 2024 before surging to become some of the fastest growing ETFs of all time.

U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets for the first time in November, with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now boasting around $50 billion in assets under management.</p>

Earlier this month, President Trump reinvigorated crypto markets with his announcement of five cryptocurrencies for U.S. strategic reserves: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). In making this announcement, Trump has opened the door to a new financial era and created an opportunity for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to go toe-to-toe with the leader in global reserve fiat currency, the US dollar.

How did Bitcoin get here? The Bitcoin revolution started and grew as a reactionary movement to another global financial event, the 2008 financial crisis that was driven by an unsustainable housing bubble propped up by poor lending practices and toxic assets. The interventions made by central banks to correct the problem—including the bailout of institutions “too big to fail”—demonstrated to Bitcoin whitepaper writer and “inventor” Satoshi Nakamoto what they had already long believed about the fundamental problems of centralized economics and the need for a decentralized “e-cash.” The Bitcoin blockchain itself went live when Satoshi embedded the following message in the genesis block: 

“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”

The current era might be even more auspicious for driving the second wave of the Bitcoin revolution, especially if you believe Bitcoin is strong enough to become something like digital gold or a global reserve currency. The problem presented by the current era is not that of the bailout but the fundamental problem of fiat currency itself, that sticky problem of inflation.Prone to centralized currency manipulation and with countries still drowning in the fiat pumped out during and after the COVID-19 crisis, inflation has proven to be a fundamental complication that has bedeviled leaders across the globe and the political spectrum. Even with a number of political incumbents in different countries falling in defeat to the problem, inflation is proving to be especially resilient, even for the many disruptors who came in on the anti-inflation, anti-incumbent sentiment.In some cases, it is a problem isolated to a few products and sectors facing unique and probably temporary supply challenges, such as in the case of the price of eggs. However, if the problem persists, a crypto reserve, and especially a Bitcoin reserve, could present an elegant solution to at least partly halting inflation. This will be a good thing not only for those governments, but for the evolution of the one truly free and fair digital currency, the one that has been with us since 2009.

Is this even workable, especially here in the United States?Generally, a Bitcoin-led reserve would present a hedge against inflation, with the drawback being that governments would lose some flexibility around these holdings in the customary fiat-driven toolkits that have helped those governments heat up or cool down economies as needed. 

It makes sense that governments would look at Bitcoin as some portion of a reserve, particularly as a small, high-risk, high-reward portion of reserves, even as those governments missed out on the initial march to $100,000. There could be other rewards as well. As Senator Cynthia Lummis has pointed out to Elon Musk, now a top advisor to President Donald Trump, a crypto reserve could also be an automatic solution for governments to better audit those reserves, digitally. 

State governments in the US have actually been leading the way on this issue, providing a sort of roadmap for the federal government to use. Nearly half of all state governments have either put money into crypto reserves or are beginning that process. If Bitcoin continues to grow through this increased demand on its fixed supply, that makes it an even more attractive option to the U.S. federal government and other governments like it.If Bitcoin is to truly become part of the US national reserves, there must be clear regulatory frameworks, robust custody solutions, and bipartisan political will. From a monetary policy standpoint, the Federal Reserve would face an asset it cannot directly manipulate, potentially altering how we manage interest rates and national debt.

But what would all these governments diving in do for Bitcoin itself? We've already seen the temporary price bump on just the news itself, but the actual ramifications if it's implemented will be more far-reaching.

For one, Bitcoin would immediately be tied to fundamental avenues of public investment, especially retirement and pension funds. That is real attention and institutional interest that goes beyond online message boards, Telegram, and the Robinhood app.

The US federal government following the states' lead would, in turn, create a ripple effect where large companies in the private sector would follow the public sector's lead. If Bitcoin were in national reserves, it would legitimize Bitcoin as an institutional-grade asset, prompting companies to hold it more confidently on their balance sheets. In practice, we'd see new liquidity strategies—like crypto-backed lending—become mainstream, and corporations would more actively integrate Bitcoin into their long-term capital planning.

If Bitcoin were deemed a national reserve, its credibility as collateral would also skyrocket. Bitcoin-backed loans would become as standard as borrowing against gold, adding a modern dimension to liquidity in times of crisis. Its digital nature offers global 24/7 markets, which can provide flexibility and speed that gold or treasuries can't match, although volatility remains a consideration.

A national BTC reserve would cement Bitcoin's status as “digital gold.” We'd see broader acceptance by banks and alternative lenders offering BTC-collateralized loans, lines of credit, and treasury management solutions. New financial tools—like Bitcoin-based municipal bonds or sovereign BTC ETFs—could also become viable.

There would still be risks, including price volatility, but that can be a benefit, not a bug, especially if it were incorporated as just one segment of a diversified portfolio with different risk thresholds. Policymakers must balance both perceived and real concerns with the massive upside of holding a finite digital reserve asset.

On the flip side, Bitcoin provides an uncorrelated hedge against inflation and can attract global capital if the US is seen as Bitcoin-friendly, truly positioning it as the best reserve asset in the world. It behooves the federal government to follow President Trump's lead and begin to seriously explore this option while Bitcoin is still at a relatively low and investment-friendly price.

BlackRock's tokenized US Treasury fund, BUIDL, has seen a sharp rise in adoption, with the fund's assets under management (AUM) surging past the $1 billion milestone this month.

This growth highlights a strong shift toward real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, even as broader crypto markets face headwinds.

According to data from RWA. XYZ, BUIDL's AUM, has increased by almost 129% over the last 30 days, bringing it to $1.4 billion.

This milestone means that it took only one year for the fund, which launched on the Securitize platform in March 2024, to cross the $1 billion mark.

While BUIDL has expanded to multiple blockchains, the majority of its supply—over $1 billion, or 86.46%—remains on Ethereum. This indicates strong minting activity on the network.

Other chains, such as Avalanche and Aptos, each hold about $56 million of the fund's supply, or roughly 3.6%. Ethereum Layer-2 networks like Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism host the rest.

Meanwhile, investor participation has also grown. In the past month, the number of holders rose by 19%, bringing the total to 62.

Market observers pointed out that these numbers highlight the growing trust in blockchain-based financial products and the rising institutional interest in tokenizing bonds and credit.

BUIDL's milestone comes as asset management firm Fidelity also moves into the tokenization space.

Over the past week, the firm filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a blockchain-based version of its Treasury money market fund. The new share class, named “OnChain,” will operate using blockchain as a transfer agent and settlement layer.

“The OnChain class of the fund currently uses the Ethereum network as the public blockchain. In the future, the fund may use other public blockchain networks, subject to eligibility and other requirements that the fund may impose,” the filing added.

Fidelity's move mirrors a broader trend. Financial institutions are turning to blockchain to tokenize bonds, funds, and credit instruments. This shift offers improved efficiency, round-the-clock settlement, and better transparency.

Meanwhile, the filing comes as institutional interest in RWAs continues to rise, despite a sluggish crypto market. While Bitcoin is down 11% year-to-date, RWA tokens have seen sustainable growth in 2025.

On-chain data shows the total RWA market has grown 18.29% in the past 30 days, reaching $19.23 billion. The number of RWA holders also increased by 5%, now nearing 91,000.

BlackRock's BUIDL leads the RWA space by market cap. It's followed by Hashnote's USDY at $784 million and Tether Gold (XAUT) at $752 million. 

Meanwhile, US Treasuries make up $4.76 billion of the total, while private credit dominates with $12.2 billion.

Key Takeaways:

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has made a historic move by formally incorporating cryptocurrencies into its global economic data systems. The new standards are provided in the seventh edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual (BPM7), released on March 20, 2025, and represent the first time the IMF has offered detailed guidance to the international statistical community on how to capture digital asset activity in its global statistical standards. This inclusion reflects the increasing prominence of digital assets in global trade and financial transactions, making it imperative for institutions to develop clear methodologies for data reporting.



The new IMF standards offer a framework to help countries consistently monitor and report on crypto activity. One such distinguishing feature in the BPM7 is the classification of digital assets. The framework distinguishes between fungible and non-fungible tokens and categorizes them based on the liabilities they incur. The framework has been developed with input from 160 countries. This illustrates the importance of identifying the worldwide impact of digital assets on an economy, even if the implementations may vary. Standardized classification of these assets ensures that policymakers have accurate data to make informed economic decisions.



The practical upshots of the new IMF classifications are not trivial. For example, cross-border transactions in Bitcoin will now be recorded in the capital account as acquisitions or disposals of non-produced assets. Such granularity paints a better picture of capital flows and the absorption of cryptocurrency into the global financial system.

To add to the complexity, the IMF recognizes staking and crypto yields. This move acknowledges the evolving nature of digital finance and highlights the growing influence of decentralized finance (DeFi) in the global monetary landscape. Rewards from holding tokens, they argue, are akin to dividends on equity, and as such should be reported as income depending on the size and purpose of the holdings. The IMF considers activities such as mining and staking—processes that secure and validate crypto transactions—as services. These will form a part of the computer services exports and imports.

IMF official recognition of crypto in its dataset signifies the fact that the world's financial institutions can not turn a blind eye to digital assets any longer. There is also a growing realization that these assets must be included in economic policy and regulation. As governments seek to balance innovation with financial stability, the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in official economic metrics marks a significant step forward.

The IMF recognizes these challenges and this acknowledgment can drive the harmonization of regulations cross-border. This enables governments to better formulate policies on taxation of cryptocurrency, anti-money laundering, and consumer protection.

One of the biggest challenges in the crypto space has been the lack of regulatory clarity. The work that the IMF does may help promote such an environment, which could in turn lead more institutions to embrace cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.

It also enhances the transparency of cryptocurrencies in the IMF's standards, which has a significant impact. Imagine a scenario where, in the near future, a small island nation experiences a crypto boom. With the IMF's standards in place, the national economy will be better prepared to recognize and mitigate risks.

The IMF's manual represents a major shift in the way global economic statistics are collected and interpreted, paving the way for future guidelines on digital currencies.

Coinbase is in advanced talks to acquire Deribit, the biggest platform for trading Bitcoin and Ethereum options. Deribit has a key operating license in Dubai, and the deal, which could greatly increase Coinbase's derivatives footprint.



Bloomberg estimated the deal could be worth $4 billion to $5 billion.



Deribit is licensed to operate in Dubai and has a strong institutional clientele as the biggest platform for trading Bitcoin and Ethereum options.

Bloomberg report highlighted that the companies informed Dubai's regulators about the talks. Coinbase may be making a calculated move with the possible acquisition as the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency company.

Deribit reportedly hired a financial advisor in January to investigate possible acquisition possibilities. A credible source said that although Kraken had been mentioned as a potential candidate, no talks between the two companies occurred.

Coinbase stated “We have a bold mission to increase economic freedom in the world, and are constantly exploring opportunities around the world to build, buy, partner, and invest to accelerate our roadmap,”

The American-listed exchange declined to confirm any ongoing deal discussions.

It is still unclear if Coinbase and Deribit have reached a definitive agreement although the most recent report indicated that talks are moving forward. This is one of the biggest acquisition discussions in the cryptocurrency industry as the options trading platform was previously estimated to be worth between $4 billion and $5 billion.

Coinbase's choice to pursue this acquisition deal seems to be a calculated step to enter the Middle Eastern market in light of this. The US and EU's initial tough stance on cryptocurrency regulations in recent years has contributed to the rise of the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, and Singapore as the three unofficial global hubs for blockchain events and resident stakeholders.

Now that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) is a formal government policy, its administrators are scrambling for ways to build and potentially sustain the plan. 

With an order to use budget-neutral strategies to manage the reserve, Bo Hines, US President Donald Trump's Executive Director on Digital Assets, suggests using gold certificates.  

Hines shared many creative ideas on possible “budget-neutral” ways to buy more Bitcoins, and he sees gold certificates as one of the best options. He added that these certificates are priced less than actual gold, making it possible for the US government to realize gains when using them to buy Bitcoins.

Trump's announcement of the executive order on the crypto reserve was met with mixed reactions. Although many expected the government to approve the BTC reserve, many were disappointed with the initial plan not to buy new Bitcoin. Instead, its administrators are tasked with tapping digital assets already owned by the government or acquiring new ones through “budget-neutral approaches.”

According to Hines, one creative and budget-neutral way to fund Bitcoin acquisition is to use gold certificates. As a guest on the Crypto in America podcast, the exec expects potential gains using gold certificates since they're cheaper than actual gold. Hines continued by pointing to the Lummis Act, where Senator Cynthia Lummis suggested tapping the potential of the gold certificates.

According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, all gold certificates are assessed at their statutory price of $42.22 per troy ounce. In contrast, spot gold is priced at more than $3k per ounce. In Senator Lummis' Bitcoin Act 2025, the Federal Reserve System's gold certificates can potentially fund future purchases.

Lummis' bill requires the Fed banks to transfer their outstanding gold certificates under custody to the office of the Treasury Secretary. The secretary will then issue new certificates reflecting gold's current and fair market value.

Hines added that he welcomes additional suggestions and recommendations on how to grow and manage the Bitcoin reserve, provided they are not a burden on taxpayers. He said this is the primary intent of Trump's crypto executive order signed on March 6th. Hines is looking to convene an inter-agency working group, and they will solicit information and suggestions from everybody.

Currently, the government holds around 207,000 Bitcoins that were seized through civil and criminal proceedings. With 207k Bitcoin holdings, the US has the biggest BTC holdings among nation-states.
