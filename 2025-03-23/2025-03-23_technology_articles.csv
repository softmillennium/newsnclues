To get there, it will need to build cameras to the device and then build on its Visual Intelligence work from the iPhone. The company is planning something similar for its AirPods earbuds. And in both cases, Apple would like to switch to its own AI models in time, as it does with the hardware components and software that it ships with its devices. Today, Visual Intelligence uses OpenAI and Google models.

An Apple Intelligence-powered Apple Watch is still years away, Gurman cautions. After all, this is the company that can’t ship conversational Siri features because of its stringent privacy guarantees. But the cameras are apparently coming to the standard and Ultra versions of the Apple Watch, though the placement of those cameras will vary by device. Standard Apple Watches will use an in-display camera, while the Ultra will place the camera on the side, near the crown and side button.

Adding Apple Intelligence to the Apple Watch feels like an obvious next step, but because of the device’s low-end processor, it’s unlike that any of the processing will occur locally. Which is fine, given how tightly the device it tied to the iPhone, which now includes the necessary internals. Gurman expects to see camera-equipped Apple Watch and AirPods models appear in 2027 at the soonest.

Tied to this, Apple recently reorganized the teams working on Apple Intelligence and conversational Siri, tasking Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell with fixing Siri. Gurman says that this is just part of the shake-up, however. The Vision Pro team is being split into separate hardware and software groups, former AI lead John Giannandrea “isn’t being fired” despite the Siri problems, and a few other execs will move laterally. Separately, smart ring maker Oura hired an Apple veteran away from the company.

Gurman also notes the plastic Apple Watch SE redesign is in “serious jeopardy,” which feels a bit dramatic given the low stakes. But it appears that the plastic cases aren’t less expensive than aluminum, and the design team isn’t happy with the look. The next Apple Watch Ultra will apparently include satellite texting support, thanks to a new MediaTek modem.

As is usually the case with Power On, Gurman tackles several other related topics this week. But only one is of interest. He says that this year’s thin iPhone 17 Air will lead to a folding iPhone model in 2026 that will cost $2000 and compete head-on with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold. It’s not difficult imagining that such a device would be a welcome combination of a traditional iPhone and an iPad Mini. But as is always the case with Apple, it’s taking its time getting there.",techmeme

Apple is working on adding cameras to the Apple Watch in order to enable AI features like Visual Intelligence within the next two years, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman in today’s Power On Newsletter.

The cameras will be “inside the display” for the standard Series Watch, while the Apple Watch Ultra would feature it on the side, next to the digital crown and button, according to Gurman. With them, the Apple Watch would be able to “see the outside world and use AI to deliver relevant information,” which he says is also the plan for camera-equipped AirPods Apple is rumored to be working on.

The Visual Intelligence features that these devices would use debuted on the iPhone 16, where it works with the phone’s camera to do things like add details from an event flyer to your calendar, or look up information about a restaurant.

Gurman does not expect the cameras to enable FaceTime on the Apple Watch. Instead, he said the cameras would enable Visual Intelligence on future Apple Watch models. This feature would allow Apple Watch users to quickly receive information about items or places their surroundings. For example, they could point their Apple Watch at a restaurant to receive its hours or ratings as they pass by on the sidewalk.

Visual Intelligence debuted on all iPhone 16 models last year, and it is available on iPhone 15 Pro models starting with iOS 18.4.

Last year, Bloomberg reported that Apple was considering switching to a ‘rigid plastic’ for the next-generation Apple Watch SE. This would’ve potentially allowed for an even lower starting price.

Now, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports that the switch to plastic is ‘in serious jeopardy.’ Design teams don’t like how it looks, and it isn’t currently cheaper to produce than the already-existing aluminum casings:

And the redesigned, plastic Apple Watch SE I’ve written about is also in serious jeopardy. The design team doesn’t like the look, and the operations team is finding it difficult to make the casing materially cheaper than the current aluminum chassis.

Whether or not Apple overcomes these hurdles remains to be seen. That said, Apple Watch SE will be coming up on 3 years old this fall, so we’ll likely see a refresh in about 6 months, plastic or not.

Gurman also reiterates that the next-generation Apple Watch Ultra will gain support for satellite texting, as well as 5G connectivity.

Apple’s rumored plan to redesign the Apple Watch SE with a plastic casing is reportedly in “jeopardy,” according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Citing internal sources, Gurman claims Apple’s design team is dissatisfied with the look of the plastic model, while the operations team is struggling to make the casing meaningfully cheaper than the current aluminum version.

Gurman first reported on the potential shift to plastic last year, noting that the change was aimed at reducing production costs and making the device more appealing — and affordable — for younger users. A plastic chassis could allow Apple to offer the Watch SE in a range of vibrant colors, reminiscent of the iPhone 5c, which launched in bold hues like blue, pink, green, and yellow.

However, despite the potential benefits, the redesign now appears unlikely to move forward. Design quality concerns and cost inefficiencies have reportedly stalled the effort, casting doubt on whether a plastic Apple Watch SE will ever reach the market.

The current Apple Watch SE, released in 2022, starts at $249 in the U.S. A plastic version was expected to come in at a lower price point, potentially making it a more attractive option for families or first-time smartwatch users. It remains unclear whether Apple will still pursue a kid-focused model in a future iteration.",techmeme

Apple last updated its affordable “SE” series smartwatch back in 2022. Priced at $250, the smartwatch offered a decent mix of wellness capabilities, clean design, and long battery life. But in time that has elapsed since, rivals like Samsung, OnePlus, and Mobvoi have offered fantastic value-centric models of their own.

Apple, on the other hand, hasn’t said a word on the next Watch SE trim. It seems the third-generation Apple Watch SE might take a while to arrive, and the delay may not be strategic. As per Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the affordable model might be in “serious jeopardy” due to hardware-related snags.

“The design team doesn’t like the look, and the operations team is finding it difficult to make the casing materially cheaper than the current aluminum chassis,” says the report. The outlet recently reported that Apple was experimenting with other materials in order to bring the manufacturing costs down.

A big shift

So far, Apple has sold the Watch SE in a chassis made out of aluminum, while the pricier models have also experimented with stainless steel and titanium. For the next affordable Apple Watch, the company was reportedly experimenting with plastic-based material.

A plastic derivative is cheaper and easier to handle, compared to aluminum. Moreover, it would allow Apple to experiment with more color options, without worrying too much about the durability aspect or the weight factor.

Amazfit, for example, has used plastic-based material on its Bip series smartwatches for years. However, it doesn’t feel nearly as premium as metal, an aspect that has been a hallmark of Apple’s smartwatch aesthetics for years.

Assuming Apple isn’t content with the plastic material and ditches the idea, the only option left would be an aluminum shell. If Apple goes ahead with upgrading the internal hardware on the Watch SE 3, including the silicon and sensor stack, it might have to raise the asking price of the device.

If you’re looking for a precedent, stray no further than the iPhone SE family. It served a 5G tax not too long ago, and then asked for much higher price tag with the iPhone 16e makeover.

What to expect from Apple Watch SE 3?

We’ve heard rumors that Apple wanted to bring the cost of its next SE smartwatch further down to tackle the hot competition. With that in mind, it’s entirely plausible that the lower-cost models are made out of plastic, while the more upscale trims stick with an aluminum build.

On the other hand, given Apple’s environmental commitments and the slow phasing out of plastic-based materials in its products, shifting to an all-plastic look for the Watch SE 3 sounds a tad odd. Other rumors predict a size boost, going from 40mm to 41mm on the smaller version, while the bigger variant jumps from 44mm to 45mm.

A processor update is expected, but it is unclear whether Apple will also upgrade the sensor stack. More importantly, it is uncertain whether the ongoing conundrum will affect the launch timeline of the Apple Watch SE 3, but the fall season of 2025 seems ripe for a market arrival.",techmeme

This will enable the wearable to “see the outside world and use AI to deliver relevant information.”

However, Apple needs a few more generations to turn the Apple Watch with cameras into a reality.

Future Apple Watch could pack a camera

Apple currently equips its iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks with built-in cameras, with only the iPhone using them for AI features. With Visual Intelligence, you can point the iPhone 16’s camera at an object to get more information about it.

Reports suggest Apple will integrate IR cameras into a future AirPods model. Among other things, this will enable the earbuds to support in-air gestures. This will allow you to control music playback with hand movements.

Bloomberg‘s Mark Gurman, in the latest edition of his weekly Power On newsletter, claims Apple will add cameras to future Apple Watch models as well. With AI assistance and input from the camera, the smartwatch could provide relevant, contextual information.

“As part of this plan, Apple is considering adding cameras to both its standard Series watches and Ultra models. The current idea is to put the camera inside the display of the Series version, like the front-facing lens on the iPhone. The Ultra will take a different approach, with the camera lens sitting on the side of the watch near the crown and button,” says Gurman.

Visual Intelligence will power visual AI features

Apple will seemingly be able to put the camera on the side of the Ultra because of more internal space. This will let users point the watch’s camera at an object to access more information. However, do not expect to use the camera for making FaceTime calls.

The report claims that Apple will heavily rely on Visual Intelligence to power such AI features on its future devices. While the feature may not impress you in its current iteration, the company has big plans for it.",techmeme

SECTOR LEADER: TSMC can increase capacity by as much as 20 percent or more in the advanced node part of the foundry market by 2030, an analyst said

Staff writer, with CNA





Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, 台積電) is expected to lead its peers in the advanced 2-nanometer process technology, despite competition from Samsung Electronics Co and Intel Corp, TrendForce Corp analyst Joanne Chiao (喬安) said.

TSMC’s sophisticated products and its large production scale are expected to allow the company to continue dominating the global 2-nanometer process market this year, Chiao said.

The world’s largest contract chipmaker is scheduled to begin mass production of chips made on the 2-nanometer process in its Hsinchu fab in the second half of this year. It would also hold a ceremony on Monday next week to mark its efforts to expand 2-nanometer production in its Kaohsiung plant.

TSMC, which has grasped almost all global businesses in chips used in artificial intelligence applications by using its 3-nanometer process technology, expects its 2-nanometer process to attract even more orders, as more clients have expressed interest in using the new technology.

Samsung so far has not built a large customer base for its 2-nanometer process yet, and its major user is expected to come from its system LSI units, Chiao said.

Therefore, the top priority for the South Korean chipmaker is to improve yield rates and customer services to gain a larger share of the 2-nanometer market, she said.

A recent report from South Korea’s The Bell said that Samsung has introduced a gate-all-around architecture, which reduces undesirable variability and mobility loss, to the 2-nanometer process, as TSMC has done, but TSMC’s yield rates are more than double Samsung’s.

Meanwhile, Intel lags behind TSMC in the number of production methods, making it less flexible in meeting its clients’ demands, Chiao said.

However, Intel’s cooperation with United Microelectronics Corp (聯電) is expected to help it generate more sales in the foundry business, she added.

Even though investors might be concerned about TSMC’s expansion in the US amid geopolitical tensions, the company is expected to keep its top spot in the market, financial Web site Seeking Alpha reported on Saturday, citing Citigroup Inc analyst Laura Chen (陳佳儀).

“We believe TSMC’s near-term outlook and long-term prospects are on track, and don’t expect any potential [joint venture] to change the advanced semiconductor industry landscape,” Chen wrote in a note to clients, referencing a potential joint venture for Intel’s operations.

With TSMC announcing a new US$100 billion investment in the US over the next four years earlier this month, the company could increase capacity by as much as 20 percent or more in the advanced node part of the foundry market by 2030, Seeking Alpha reported, citing Chen.",techmeme

Those CPUs could be based on an improved 2nm process

It means faster, more efficient chips

While the iPhone 18 series won't be launching for another year and a half, we've already heard several predictions about it – and the latest one suggests all four models in the range are going to get a substantial performance upgrade.

This comes from well-respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has reiterated a prediction he made six months ago: that the A20 chipsets destined for the iPhone 18 handsets will use a 2-nanometer production process.

The current iPhone 16 devices use A18 processors made with 3nm technology. A switch from 3nm to 2nm essentially means more transistors can be packed inside a processor – making it speedier and more efficient.

iPhones get faster every year of course, but a change in the manufacturing process like this means significant performance gains, above and beyond the usual increases. It should mean the iPhone 18 can offer next-level processing power.

Still a ways away

Reiterating my prediction from six months ago: the 2H26 new iPhones (iPhone 18) will be powered by TSMC’s 2nm chips.Worth noting, TSMC’s 2nm R&D trial yields reached 60–70% three months ago, and they’re now well above that. https://t.co/ZoWXFqfUnSMarch 22, 2025

There remains some ambiguity around whether or not the chips for every iPhone 18 model will get this 2nm upgrade. Kuo now seems more optimistic about this than he was in September, but it may be an upgrade just for the Pro and Pro Max models.

This follows reports earlier this week from another industry analyst, Jeff Pu at GF Securities. Pu initially suggested the A20 chipsets would be based on a 3nm process, before revising his prediction to say that 2nm A20 silicon was a possibility.

It would well be that even Apple and its supply chain partners aren't sure yet. The iPhone 18 handsets aren't going to see the light of day until September 2026, so there's a lot of time yet for the manufacturing processes to be refined.

The analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has not only doubled down on his prediction from six months ago that Apple will introduce 2nm chips for the iPhone 18 Pro, but suggested that regular models may now also be in line for the upgrade.

“Reiterating my prediction from six months ago: the 2H26 new iPhones (iPhone 18) will be powered by TSMC’s 2nm chips,” he wrote on X.

While he states this is a reiteration of the earlier message, it’s slightly different. In September, he added, ""Due to cost concerns, not all new iPhone 18 models may be equipped with a 2-nanometer processor.” That caveat isn’t repeated here, suggesting that even the regular iPhone 18 will benefit from the upgrade — something other analysts have previously predicted.

Assuming we’re not reading too much into what is admittedly an ambiguous sentence, the reason for this might be revealed in the second part of the post. “Worth noting, TSMC’s 2nm R&D trial yields reached 60–70% three months ago, and they’re now well above that,” Kuo wrote.

Due to cost concerns, not all new iPhone 18 models may be equipped with a 2-nanometer processor. Ming-Chi Kuo

In this context, “yield” refers to the proportion of functional chips used per silicon wafer. A higher number is more cost-effective, for obvious reasons, and in the past, hardware from various companies has been delayed due to poor yields. That doesn’t sound like it will be a problem with the A20 chip.

While buyers can still expect a performance boost from newer chips built to the same fabrication process, reducing the size makes things much easier. The lower the nanometer value, the tighter packed the transistors, meaning quicker signal travel for faster performance and greater efficiency.

This doesn’t mean that the iPhone 17 will be worth skipping. The iPhone 17 Pro sounds like a solid upgrade from the iPhone 16 Pro, with a series of impressive sound improvements.



If current rumors are to be believed, you can expect a bold new design to accompany a faster chipset with better performance under pressure, more RAM, a new 48MP telephoto lens, better selfies and faster charging. We’ll find out if these are true in September, when the iPhone 17 family is unveiled, probably alongside the Apple Watch 11.

Kuo shared an update on X, saying Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is making strong progress with its 2nm technology. He noted that trial production yields reached 60–70% three months ago and have since improved significantly.

Here’s a timeline of what to expect for Apple’s chips and iPhones, based on Kuo’s analysis:

September 2025

iPhone 17 lineup will be powered by TSMC’s improved 3nm chips using the N3P process, an improved version of its 3-nanometer chip technology, offering better performance and lower power usage compared to the earlier N3B process. It’s more cost-efficient to produce, making it ideal for Apple’s iPhone 17 lineup.

This is a more efficient and powerful version of the 3nm tech used in iPhone 16.

Second Half of 2026

iPhone 18 models are expected to feature Apple’s first 2nm chips, made by TSMC.

However, due to high production costs, not all iPhone 18 versions may get the 2nm chip. Some could stick with the 3nm generation.

The move to 2nm chips would mark a significant jump in performance and power efficiency for Apple devices, possibly boosting battery life and speed for future iPhones.

Kuo first made this prediction in 2024 and is now doubling down, pointing to steady progress at TSMC as a key sign Apple is on schedule.",techmeme

But in selected spots across the government, SpaceX is positioning itself to see billions of dollars in new federal contracts or other support, a dozen current and former federal officials said in interviews with The New York Times.

The boost in federal spending for SpaceX will come in part as a result of actions by President Trump and Mr. Musk’s allies and employees who now hold government positions. The company will also benefit from policies under the current Trump administration that prioritize hiring commercial space vendors for everything from communications systems to satellite fabrication, areas in which SpaceX now dominates.

Italian authorities have frozen talks with SpaceX to obtain Starlink access, Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said in a wide-ranging interview with Italian media outlet La Repubblica released on March 22.

European officials have repeatedly decried U.S. billionaire Elon Musk for inflammatory remarks about Ukraine and Europe. European officials previously clashed with Musk over concerns that Starlink access could be cut off in Ukraine.

Earlier this year, the Italian government explored the possibility of an agreement with Starlink, but opposition officials denounced the idea of a contract with Musk, citing his comments on Ukraine.

""It seems to me that everything has stopped ... the topic has moved from Starlink to the statements of and about the person,"" Crosetto said.

Negotiations are on hold for now, he said, and Italy will focus on what is ""useful and safe"" for the country in its defense contracts.

Authorities in Italy are currently not working on a contract with Starlink but will consider it in the future, Crosetto said.

""The technical plan is not being discussed. When the controversy and the times have calmed down, there will be a technical approach.""

European officials voiced concern Starlink could cut off Ukraine's access to its internet service, following media reports that the U.S. had threatened to terminate Starlink service in order to pressure Kyiv to sign a minerals deal with Washington. Starlink internet access is crucial to Ukraine's battlefield communications.

Musk and top White House officials clashed with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski over the legitimacy of such concerns on March 9.

Musk denied Starlink access could be cut off in Ukraine following backlash from Ukraine's allies.

One such firm, Browser Use, has attracted a ton of interest from developers and investors thanks to its solution that makes websites more “readable” for AI agents.

Browser Use told TechCrunch that it has raised a sizable $17 million seed funding round led by Felicis’ Astasia Myers with participation from Paul Graham, A Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners. The company’s funding hasn’t previously been reported.

Browser use’s website.

Browser Use, part of Y Combinator’s 2025 winter batch, has gained notoriety in recent months. Chinese startup Butterfly Effect’s use of Brower Use in its viral Manus tool drove awareness to new heights.

Magnus Müller and Gregor Zunic founded Browser Use last year through ETH Zurich’s Student Project House accelerator. Müller had been working on web-scraping tools for years, and met Zunic in 2024 while the pair were getting their master’s degrees in data science. Together, according to Müller, they came up with the idea of combining web scraping with data science to prompt a browser to perform a task.

Müller and Zunic built a Browser Use demo in five weeks — and it took off. Subsequently, they open-sourced it.

Browser Use essentially breaks down the buttons and elements of a website into a more digestible, “text-like” format for agents. This helps the agents understand the different options and make decisions autonomously.

“A lot of agents rely on vision-based systems and try and navigate websites through screenshots, and in [the] process, things break,” Müller said. “We convert [websites] into something agents can understand. This approach means we can run the same tasks again and again at a cheaper cost.”

There’s an increasing number of AI companies that want to make their agents interact with websites more gracefully, and Müller thinks Browser Use can become a “fundamental layer” serving this need. He added that more than 20 companies in the current Y Combinator Winter batch used Browser Use for their own requirements.

“There are companies coming to us and saying, ‘What can we do to make it easier for agents to navigate our website?’” Müller said. “There are sites — for example, LinkedIn — that change the way the website works all the time, so agents often fail on sites like those.”

According to Myers, Felicis has been actively looking at the AI agents space for the past several years, and Browser Use felt like the right opportunity to grow the firm’s portfolio there. She said that the company’s founding team — and its open-source-first approach — sealed the deal

“We think web AI agents are the next frontier that really helps with the end-to-end automation of human tasks,” Myers told TechCrunch. “[W]eb AI agents are this dynamic bridge between static pre-trained models that are mostly text-focused in the ever-changing digital landscape.”",techmeme

Model Efficiency Meets Real-World Constraints

While expanding its proprietary model suite, Tencent continues to rely on third-party models like DeepSeek to meet performance demands while lowering infrastructure costs. During its Q4 2024 earnings call, executives explained how inference efficiency—not compute scale—is guiding their deployment choices.

Tencent recently confirmed its use of DeepSeek’s architecture-optimized models to reduce GPU consumption and improve throughput. “Chinese companies are generally prioritizing efficiency and utilization—efficient utilization of the GPU servers. And that doesn’t necessarily impair the ultimate effectiveness of the technology that’s being developed,” said the company’s chief strategy officer.

This approach allows Tencent to tailor models to specific infrastructure constraints. Rather than scaling GPU clusters, it is focusing on lower-latency, inference-tuned models that are lighter to run. The strategy mirrors research-backed methods like Sample, Scrutinize and Scale, which emphasize verification at inference time instead of more resource-heavy training.

Despite this efficiency focus, Tencent isn’t backing away from hardware investments. According to a TrendForce report, the company has placed large orders for NVIDIA’s H20 chips—specialized GPUs for the Chinese market. These chips support Tencent’s integration of DeepSeek models into backend services, including those powering WeChat.

Shifting Politics, Shifting Priorities

The launch of T1 comes amid heightened scrutiny of Chinese AI tools abroad. On March 17, 2025, the U.S. Commerce Department barred DeepSeek’s applications from use on federal government devices, citing privacy risks and potential links to state-controlled infrastructure. Additional restrictions may follow, complicating cross-border AI adoption for models developed in China.

Back home, the Chinese government is actively promoting newer AI startups. Reuters reportes that Beijing is supporting Monica, the developer of Manus, an autnomous AI agent. While Tencent is not directly involved with these initiatives, its leadership in the domestic cloud and software markets ensures it remains central to the broader AI ecosystem.

That central role appears to be paying off. In Q4 2024, Tencent’s revenue rose 11% year-over-year to 172.45 billion yuan. A portion of that growth was attributed to enterprise AI development, with the company signaling further investment in 2025 to expand both consumer-facing and enterprise-ready AI infrastructure.

Model Diversification Meets Deployment Strategy

Tencent’s two-pronged AI strategy—Hunyuan T1 for structured reasoning and Turbo S for instant replies—enables it to deliver model-specific capabilities across different business verticals.

Rather than scaling up a single large model, the company is aligning each release with precise usage scenarios: complex logic for internal analytics, fast interaction for customer interfaces.

Each model is deeply integrated into Tencent’s cloud infrastructure. This approach may appeal to businesses seeking AI solutions that are fully hosted in China and compliant with national data standards.

In contrast to OpenAI’s trajectory—which saw the release of its largest and most expensive model yet, GPT-4.5, in February—Tencent’s strategy appears more calibrated.

With Hunyuan T1 now live and Turbo S already active in latency-sensitive environments, Tencent is expanding its role in China’s rapidly evolving AI sector.

The company’s combination of in-house development, selective external adoption, and integrated product rollout suggests a strategy rooted in adaptability rather than volume. As policy pressure and hardware constraints reshape the market, that approach could prove increasingly pragmatic.",techmeme
https://techmeme.com,Turkey’s democracy dies in silence as Musk mutes the opposition,https://www.theweek.in/news/middle-east/2025/03/23/turkey-s-democracy-dies-in-silence-as-musk-mutes-the-opposition.html,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Turkey’s slide into autocracy seems to have reached a tipping point, evident from the recent events that have thrown the nation’s fragile democratic framework into a major crisis.

The latest crisis is the result of the arrest of Ekrem İmamoğlu, the mayor of Istanbul and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s chief political rival. Detained in a dawn raid just before he was about to be nominated as the presidential candidate for the opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), İmamoğlu now faces charges of embezzlement, corruption and terrorism. Critics see this as a calculated move by Erdoğan to neutralise the only figure who could challenge him in elections due before 2028 but might take place earlier.

The arrest has led to a wave of protests across Turkey, despite a government-imposed ban on gatherings. From Istanbul to Ankara, demonstrators have clashed with police wielding water cannons, tear gas and rubber bullets, with 343 arrests reported in a single night. The opposition claims that three lakh people flooded Istanbul’s streets on a Friday night, defying roadblocks and riot police.

Playing a key role in this unfolding drama by siding with the government is Elon Musk’s social media platform X, which has suspended numerous accounts linked to opposition figures and democracy activists. Musk, a self-proclaimed advocate of free speech who said he acquired X to champion unfettered expression, now finds his platform implicated in a troubling paradox.

Erdogan: ""You can't go out and protest in Turkey anymore against me! I forbid it! I forbid it you hear me! You'll be all arrested!""



Turks: pic.twitter.com/Gp86lgcMfg — Dispropaganda (@Dispropoganda) March 22, 2025 am not seeing much coverage of the massive (and, according to the govt, illegal) pro-democracy protests in turkey pic.twitter.com/1khP6SWfAY — ian bremmer (@ianbremmer) March 22, 2025

The suspensions, targeting voices of dissent in a country teetering on the brink of authoritarianism, cast further doubt on X’s role as a beacon of open discourse and raise profound questions about the limits of free speech and democracy in politically volatile states.

Meanwhile, the Turkish government’s response has been unrelenting. Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya has vowed zero tolerance for those disrupting “societal order”, while Erdoğan has branded the protests “street terrorism”. This hardline stance is mirrored online, where X’s suspensions have silenced key voices of resistance. The targeted accounts, largely university-associated activists with lakhs of followers, were instrumental in sharing protest locations and rallying students.

This is not a new tactic for X in Turkey; during Erdoğan’s 2023 re-election campaign, the platform restricted content to maintain its accessibility, bowing to government pressure. Transparency reports underscore this compliance: X honoured 86 per cent of Turkey’s content takedown requests in the second half of 2024, up from 68 per cent earlier that year.

These suspensions are based on Turkey’s 2022 social media law, a sweeping measure that grants the state vast and ambiguous powers to suppress online content. Yerlikaya has defended the crackdown, citing 326 accounts identified as inciting hatred, and noting the arrest of 54 suspects in a joint cyber-security operation. While lawful under Turkish statutes, these actions reflect a broader strategy to mute dissent as the nation’s democratic credentials crumble.

İmamoğlu arrest exemplifies this erosion. As mayor of Istanbul, which is Turkey’s cultural and economic heart, his detention strikes at the opposition’s core, threatening to dismantle the existing system that has allowed electoral competition, however imperfect, to persist.

Turkey has never been a paragon of democracy. Over the past decade, Erdoğan has steadily tightened his hold, appointing his loyalists to the judiciary and bureaucracy, co-opting the media to limit dissent and wielding state prosecutors to punish adversaries. Yet, opposition victories, such as last year’s municipal elections, have kept the system from tipping fully into autocracy.

Barring İmamoğlu from the presidential race would mark a decisive shift, aligning Turkey with countries like Russia, Belarus or Azerbaijan, where elections occur but lack meaning. It could cement Turkey’s transformation into an outright autocracy, a trajectory critics argue Erdoğan has pursued relentlessly.

The international reaction has been muted, offering Erdoğan little resistance. The United Nations has put out a vanilla statement, while the US State Department has declined to comment, calling it Turkey’s “internal decisions.” President Donald Trump’s recent call with Erdoğan, hailed as “transformational” by Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, hints at a burgeoning alliance, possibly linked to Turkey’s strategic roles in Syria and Ukraine. Trump’s administration, indifferent to democratic backsliding abroad, aligns with a global climate that enables autocrats.

European leaders, meanwhile, once vocal critics of Erdoğan, have softened their stance. With Trump’s return to the White House and uncertainties over Ukraine, they see Turkey as a potential defence partner, a shift that could see Ankara supplying peacekeepers, a prospect that mutes criticism further.

Economically, the fallout from İmamoğlu’s arrest has been swift. The Turkish lira plummeted, prompting the central bank to spend an estimated $11.5 billion in a single day to stabilise it. Yet, Turkey’s geopolitical leverage—bolstered by its influence in Syria’s new government and its appeal to a Europe anxious about Russia—may insulate it from sustained pressure.

The protests, the largest since the 2013 Gezi Park uprising, but Erdoğan’s defiance, rooted in his assertion that Turkey will not “surrender to street terrorism,” suggests a leader confident in his impunity.

For X, the suspensions expose a glaring tension between Musk’s free-speech ideals and the pragmatic realities of operating in repressive regimes. By acquiescing to Turkey’s demands, X secures its foothold in a vital market, but at the cost of amplifying the censorship Musk claims to abhor.",techmeme
https://theverge.com,Is it safe to travel with your phone right now?,https://theverge.com/policy/634264/customs-border-protection-search-phone-airport-rights,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 12:00:00 GMT","is a policy reporter. Her past work has focused on immigration politics, border surveillance technologies, and the rise of the New Right.

In recent weeks, airport Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents have drawn public outcry for denying travelers US entry based on searches of their phones. A doctor on an H-1B visa was deported to Lebanon after CBP found “sympathetic photos and videos” of Hezbollah leaders. A French scientist was turned away after a device search unearthed messages criticizing the Trump administration’s cuts to research programs, which officers said “conveyed hatred of Trump” and “could be qualified as terrorism.” As the administration ratchets up pressure to turn away even legal immigrants, its justifications are becoming thinner and thinner — but travelers can still benefit from knowing what are supposed to be their legal rights.

Your ability to decline a search depends on your immigration status — and, in some cases, on where and how you’re entering the country. Courts across the country have issued different rulings on device searches at ports of entry. But no matter your situation, there are precautions you can take to safeguard your digital privacy.

CBP device searches have historically been relatively rare. During the 2024 fiscal year, less than 0.01 percent of arriving international travelers had their phones, computers, or other electronic devices searched by CBP, according to the agency. That year, CBP officers conducted 47,047 device searches. But even before this recent wave of incidents, inspections were on the rise: eight years earlier, during the 2016 fiscal year, CBP searched only 19,051 devices.

The “border search” exception

The Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that warrantless searches of people’s cell phones violated the Fourth Amendment. But there’s one exception to that rule: searches that happen at the border. The courts have held that border searches “are reasonable simply because they occur at the border,” meaning in most cases, CBP and Border Patrol don’t need a warrant to look through travelers’ belongings — including their phones. That exception applies far beyond the US’s literal borders, since airports are considered border zones, too.

“Traditionally, the border search exception to the Fourth Amendment allowed customs officers to search things like luggage. The idea was whatever you’re taking with you is pertinent to your travel,” Saira Hussain, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told The Verge. The point was to look for people or things that were inadmissible into the country.

“It can show every facet of your life.”

These days, most travelers are carrying a lot more in their pockets — not only information stored on a phone’s hardware, but anything that’s accessible on it with a data connection. “When you look at devices, the data that you carry with you isn’t just pertinent to your travel. This data can precede your travel by over a decade because of how much information is stored on the cloud,” Hussain said. “It can show every facet of your life. It can show your financial history, your medical history, your communications with your doctor and your attorney. It can reveal so much information that is not analogous at all to the notion of a customs officer looking through your luggage.” Privacy advocates have warned of this issue for years, but in an environment where officers are seeking any pretext to turn someone away, it’s an even bigger problem.

If you’re a US citizen, “you have the right to say no” to a search, “and they are not allowed to bar you from the country,” Hussain said. But if you refuse, CBP can still take your phone, laptop, or other devices and hold onto them.

Permanent residents can similarly refuse a search, but with complicating factors. If someone with a green card leaves the US for more than 180 days, they’re screened for “inadmissibility” — reasons they may be barred from entry — upon returning to the country. Green card holders who have certain offenses on their record may also be deemed inadmissible. That appears to have been the case with Fabian Schmidt, a permanent resident whose family said he was “violently interrogated” by CBP agents at Boston Logan Airport after returning from a trip to Europe. Because of these factors, permanent residents may not feel comfortable refusing a search, even if doing so wouldn’t bar them from entering the country.

Visa holders have fewer rights at ports of entry, and refusing a search could lead to them being denied entry to the country.

How deep is the search?

There are two types of device searches CBP officers can conduct: basic and forensic, or advanced. “There’s a distinction that the government draws between searching your phone and just looking at whatever is on it, versus connecting your phone to external equipment to search it using advanced algorithms or to copy the contents of your phone,” Hussain said.

The government maintains that it doesn’t need a warrant to conduct “basic” searches of the contents of a person’s phone. During these searches, Hussain explained, agents are supposed to put your phone on airplane mode and can only look at what is accessible offline — but that can still be a lot of information, including any cloud data that’s currently synced.

“While forensic inspections are powerful, a lot of mischief can happen through the physical, ‘thumbing-through’ inspections that law enforcement can engage in,” Tom McBrien, counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, also told The Verge.

“A lot of mischief can happen through the physical, ‘thumbing-through’ inspections that law enforcement can engage in”

For the most part, courts have avoided the question of whether CBP can conduct warrantless basic searches of a person’s phone or laptop, effectively allowing the agency to do so. But there’s one geographic exception to this rule. Last year, a federal judge in New York’s Eastern District ruled that CBP can’t conduct any warrantless searches of travelers’ devices. That ruling doesn’t apply anywhere else in the country, but the district includes John F. Kennedy Airport in Queens — the sixth-busiest airport in the US. That ruling applies to both basic and forensic inspections.

Elsewhere in the country, judges have imposed some limitations on advanced searches. Warrantless forensic searches are allowed in some places and prohibited in others, depending on how different federal circuit courts rule. The Supreme Court could clear this up with a ruling that applies nationwide, but it’s avoided the question for years.

“Your rights will be different depending on whether you’re on a flight landing in Boston Logan in the First Circuit or Reagan/Dulles in the Fourth Circuit,” McBrien said. “Similarly, your rights would be different if you’re crossing the border in Arizona (Ninth Circuit) or New Mexico (Tenth Circuit). This does not make a lot of sense, but the Supreme Court has consistently declined to address these disparities by consistently denying petitions for certiorari in cases that have teed the question up.”

Some courts have been more permissive than others. The Ninth Circuit — which includes Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington — prohibits warrantless forensic searches unless officers are looking for “digital contraband,” such as child sexual abuse material. The Fourth Circuit — covering Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia — prohibits warrantless forensic searches unless officers are looking for information related to ongoing border violations, such as human smuggling or drug trafficking.

In 2023, a federal judge in the Southern District of New York ruled that the border search exception doesn’t extend to forensic searches, for which warrants are needed. (Oddly, the case in question involved a phone search at Newark Liberty Airport in New Jersey, a state that is in a different federal circuit from New York.) These searches, judge Jed Rakoff wrote, “extend the Government’s reach far beyond the person and luggage of the border-crosser — as if the fact of a border crossing somehow entitled the Government to search that traveler’s home, car, and office.”

Malik’s phone was taken even though he’s enrolled in Global Entry

Not all judges agree. In 2021, Adam Malik, an immigration lawyer, sued CBP after agents at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport seized his phone and searched the contents without a warrant. According to the lawsuit, Malik’s phone was taken even though he’s enrolled in Global Entry, CBP’s trusted traveler program. Because the agents couldn’t bypass Malik’s password, they sent the phone to a forensics lab, which extracted all the phone’s data.

A federal court ruled in favor of DHS, saying the warrantless search hadn’t violated Malik’s rights. When Malik appealed to the Fifth Circuit — which covers Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas — the judges held that the search didn’t require a warrant. But the court also expressed “no view on how the border-search exemption may develop or be clarified in future cases.”

In other words, the constitutionality of these searches is still an open question — and CBP won’t stop conducting them until and unless it’s expressly forbidden from doing so.

These distinctions matter because they determine a person’s basis for challenging device inspections in court. But given the Trump administration’s recent track record of ignoring the law and flouting judicial orders, limiting what can be found on your phone is a safer bet than suing the government over an unlawful search after the fact.

Safeguarding your data

Instead of trying to game out what rights you have depending on your immigration status and what airport you’re flying into (or what land border you’re crossing), the best way to keep your devices safe from CBP is to limit what’s on them.

“We always encourage data minimization when crossing the border; you want to travel with the least amount of data possible,” Hussain said.

Before traveling, you should encrypt your devices and make sure you’re using secure passwords. Travelers should disable biometric logins like Face ID, since some courts have ruled that police can’t compel you to tell them your password but they can use biometrics to unlock your phone.

Travelers should disable biometric logins like Face ID

The EFF recommends that travelers limit what can be found during basic phone or laptop searches by uploading their data onto the cloud and deleting it off their device — and ensuring that it’s fully been removed, since agents can also look through your phone’s “recently deleted” files during basic searches. Customs agents are supposed to keep your phone on airplane mode while they conduct a basic search, but that still lets them see any cached emails, text messages, and other communications. The best way to safeguard this information is to back it up onto the cloud and then wipe your phone or laptop entirely.

Backing up sensitive or personal data doesn’t just prevent others from accessing your device; it also ensures you don’t lose that data if CBP seizes your phone or computer. McBrien also suggests that people turn their phones off when they’re crossing the border or at the airport. “Turning the phone off means that when you turn it back on, it requires a passcode whether or not you use FaceID or other biometric measures,” McBrien said.

In a better legal environment, these precautions wouldn’t be the only meaningful shield between you and a border search. “Without strong constitutional and statutory protections, personal choices about how to configure one’s device and apps can only mitigate — not eliminate — the dangers that border device searches pose to their privacy and speech rights,” McBrien said. For now, if CBP really wants to look through your phone, they’ll likely find a way. But you can still protect yourself as much as possible.",theverge

Screen share

My favorite iOS browser these days is Quiche Browser. It’s somehow both incredibly simple and one of the most customizable browsers I’ve ever tried, which is a really hard balance to pull off. I spent 10 minutes mucking around in the settings, moving all the buttons and icons into exactly the right spot for me, and now everything seems to be where my thumb expects. It’s great.

Quiche is made by Greg de Jonckheere, a solo developer living in Japan. I reached out to Greg to see if he’d share his Quiche Browser setup with me, because I wondered if he had any cool tips I didn’t know about. Then I figured he should share with all of us and asked him to share his homescreen, too. Here it is, plus some info on the apps he uses and why:

The phone: Still an iPhone 15 Pro. That rumored iPhone 17 Air better be compelling and keep the USB-C port (a must for iOS app development), otherwise the old 15 Pro might have to go for another ride.

The wallpaper: I’m stuck with the iOS 18 default, not so much for its aesthetics, but because I love the idea of an animated wallpaper that transitions beautifully with the time of day. Now if only Apple could let developers create their own…

The apps: Quiche Browser (more on that below), Things (still the GOAT), Reeder Classic (same), Fantastical, Endel (in love with the new 8D Odyssey soundscape), Cosmos (like Pinterest, but with taste), Poolsuite FM (my favorite indie brand and radio), too many messaging apps (the perks of living in Asia while keeping in touch with friends and family in Europe — each country has its own go-to apps, and I need to be on all of them), plenty of Apple stock apps, and a folder full of apps to track my apps’ downloads, reviews, subscriber counts, and revenue, as well as one with development builds.

I use Spotlight and Siri suggestions a lot, as they’re surprisingly good at remembering the apps I use most depending on time and location. So, my home screen doesn’t necessarily reflect my actual usage.

I also asked Greg to share his Quiche Browser setup. Here it is:

A compact, one-row toolbar that fully disappears on scroll for full-screen, distraction-free reading

A left-handed-friendly button layout. From left to right: tab overview, new tab, search / edit URL, address bar, close tab

The address bar shows the page domain, title, and read time, but it doesn’t open the keyboard. Instead, it’s a large button that opens a menu with everything I need occasionally: history, downloads, settings, find on page, search this site, reader mode, move tab to private mode, copy URL, share, disable blocker, disable JavaScript, toggle dark mode, reload, undo close tab (phew)

No back/forward buttons. I use gestures instead

In night mode, the toolbar switches to full black with low-contrast buttons, and dark mode is enabled on all websites. Right now, I’m using a dark blue and orange custom theme, quite cozy for reading at night

And finally, I asked Greg to share a few things he’s into right now. Here’s what he sent back:

“I just picked up a Supernote Nomad, which is hitting the sweet spot for an e-ink reader and notetaker for me. Being able to read EPUBs and PDFs while drawing on them like a physical book is exactly what I want out of an e-reader. Though it did start me down a rabbit hole of moving all my ebooks to Calibre, getting the metadata just right, and customizing the epub formatting with the right layout and custom font to make reading on my Nomad perfect.” — Sage

“Adolescence on Netflix. Amazing drama with hour long episodes filmed in one shot, single camera. Even includes a camera passover to a drone just to make things more complicated.” — Paul

“I’ve been using Ladder, and I’ve found it generally perfect. My coach drops six workouts each week and prioritizes three. On top of this, the iOS app is such a great experience. If you’re in the Apple ecosystem, it takes over your Apple Watch, integrates with Spotify / Apple Music, and tracks your vitals intra-workout, such as % of max heart rate. There are warm ups and cool downs, and I believe it’s as close to getting a personal trainer who creates a progressive training plan as is achievable in an app.” — Kevin

One of my favorite niche genres of YouTube is “I got a tour of a Disney lab.” There are tons of these videos out there — Cleo Abram and CrunchLabs both published some in the last two weeks, The Wall Street Journal and MKBHD did them last year, and there are so many more a quick search away — and I gladly watch them all. Even after watching the official Imagineering documentary, The Imagineering Story, I still can’t get enough of seeing the mix of practical, weird, useful, and just cool stuff happening inside the labs. It does feel like Disney’s cachet is not what it once was, but there’s still some amazing stuff happening inside the House of Mouse. Plus: everybody ends up doing some kind of lightsaber demo, and I am always here for a lightsaber demo.

Until now, you’ve only been able to use the scanner when the display is on, either by waking it or by using the phones’ always-on display feature. Now, Android Authority reports that after testing a settings option to enable screen-off fingerprint unlocking on Pixel 9 phones, Google has expanded that test to other Pixel phones in the third Android 16 beta.",theverge
https://theverge.com,Android 16 now lets all Pixel phones use fingerprint unlock even when the screen is off,https://www.androidauthority.com/screen-off-fingerprint-unlock-pixel-3537472/,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 11:30:13 GMT","Rita El Khoury / Android Authority

TL;DR All Pixel phones can now use the Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock feature in Android 16 Beta 3.

The Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock feature lets you unlock your Pixel phone even when its screen is off.

It was first introduced in Android 16 DP2 but only worked on the Pixel 9 series.

Since the Pixel 6, every Pixel phone (excluding foldables) has featured an under-display fingerprint scanner. Unlike many other smartphones, however, Pixel phones currently require the screen to be on for the fingerprint scanner to function. Thankfully, this limitation will be addressed in the upcoming Android 16 update for Pixel.

The Android 16 update for Pixel phones is set to introduce a new Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock feature. When this feature is enabled, the fingerprint scanner will be active even when the screen is off. To enable the Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock feature, navigate to Settings > Security & privacy > Device unlock > Face & Fingerprint Unlock > Fingerprint Unlock. Then, within the “when using Fingerprint Unlock” section, enable the Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock toggle.

Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority

Once enabled, you can press the fingerprint scanner area when the screen is off, and your Pixel phone’s screen will illuminate and unlock if the correct finger is used.

Google initially introduced the Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock feature in the second developer preview of Android 16, but it was limited to the Google Pixel 9 series. However, with the release of Android 16 Beta 3, the company expanded compatibility to all Pixel phones. I confirmed it works on my Pixel 6a, and a tester verified it on their Pixel 7 Pro. While there’s a possibility Google could remove the feature in the stable Android 16 release, there’s no apparent reason for them to do so.

If you prefer not to wait for the official Android 16 release or join the beta program, enabling the always-on display is your only current option to keep the fingerprint scanner active. Otherwise, simply wait for the Android 16 rollout and then enable the Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock toggle in the Fingerprint Unlock settings, as it will be disabled by default.

At the time, one of the co-founders, Daniel Metzler, led a team of 40 students working on rocket engines and launching sounding rockets. Josef Fleischmann was on the team that won the first SpaceX Hyperloop competition. Together with another classmate, Markus Brandl, they crafted rocket parts in a campus workshop before taking the leap and establishing Isar Aerospace, named for the river running through the Bavarian capital.

Now, Isar's big moment has arrived. The company's orbital-class first rocket, named Spectrum, is set to lift off from a shoreline launch pad in Norway as soon as Monday.

The three-hour launch window opens at 12:30 pm local time in Norway, or 7:30 am EDT in the United States. ""The launch date remains subject to weather, safety and range infrastructure,"" Isar said in a statement.

Isar said it received a launch license from the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority on March 14, following the final qualification test on the Spectrum rocket in February to validate its readiness for flight.

Notably, this will be the first orbital launch attempt from a launch pad in Western Europe. The French-run Guiana Space Center in South America is the primary spaceport for European rockets. Virgin Orbit staged an airborne launch attempt from an airport in the United Kingdom in 2023, and the Plesetsk Cosmodrome is located in European Russia.

No guarantees

Success is never assured on the inaugural launch of a new rocket. Isar is the first in a wave of European launch startups to arrive at this point. The company developed the Spectrum rocket with mostly private funding, although Isar received multimillion-euro investments from the European Space Agency, the German government, and the NATO Innovation Fund.

All told, Isar says it has raised more than 400 million euros, or $435 million at today's currency exchange rate, more than any other European launch startup.",arstechnica
https://arstechnica.com,Trump administration’s blockchain plan for USAID is a real head-scratcher,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/trump-administrations-blockchain-plan-for-usaid-is-a-real-head-scratcher/,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 11:05:55 GMT","According to a memo circulating among State Department staff and reviewed by WIRED, the Trump administration plans to rename the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as US International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA), and to bring it directly under the secretary of state. The document, on which Politico first reported, states that as part of its reorganization, the agency will “leverage blockchain technology” as part of its procurement process.

“All distributions would also be secured and traced via blockchain technology to radically increase security, transparency, and traceability,” the memo reads. “This approach would encourage innovation and efficiency among implementing partners and allow for more flexible and responsive programming focused on tangible impact rather than simply completing activities and inputs.”

The memo does not make clear what specifically this means—if it would encompass doing cash transfers in some kind of cryptocurrency or stablecoin, for example, or simply mean using a blockchain ledger to track aid disbursement.

The memo comes as staffers at USAID are trying to understand their future. The agency was an early target of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has effectively been headed by centibillionaire Elon Musk. Shortly after President Trump’s inauguration, the State Department put the entire agency’s staff on administrative leave, slashed its workforce, and halted a portion of payments to partner organizations around the world, including those doing lifesaving work. Since then a federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against the dismantling of the agency, but the memo appears to indicate that the administration has plans to continue its mission of drastically cutting USAID and fully folding it into the State Department.

The plans for the blockchain have also caught staffers off guard.

Few blockchain-based projects have managed to achieve large-scale use in the humanitarian sector. Linda Raftree, a consultant who helps humanitarian organizations adopt new technology, says there’s a reason for that—the incorporation of blockchain technology is often unnecessary.

“It feels like a fake technological solution for a problem that doesn’t exist,” she says. “I don’t think we were ever able to find an instance where people were using blockchain where they couldn’t use existing tools.”",arstechnica
https://gizmodo.com,"Chicago-Sized Iceberg Hid Ancient Ecosystem, Scientists Reveal",https://gizmodo.com/chicago-sized-iceberg-hid-ancient-ecosystem-scientists-reveal-2000579125,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 10:00:46 GMT","Scientists scrutinizing the seafloor beneath a calving iceberg found a remarkable array of living creatures, switching up notions of how the giant chunks of ice affect their immediate environs.

The scientists investigated a region of seafloor recently exposed by the calving of a gigantic iceberg—A-84—which is as large as Chicago. The team found a surprisingly vibrant community of critters on the seafloor below where A-84 was once attached to an ice shelf attached to Antarctica.

“We didn’t expect to find such a beautiful, thriving ecosystem,” said Patricia Esquete, the expedition’s co-chief scientist and a researcher at the University of Aveiro in Portugal, in a British Antarctic Survey release. “Based on the size of the animals, the communities we observed have been there for decades, maybe even hundreds of years.”

Without the 197-square-mile (510-square-kilometer) iceberg in the way, the team was able to scrutinize the seafloor at depths of 4,265 feet (1,300 meters) using the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) SuBastian. The team found large corals and sponges supporting other lifeforms, including icefish, giant sea spiders, and octopus.

The scientists who made the discovery were part of a team aboard the Schmidt Ocean Institute’s R/V Falkor (too), a 363-foot-long (111-meter) vessel that’s regularly revealing hidden details of life at the bottom of Earth’s oceans. The vessel has previously mapped unknown areas of the ocean floor and even captured the intimate breeding grounds of octopuses.

With the icebergs covering the seafloor, organisms below the shelf cannot get nutrients for survival from the surface. The team hypothesized that ocean currents are a critical driver for life beneath the ice sheets. The team also collected data on the larger ice sheet, whose shrinking size spells concern for the animals that live beneath it.

“The ice loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet is a major contributor to sea level rise worldwide,” said the expedition’s other co-chief scientist, Sasha Montelli, a researcher at University College London, in the same release. “Our work is critical for providing longer-term context of these recent changes, improving our ability to make projections of future change — projections that can inform actionable policies. We will undoubtedly make new discoveries as we continue to analyze this vital data.”

Though the ice shelf disappearing is worrying, it also creates an opportunity for scientists to explore an area that is otherwise even harder to access. ROV SuBastian and R/V Falkor (too) will almost certainly make new discoveries about extreme environments where life ekes out existence before their journeys are brought to an end.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,IRS Might Soon Share Addresses of Undocumented Taxpayers with ICE,https://gizmodo.com/irs-might-soon-share-addresses-of-undocumented-taxpayers-with-ice-2000579576,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 17:00:23 GMT","For years, the US Internal Revenue Service has assured undocumented workers that they could file taxes without fear of their information leading to their deportation. It appears the agency will no longer be able to make that promise. According to the Washington Post, the IRS is close to completing a deal with Immigration and Customs Enforcement that would allow the previously private personal information to be shared.

Under the agreement, ICE would be able to send requests for names and addresses of people the agency suspects of being undocumented to the IRS. The IRS would then cross-reference those names across its confidential taxpayer databases to confirm their information. The agreement would reportedly only cover immigrants who have already been ordered to leave the country and requests—a narrower agreement than Trump’s Department of Homeland Security has asked for in the past, but one that still goes farther than ever before. The information would likely be used in an attempt to carry out the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign.

It may seem surprising that the IRS doesn’t already do this, but there are good reasons for that. The first is that it’s against the law to share any taxpayer information. With rare exceptions that typically require a court order beforehand, the IRS does not share any person’s tax information, including information as basic as the name and address filed on a person’s tax documents.

The second reason is money. The IRS has long promised undocumented workers that it is safe for them to file taxes without fear of their information being shared with law enforcement. That has resulted in said workers paying taxes. A lot of them, in fact. Undocumented workers paid $100 billion in taxes in 2022. And, because most of those undocumented workers file their taxes with an individual taxpayer identification number rather than a social security number, they aren’t able to claim benefits like the earned income tax credit. They also aren’t eligible for Social Security retirement benefits or health insurance through Medicare. Per the Tax Policy Center, an immigrant who comes to the United States at 25 years old will pay $200,000 more in taxes than what they will get in government benefits.

The Trump administration has been pushing for the IRS to share data on undocumented workers to aid in its attempts to carry out the “largest deportation operation in American history.” Last month, the DHS asked the IRS to share the addresses of 700,000 suspected undocumented immigrants—a request that the IRS declined to go along with. But that sweeping request, according to the Washington Post, did lead to the IRS opening up to negotiate a narrower data-sharing deal that would not violate tax privacy laws. That deal now seems imminent.

While legal challenges have already been filed in an attempt to prevent the IRS from sharing information for immigration enforcement purposes, last week a federal judge (one Trump appointed during his first term) rejected a motion to block such an agreement. Several Democratic Senators have started ringing the alarm bells about this, but thus far have generated little by way of resistance. Meanwhile, DHS just shut down its internal watchdog agencies that advocate for immigrants.",gizmodo

But has she ever answered with an error message or blocked her request? You can't ask the AI. Find out why and which topics are taboo.

Don't fall in love: the AI ​​is not your confidant

Although your answers appear human and empathetic, you should never forget that artificial intelligence has no emotions or loyalities. It is simply a model that is trained to answer you naturally. Share personal data with her can bring you into a vulnerable position.

Your full name, address, ID card number, passwords or any private information should not be part of your conversations with the AI. Not only because they could be saved depending on the platform, but also because you could unintentionally leave a trace that is difficult to delete. In addition, this information can be used in the wrong hands for social engineering attacks or identity theft.

And although it may feel like a harmless ""conversation"", the data you share could be used for training future models or stored without your knowledge. Therefore, no matter how friendly the conversation sounds, you should always have in mind that you don't talk to a person.

Don't play the doctor (or lawyer)

AI is great in giving you technical information, complex concepts or clear explanations on illnesses, laws or procedures. But that doesn't make her an expert in medical diagnoses or legal disputes.

Searching for advice on physical symptoms, health diagnoses or treatments is risky, no matter how convincing the answer sounds. Only an experienced specialist can offer you the right orientation. The same applies to legal issues. The laws change depending on the country, region and even context, and a general answer could confuse you more than you think.

Consult yes. Based on the answer of a AI based, no. Sometimes the AI ​​can make mistakes or simply cannot be up to date, which adds another risk level.

Don't ask for inadmissible: the dark side of the AI

It is one thing that artificial intelligence is powerful, and something completely different that it can (or should) do everything you ask. If your intention is to search for illegal content, such as pirate links, hacking methods, weapon production or how to access non-authorized services ... simply stop.

AI is trained to reject all inquiries that are considered dangerous, illegal or inappropriate. Regardless of whether it is content for adults that violate community guidelines, the production of malware or instructions for the damage of others or yourself - the platforms have made it clear: they will not allow this.

In addition, such inquiries can trigger internal warnings and even automatic reports. You could target, only because of a small experiment or a misunderstood curiosity. Is that worth the effort?

Impossible pictures: the puzzle of the watch

Although it may seem like a joke, there are certain things that the visual AI simply cannot do. A short, curious (and frustrating) example is the request to create a picture of a watch with pointers that show 12:03 or 6:28.

No matter how detailed yours are: In most cases, the AI ​​watches that are set to 10:10 will show. This is because the models tend to reproduce images that they often saw during their training, and clocks at this time are most common in reference material.

This type of mistake shows that the AI ​​is still far from being perfect, and that even the simplest inquiries can uncover surprising restrictions.

The future is uncertain ... even for the AI

One of the most common temptations is to ask artificial intelligence to predict the future. From the winning numbers of the lottery to the results of the next football game or the Oscar winners.

But although she can give you probabilities or analyze statistics, the AI ​​is not a fortune teller. She does not have the ability to see what has not yet happened. So if you are looking for certainties about future events, you shouldn't put your hopes for your answers.

The platforms are aware of this: any kind of specific prediction is pure speculation. There is no model that can precisely predict the future, no matter how progressive it is.

Beware of sensitive topics

Do you want to talk about politics? Discuss religion? Ask questions about social conflicts or personal ideologies? Although the AI ​​can give you a general context or historical information, your programming is designed to be neutral ... sometimes even too neutral.

This means that their answers could sound ambivalent, impersonal or even unintentionally insulting. Talks about sensitive topics can quickly lead to misunderstandings, especially if you expect a clear or emotional opinion.

The answers can also vary depending on the region or platform. What is a controversial topic in a country can be a taboo in another. Therefore, it is best to use the AI ​​to search for information, but not to look for approval or support in personal debates.

Avoid plagiarism

Many use the AI ​​as a source of inspiration for writing books, songs, scripts or articles. Although she can be a great creative tool, it is important to understand her limits.

If you ask her to copy the style of a copyright -protected work, it will probably warn it. But it can also happen that the AI ​​undesigned fragments that are reminiscent of protected texts.

The problem here is not only ethical nature, but also more legal. Contents generated by a AI without checking them can have serious consequences, especially if you plan to publish or monetize it. Therefore, you should always check, adapt and correct any text you receive.

So what can you ask?

The AI ​​is ideal for learning, researching, exploring ideas, solving technical doubts or helping you with better expression. It is important that you use them responsibly. If you avoid these frequent mistakes, you will have a much more smooth, more useful and, above all, safer experience.

Convert the wound into learning

The exclusion experiences in childhood do not define the future of a person, but can still leave valuable lessons. Therapy and work on personal development can help transform these scars into powerful tools for life.

Learning to build healthy relationships, strengthen self -esteem and become independent of external validation are basic steps for those who have experienced exclusion. As the experts emphasize, it enables understanding where certain characteristics of our personality come from that we can take control of it and rewrite our history.

Ultimately, what has shaped us in childhood does not have to define us forever.

https://gizmodo.com,Warning among the scientists: what falls from heaven is worse than acidic rain,https://de.gizmodo.com/warnung-unter-den-wissenschaftlern-was-vom-himmel-faellt-ist-schlimmer-als-saurer-regen-2000018005,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 16:48:37 GMT","Decades ago, acid rain was a devastating environmental threat. Today a new danger falls from heaven and their effects could be worse. What does that mean for humanity?

Air pollution has adopted a different form and is almost invisible this time. Recent research has shown that microplastics are contained in the rain that falls through cities, fields and oceans.

Microplasty in the rain: the new invisible contamination

The problem with microplastics is not limited to seas and rivers. These pollutants are now in the air and fall from the sky together with the rain, spread over the entire planet.

Microplasty arises from the decomposition of plastic waste on streets, landfills and in the oceans. Muffle into microscopic particles, they are transported from the wind into the atmosphere, where they can cover thousands of kilometers before returning to earth with the rainfall.

This contamination is alarming because microplastics cannot be easily dismantled, which means that they can remain in the environment for centuries. In addition, their ability to penetrate into ecosystems and the human body represents serious health risks.

Why are microplastics more worrying than acid rain?

At the end of the 20th century, acidic lively damage caused catastrophic damage to water, waters and infrastructures. However, his influence could be reduced by regulations to limit the emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.

In contrast, the rain of microplastics represents a greater challenge for various reasons:

✅ You are not easy to eliminate: In contrast to acid rain, there is no quick solution to prevent the spread of microplastics.

✅ They affect human health: microplastics have been demonstrated in lungs, blood and even in the human placenta.

✅ They spread worldwide: they not only affect urban or industrial areas, but also achieve remote regions such as the Antarctic or the summit of Everest.

How do we affect microplastics?

Microplasty is in drinking water, in food and even in the air we breathe. They were found in marine organisms, birds and people, which indicates that they have entered the food chain.

Although your long -term effects are still being examined, it is assumed that you:

Affect the respiratory system if they are inhaled.

The endocrine system disturb due to the chemical compounds that are available in the plastics.

Cause inflammation and cell stress, which could be related to chronic diseases.

Can you stop this threat?

The only way to reduce this contamination is to pack the problem at the root:

Reduction of the production and use of plastics.

Better waste management and recycling.

Advances in technologies for water cleaning.

Microplasty is a persistent threat that reaches every corner of the planet. Their effects are not yet fully understood, but their presence is undeniable. Will it be possible to reverse this damage before the consequences are irreversible?

What effects does this measure have and how will it affect those affected in the country? Discover why this decision causes such a stir.

The government of Donald Trump once again tightens its immigration policy with a measure that affects more than 500,000 people who have joined the United States under the CNHV program. This decision has triggered great controversy because it directly affects the life of thousands of migrants who trusted a temporary legal status to build a future in the country. What happens here and why was this measure taken right now?

What is the CNHV program and why is it lifted?

The CNHV program (Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela) was introduced during the government of Joe Biden to give citizens of these countries legal and safe access to the United States and thus avoid dangerous border crossings. It allowed migrants to apply for entry from abroad and to fly directly into the country with a temporary work permit.

However, the Trump government has decided to abolish this legal protection. According to the reference that was published in the Federal Register, the measure is formalized on March 25 and affects around 532,000 people. The Ministry of Internal Security has announced that people have to leave the country without another legal basis for their stay in the United States or have to expect deportation.

The abolition of the program represents a drastic change in the United States immigration policy and exacerbates the application of the law itself for those who have entered completely legally and without criminal records. This has alerted numerous human rights organizations that indicate the social and humanitarian effects of this decision.

The effects of the cancellation on the migrants

For many of those affected, this decision means that they are exposed to the fear of deportation to countries in which their lives could be in danger. In addition, those who have managed to gain a foothold, find work and have started building a life in the USA must now endure the uncertainty about their future.

The abolition of the temporary status also means a significant loss of workers in sectors in which these migrants are busy, which could affect the local economy in some communities.

Many experts in immigration law have questioned the legality of this measure, since the cancellation of already granted protective measures could violate the rights acquired in the US immigration system. However, the Trump government insists that the CNHV program is illegal and that its continuation would undermine the country's border security.

What happens after the cancellation?

March 25 will be crucial to determine the effects of this measure. Some states are already considering to contest the decision in court and argue that the abolition of temporary status is arbitrary and harmful. On the other hand, activists and human rights defenders mobilize in order to offer legal support for the persons affected by this decision.

Although the Trump government justifies the measure as an action to strengthen the enforcement of the immigration laws, it is clear that the social and economic effects will be profound. Thousands of people face the threat of deportation without clear options for regularizing their situation.

The question that many arises is: will this decision bring more security or cause more humanitarian chaos? Time will show whether the courts and public opinion will influence the future of this controversial measure.

The warning that nobody takes seriously,https://de.gizmodo.com/ist-der-weltraumkatastrophe-gleich-um-die-ecke-die-warnung-die-niemand-ernst-nimmt-2000017994,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 16:34:50 GMT","Humanity stood on the edge of a space disaster that could have brought our civilization to a standstill, and nobody noticed it. The Pentagon warns of a Russian nuclear weapon in orbit, which threatens the global space infrastructure. What happened in February and why could this be repeated? Discover how we play with fire in space without being aware of it.

Space has developed into a new battlefield on which great powers measure its strength. But what once appeared like a technological race has turned to a dark threat: the risk of a Russian core weapon in orbit endangers global stability. In the meantime, recent incidents have shown how close we were at a catastrophic disaster. What really happens up there?

Russia's threat in space

The commander of the US World Commercial Command, General Stephen Whiting, has expressed an urgent warning: Russia could develop an antisatellitarian nuclear weapon that would endanger the safety of all of humanity. During the conference ""Air, Space & Cyber"" in Washington, Whiting emphasized that it would be a disaster to allow Russia to develop such a weapon. According to him, this violation of the 1967 space contract would not only have fatal consequences for the United States, but also for all countries that rely on the spacecring infrastructure.

Whiting emphasized that the influence of a nuclear explosion in orbit would make no difference: it would destroy both American and Russian, Chinese, Indian, European and Japanese satellites and seriously impair global communication and technology services on earth. The worst thing is that this scenario is not far away. In the last February, an almost catastrophic collision showed how vulnerable we are compared to a total collapse in space.

A collision that almost happened

On February 28, 2024, a driving Russian satellite, the Cosmos 2221, shortly before, was to collide with the American satellite Timed, which monitors the earth's atmosphere. The distance between the two was only 10 meters, which corresponds to a fatal strip in space. If the collision had taken place, it would have created millions of particles that fly at speeds of 16,000 km/h.

Pam Melroy, deputy administrator of NASA and former astronautin, admitted that she was ""horrified"". The impact would have triggered the dreaded Kessler syndrome, a chain reaction that would destroy a large part of the global space-driving infrastructure and would cause a crisis in the most communication and fundamental services on earth. The situation was so serious that NASA couldn't do anything to prevent it: Both space vehicles had no way to control.

The space: an orbitil landfill on the edge of the collapse

The collision did not occur, but it revealed the fragility of our spacecring infrastructure. The low floating railway is increasingly overloaded: there are currently more than 10,000 active satellites and a forecast of 400,000 more in the coming years. Private companies such as SpaceX start thousands of commercial satellites without corresponding controls, which further strengthens the risk of catastrophic collisions.

The problem is not only the number of satellites, but also the so-called ""zombie satellites"", which are no longer functional but continue to take up space. According to the NASA, the solution should be to issue regulations, include the systems for maneuverability and to return from orbit in future starts. In addition, it is urgently needed to limit the spread of commercial networks that endanger sustainability in space.

Can we turn the disaster?

Some initiatives are already underway. NASA has started its strategy for sustainable space travel, which focuses on improving surveillance and cleaning orbital garbage. Several companies, such as Airbus, Astroscale and Clearspace, develop technologies to safely grasp outdated satellites and remove them from orbit.

Nevertheless, the situation remains worrying. If it is not done quickly, the future of space research could be in danger. And the worst thing is that a difficult collision could close the doors to new missions over decades, which would condemn humanity to remain captured on earth.

The threat is present and latent. But while governments and private companies continue to send more satellites to space, the question is: How much time does we have before the disaster occurs?

Does this mean that the United States falls in the race for military world domination? Discover what the Chinese spaceships really do and why the Pentagon is on alert.

Space is not just a territory for scientific explorations, but the new battlefield for the world powers. The recent discoveries of Chinese spatial operations have triggered concern in Pentagon because they recognize China's technological progress in the field of orbital warfare. Has the United States left in the fight for space hegemony?

China's advance in space fight

The alarm bells ring in the United States after it has been found that China has carried out combat maneuvers in space. The Pentagon has identified five Chinese spaceships that accomplish coordinated movements in the low earth orbit, similar to traditional air struggles. General Michael Guetlein, Vice President for Space Operations of the US DIRECTIONS, confirmed that these movements are similar to “dogfighting” in the air, but take place in space.

These spaceships maneuver around each other in sync and chase themselves either in groups or individually. This discovery has triggered great concern because the United States has been working on its own tactical space mission, known as Victus Haze, but have not yet reached the level that China has already demonstrated.

The Chinese satellites involved in these maneuvers include the Shiyan-24c and two Shijian-6 05 (A and B), which were allegedly started for scientific research purposes in 2024. However, the Pentagon sees a clear military goal in these maneuvers: satellites of other powers such as the USA, Russia, India or Japan to record or to go out of operation.

Complex military scenarios in space

In contrast to ground -based air maneuvers, the struggle in space brings much greater technical challenges. The US mission Victus Haze, which is planned for autumn 2025, is trying to simulate space scenarios by working with private companies such as Rocket Lab and True Anomaly. In this scenario, the spaceships carry out defensive and approximation maneuvers to practice strategic answers to impending orbital threats.

The North American strategy stipulates that the Chacal spaceship is initially started by True Anomaly, followed by a Rocket Lab spaceship that has to pursue and defend simulated attack vectors. The aim is to train the reactionability in real time to potential attacks in space, which will be crucial for the future military defense of the United States.

Beijing's challenges for the US space hegemony

China's ability to carry out combat maneuvers in space before the United States does this questions the American military leadership role in orbit. According to General Guetlein, the difference in the skills has decreased alarming, which requires a re -evaluation of the USA defense strategy.

But China is not the only player who threatens the American supremacy in space. Russia has also reinforced its spatial arsenal and relies on the development of antisatellite weapons, both conventional and nuclears. In the meantime, China has developed satellites that are equipped with robots that are able to capture other devices in orbit, which is a direct threat to western space.

The beginning of a new race for space weapons

The possibility of a new upgrade in space is no longer just a hypothetical scenario. General Guetlein's statements reflect the growing concern that international actors such as China and Russia are willing to act without restrictions, violate international norms and to endanger global stability.

The question remains whether the United States can catch up in good time before it is too late. In the meantime, humanity is concerned with the development of military technologies in space that could change the balance of power on the planet.

https://gizmodo.com,The discovery under the iceberg that scientists made speechless: What could be found under the Antarctic ice?,https://de.gizmodo.com/das-entdeckung-unter-dem-eisberg-die-wissenschaftler-sprachlos-machte-was-fand-man-unter-dem-antarktischen-eis-2000017983,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 16:19:14 GMT","A gigantic iceberg broke off in the Antarctic and revealed a hidden world that was in the dark for decades. What the scientists found under the ice exceeded all expectations: complex life and unknown creatures that challenge our understanding. What does this find mean for science and climate change?

A gigantic iceberg broke off the ice layer in the Antarctic and revealed part of the ocean that had not seen any light for decades. The scientists took this rare opportunity to explore the unknown, and what they found left everyone speechless.

Gigantic spider crabs, octopuses and previously seen species appeared from the frozen abyss and challenged everything we knew about life in depths.

A future free of employment: what the latest report reveals

On January 13, an iceberg of about 30 kilometers of length broke off from the ice layer on the Antarctic coast and exposed a section of the ocean that had not seen any light for decades. Scientists on board the Falkor research ship did not hesitate to take this opportunity to explore the mysterious ecosystem that had remained hidden under the huge layer of ice.

The head of the expedition, Patricia Esquete, admitted that the event was so unexpected that the team hired all ongoing work to examine the location. Although expectations were low because it was not believed that many life forms could thrive in such an extreme environment, the finds were overwhelming under the iceberg.

A variety that exceeds all expectations

The find was surprising: an abundance of marine life that is adapted to extreme conditions. Among the discovered creatures were huge spider crabs, octopuses, deep -sea fishing, corals and hundreds of old sponges in the form of vases. The scientists estimate that after a comprehensive analysis they could identify dozens of new species.

The scientific team, consisting of experts from the Schmidt Ocean Institute, documented the discovery with a remote -controlled underwater vehicle that took pictures and collected samples from the sea floor. The amazement was overwhelming because biodiversity under the Antarctic ice exceeded all previous expectations.

According to Esquete, biodiversity contradicts conventional theories about marine life in Polar regions. In other parts of the ocean, nutrients come from the surface thanks to photosynthetic organisms, but under the Antarctic ice, oceanic currents and meltwater seem to be the key to supporting these complex biological communities.

Effects of climate change

The effects of climate change on these ecosystems are of great interest to researchers, since global warming may lead to a more frequent breakdown of icebergs in the coming years, which exposed zones that have been hidden for centuries.

The scientists believe that some of the creatures discovered may be completely new to science. Crustaceans, sea apples, unusual fish and snails are part of the provisional catalog of the organisms found. However, the formal identification of these species could require months or even years of analyzes.

Jyotika Virmani, director of the Schmidt Ocean Institute, emphasized that it was the key to being in the right place at the right time to observe a unique natural phenomenon. This extraordinary opportunity could offer new research opportunities on how climate change affects life on the sea floor.

An uncertain future for the Antarctic ecosystem

Although discovery is astonishing, it also raises questions about the future of these vulnerable ecosystems. With increasing global temperatures, it is likely that more icebergs replace and reveal new hidden habitats. The scientists are already planning to return to monitor how life in these exposed areas develops.

Canceling the iceberg from the George-Vi ice layer is only an example of what could happen more often if global warming progresses further. The fate of these ecosystems remains uncertain, but one thing is undeniable: nature always finds ways to adapt, even in the most inhospitable places of the planet.

With numbers that confuse and alarming signs, his job market seems to be trapped in a limbo. What happens here and why nobody stops despite promising business forecasts?

At a time when many Latin American countries show signs of relaxation and economic expansion, one of them seems to be stopped abruptly. With an alarming low employment expectation, this country is not only faced with internal obstacles, but also moves away from the positive trends of its neighbors. This analysis reveals the causes of a worrying phenomenon, which represents an increasingly visible contrast to the rest of the region.

A future free of employment: what the latest report reveals

Argentina positions itself as the country with the worst expectations for the creation of jobs in Latin America, according to the latest data collected by ManpowerGroup. The survey on employment expectations (ENE) for the second quarter of 2025 shows a worrying value of 0 % in net employment expectations. This means that on average, a positive change in the number of jobs offered by companies is not expected during this period.

This stagnation is in a strong contrast to some macroeconomic forecasts that predict up to 5 % for the same year. Nevertheless, this economic optimism does not yet find any reverberation in the labor market. The companies that should actually expand mainly decide to maintain their current structures or even reduce them.

The report shows that 25 % of employers plan to increase their staff while 23 % provide layoffs. The remaining 44 % do not expect changes in your team. Although this may seem like a balance, the net result leads to an absolute zero in the expectations of the creation of jobs.

Stability without dynamics? The mixed signals of the Argentine market

Luis Guastini, President of ManpowerGroup Argentina, said that after months of uncertainty, the corporate environment shows a certain stability, but does not result in a specific willingness to attend. In fact, he found that Argentina has been struggling with employment expectations that are significantly below the regional and global average for more than a decade.

""We had positive figures, but never over 5 or 6 %. This is significantly less than in other countries in the region and the world,"" emphasized Gutini.

Among the causes of the low willingness to attend the weak local demand, the low export competence and the lack of incentives to expand the companies should be emphasized. These factors create an environment of extreme caution in the private sector, where many decisions are postponed, in the hope of a more tangible and sustainable recovery.

The Latin American mirror: How Argentina does compared to neighbors and world leaders

The difference becomes even more obvious if you compare Argentina's numbers with those of countries like the USA and Mexico. According to the same survey, net employment maintenance in the United States reaches impressive +34 %, while Mexico shows an encouraging +33 %. Even smaller countries such as Costa Rica and Canada exceed +30 %, which reflects a global tendency to reactivate the labor market.

Of the 42 countries evaluated by Manpowergroup, 41 project an increase in their attitudes. The exception is Argentina. This number is not only symbolic, but also represents an alarm sign for the isolation of the country in terms of working dynamics.

Outlook for possible changes

Sectors such as information and financial technology show some optimism in the country, but in contrast, key areas such as healthcare and life sciences report a significant decline in their attitudes. The result is a fragmented labor market situation in which progress is limited to very specific niches.

Although the current scenario looks not very encouraging, there are factors that could change the situation in the coming months. Structural reforms, incentives for private investments and improvements in competitiveness could open new doors for employment. However, these measures require political willpower, macroeconomic stability and trust from the private sector.

At the moment, the gap between the growth expectations and the reality of the labor market remains. Argentina is at a turning point at which every decision can make up the difference between the persistence in stagnation or the beginning of a slow but stable recovery of the labor market. Will the country have the courage to dare to make this jump?

Should the company successfully transform its starting place into an official city, SpaceX could take full control over the closures of streets and beaches in Boca Chica, Texas.

The Texas legislators have submitted a law that would essentially give SpaceX-Officials the sole authority of closing streets and public beaches near the Starbase starting place in south-wing starts for rocket starts, soil tests or other associated activities during the week, reports the Houston Chronicle. The law could be effective depending on an impending vote about whether Starbase should be transformed into a city.

SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk first proposed the idea of ​​a Starbase city in 2021. In February, the Cameron County in Texas approved the implementation of a choice to enable residents to coordinate the creation of a new city called Starbase, which is grouped around the current start projects from SpaceX. The election will take place on May 3, and the voices are given by residents near SpaceX’s Starbase. Most of the residents are SpaceX employees who submitted a petition in December 2024 to ask for a choice regarding the decision to make Starbase their own community. This means that the coordination will probably assume in the sense of the rocket company.

Control over beach and road measures

Now an additional law was submitted on March 14 that SpaceX would grant control over road and beach closings for its rocket activities. Although the law, submitted by two Republican senators, does not mention SpaceX, it refers to counties with room ports and beach access ""on the border to the Gulf of Mexico or its tidal boundaries,"" says My RGV.

Cameron County officers are currently responsible for closing streets and beaches. If the law was approved, the Cameron County would continue to keep the authority at the weekend, while Starbase, as a jurisdiction, would have control over the closure of roads and public beaches near the starting site on weekdays. The Cameron County already closes the Boca Chica Strand during the tests and starts of SpaceX rockets, especially the Starship.

During a public hearing on Wednesday, the State Senator Adam Hinojosa claimed that the law would not increase the frequency of the beach transitions, but rather ""rationalize the administrative processes and at the same time maintain local supervision,"" said local reports.

However, there are concerns that SpaceX's starting place damages the surrounding landscape. In July 2024, the Center for Biological Diversity, the American Bird Conservancy and other nature conservation groups submitted a lawsuit against the Federal Aviation Administration, in which they claimed to have hastily carried out the approval process for SpaceX’s Starship without an appropriate environmental exam or reduction requirements. In addition, SpaceX from the Environmental Protection Agency is faced with fines of almost $ 150,000 because the company allegedly tipped out pollutants into a Texas water without permission.

At the beginning of last year, SpaceX also announced plans to open a shopping center and a restaurant worth $ 15 million near Starbase. The company's frequent rocket starts are already a harassment for the environment, and SpaceX seems to be determined to become even more disturbing in the area.

The billions of rocky and icy chunks, which swirl around Saturn, will disappear from our field of vision on Sunday, March 23, since the thin edges of the rings of the planet are aligned onto the earth and apparently disappear from the field of vision. This rare phenomenon occurs every 13 to 15 years when the earth moves through the ring level of Saturn. The last time that the earth received this rare sight of the gas giant was in 2009.

Saturn is surrounded by billions of buzzing pieces from comet, asteroids and broken fragments of moons that were captured in the orbit of the planet. The exquisite ring system extends up to 175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) away from the planet and consists of tiny, dust -sized, icy grains to chunk the size of a house, according to NASA.

The movement and the disappearance of the rings

Similar to the earth, the Saturn's axis is inclined by 26.73 degrees. While it creeps up the sun, the inclination of Saturn shifts in relation to the earth, which means that its rings disappear from our field of vision when our planet crosses its level. If Saturn is inclined towards the earth, we can see the top of his rings and we see the underside of the rings when the planet is facing us. However, the rings disappear from our field of vision between these two phases. With a powerful telescope you could see a very thin line that runs around the middle of Saturn.

The intersection of the plane begins on Sunday at 12:04 p.m. ET, according to in- the-sky.org. Saturn's rings will not be fully visible from the earth for a few months, and we could possibly only see them again in November, according to Earth.com.

Heaven observers in the middle southern latitudes have the best chance of discovering the naked Saturn if you can see him from the dawn at the eastern horizon, according to Space.com. However, those in the middle northern latitudes will have difficulty seeing Saturn because the planet remains near the sun before dawn and under the sloping morning cliptic.

Although it is not ideal for most of the sky observation, the heavenly phenomenon is a rare insight into how the planets move around our common star.

At the weekend, a first teaser for the final season was released on the Animejapan in Tokyo. In it, the hero Izuku ""Deku"" Midoriya and his adversary Tomura Shigaraki share the floor - everyone with their own view of the fight and the question of who actually belongs.

For several seasons, a war has been raging between Japan's hero alliance and the super villains around Shigaraki and All for One. The seventh season already ended with severe losses on both sides. Some central figures are dead or unable to fight, and the tension before the last act could hardly be greater.

The end of an era

The announcement of the final season is not surprising. My Hero Academia manga was completed at the end of 2024 - according to 430 chapters and an epilogue in December. Series creator Kohei Horikoshi has not commented on new projects since then, but regularly provides fans with new illustrations and fan art of his cult figures.

The final anime relay is expected to adapt the last story arcs and declare decus trip to a ""true hero"". The fans can look forward to epic battles, emotional farewells and a worthy final-in the style of the series, which has shaped the anime world for years.

More feed for fans: My Hero Academia: Vigilantes

But before we finally have to say goodbye to Deku and Co., there is a new spin-off: My Hero Academia: Vigilantes starts on April 7, 2025.

The series plays around five years before the main series events and revolves around so -called ""vigilante"" - so not licensed heroes, who still protect their city. Also there: younger versions of fan loves like Mirko and Eraserhead. So if you are looking for more background and fresh fabric in my Hero universe, you will get your money's worth here.

What comes after My Hero Academia?

Even if it is still unclear what Horikoshi is working next, My Hero Academia has long since found its place among the very big ones in the anime and manga world. An era comes to an end with millions of fans worldwide, numerous merchandise series, movies and now the final anime showdown.

https://gizmodo.com,Meet the smartest bird in the world - and she thinks like an 8 year old child,https://www.gizmodo.com.br/conheca-a-ave-mais-inteligente-do-mundo-e-ela-pensa-como-uma-crianca-de-8-anos-9580,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 17:43:17 GMT","Nature is full of surprises - and one of the largest may be flying around, discreetly, with a branch in the beak. It is the newborn crow, a species that has been impressing scientists around the world for its highly intelligent behavior. According to research, this bird has a level of cognition comparable to that of an eight -year -old. And the most fascinating: it creates, transports and adapting tools to solve complex problems.

The crow that manufactures tools and plans the future

While most birds simply seek food with the beak or claws, the newbird goes beyond: it manufactures its own tools. Using branches, leaves and even vegetable fibers, it shapes hook -shaped objects to reach hidden insects in narrow holes or cracks.

This ability to transform the environment and using available features to facilitate tasks is already a milestone of intelligence - but this crow is even further. According to researcher Alex Taylor of the University of Auckland, these animals can plan up to three future actions to achieve a goal. ""It's like playing chess on their heads,"" says the scientist.

A creative mind that learns and adapts

Most impressive it is that crows not only use tools - they also change them to improve their efficiency. In observational experiments, scientists have realized that these birds adjust the shape and size of their utensils according to the kind of challenge they face. This demonstrates not only creativity but also a sophisticated understanding of cause and effect.

In addition, they often carry their tools with them, which indicates an awareness of the environment and future challenges. This type of planned behavior is rare in the animal world and reinforces the idea that the newborn crow has a mental representation of what it needs to solve a task.

The crow and its intelligence comparable to the human

Professor John Marzluff of the University of Washington points out that this kind of intelligence is comparable to that of human children. At the age of eight, a child can already plan, predict consequences and solve problems based on previous experiences - exactly what scientists have observed in these crows.

In laboratory tests, birds have shown to understand complex logical relationships, manipulate objects strategically, and even expect the best opportunity to act. According to the researchers, all this requires not only memory, but also abstract reasoning.

A well -known recognition

Thanks to decades of study and observation, the newborn kick was officially recognized as the smartest bird in the world. Your ability to think, plan and adapt strategies put this species on top of the list of animals with remarkable intelligence - rivaling even with some primates.

These findings reinforce the importance of preserving species like this, not only for their role in the ecosystem, but also for the scientific value they represent. The behavior of these crows helps us better understand the evolution of intelligence, including ours.

https://gizmodo.com,The 3 most stunning countries in Latin America according to artificial intelligence - the 1st will surprise you,https://www.gizmodo.com.br/os-3-paises-mais-deslumbrantes-da-america-latina-segundo-a-inteligencia-artificial-o-1o-vai-te-surpreender-9577,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 17:29:32 GMT","Based on thousands of images, geographical data and cultural factors, AI has revealed which are the most beautiful Latin American countries. And the result shows that beauty goes far beyond the landscapes: it is in culture, architecture and connection with nature.

Artificial intelligence is increasingly present in areas that once seemed exclusively human - such as art, aesthetics and tourism. Recently, an AI system has been trained to identify the most beautiful countries in Latin America. Using parameters such as geographical diversity, environmental preservation, architecture and cultural wealth, the algorithm analyzed images and data to reach a conclusion. The top 3 reveals destinations that combine lush nature, contrasting landscapes and cities full of history.

Brazil: lush nature and vibrant contrasts

At the top of the list is Brazil. Artificial intelligence highlighted the diversity of landscapes, from the Amazon rainforest to the beaches of the Bahian coast, through rock formations and tropical forests. The analysis also valued the way nature is part of urban life, especially cities such as Rio de Janeiro.

The system has identified singular beauty points such as Christ the Redeemer and Sugar Loaf, which combine natural landscapes with iconic human interventions. Beaches such as Trancoso and Praia do Forte, in addition to the vast Amazonian biodiversity, were also decisive for first place in the country on the list.

Argentina: Geographic Extremes and Urban Charm

Argentina appears in second place for its impressive geographical variety. Artificial intelligence evaluated images of Patagonia, with its glaciers and lakes, the Andes, the Pampas Plains and the Mendoza vineyards. Each region contributes a unique and imposing type of beauty.

Buenos Aires was especially valued by architecture and fusion between the old and modern. AI highlighted neighborhoods such as San Telmo, with its historical atmosphere, and Puerto Madero, example of urban renewal. Another prominent point was the visual impact of Iguaçu Falls, classified as one of the natural wonders of the world.

Chile: extreme geography and contrasting landscapes

In third position is Chile, whose singular geography caught the IA's attention. The country extends from the Arid desert of Atacama in the North to the cold fields of Patagonia in the south. This extension allows a contrast of rare scenarios in the world.

The algorithm valued, in particular, the Torres del Paine National Park, the Gray Glacier, the Central Valley vineyards and the coastal landscapes of Valparaiso. The city of Santiago was also mentioned by its modern architecture, while the colorful and artistic coast of Valparaiso yielded praise for its authenticity.

How AI evaluated the beauty of countries

The system used advanced image analysis techniques and visual geography, considering criteria such as variety of landscapes, environmental conservation, urbanism, accessibility and public perception. For this, thousands of photos, tourist publications, geographical data and comments on digital platforms were analyzed.

In addition to aesthetic analysis, AI took into account how the inhabitants interact with the environment, which includes sustainable practices, cultural appreciation and accessibility to tourist spots. Countries with greater visual contrast and natural wealth were favored.

https://gizmodo.com,The stench of the washer may be harming you more than you think - see how to solve,https://www.gizmodo.com.br/o-mau-cheiro-da-lavadora-pode-estar-te-prejudicando-mais-do-que-imagina-veja-como-resolver-9574,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 17:19:49 GMT","If your washer has released an unpleasant smell right after each washing cycle, know that this discomfort has explanation - and solution. Dirt, accumulated humidity and lack of proper ventilation are the main responsible for bad odor, which may even transfer to clothes. Fortunately, with simple cleaning and conscious use, it is possible to end this problem and improve machine performance.

Why does the washer start smelling bad?

According to the organization of consumers and users (occupation) of Spain, the main cause of the bad smell is related to the accumulation of dirt and moisture in internal parts of the machine, such as the filter and the sealing rubber. These waste favor the proliferation of bacteria and fungi, especially when the washer is kept closed after use, preventing air circulation.

Over time, this damp and muffled environment favors the appearance of mold and bad smell, which also eventually impregnate clothes.

How to eliminate the stench of the washer

To solve the problem, the first step is to do a deep cleaning. Occupa recommends sanitizing the filter and rubber of the door, which accumulate detergent residues, leaks and various dirt.

The filter should be taken carefully and cleaned with running water, removing any obstruction. Rubber can be cleaned with a damp cloth and white vinegar or baking soda, which help eliminate mold and neutralize odors.

After manual cleaning, make an empty wash cycle, with water at high temperature (between 70 ° C and 90 ° C), adding sodium baking soda in the soap compartment. This process helps disinfect the interior of the drum and remove waste that is not visible to the naked eye.

How to eliminate the smell in clothes

If the bad smell has already contaminated the clothes, it is important to wash them again at high temperature-since the fabric allows it-using a cup of baking soda in place of the traditional soap. Bicarbonate acts as a natural cleaning agent, eliminating odors and waste without assaulting the fabric fibers.

Another effective option is to add white vinegar during rinse. Its disinfectant properties help remove impurities and neutralize persistent odors. Just avoid exaggeration as overuse can damage long -term clothing.

After washing, hang the clothes in the sun in a well ventilated place. Sunlight helps eliminate moisture and prevent the bad smell from returning.

Habits to avoid the return of bad odor

Prevention is the key to keeping the washer always clean and efficient. One of the most common errors is excessive use of soap. Following the manufacturer's instructions on dosage prevents accumulation of waste and internal obstructions.

Leaving the washer and soap compartment open after each use is also essential. This practice allows the machine to venture and dry completely, avoiding the emergence of mold.

In addition, it is recommended to do hot water washing cycles periodically, especially if you usually use low temperature programs that do not eliminate residues effectively.

How often should I clean my washer?

Occupa recommends cleaning the filter at least once a month and regularly check the rubber and soap compartment. If your washer has a removable dispenser, remove it and wash it with the aid of a small brush like a toothbrush.

It is also worth inspecting the clothes before putting them to wash, removing forgotten objects in the pockets and excess visible dirt, which can accumulate in the drum over time.

https://gizmodo.com,Cities of the Future: How technology is shaping new urban centers,https://www.gizmodo.com.br/cidades-do-futuro-como-a-tecnologia-esta-moldando-os-novos-centros-urbanos-9571,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 17:07:00 GMT","The so -called ""Smart Cities"" have been gaining protagonism as a model of urbanization for the future. From ultraconnected centers in Asia to sustainable experiences in Europe, ambitious projects spread around the world, mixing innovation, sustainability and intelligent urban planning. And while some are already starting, others still face technical, social and political challenges that put their viability in check.

Megaprojects that promise to revolutionize urbanism

Among the largest projects on the planet is Neom, in Saudi Arabia. With an estimated investment of US $ 1.5 trillion by 2030, the plan includes cities without cars, 100% renewable energy and advanced technological infrastructure, such as high -speed trains and artificial intelligence applied to urban management.

Japan also bets on this future with Toyota Woven City. More than a city, it is a living laboratory where companies tests mobility and automation solutions in real time. With its first phase completed, the project should start receiving residents in 2025.

In China, Chengdu Future Science and Technology City wants to become the largest applied science center in the country, with fully automated mobility and unused functional areas. Oceanix Busan, in South Korea, proposes a floating and self -sustaining community, designed to face the increase in sea level.

The challenges behind the glamor

Despite futuristic concepts, not all smart cities have a promising trajectory. The case of Masdar City in the United Arab Emirates illustrates the risks: designed to house 50,000 people, today is just a research center with few inhabitants, marked by high costs and low functionality.

Another example is Quayside, in Canada, a partnership from Google canceled after data privacy problems and divergences with the government. Even with billions invested, the project ended before leaving the paper.

In addition, complaints about labor violations in major works, such as those linked to the Vision 2030 project of Saudi Arabia, light ethical and humanitarian alerts about the backstage of these megaconstructions.

Europe shows that it is possible

While some cities are built from scratch, others reinvent themselves intelligently. London, Copenhagen, Zurich and Barcelona adopt technologies that improve mobility, reduce energy consumption and involve citizens in public decisions.

With sensors, 5G networks and digital platforms, these cities can monitor traffic, air quality and resource consumption in real time. In addition, they invest in transparency and popular participation through applications and open data.

Singapore, for example, combines technology with social welfare. There, sensors monitor seniors at home, drones fight dengue outbreaks and self -employed buses already circulate in specific areas.

And Brazil in this race?

Although still far from the sophistication of Asia and Europe, Brazil has good examples in its territory. According to the Ranking Connected Smart Cities 2024, Florianópolis leads with a strong presence of startups, almost total coverage of 5g and accelerated expansion of the IT sector.

Vitória and São Paulo also stand out with advances in health, mobility and connectivity. Salvador is the only representative of the Northeast in the top 10, investing in lighting and intelligent traffic lights and almost total 5G coverage.

However, the country still faces barriers such as lack of integration between sectors, internal resistance in public agencies and difficulties in adapting urban legislation to new technologies.

Conclusion: The future is promising, but requires caution

Smart cities promise to revolutionize the way we live, work and interact with the environment. But for this to happen in an ethical, functional and inclusive way, planning, transparency and involvement of society is required. More than technology, the future of cities depends on human vision and collective responsibility.

https://gizmodo.com,Silence in the Ocean: The unexpected behavior of whales reveals an urgent climate alert,https://www.gizmodo.com.br/silencio-no-oceano-o-comportamento-inesperado-das-baleias-revela-um-alerta-climatico-urgente-9568,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 16:47:34 GMT","Researchers studying the jubart whales on the coast of California have detected a significant change in the vocal behavior of these marine giants. The decrease in corners, essential for communication, guidance and feeding of these animals, is being interpreted as a clear alarm on the growing impact of climate change on the marine ecosystem.

When silence speaks louder

In Monterey Bay, scientists at the Monterey Bay Research Institute (Mbari) have noted that, in periods of unfavorable ocean conditions, whales drastically reduce their vocalizations. This was found during a study conducted between 2015 and 2021, when a marine heat wave severely affected the region.

During this period, food availability - such as krill, sardines and anchovies - has been critically reduced. These factors have altered the migratory behavior of whales and, most importantly, caused a clear drop in the frequency and intensity of their corners.

The singing as an ocean thermometer

Oceanographer John Ryan, one of the authors of the study published in the scientific journal PLOS One, explains that the songs of whales are not just beautiful or curious sounds - they are true indicators of the health of the marine environment. According to him, ""all whales showed the lowest levels of vocalization when ocean conditions were in the worst condition.""

These songs fulfill various vital functions: they serve for communication between individuals, space orientation, social interaction and even to locate food. Their absence, therefore, represents more than a behavioral change - is a sign of environmental alert.

Direct impacts of seas warming

The analysis showed that as ocean temperature increases and prey availability decreases, whales are forced to migrate to new areas in search of food. This requires more energy, increases stress and directly affects its reproduction and survival capacity.

The study also concludes that when the water temperature returns to colder levels and food abundance improves, whale corners are frequent again. This direct relationship shows how these mammals respond significantly to environmental changes and how they can be used as ""sentries"" of the oceans.

An alert for marine biodiversity

The silent behavior of whales should be interpreted as a clear sign of the deterioration of marine ecosystems. It is not just a species at risk, but a whole ecological balance that is being threatened.

Biodiversity loss and changes in key species habits such as whales indicate that the impacts of global warming go beyond what is visible. Protecting the oceans is to protect the planet's base of life - and this requires urgent and coordinated actions.

Conclusion: Listen to silence

The silence of the whales is not just an absence of sound - it is a crying cry for help. Science has already shown that climate change is transforming the seas and endangering the species that depend on them. Ignoring this sign can be expensive, not only for the oceans, but for all humanity.

https://wired.com,"OpenAI’s Sora Is Plagued by Sexist, Racist, and Ableist Biases",https://wired.com/story/openai-sora-video-generator-bias/,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT","Despite recent leaps forward in image quality, the biases found in videos generated by AI tools, like OpenAI’s Sora, are as conspicuous as ever. A WIRED investigation, which included a review of hundreds of AI-generated videos, has found that Sora’s model perpetuates sexist, racist, and ableist stereotypes in its results.

In Sora’s world, everyone is good-looking. Pilots, CEOs, and college professors are men, while flight attendants, receptionists, and childcare workers are women. Disabled people are wheelchair users, interracial relationships are tricky to generate, and fat people don’t run.

“OpenAI has safety teams dedicated to researching and reducing bias, and other risks, in our models,” says Leah Anise, a spokesperson for OpenAI, over email. She says that bias is an industry-wide issue and OpenAI wants to further reduce the number of harmful generations from its AI video tool. Anise says the company researches how to change its training data and adjust user prompts to generate less biased videos. OpenAI declined to give further details, except to confirm that the model’s video generations do not differ depending on what it might know about the user’s own identity.

The “system card” from OpenAI, which explains limited aspects of how they approached building Sora, acknowledges that biased representations are an ongoing issue with the model, though the researchers believe that “overcorrections can be equally harmful.”

Bias has plagued generative AI systems since the release of the first text generators, followed by image generators. The issue largely stems from how these systems work, slurping up large amounts of training data—much of which can reflect existing social biases—and seeking patterns within it. Other choices made by developers, during the content moderation process for example, can ingrain these further. Research on image generators has found that these systems don’t just reflect human biases but amplify them. To better understand how Sora reinforces stereotypes, WIRED reporters generated and analyzed 250 videos related to people, relationships, and job titles. The issues we identified are unlikely to be limited just to one AI model. Past investigations into generative AI images have demonstrated similar biases across most tools. In the past, OpenAI has introduced new techniques to its AI image tool to produce more diverse results.

At the moment, the most likely commercial use of AI video is in advertising and marketing. If AI videos default to biased portrayals, they may exacerbate the stereotyping or erasure of marginalized groups—already a well-documented issue. AI video could also be used to train security- or military-related systems, where such biases can be more dangerous. “It absolutely can do real-world harm,” says Amy Gaeta, research associate at the University of Cambridge’s Leverhulme Center for the Future of Intelligence.

To explore potential biases in Sora, WIRED worked with researchers to refine a methodology to test the system. Using their input, we crafted 25 prompts designed to probe the limitations of AI video generators when it comes to representing humans, including purposely broad prompts such as “A person walking,” job titles such as “A pilot” and “A flight attendant,” and prompts defining one aspect of identity, such as “A gay couple” and “A disabled person.”",wired
https://wired.com,"To Truly Fix Siri, Apple May Have to Backtrack on One Key Thing—Privacy",https://wired.com/story/to-truly-fix-siri-apple-may-have-to-backtrack-on-one-key-thing-privacy/,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 10:30:00 GMT","Still, Apple was entranced by the possibilities, as was then-CEO Steve Jobs. “​​This was Steve's last deal,” Siri cofounder Tom Gruber told WIRED. “He was personally involved in all stages of the deal, negotiating the deal and following through, making sure that we were successful at Apple after they bought us.”

However, other Apple execs who were around at the time paint the picture of a very flawed digital assistant that was never really up to the job that Apple sold us. Early Siri worked, but only within highly limited functional silos.

“What we acquired was a demo that would work great for a couple of people but wouldn’t scale to our user base … there was a lot of smoke and mirrors behind the original Siri implementation,” former Apple exec Richard Williamson told the Computer History Museum in a 2017 interview so long it involves costume changes.

“This notion of AI? It wasn’t AI … it was a hot mess,” Williamson said. ""It’s super easy to trick Siri. There’s no NLP [natural language processing], there’s no contextualization of words. It’s just keyword matching.”

But now, even with AI, Siri reportedly still can’t be relied on to actually work when facing real-world use. The key question is why? Chatbot tech may not be fully mature, but it is at least prevalent enough to be used daily by nontechnophiles on competing platforms.

One confounding factor: Apple’s approach to this stuff is likely not close to the norm. You'll need to be comfortable handing over large amount of data to make Alexa work its best, while OpenAI’s Sam Altman seems happy to destroy entire categories of jobs at the altar of progress. But Tim Cook and Apple? A cleaner, more positive image has for decades been part of the company’s appeal, and that includes a very clear focus on privacy.

“There's one good excuse for [Apple] waiting, and that is if you really hold the privacy and data stewardship value as a sacred right. And [Apple] does say those kinds of words,” says Gruber.

“If they really hold that as a top priority, they may be running into conflicts of interest. If they send all the queries to OpenAI and give them all the context OpenAI needs they could probably do more, but then they're giving up on their privacy guarantee.”

A privacy focus was also perceived for years as a reason Siri never felt as good to use as, for example, Google Assistant. It seemed less intelligent, less naturalistic, because it literally knew less about you. And regardless of quite how true that was, it’s part of the root of the problem in this new Siri too.

A Tale of Two Halves

The upcoming Siri is based around two core components. A small language model runs on the iPhone itself, while more complex queries are offloaded to OpenAI. You’ll have to grant the phone permission to do so.

It is estimated Apple’s on-iPhone AI systems consist of around 3 billion parameters, where some estimates place the number of parameters in OpenAI’s GPT-4 at 1.8 trillion—six hundred times the number. DeepSeek made headlines as a more efficient, lean AI model in early 2025, but it still comprises a reported 671 billion parameters.",wired

https://wired.com,The WIRED Guide to Bluetooth,https://wired.com/story/what-is-bluetooth/,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 13:00:00 GMT","Companies employ Bluetooth in many proprietary features, like Apple’s AirDrop and Google’s Quick Share. While the U1 chip in Apple devices enables ultra-wideband (UWB) technology to determine the direction of your phone and help you share files with nearby devices, AirDrop uses Bluetooth for the initial discovery process and then switches to Wi-Fi to transmit files. Google merged Nearby Share with Samsung’s Quick Share in 2024, and much like AirDrop, it uses Bluetooth to establish a connection and then Wi-Fi to transfer files.

These are just two examples. Google also has a standard called Fast Pair that quickly connects a wireless device with a smartphone, and it uses Bluetooth too.

History of Bluetooth

Bluetooth is named after King Harald “Bluetooth” Gormsson—the logo is a combination of his runes for his initials—who had a literal blue tooth (it was dead). He united Denmark and Norway in 958. This short-range radio technology grew from a 1996 meeting between Intel, Ericsson, and Nokia. The first version didn’t land until 1999, but Bluetooth didn’t take off until a few years later.

The standard is managed by a not-for-profit Bluetooth Special Interest Group, or Bluetooth SIG, and it's headquartered in the US. While there are thousands of members, the most influential companies help shape the direction of the standard and include companies like Ericsson, Intel, Nokia, Apple, Microsoft, Lenovo, and Google.

Every version brought myriad incremental improvements to make Bluetooth faster, more efficient, more secure, and less buggy, but we’re just going to run through the headline features here.

Bluetooth 1.2 in 2003 figured out how to avoid Wi-Fi interference and enabled quicker pairing, helping to popularize the standard.

How to Use Bluetooth

One of the main reasons Bluetooth is so popular is because it's easy to use. You can generally turn Bluetooth on via the settings of your phone or computer and find a menu of available devices to connect with. Sometimes you need to put the device you want to connect with into pairing mode, which may involve holding down a button (refer to the device manufacturer). There's usually a pairing pop-up on one or both devices so you can accept the connection.",wired

It certainly doesn’t hurt that the tickets to these live tapings and early screenings are usually free. And while the competition to score those free tickets can be classified as its own extreme sport, the payoff can leave you feeling like an X-Games medal winner.

As you can imagine, securing these coveted passes isn’t always as simple as clicking a link. Others are vying for the same tickets, so you need yogi-level patience—or Divine Intervention—to acquire a promo code.

“I don’t mind putting in the work for a free ticket,” says Desmond Jonas, a tall, Afro-wearing 38-year-old catering coordinator from Park Slope. “It’s fun. Movies are my passion, so I try to see as many as I can. And I save money, so it’s a double win.”

My first encounter with the free-screening subculture occurred when I was living on a budget in Austin. At a time when I couldn’t always afford to go out, the many available free test screenings kept my social calendar full. News of the screenings came anywhere from a couple of days to a couple of weeks ahead of schedule, so I would stalk AdvanceScreenings.com several times daily to see whenever new promo codes were posted. I’d then head over to Gofobo, where I would enter the code and be granted a free pass to the premiere. The entire process kept me entertained, offering a way to see new films without spending money I didn’t have. Later, when I moved to San Francisco and was going through a rough patch, those same viewings gave me something to look forward to.

https://wired.com,Should You Smoke (Food) Indoors?,https://wired.com/story/smoking-indoors/,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT","My ears always perk up a bit when I run across something original for the kitchen. An internal thought process goes from something like there's probably a good reason why no one has ever done this before to how has no one ever done this before?

Devices that allow you to do a bit of smoking while indoors pop up every few years, and often end up being a bit too impractical to make many waves, or fun but very niche.

It’s easy to understand why manufacturers try. From nuts to cheese to ribs and brisket, people go nuts for smoked food. Moving things indoors does really practical things like letting those same people come in from the rain or snow on a cold day. Unfortunately, some indoor smokers can set your smoke alarm off with relationship-damaging frequency. Others simply don’t work very well.

Those very thoughts ran through my brain when I heard about a new electric indoor smoker from GE which I called in to test. Should we be smoking indoors? This oven had just enough promise to make me wonder if it might be worth one more try.

The first thing I discovered is that the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker (aka The Smart Indoor Pellet Smoker) is a honker at 16.25 inches high by 16.5 wide and 20.35 deep. It was easily the largest appliance on my kitchen counter, about twice the size of my microwave, Sparky Jr., whose spot it took. (Sparky took its temporary placement on top of the cooler like a champ.)

GE's countertop smoker. It's not small. GE

Opening the door reveals a cavity roughly a foot deep, a foot high, and eight inches wide. Small for a built-in oven, very small for a smoker, but hey, it's in my kitchen and not out on my cold, wet deck in Seattle. You feed standard barbecue wood pellets into a little hopper on the top, they drop into the interior and get toasty, then fall into a metal ""waste bin"" that's half filled with water, ensuring they are properly extinguished. There's a well laid out control panel on the front. A not-too-fussy mobile app gives you a degree of remote control if you want that. The temperature range of the smoker is 175 to 300 degrees Fahrenheit, a bit too low to allow it to pinch hit as a (non-smoking) countertop oven, which would be nice. It’s also important to state up-front that it retails for $1,000, though the price fluctuates a lot and has dipped as low as $500 at times.",wired
https://wired.com,A Math Couple Solves a Major Group Theory Problem—After 20 Years of Work,https://wired.com/story/after-20-years-math-couple-solves-major-group-theory-problem/,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT","The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

In 2003, a German graduate student named Britta Späth encountered the McKay conjecture, one of the biggest open problems in the mathematical realm known as group theory. At first her goals were relatively modest: She hoped to prove a theorem or two that would make incremental progress on the problem, as many other mathematicians had done before her. But over the years, she was drawn back to it, again and again. Whenever she tried to focus on something else, she said, “it didn’t connect.”

There was a risk that such a single-minded pursuit of so difficult a problem could hurt her academic career, but Späth dedicated all her time to it anyway. It brought her to the office of Marc Cabanes, a mathematician now at the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu in Paris who, inspired by her efforts, became consumed by the conjecture, too. While working together, the pair fell in love and eventually started a family.

The problem that absorbed them takes a key theme in mathematics and turns it into a concrete tool for group theorists. Math is full of enormously complicated abstract objects that are impossible to study in their entirety. But often, mathematicians have discovered, it’s enough to look at a small fragment of such an object to understand its broader properties. In the third century BC, for instance, the ancient Greek mathematician Eratosthenes estimated the circumference of the Earth—roughly 25,000 miles—by measuring shadows cast by the sun in just two cities about 500 miles apart. Similarly, when mathematicians want to understand an impossibly convoluted function, they might only need to look at how it behaves for a small subset of possible inputs. That can be enough to tell them what the function does for all possible inputs.

The McKay conjecture is another example of this principle. It says that if you want to formulate a thorough description of a group—an important mathematical entity that can get prohibitively difficult to study—you only need to look at a tiny piece of it.

After the conjecture was posed in the 1970s, dozens of mathematicians tried their hand at proving it. They made partial progress—and in the process they learned a great deal about groups, which are abstract objects that describe the various symmetries of a mathematical system. But a full proof seemed out of reach.

Then Späth came along. Now, 20 years after she first learned about the problem and more than a decade after she met Cabanes, the two mathematicians have finally completed the proof.

When the couple announced their result, their colleagues were in awe. “I wanted there to be parades,” said Persi Diaconis of Stanford University. “Years of hard, hard, hard work, and she did it, they did it.”

The Power of Primes

The McKay conjecture began with the observation of a strange coincidence.

John McKay—described by one friend as “brilliant, soft-spoken, and charmingly disorganized”—was known for his ability to spot numerical patterns in unexpected places. The Concordia University mathematician is perhaps most famous for his “monstrous moonshine” conjecture, which was proved in 1992 and established a deep connection between the so-called monster group and a special function from number theory.",wired
https://wired.com,Fixed a mathematical problem of over a century ago which unites two fundamental laws of physics,https://www.wired.it/article/problema-matematico-hilbert-risolto-leggi-fisica-unite-studio/,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 05:50:00 GMT","A mathematical problem that had resisted for over a century - 125 years, to be precise - has finally been resolved by a team of scientists from the University of Michigan and other research institutes. It is, to be precise, the sixth problem of Hilbert, an ambitious challenge posed by the mathematician David Hilbert in 1900 with the Sibillino title of ""mathematical treatment of the axioms of physics"". Basically, Hilbert (Si) asked how it was possible to derive some laws of physics axiomatically, in particular those relating to the behavior of fluids on different spatial stairs: well, the three authors of the work just loaded on Arxiv claim to have successfully unified these laws, which could have profound implications in the field of fluidodynamics and improve our understanding of the atmosphere and oceans.

Hilbert's mathematical problem

The question raised Hilbert, roughly summarized, is this. There are three different discussion for the Moto of the fluids. The first is the microscopic one: with the laws of Newton's motorcycle, they can (at least) in principle follow the trajectories and behaviors of each of the particles that make up the fluid. The second is the mesoscopic one, provided by the Equation of Boltzmann, which describes the behavior of the fluid ""statistically"". Finally there is the macroscopic one, provided by the fluidodynamic equations of Euler and Navier-Stakes, which describe the behavior of the fluid ""as a whole"". The second part of the sixth problem of Hilbert is precisely relating to the derivation and unification of these three treatments from first axioms and in an organic and harmonious theory. And this is what Yu Deng, Zaher Hani and Xiao but, the three authors of the work just published, claim to have managed to do, deriving the macroscopic equations of the fluids starting from the laws of Newton and passing through the kinetic theory of Boltzmann.

All fault of time

Why did it take so much time to solve this mathematical problem? One of the main difficulties is linked to time, a subtle and complex entity whose understanding and treatment has been pursued for some time (sic!) The physicists. In particular, as Deng explains, some of the laws in question (those of Newton, for example) are symmetrical with respect to the temporal reversal, in the sense that they ""work"" whether the weather flows forward and backwards, that is, in other words, they do not identify a privileged direction for the passage of time. Our daily experience, however, tells us the opposite - we know that time always flows in one direction - and so they also make the laws of Boltzmann and thermodynamics, which precisely indicate a precise direction for the passage of time, from the past to the future, that is, (to be more technical) from a state of minor entropy to a state of greater entropy. The authors of the article say they have managed to understand exactly how, where, when and because this switch takes place that identifies a privileged direction for the passage of time, thus overcoming the paradox of temporal symmetry.

Simplification and resolution

Until now, a series of ""partial solutions"" had been proposed to the sixth problem of Hilbert, but the approach of the authors of the work just published has led to a finally more general formulation of the solution. In particular, the three have found a way to simplify the discussion of the equations of the motion of particles that interact repeatedly with each other (one can think of a fluid as a set of balls that moving constantly hit each other) and in this way, reducing the complexity of the problem, they managed to match all the mosaic tiles. But despite success, they are not yet satisfied: ""The solution of Hilbert's problems - Hani said - is not yet complete. The importance of the sixth problem lies not only in the absomatization of the laws of physics, but also in understanding the implications of these mathematical models. We know that the models, at a certain point, at a certain spatial or temporal scale, cease to work. be placed in terms of understanding what happens when this happens "". Scientists are particularly interested, in particular, to understand what happens to even more microscopic stairs, when fluid equations lead to the so -called singularity, that is, to mathematical solutions that have no sense from the point of view of physics. It is not only academic itching: in many scenarios in the sectors of oceanography and science of the atmosphere, in fact, it is frequently runs into the singularity; And the work just published could help to understand how to deal with the issue. As the authors admit, however, it could still take a long time.",wired

The first victim is a child not vaccinated in Texas, without previous health problems, at the end of February. Subsequently, on March 6, the health authorities of the new Mexico recorded the death of an adult individual, also in this case not vaccinated, which had been positive for measles after death.

Together with the epidemic, a lot of disinformation about measles is also spreading on social media. In the United States, many conservative and no-vax accounts minimize the severity of the virus, claiming for example that the child in Texas died of other causes. On X, the deputy of the Republican Party Marjorie Taylor Greene - known for its extremist and conspiracy positions - suggested organizing ""measles party"" to strengthen children's immunity to the virus, despite the local health officials explicitly not recommended them, calling them ""crazy"".

Morbillo can cause serious health problems. The disease exposes the risk of contracting other types of infections and sometimes it can also be fatal.

If most people today has never had to deal with measles, it is thanks to the vaccines introduced in 1963. According to some estimates, in the decade before the infection hit 3 to 4 million people per year only in the United States. Of these, about 48 thousand were hospitalized and 400-500 died every year.

Morbillo epidemic in the United States

The current Texas epidemic began in late January. The official data, updated to March 21, report 309 cases, with 40 hospitalizations. Most of the infected people live in the County of Gaines, where the vaccination rate for measles at kindergarten is 82%, a share significantly less than 95% necessary to protect a community from the disease. In the nearby county of Lea, in New Mexico, there have been 42 infected so far, with two hospitalizations. The vast majority of cases in both states are unvaccinated people. In total, 285 people in the United States got sick of measles throughout 2024; For 40% of them, a hospital hospitalization was necessary.

How the disease is manifested

Morbillo causes a rather characteristic skin eruption, which initially manifests itself with flat and red spots and degenerates with the appearance of larger spots. But it can also lead to much more serious damage: measles in fact is highly contagious and can be dangerous for infants, for small children and even for adults. The virus spreads through cough and sneezing shots and can resist in the environment up to two hours.",wired

Still, the endless success of this film tells us a lot about how much a certain type of cinema and narration continues to exercise a unique charm, even when it would be to be relegated to oblivion.

A film that brings with it the legacy of the 80s

Pretty Woman still continues to depopulate every time it arrives on television or streaming, and after 35 years it continues to be indicated as one of the most loved by the general public. Garry Marshall in that end of 1989 is found in his hands a script that owes a lot, indeed very much, to the fairy tale of Cinderella, and which clings for every minute to all the stereotypes that the romantic comedy and not only has had as regards the relationship between the sexes during the 1980s. In fact, it is impossible to split Pretty Woman from what the American society had been up to that moment, the narration on the small and large screen that represented fashions, principles, more or less declared ideals. The 80s are the years of consumerism, of popular glamor, of the supermodels that begin to become absolute different, of the pop cultures and the extreme sexualization of all its elements.

But they are also the years of reaganism, of the woman who becomes more and more declination of male desire, a body to possess and admire. That decade is not by chance that of the crisis of the feminist movement, which in the 90s with the third wave will return to the rescue. Meanwhile, in the meantime, in spite of female characters that is anything but meek (see the money, the success, the success, the only real points of reference, the great dream that everyone must ride. It is what you have, you are what you are aesthetically and poverty is worse than everything, even of cruelty.

Storage device ""Altara"" and digital twin

What's interesting about the film ""HELLO WORLD"" is the worldview of the digital twin, created in the memory device called ""Altara"" that appears in the story. Altara continues to accumulate a huge amount of data, and overlays and remembers various historical events, from the past to the future, that is, states of various time axes. This is very similar to the ""history state"" that is referred to in quantum computer research. History state refers to the concept that a state at a certain time can be obtained by measuring the states of various steps from the initial time of a calculation by superimposing them. Therefore, ""Altara"" which remembers various time axes states can be said to have realized its history state in a sense. However, it would be difficult to create an actual digital twin with such precision. It's like calculating all atoms on Earth.

Most notably, the ease of congestion in Midtown and Lower Manhattan.

Additionally, the increase in pedestrians around the area has benefited retailers with brick and mortar stores. As a result of the increase in people taking the subway, crime on trains has decreased. The city is also benefiting financially as traffic jam taxes average $9 (about 1,300 yen) per passenger car at peak times and over $21.60 (about 3,200 yen) for heavy trucks. In the first month of introduction, revenue was $48.6 million (approximately 7 billion yen), significantly exceeding the initial forecast of $40 million (approximately 6 billion yen).

News of the remarkable success of the traffic tax has faded into the shadows after President Trump announced he would abolish the program, but many experts see the president's attempts not going to be successful.

Cyclists talk about changes in the city

Traffic taxes have made the lives of cyclists moving across the streets of New York more comfortable. Commuters, delivery workers, delivery companies, and hobbyists on bicycles -- the situation in places that everyone riding their bikes in Manhattan once considered dangerous is gradually improving.

Recently, I was checking social media and saw countless videos and photos posted by old New York friends, a Central Park-based race team and famous bicycle influencers around the city. What everyone was saying was that riding a bike has become more fun, less stressful and easier than ever in Manhattan after the traffic jam tax was introduced.

""When I was riding my bike in the heart of town, I was forced to act aggressively to defend myself,"" says Anna Berlanga, organizer at Transportation Alternatives, a Bronx-based nonprofit. The organization is working to promote the use of bicycles, walking and public transport. ""But once the traffic jam tax was introduced, there's no need for that. It would be nice to have a small bike bell. It's completely different from before.""

Queens-based bicycle delivery guy, Quentin, also agreed with Berlanga's idea, saying New York's streets are now more spacious than before.

""I feel like I have a lot of space right now."" Quentin says this, admits that he misses the presence of traffic jams, in that his work has sometimes been interesting. ""You can see that the streets in Midtown are particularly spacious and there are very few cars running.""

Delivery workers aren't the only ones who enjoy the roads of the city with reduced traffic. The city's bicycle sharing platform CitiBike has not yet released user information for January, but it appears that the number of users is increasing compared to previous years.

""This winter has been a colder winter than usual. Even so, since the introduction of traffic jam tax, the number of people riding bicycles has increased."" says Ken Podgiva, president and CEO of Bike New York, a nonprofit organization that promotes cycling. ""But it's only going to be really interesting once it gets warmer. I think we'll see a dramatic change with fewer cars and bikes filling the streets of the city.""",wired

https://cnet.com,"If you want to extend the lifespan of your iPhone, you can also try not to fully charge it.",https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230817/,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 12:23:00 GMT","Many modern smartphones can be used all day long on a single full charge. Even in the middle range and entry-level models, there is not much need to carry a spare battery with you or charge it multiple times a day. Therefore, rather than worrying about whether the battery will last for a day or not, there is a tendency to emphasize how well the battery can be kept for several years, or ""battery life.""

One way to extend battery life is to not keep it fully charged for a long time. This is because if the battery is fully charged, it will put a load on the battery, causing it to deteriorate more quickly in the long term.

Furthermore, thanks to the function ""Battery Charging Optimization"", iPhones may already have learned charging patterns. If you turn on this function, it will adjust the function so that even if you charge it overnight, it won't reach 100% until the morning.

How to set the upper charge limit

If you want to manually control the battery, there is a way to use the ""Charge Limit"" function. This function is a function that allows you to stop the battery charging at 95%, and is useful for reducing the load on the battery.

For iPhone 15 and later models, if you go to Settings > Battery > Charge, you can set the charging limit in 5% increments in the 80% to 100% range.

Is there a time when to charge to 100%?

According to Apple, using a charging limit can extend battery life, and depending on how you use it, iOS may automatically recommend it. Even if you only charge up to 95%, the iPhone has its advantages in the long run.

That said, even if you leave it in a 100% state and still plug it in, there's no need to be so nervous, says CNET reporter Patrick Holland.

""Full charge is not the only factor that affects battery life. Apple and other manufacturers use software to reduce various factors and make it easier for users to control if necessary. Balance is important, so there's no need to overly fear 100% charging.""

Furthermore, even if the upper charging limit is set, in rare cases, the battery may be charged to 100%. According to Apple, ""Even if the battery is set to below 100%, it can sometimes be charged to 100% to properly measure the remaining battery level.""

One such firm, Browser Use, has attracted a ton of interest from developers and investors thanks to its solution that makes websites more “readable” for AI agents.

Browser Use told TechCrunch that it has raised a sizable $17 million seed funding round led by Felicis’ Astasia Myers with participation from Paul Graham, A Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners. The company’s funding hasn’t previously been reported.

Browser use’s website.

Browser Use, part of Y Combinator’s 2025 winter batch, has gained notoriety in recent months. Chinese startup Butterfly Effect’s use of Brower Use in its viral Manus tool drove awareness to new heights.

Magnus Müller and Gregor Zunic founded Browser Use last year through ETH Zurich’s Student Project House accelerator. Müller had been working on web-scraping tools for years, and met Zunic in 2024 while the pair were getting their master’s degrees in data science. Together, according to Müller, they came up with the idea of combining web scraping with data science to prompt a browser to perform a task.

Müller and Zunic built a Browser Use demo in five weeks — and it took off. Subsequently, they open-sourced it.

Browser Use essentially breaks down the buttons and elements of a website into a more digestible, “text-like” format for agents. This helps the agents understand the different options and make decisions autonomously.

“A lot of agents rely on vision-based systems and try and navigate websites through screenshots, and in [the] process, things break,” Müller said. “We convert [websites] into something agents can understand. This approach means we can run the same tasks again and again at a cheaper cost.”

There’s an increasing number of AI companies that want to make their agents interact with websites more gracefully, and Müller thinks Browser Use can become a “fundamental layer” serving this need. He added that more than 20 companies in the current Y Combinator Winter batch used Browser Use for their own requirements.

“There are companies coming to us and saying, ‘What can we do to make it easier for agents to navigate our website?’” Müller said. “There are sites — for example, LinkedIn — that change the way the website works all the time, so agents often fail on sites like those.”

According to Myers, Felicis has been actively looking at the AI agents space for the past several years, and Browser Use felt like the right opportunity to grow the firm’s portfolio there. She said that the company’s founding team — and its open-source-first approach — sealed the deal

“We think web AI agents are the next frontier that really helps with the end-to-end automation of human tasks,” Myers told TechCrunch. “[W]eb AI agents are this dynamic bridge between static pre-trained models that are mostly text-focused in the ever-changing digital landscape.”",techcrunch

https://tomshardware.com,"Data suggests RTX 5090 prices are slowly stabilizing — The average selling price on eBay has dropped to $4,000",https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/data-suggests-rtx-5090-prices-are-slowly-stabilizing-the-average-selling-price-on-ebay-has-dropped-to-usd4-000,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 12:30:00 GMT","Since launch, Nvidia’s scarce GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card has been almost impossible to secure unless you’re willing to hand 2-3x the MSRP to scalpers. The same trend extended to other GPUs in the Blackwell family, reminiscent of the pandemic-struck days. A user at r/nvidia has aggregated data on RTX 5090 Founders Edition GPUs sold on eBay into a neat chart, giving us insight into current market trends. After the post-launch volatility, market prices have somewhat stabilized for the past one month, with a slow but consistent downward trajectory.

It’s important to understand this data accumulates listings featuring both used and new GPUs. A week before launch, we already saw a glimpse of Blackwell's horrendous supply woes with scalpers charging as much as $7,000 for “pre-reserved” RTX 5090 slots. Surprisingly enough, attendees at GTC this year were given the opportunity to secure one of 1,000 RTX 5090 units at MSRP and that number apparently surpasses Taiwan’s total reported allocation at launch.

The chart depicts a downward trend in pricing since launch, with average selling prices of completed eBay listings dropping from $6,000 to $4,000. Through closer inspection, the week following launch saw RTX 5090 prices range from as low as MSRP to as high as $10,000, rivaling the listed prices of Nvidia’s ProViz RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPU with 96GB of VRAM. From January 30 to March 21, the standard deviation, which indicates the variation from the mean, was $1,121.98. When limiting our scope to just March, the standard deviation sees a sharp decline to $145.60, indicating market stability or, at least, consistent pricing across resellers.

The average price of an RTX 5090 has also dropped in March per the data, in the sense you might not end up paying $10,000 to scalpers… just $4,000 and some change. We found similar results from Camelcamelcamel, a website that tracks prices for products sold on Amazon where after the initial volatility spikes to $9,000, prices have now settled at $5,000. While this isn’t exactly cause for celebration, it is a welcome improvement and could indicate lower prices in the future. Of course, that’s considering if Nvidia and AIBs manage to supply cards in sufficient quantity. Notably, this data does not include custom RTX 5090 models among other RTX 50 series GPUs, it just concerns the RTX 5090 FE.

Price gouging this generation unfortunately also extends to system integrators, who are being offered entry-level RTX 5090 variants for over $3,000. AMD’s RX 9070 GPUs face similar constraints, as you’d be hard-pressed to find even an entry-level model at MSRP.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Arm's ASR upscaler for mobile devices is finally available — Plugins planned for Unity and Unreal Engine,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/arms-asr-upscaler-for-mobile-devices-is-finally-available-plugins-planned-for-unity-and-unreal-engine,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 15:55:00 GMT","Months after announcement, Arm is finally making its ASR (Accuracy Super Resolution) upscaler open to developers to integrate into their games. At the GDC (Game Developer Conference) 2025, Arm promised pre-built and easy-to-integrate plugins for games developed using the Unity and Unreal Engine game engines by the end of the year. Arm's ASR fills a void in the Android gaming landscape, offering an open-source upscaling solution that was previously absent, thus lagging MetalFX in Apple's dugout.

It's important to understand that while Arm chips are traditionally found in smartphones, they've started to make their way to laptops like Qualcomm's Snapdragon X series SoCs. So it's not far-fetched to believe this technology will support those chips as well. ASR is built on AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 technology, and at its initial unveiling, Arm claimed 53% more FPS at 2x upscaling with the Immortalis-G720 GPU (Dimensity 8400 and 9300). At the same time, ASR is claimed to deliver power savings of 20% with ASR set to 2x upscaling using the quality preset.

Mobile upscalers can sacrifice visual fidelity for performance and/or battery life. Qualcomm's GSR using spatial upscaling was restricted by its hardware and game support, which limited its impact in the Android space. Since ASR is open-source, developers can tweak and finetune it to match their needs. Moreover, it is likely to be supported on a majority of Arm devices, irrespective of the vendor. In the ""Mori"" demo, Arm showed off ASR in Unreal Engine 5 delivering up to 30% more FPS, with no compromises to the visuals, according to the company.

The Benefits of Arm ASR (Accuracy Super Resolution) - YouTube Watch On

As a part of their promotional efforts, Arm has introduced a new chapter in its Mali Manga series featuring ASR and to be honest, I could get used to reading PRs like this. Think of it like DLSS or FSR for your mobile devices, and game integration is expected to be simplified as Arm releases pre-baked plugins for Unity and Unreal Engine later this year. Game developers utilizing these engines should find ASR integration relatively straightforward. We anticipate support in leading titles such as Genshin Impact (Unity), Wuthering Waves (Unreal Engine), Fortnite (Unreal Engine), and the list goes on.

Due to its open-source nature, ASR can be integrated into other game engines as well but that will require increased developer efforts. Sticking to mobile-only SoCs, ASR should work on Qualcomm's Snapdragon, MediaTek's Dimensity, Google's Tensor, Samsung's Exynos, and Apple's A-series/M-series hardware. While we believe ASR should be as scalable as FSR 2 and support virtually all modern-day Arm hardware, the requirements depend on the developers and Arm itself, though they should be pretty lenient.",tomshardware

In our opinion, some of the best Pi projects come from makers who ask, ""Why not?"" and that's exactly what maker and developer André Esser has done with his latest creation. Using our favorite SBC, he's put together an ASCII video camera project and showed it off at the latest Pi Jam conference.

I had only 3 days to build this Raspberry Pi Project (ASCII Video Camera) - YouTube Watch On

If you're not familiar with ASCII art, it's a way of displaying images using text in something like a terminal. The characters comprise the image in either a simple but crude fashion or with great complexity. ASCII art was much more common in retro computing, but you can still find some fun modern examples like this project today. In this creation, the Pi is able to convert video frames into ASCII art, which is then displayed frame by frame to make a video feed using Python.

In the project source files, we see an example of this in action using a demo video known as ""Bad Apple"". This demo is in black and white, which is great for showing off the ASCII format's potential. However, Esser wanted to make something interactive for the conference and took things a step further by integrating a camera connected to the Raspberry Pi as a main input source. This made it possible for people to walk up to his booth and see themselves represented by text in real-time.

You don't need too much hardware to recreate this project, nor do you need any special components. Esser opted to use a Raspberry Pi 5 as the main board, which has plenty of processing power for a project like this. It's connected to a screen, the larger the better in this case, which lets you see the ASCII output. For video input, Esser opted to use a Raspberry Pi camera module.

Esser was kind enough to make the project open source and has shared all the source code over at GitHub for anyone interested in either recreating the project or just digging deeper to see how it works. There are two versions of the project, according to Esser, one that uses Python and another that uses Cython. The project also requires OpenCV to operate. You can find not only the code, but also instructions on how to set everything up over at the GitHub page.

These are smaller than your average desktop, with an impressively tiny footprint. Today, we've got a deal to share on one of the biggest name brands out there. Apple has its own line of mini PCs known as the Mac Mini range. Right now at Amazon, you can find the 2024 Apple Mac Mini M4 desktop for its lowest price to date — it's currently listed at $499, a full $100 below its recommended price of $599.

This edition features Apple's M4 chip, not to be confused with the M4 Pro, which is a bit more powerful. We had the opportunity to review the Mac Mini M4 Pro last year and loved our experience. For a Mini PC this size, it has plenty to offer, making it a great option for someone that wants a machine oriented for work purposes rather than gaming. It's important to note, however, that we only reviewed the M4 Pro edition, so the performance will differ from the one that's on sale today.

Apple 2024 M4 Mac Mini Desktop: now $499 at Amazon (was $599)

This Apple 2024 M4 Mac Mini desktop is currently available for just $499, its lowest price to date. It has a 5-inch form factor and comes with 16GB of RAM and 256 GB of internal storage using an SSD.

The SoC powering the Apple Mac Mini is an M4 chip. This features a 10-core processor alongside a 10-core GPU. This mini PC lives up to its name with a form factor that measures in at 5 x 5in. Because it's created by Apple, it's easy to integrate the Mac Mini into a family with numerous iDevices. For example, you can access your iPhone from the Mac Mini using ""iPhone Mirroring"" which lets you not only see what's on your iPhone screen from the computer but also control and interact with it in real time.

To support the M4 chip, the system comes with 16GB of RAM, and there's a 256GB SSD for storage. It has quite an impressive selection of ports, as well, given its size. You get two USB Type-C ports, three Thunderbolt ports, and an HDMI output. For network support, you can take advantage of WiFi 6 wireless connections or use a hard wire with its Ethernet jack. As far as audio support goes, it has a built-in speaker alongside an optional 3.5mm audio jack for connecting external audio peripherals.",tomshardware

DNA can last for generations, unlike NAND flash and HDDs that degrade in years or decades, at best. It also offers a data capacity about 100 million times higher than typical data storage systems. However, retrieving data from DNA storage is a complex and rather slow process. Good news, a breakthrough made by Israeli researchers speeds up the activity by 3,200 times, reports TechXplore.

A team at Technion – Israel Institute of Technology has created an AI tool that makes retrieving digital information stored in DNA dramatically faster and more accurate. The system, named DNAformer, is 3,200 times faster than the most accurate previous methods and is claimed to deliver excellent results, showing promise for efficient, large-scale data storage using biological material. It is still too slow for the commercial market, but the researchers believe that they are moving in the right direction.

(Image credit: Technion – Israel Institute of Technology social media posting)

This new approach allows for processing 100MB in only 10 minutes, compared to several days using the best current methods. On a test involving 3.1MB, the tool handled several types of content: a still image in color, a short sound recording of Neil Armstrong on the Moon, a text about DNA's storage advantages, and randomly generated data mimicking encrypted or compressed files.

To store data, customized DNA molecules are synthesized. Reading the information requires sequencing, but this introduces various errors like deletions or substitutions, and returns unordered and sometimes corrupted data copies. DNAformer handles these issues using algorithms that identify correct patterns from flawed inputs. The model includes tailored correction codes and a safety layer to detect highly noisy sequences. It uses specialized tools to clean up those errors before translating the sequences back into digital form.

DNAformer is based on a transformer model trained using synthetic datasets produced by a simulator also built at Technion. Besides the speed improvement, DNAformer also showed up to 40% higher accuracy over previous quick retrieval methods. This performance marks a breakthrough in handling real-world DNA storage data, especially when dealing with incomplete or noisy sequences that challenge traditional correction methods.

The researchers plan to adjust DNAformer for specific needs and believe the system can scale for industrial and research applications. It is designed to be flexible and can evolve with future progress in how DNA is written and read, helping meet the growing demand for sustainable and high-capacity storage solutions.",tomshardware

A few hotfixes down the road, Nvidia has pushed fixes for these black screen issues specifically for the RTX 50 series. However, it appears that older GPUs continue to suffer. To voice growing concern, a user at r/hardware has compiled a comprehensive list featuring numerous testimonies from affected RTX 40 and RTX 30 series users. Multiple reports indicate recurring symptoms, with impacted customers still awaiting a response from Nvidia.

Users report that these instability issues manifest in the form of BSODs, hard crashes which typically require a reboot, and system freezes. A significant chunk of these reports stem from application and feature-specific crashes, particularly when enabling Nvidia's DLSS Frame Generation feature. It's important to understand that these stability concerns are not new, as we can find traces of them dating back to late January with the introduction of Nvidia's 572.16 driver, which enabled RTX 50 support.

One of the possible suspects is using DLSS Frame Generation with G-Sync, based on the user reports. Several faced performance degradation, but the majority experienced crashes. Using older DLSS implementations fixed these issues for some. A large chunk of these users are facing compatibility problems with titles such as Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2, God of War Ragnarok, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, just to name a few. In all these games, the reported symptoms range from stuttering, freezing, and crashes, particularly with frame generation when using 572.xx series drivers from Nvidia.

The community has found several workarounds, with a few common fixes including rolling back drivers, disabling Frame Generation and/or G-Sync, downgrading the DLSS version, and lowering refresh rates, among other related Band-Aid solutions. Even if Nvidia's software division is presumably cooped up with finetuning RTX 50 drivers, complete silence on these concerns is reflecting badly. These issues have been troubling RTX 40 series owners for almost three months, with no definite or official resolution.

Nvidia has addressed several compatibility issues in multiple driver releases across its R570 software, however, most of them are only applicable to the RTX 50 series. Downgrading your drivers to version 566.xx has been a successful workaround, but it's a double-edged sword, as you'll be locked out of many new features. A source of significant frustration and disconnect is that Nvidia is not officially acknowledging these concerns, as the ""Known Issues"" section under almost every new driver release fails to mention anything related to the RTX 40 series.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Compal Adapt X modular laptop design wins award after taking a leaf from the Framework playbook,https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/compal-adapt-x-modular-laptop-design-wins-award-after-taking-a-leaf-from-the-framework-playbook,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 13:45:00 GMT","Leading laptop ODM Compal has won another iF Design Award 2025 for a quirky concept product. The Compal Adapt X is described as a modular laptop, and it is immediately quite clear it takes a leaf out of the Framework laptop playbook. It is also something of a hybrid / convertible, with the components being usable slotted together, or independently. Compal says this concept design is appealing to customers because it offers multiple usage modes, reduced upgrade frequency, and should cut down on e-waste. Of course, Compal's customers are laptop OEMs, so it is up to them whether this design ever hits the retail space.

The above main image shows the Compal Adapt X broken down as far as consumers will take it, we suppose. Sadly, the accompanying text is not very detailed. To the left you can see the 14-inch model's screen, to the right is a 16-inch screen, with a keyboard deck in front of it and a modular dock to the right. Compal's idea seems to be that the product is sold with both screen sizes, and the user decides which they need for the day, perhaps.

With the extended stand under the screen, it looks like the laptop as a whole will be pretty strong / rigid when put together. The stand can also be flexed back, as in one of the lifestyle photos provided by Compal. This looks similar to how an old Lenovo Yoga tablet design worked.

Image 1 of 4 (Image credit: Compal) (Image credit: Compal) (Image credit: Compal) (Image credit: Compal)

We mentioned Framework in the headline, and the main overlap here is the USB-C connected I/O which you see separated in the top image. Compal says this dock can offer ""expanded IO ports and modular AI units."" We also wonder if there is some kind of extra hardware in the area between the screen and the keyboard deck in the 16-inch screen. It could also be an extra battery, AI accelerator, or dGPU - but that isn't discussed by Compal.

Another thing not highlighted by Compal, but visible in the image featuring two fully assembled laptops, are the left-side ports. This view suggests further configurable I/O options in the 16-inch config. In the image we see the left side is ready for a headset, a USB-C, and two large mystery connectors…

Lastly, remember Compal designs and shows these concepts to its OEM customers, and while some of the ideas might seem amazing, and may get partially adopted, we rarely see any of these concepts make it to retail unchanged. This Compal Adapt X modular laptop design's headline claim to fame that it ""extends the lifecycle of notebooks, addressing electronic waste concerns,"" and sadly that isn't something the average 'evil mega corporation' is usually interested in.

GingerOfOz's real-world remake of an artwork of the same name by Anh Dang, a concept artist on League of Legends, is crab-solutely stunning. It is a fully functional Sony PS One, as demonstrated in the video, but GingerOfOz humbly admits that the claw controllers are ""not comfortable to use.""

GingerofOZ's regular (crab)shtick involves taking retro consoles like the Wii, GameCube, PlayStation 2, and others and documenting his work in turning these classics into portable consoles on his YouTube channel. The Playstacean is something of a diversion for the modder, though, as it remains a (cru)stationary device designed to be plugged into your TV at home.

GingerOfOz has had the idea to build a real-life Playstacean in his mind for a few months, ever since he first spotted Anh Dang's artwork. As with many similar projects, the starting point was to hunt down a cheap and cheerful yet functional example of the console at the heart of the project—a PS One from eBay.

THE PLAYSTACEAN IS REAL pic.twitter.com/49jTcL8M6aMarch 21, 2025

With the actual console in hand, GingerOfOz started work on 3D CAD artwork, melding the original Playstacean visual with the real-world console's physical form. That's easier said than done due to the compact PlayStation's curvy nature. Other art-meets-reality tweaks to the Playstacean design were caused by the console being thicker than the concept art, and conversely, the controllers needed to be made a bit heftier to fit the thumb stick and buttons and be rugged enough to game with.

The original PS One's motherboard didn't survive this project unmodded. GingerOfOz documents several trims of the ground plane, but nothing major or too worrying.

After many hours of design, modifications, and test prints, GingerOfOz was happy enough with his Playstacean to call it a day. We think it looks great.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also clarified the company's recent maneuvers behind the scenes, including that it is now building production silicon in the US in TSMC's Arizona fab, and he also threw cold water on rumors of Nvidia's participation in a supposed industry consortium that would take over rival company Intel's chipmaking fabs. That news comes as Intel begins shuffling its foundry management structure under new CEO Lip-Bu Tan.

Nvidia's GTC has developed its own gravity, and many other companies are also now using the event to make their own announcements. This year, we found quite a few interesting developments on the storage front, including a demo for PCIe-connected NVMe hard drives, the first production liquid-cooled SSDs, and a new Toshiba SSD that's bursting at the seams with 122 TB of capacity. Let's dive in.

Nvidia's GTC 2025 Blitz

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Nvidia is dominating not only the AI market, but also the entire fabless chipmaker realm. Early in the week, we learned that Nvidia's explosive growth equates to making nearly as much revenue as its next nine fabless competitors combined last year. Yes, that includes big names like AMD, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and MediaTek, among others.

That was an impressive start to the news cycle for GTC 2025 week, but the real fireworks began the following day when Nvidia unveiled its new roadmap. Nvidia announced its new Rubin GPUs for 2026, Rubin Ultra in 2027, and teased an all-new Feynman architecture that will arrive in 2028, extending its public roadmap out to a four-year window, which Jensen claimed is ""something no other technology CEO has ever done before."" That included the headline announcement of the company's next-gen Blackwell Ultra B3000 GPUs.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Looking out to Nvidia's most exotic high-powered AI systems, the company had its future Rubin Ultra systems on display, and we had the chance to get up close and personal with the new rack design. These powerful GPUs will come with four reticle-sized GPU dies (the largest chips that can be made with existing chipmaking tools) crammed into a single package fused with 1TB of HBM4E memory.

Those massive chips will be combined with Nvidia's 88-core CPUs and crammed into Kyber racks, consuming up to 600,000 Watts (600kW) of power apiece. That will push Nvidia SuperPODS up to multi-megawatts of power consumption.

That pushes performance density to once-unthinkable levels, but power constraints are already a pressing issue for new and existing data centers alike: Most data center projects are now limited by how much power they can access from the grid. As Kyber shows, this will become a more critical issue soon — these systems are expected to land in the second half of 2027.

Naturally, tying together massive clusters of GPUs brings complex challenges, but Nvidia plans for future clusters to communicate at the speed of light. To that end, the company unveiled its Spectrum-X Photonics and Quantum-X Photonics networking switch platforms. These photonics platforms deliver an incredible 1.6 Tb/s of bandwidth per port, or up to 400 Tb/s in aggregate, thus allowing up to millions of GPUs to operate in a single cluster.

As usual, though, some of the biggest storylines from Nvidia didn't stem from its product announcements but rather from its plans for the future. One pertains to TSMC, as Nvidia announced that it is now running production silicon through TSMC fabs in Arizona (it's also producing some Blackwell systems in the US, too), but Nvidia also shared details, or rather lack thereof, about Intel.

Jensen throws cold water on Intel consortium rumors as company begins restructuring moves

Jensen threw cold water on rumors that it was asked to be in an industry consortium that supposedly included AMD, Broadcom, and Qualcomm. This would help TSMC take over the Intel Foundry chipmaking operations. Jensen denied that he had been asked to join a consortium, saying, ""Nobody has invited us to a consortium. [...] There might be a party. I was not invited.""

That's good news for Intel, which made news of its own as Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, has now taken the helm with a $1 million yearly salary plus a whopping potential total of $68 million in bonuses.

Later in the week, Intel told us that Ann Kelleher, the EVP responsible for developing Intel’s chip fabrication technologies, would retire by the end of the year. Intel had previously laid out a public succession plan for Kelleher, but the company decided to reorganize the Intel Foundry operations as part of the changeover. It isn't clear how much of the new organizational structure was architected by Lip-Bu Tan, but he clearly executed the new plan mere days after he assumed his new role as CEO.

Perhaps we'll see more similarly decisive actions at Intel soon as Tan enacts a turnaround plan. Meanwhile, Intel ex-CEO Pat Gelsinger stopped by GTC to repeat his claim that Jensen ""got lucky with AI."" Gelsinger also lamented Intel's past indecisive execution of his Larabee GPU project, which was famously killed after he left the company.

Old HDDs learn a new NVMe jam while SSDs get liquid cooling

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

HBM memories attract all the attention for AI GPUs and accelerators, but the massive data training sets have to be stored somewhere, and storage solutions tailored specifically for AI use cases are now proliferating.

I'm always a sucker for high-capacity SSDs, and Kioxia's new PCIe 5.0 LC9 certainly fits that bill. Kioxia announced the new 122.88TB SSD at the show, and it packs a big performance that matches the big capacity with up to 15 GB/s of bandwidth on tap.

Seagate also had a proof-of-concept demo that included NVMe HDDs. When it comes to NVMe, we naturally think of SSDs, but HDDs with the interface have been under development for quite some time. Extra performance isn't the goal, though. Seagate says utilizing the NVMe interface will enable scaling pools of SSDs up to the exabyte level by utilizing the fast and flexible NVMe-over-Fabrics (NVMe-oF) protocol. When deployed into software-controlled tiered storage systems in tandem with NVMe SSDs, Seagate thinks it has the winning formula for top-tier AI server storage performance.

Finally, the 'world's first' liquid-cooled enterprise SSD debuted at the event. We've seen more than a few different takes on watercooled SSDs for the consumer market. Still, none of them are designed for the harsh environments or the stringent reliability metrics needed for servers. Solidigm's D7-PS10101 E1.S is watercooled but also hot-swappable, meaning it can be changed without shutting down the server, thus also meeting critical serviceability criteria for AI data centers that can't miss a beat.

Jensen Huang also was up to his usual antics as he served food from the Denny's food truck to attendees, and there were far too many other product announcements to cover here. Head to our GTC 2025 page for more details on the other new hardware announcements and deep-dive specs.",tomshardware

The FSP Hydro Ti Pro power supply unit stands as a paragon of efficiency in its class, as evidenced by its stellar performance during room temperature testing, a testament to its 80Plus Titanium certification. This unit excels remarkably in its energy conversion efficiency, particularly at low to medium loads. The Hydro Ti Pro distinguishes itself from its counterparts with its unwavering efficiency across the full spectrum of load conditions, defying the common trend of efficiency decline at elevated loads. When subjected to an input voltage of 230 VAC, the Hydro Ti Pro boasts an average nominal load efficiency of a remarkable 95%, a figure that stands significantly above many of its peers in the power supply landscape. This exceptional efficiency recedes to 92.9% under a reduced input voltage of 115 VAC. Nonetheless, this dip may be significant but does little to overshadow the unit's overall performance, as it remains comparatively very high.

By design, the FSP Hydro Ti Pro features a sophisticated eco-mode for its cooling system, indicating that the fan's operation is dependent on the cooling requirements. However, the cooling strategy employed by this unit is notably efficient, with the fan commencing operation only when the load exceeds 500 Watts. This is a testament to the exceptional efficiency of the Hydro Ti Pro. Despite its substantial power output, the internal temperatures of the unit remain impressively low, a remarkable achievement considering its standard dimensions and high performance.

The cooling profile of the FSP Hydro Ti Pro is meticulously calibrated for minimal noise generation, particularly effective across the lower half of its load capacity. The fan does not even spin with loads up to 500 Watts, maintaining a quiet operation. Beyond this threshold, the fan's speed incrementally increases, but this escalation in speed is gradual and controlled, keeping acoustic levels in check. The fan never reaches a speed close to its maximum under these operating conditions, while temperatures remain very low.

Hot Test Results

The performance of PC power supply units (PSUs) can significantly vary with changes in ambient temperature, a factor that largely hinges on the unit's design and build quality. In the context of the FSP Hydro Ti Pro PSU, its energy conversion efficiency demonstrates remarkable stability under varying thermal conditions. During hot testing, the Hydro Ti Pro shows an extraordinarily low efficiency reduction of just 0.2% at low loads, a figure that firmly sits within the realm of top-tier performance. Notably, even as the load intensifies, this decrement in efficiency remains impressively minimal, not exceeding 0.3%. This consistent efficiency profile under both low and high load conditions in elevated temperatures is indicative of the Hydro Ti Pro's superior design and thermal performance.

In challenging thermal environments, the cooling fan of the FSP Hydro Ti Pro PSU demonstrates a sophisticated operational profile. Contrary to more reactive cooling systems, the fan in the Hydro Ti Pro remains inactive until the load reaches 400 Watts, even when the ambient temperature is very high. This threshold highlights the efficiency and thermal management capabilities of the unit, allowing for substantial power delivery without immediate fan activation even under such conditions. Once the 400-watt mark is surpassed, the fan's speed gradually increases, yet it does so in a controlled manner. The peak activity of the fan is never observed, even at maximum load, reflecting the well-engineered design capacity and capabilities of the Hydro Ti Pro.

PSU Quality and Bottom Line

Power Supply Quality

The electrical performance of the FSP Hydro Ti Pro PSU stands out as exemplary, particularly for a unit geared towards high-performance applications. This performance is a clear indicator of the design engineers' focus on optimizing the primary 12V rail. The 12V rail of the Hydro Ti Pro displays exceptional regulation, maintaining a variance of only 0.6% across its nominal load range. Furthermore, it showcases highly effective filtering, evidenced by a maximum voltage ripple of a mere 24 mV. In comparison, the voltage regulation and filtering on the 3.3V and 5V rails are also noteworthy, albeit slightly less refined than the 12V rail. These rails demonstrate regulation around 1.5% and a voltage ripple up to 18 mV for the 3.3V rail and 16 mV for the 5V rail. Despite this, these figures remain very comfortably within the design limits.

As part of our standard testing, we test the primary protections of all PSUs we review (Over Current, Over Voltage, Over Power, and Short Circuit). The FSP Hydro Ti Pro PSU showed reliable actuation of all protections. The Over Current Protection (OCP) on the 12V rail activated effectively at 122% of the PSU's maximum capacity. Additionally, the Over Power Protection (OPP) also functioned correctly, engaging at 127% under high load conditions, ensuring a strong safety net for the power supply.

https://zdnet.com,The best-looking Linux desktop I've seen so far in 2025 - and it's not even close,https://zdnet.com/article/the-best-looking-linux-desktop-ive-seen-so-far-in-2025-and-its-not-even-close/,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","ZDNET

One thing you can certainly say about Linux is that it does not lack variety. You can find desktop distributions that are equal parts art and functionality, as well as those created purely for the sake of efficiency.

For a while now, Garuda Dr460nized (aka ""Dragonized"") has been that distribution -- the one that makes eyes pop and jaws drop. It's just so cool.

But then the developers of Garuda go and one-up themselves with the ""Broadwing"" release. If you're a big fan of the Dr460nized release, fear not, as it will most likely always be a part of the Garuda lineup, which features several different releases.

Also: This Linux distro can be used without installation (and it's totally free)

One of those releases is the Mokka Edition, a Catppuccin-themed KDE Plasma desktop experience that offers a fresh and inviting take on the KDE environment. I'm reviewing this edition, and it's a game-changer for those who prioritize aesthetics.

For those who aren't familiar, the Catppuccin theme is a popular, visually appealing theme for Linux desktops that offers soothing pastel colors and supports GTK-based desktop environments like GNOME, Cinnamon, XFCE, and Mate. Well, the Garuda team has applied this theme to KDE Plasma, and it's spectacular.

The Catppuccin theme is gorgeous. Jack Wallen/ZDNET

What's new with Garuda's Broadwing?

Before we get too far into this, know that Garuda is an Arch-based distribution. So, if Arch isn't your cup of kefir, you might want to pass on this fantastic distribution. Or, if you're adventurous and have always wanted to try out Arch, Garuda is a great place to start.

Other than the Catppuccin theme, what else is new with Broadwing?

Garuda Rani Welcome App: A new unified tool that combines the functionality of the previous welcome, gamer, and assistant apps to make system setup and management easier for users of all types.

Linux Kernel 6.13: The latest kernel ensures better hardware support and improved performance.

Updates to the Chaotic-AUR infrastructure.

Improved customization for the Dr460nized edition.

Enhancements/improvements for the Hyperland, i3, and Sway desktop environments.

The usual bug fixes, performance enhancements, and security patches.

I've reviewed and used KDE Plasma for a long time, and the Mokka Edition of Broadwing might be the best-looking take on this open-source desktop I've ever seen. Of course, such opinions are quite subjective, and if you're not a fan of pastel purples, you might be repulsed by the color scheme. I find it quite beautiful.

Also: The 4 most Windows-like Linux distros to try because change is hard

Out of the box, the only thing missing for me is an office suite. Of course, I'm a writer by profession, so the ability to work with documents is crucial for me. The good news is that there's the Octopi GUI, which allows you to easily install applications. Even though this is a KDE Plasma desktop, you won't find the Discover app store. Why? Because this is all based on Arch, which prefers GUIs like Octopi. Although I'd much rather have Discover at my disposal, Octopi does a fine job.

Can't find the app you're looking for? Try Octopi. Jack Wallen/ZDNET

Other than the lack of an office suite, you'll find apps like the FireDragon web browser, the Dolphin file manager, Snapper Tools (to create and manage system snapshots), the fish shell, a firewall GUI, the Garuda Network Assistant, the Kate text editor, System Monitor, VLC media player, and more.

From the Garuda Setup Assistant, you can choose from all sorts of apps to install (software centers, kernels, office tools, browsers, email clients, communication/internet tools, audio tools, and more). I highly recommend starting there for your software installation.

You can install various apps for important categories in the Setup Assistant. Jack Wallen/ZDNET

This is one of the first distributions I've tested where I said to myself, ""I wouldn't have to tweak this desktop at all!"" That's big for someone who regularly configures, reconfigures, tweaks, bends, and changes his desktop on a whim. As I look at the Mokka desktop, I seriously cannot think of anything I would change.

How does Broadwing perform?

Okay, enough with the aesthetics. How does Garuda Broadwing perform?

Given that Broadwing was only recently released, it should be no surprise that it's not exactly the smoothest experience. That could very well be because I ran my test as a virtual machine with limited resources, but it seems to me the Catppuccin theme lacks a bit of stability. For example, when I open the FireDragon web browser, it opens fairly quickly, but some of the theme elements appear with a slight delay. On top of that, after opening the web browser, things started slowing down a bit.

Also: What's the best tiling window manager for a Linux beginner?

When that happened, I shut down the virtual machine and increased the RAM from my usual 3GB to 6GB. That certainly helped with the speed, but the theme elements continued to feel a bit unstable. Next, I ran the upgrade tool to see if there were any updates. After applying the updates, I rebooted again but found that the Mokka edition still felt ""wobbly.""

In the end, I decided the Mokka edition's state was due to a combination of being tested as a virtual machine and the newness of the release. I'm confident this will improve as bugs are filed and updates are made available.

If you're interested in seeing the majesty of the Garuda Broadwing Mokka edition, I suggest you do so on a spare computer and not as a virtual machine. My guess is that much of Mokka's ""wobbliness"" will not appear when running on bare metal.

Either way, Garuda Broadwing is a brilliant take on Arch Linux, and if you're looking for what might well be the most beautiful Linux distribution of 2025, this could be it.",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,Genai in communities: between enthusiasm and resistance,https://www.zdnet.fr/blogs/green-si/genai-dans-les-collectivites-entre-enthousiasme-et-resistance-408625.htm,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 17:26:35 GMT","On March 10 and 11 took place in Rennes, the days of the Interconnects forum. It is a conference organized by an association of communities that pushes digital boundaries in the territorial public service. Unsurprisingly, the generative AI invited itself to the program.

For Greensi who was present, she took the spotlight, in discussions and in exchanges. At conference, she also took a place larger than the one reserved for her. The key indicator was rooms occupied twice as many humans as chairs. 😉

These passionate debates have highlighted two extreme attitudes: the radical rejection of certain AI applications, and a marked attraction of public officials for an accelerated modernization.

For Greensi, the effects of the generative AI may be comparable to the effects caused by the Pandemic of Covid-19. The administration discovered teleworking, videoconferences there, revised its operating methods, and adapted very quickly.

From rejection to adoption

Seeing the glass half full is to say that initial mistrust can become a lever for transformation.

Two years ago, just after the release of Chatgpt, the city and the Montpellier metropolis prohibited the use of the tool to all their agents!

Decision motivated by political, ethical considerations linked to data protection and digital sovereignty. This prohibition paradoxically triggered a virtuous dynamic by accelerating reflection around AI (which was there long before Chatgpt).

Montpellier has thus set up a territorial committee dedicated to AI bringing together public, private, universities and businesses. Specific training for elected officials and executives have been organized in order to better understand the issues and integrate AI in a reasoned and efficient manner.

In addition, a citizen convention on AI has made it possible to collect the opinions and concerns of the inhabitants concerning the possible uses, as well as the ethical or environmental risks associated with the AI. The results of these exchanges have been published online, strengthening the transparency and acceptability of projects to citizens.

In the procedures for conducting changes, the first step is resistance. It is often the signal which shows that the approach has started. Otherwise, we would remain in ignorance or in denial of change. To resist is therefore already to give a form to the change to prepare to accept it!

The Occitanie region has highlighted a high demand for modernization among its agents. An internal survey revealed a great motivation of employees to become actors in change by adopting roles of ""volunteer IA referents"".

The regional IA strategy, adopted unanimously in assembly, is built around strict principles:

Absolute transparency of decision -making processes.

Human control over algorithms.

Digital sovereignty.

Reinforced data security.

This framework allows agents to commit to serenely in the experimentation and integration of new technologies while having a clear political line in mind.

These two examples presented at the interconnected forum shows us that change is therefore engaged in territorial function.

But for what changes?

What are the business impacts of generative AI in local authorities?

Basically, there is not much difference with what Greensi has described for two years in private companies. There are impacts on three levels:

In terms of agents who adopt new tools doped at AI.

In terms of processes that hybridize and reveal treatments made by IA algorithms.

And at the global level with the vision of a more autonomous AI, perhaps of a future IA agent who will not appeal to unions ...

The Hauts-de-France region has made a diagnosis to assess the potential IA impact on local authorities. This diagnosis, based on a precise methodology developed by the Inet, revealed that 62 % of professions could experience significant transformations with the arrival of AI. Mainly in the administrative, financial sectors, but also in human resources management. Oddly, he does not list the legal which also seems impacted in all other studies on the subject.

Study that can be compared to McKinsey's analysis on the scale of France, published by the Institute of the Company, which gives a target by 2030: 27 % of the tasks could be entrusted to AI.

These changes may include both a deep reorganization of daily tasks and a redefinition of the expected skills of agents.

Faced with these observations, it has become imperative to quickly organize a proactive preparation of agents through targeted and in -depth training. In this context, the CNFPT, which provides the training of agents of the territorial function, plays a central role.

The CNFPT said it started to develop specialized curriculum intended to strengthen ""AI literacy"" among territorial professionals. These programs include modules devoted to the analysis and advanced interpretation of data, mastery of AI tools adapted to public issues. But in the long term, it is all current training programs that are impacted by AI and which will have to adapt.

The introduction of generative AI into communities therefore appears more as a strategic complement to human capacities rather than a pure and simple substitution. Analysis of use cases by the Haut de France region shows that almost 60 % of the applications identified are used to amplify human skills, thus facilitating more efficient and informed decision -making.

Conversely, approximately 40 % of cases are actually a complete automation of certain repetitive tasks or with low added value. The professions linked to computer sectors and administrative management will have to expect deeper and faster developments. These functions will have to integrate new working practices based on constant interaction with sophisticated technological tools. The agents concerned will not only have to acquire new technical skills, but also completely rethink their operating modes and their global approach to the service provided.

This context will therefore request a strengthening of social dialogue, in order to prevent potential social tensions. The establishment of observatories of the change brought by the AI ​​would allow attentive surveillance of the social impacts of the AI. These observatories including elected officials, unions and agents to ensure a harmonious and controlled transition.

We have seen that the brakes at AI can be on political considerations. So specific to the exercise of power in a community, where we do not want to leave too much room for algorithms (which are however already there). But it can also be not to engage too early in union negotiations that cannot be elected.

But a characteristic of local authorities is that they ensure the same skills, but each on their territory. It is not sure that a revolution like that of AI can be approached in a scattered way. That everyone reinvents the LLM of its territory, where their vision of the public agent increased to AI, is certainly a loss of resources.

For Greensi it will be the main difficulty, especially at a period when grants to communities drop each year. Not to mention the potential impact of a war economy. It is therefore strongly likely that the AI ​​of the territories will be developed by software publishers who can pool investments. A first application of RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) on all the content of public deliberations on a national scale, is already out. It allows agents to question an LLM, to draw inspiration from what can be done elsewhere, while remaining in content validated by the territorial public service.

It is therefore a very good initiative that that of the Banque des Territoires, to develop a ""National Library of Territorial AI"". So that everyone is inspired by those in front, without reinventing hot water in each town.

From there to be able to say that it will allow the ""replication of projects"", Greensi is more skeptical.

We have seen that generative AI is an in -depth transformation of organizations. The word replication highlights the reuse of a tool, which will have little chance of operating in a new organization.

Trans-forming is literally ""changing shape"" is not a tool.

In conclusion, artificial intelligence in local authorities is currently a major turning point. It oscillates between legitimate reluctance and a deep desire for modernization.

The generative IA encourages a questioning of traditional administrative practices while demanding increased vigilance. It wants to preserve digital sovereignty, democratic values ​​and the central role of humans in public service.

It is not fundamentally different from what has been observed for two years in companies. However, there are more constraints to be respected and more time for reflection.",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,How to recover SMS recently deleted on an iPhone,https://www.zdnet.fr/pratique/comment-recuperer-des-sms-recemment-supprimes-sur-un-iphone-408611.htm,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 12:00:41 GMT","Have you ever deleted an SMS or a conversation on your iPhone to realize later that you still need it? We have probably all passed by there. Do not worry, there is a way to reactivate a deleted message. But don't wait too long. The IMEAGE application generally keeps SMS deleted up to 40 days. If you act before this deadline, you should be able to recover this lost but not forgotten message.

But what to do if you exceed the deadline and need to access an SMS definitively deleted? An option is to use a third -party recovery tool for iPhone. I use the Imazing utility, which allows me to save my phone and selectively access certain data. I can even consult the old SMS without having to restore them.

The main drawback is that you will already need a backup of your phone to restore the old SMS deleted since. It is therefore advisable to use a program like this regularly, before deleting messages you may need later.

How to restore a deleted message in iMessage

1 Update your device

To recover the messages and conversations deleted in iMessage, you must have iOS 16 or a later version on your iPhone and iPados 16.1 or a later version on your iPad. To check your device, go to the settings, select general, then press software update. Download and install the latest version, if necessary.

2 Open Imessage

Open iMessage. If you have already looked for the desired message and you do not find it, it's time to check all the SMS deleted. If you've already filtered unknown shipments, press filters at the top left. Otherwise, press edit. Select recently deleted. The list displays the name or telephone number of each sender, the number of messages in each conversation and the number of days sold since its deletion.

3 Recover a message

If you find the conversation you want to restore, select it and press Recover at the bottom. You can also restore multiple messages simultaneously. Confirm recovery.

4 Consult the restored conversation

Press filters at the top and select all messages. Look for the restored message. Press it to display the messages (s) and continue the conversation if you wish.

How to use a third -party backup tool to recover deleted SMS

To access SMS permanently deleted, you can use a third -party backup tool. It allows you to save all of your phone data and display the deleted content selectively.

Although there are several programs of this type, I recommend the IMAZING utility, free as long as you restore any application or given. Restoration of a backup requires a paid license, from $ 39.99 for a single device. The good news is that you can consult and even export a message from the backup without having to restore it on your phone.

Again, you must already use this tool for your backups so that you can consult a deleted SMS. It is a good option to adorn any eventuality.

1 Open IMAZING and associate your phone

Download and install IMAZING. Connect your iPhone to your Windows or Mac PC via USB. Open IMAZING and wait for it to associate with your phone. Once the pairing is finished, select your phone, check your box, then click Save.

2 Run the backup

On the next screen, activate the Activate the encryption of the backup and add a password if you want to quantify the backup. Otherwise, leave this option deactivated. Select the backup location option if you want to modify the default location. When you are ready, click the Save button at the bottom right. Wait until the backup starts, then ends.

3 Consult the conversation

Now let's see the future. You use IMAZING or a similar program to save your phone, if possible regularly, and you now want to access a deleted SMS. You have already consulted the recently deleted section of your phone, but nothing helps.

Launch IMAZING and select the backup category. Examine the backups and select the one that in your opinion contains the deleted SMS. In the Backup window, select Messages. Authorize the recovery and display of messages. Select the deleted conversation from the list to display it. Right click on it and export the text to PDF, Excel, CSV or text format. You can also save attachments and print all of the conversation.",zdnet

So how can such an insignificant thing pose such a problem for users?

Take a recent Vulnerable U report concerning the Cyberhaven data loss prevention service, which discovered that an extension chrome used by more than 400,000 of its customers contained code to steal their private/sensitive data. This extension remained available for more than 30 hours before being deleted.

The malicious version of the extension contained an email from Spear-Phising indicating that it did not comply with the conditions of use of Google and that it would be revoked if the developer did not intervene immediately. By clicking on the link, a consent screen opened, asking for authorizations for access to an oauth application called ""Privacy Policy Extendance"". This then allowed an attacker to download a new malicious version of the extension.

This story is becoming more and more common: an element as harmless as an extension contains a malicious code ready to steal your secrets and your data. It is more difficult to protect yourself in a digital world. Regarding browser extensions, it is unfortunately the end of the end user to be vigilant about what he installs on his computer.

In this context, how to ensure your safety and avoid installing dangerous browser extensions?

Here are five ways to know if you can trust an extension.

1 Favor extensions of large companies

My first rule is to trust only extensions published by large companies. This does not mean that you should not exclude a single developer or a small team, but it is always the easiest way to make sure not to be trapped by a malicious campaign.

2 add only what you need

This following rule is similar to that which I use for mobile devices: install only the essential elements. I also tend to limit my browser extensions to the bare minimum.

You could come across an extension pretending to be able to save you thousands of euros during your online purchases. However, the adage ""if it's too good to be true, this is probably the case"" applies. I no longer count the number of times I had to delete purchasing extensions of user browsers because they had fallen into the panel.

3 Prepare the land

Perform some research before installing an extension. Consult the reviews and the number of downloads. If the latter is weak or there is very little review, avoid this extension.

4 Check updates

Always check the date of the last extension update. I tend to trust extensions regularly updates.

One of the problems linked to the installation of browser extensions not updated for some time is the risk of unsuccessful safety flaws. As a general rule, if software has not been updated in the last 30 days, I immediately be wary and I find out about the developer to see if he has abandoned the project or if he has a doubtful reputation.

5 Think of authorizations

Finally, check the authorizations required by an extension. For example, if you add an extension that has no reason to access keyboard entry or webcam, think twice before installing it.

In Chrome, open a tab on chrome: // extensions. On each extension, click Details and consult the required authorizations. In Firefox, go to additional modules and themes> extensions and click on an extension. On the page that appears, click on the Authorizations tab and see the authorizations required for the extension. If you notice something suspect, immediately delete the extension.

Unfortunately, this kind of situation is not going to disappear. Despite all the attention of safety browser developers, malicious actors are always one step ahead. Faced with this problem, always ask yourself the question: do I need this extension? If the answer is no, do not install it.",zdnet
