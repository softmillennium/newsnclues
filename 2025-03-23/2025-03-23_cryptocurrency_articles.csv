The cryptocurrency industry notched two major victories last year when several fund issuers secured long-awaited approvals to offer spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and their Ethereum-based counterparts in the U.S. But that doesn't mean issuers are ready to rest on their laurels just yet.

In recent months, fund managers have proposed new investment offerings directly tracking the prices of a variety of cryptocurrencies, from Dogecoin to XRP, Solana, and even Donald Trump’s meme coin.

Here are the various crypto-based ETFs that could soon be offered in the United States, and a look at the high-profile filings so far for each asset.



Solana

Spot Solana exchange-traded funds are one potential alternative to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs that could begin trading in the U.S. this year or next.



The proposed funds, which include the VanEck Solana Trust, 21Shares Core Solana ETF, Canary Solana ETF, and Bitwise Solana ETF, would directly track the price of the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

Franklin Templeton joined the fray in February, as well, filing an S-1 registration statement with the SEC. In March, CBOE filed on behalf of Franklin Templeton for a rule change to list the proposed fund.

Meanwhile, a handful of proposed Solana futures ETFs such as the ProShares Short Solana, ProShares 2x Solana, and Vol Shares’ Solana ETF would enable investors to make more complex bets on Solana's price movements.

However, both spot and futures Solana ETFs will likely not begin trading in the U.S. until 2026, according to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffert. That’s because the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission still has to assess a batch of spot Solana ETF applications.

The SEC typically takes between 240 and 260 days to make decisions on applications. But ongoing litigation over whether Solana is or isn't a security could prolong that process for several would-be Solana ETFs. The regulator acknowledged Grayscale's Solana ETF application on February 6 and is seeking public comment on the filing, marking what one analyst called ""new territory"" for the agency.

Nevertheless, if and when spot Solana ETFs are approved, the investor dollars they attract could be massive. JP Morgan analysts predict Solana ETFs could collectively bring in between $4 and $8 billion in investments.

Dogecoin

A few issuers have signaled that they plan to offer spot Dogecoin ETFs following a wave of political events that slingshotted the Shiba Inu-inspired meme coin to a three-year-high price of $0.48 in December.

Exchange-traded fund provider Rex Shares applied in January to launch the Rex-Osprey DOGE ETF, the company’s filing with federal regulators shows.

Meanwhile, Bitwise Asset Management has registered a Dogecoin ETF entity in Delaware, a major step towards applying for permission to launch an exchange-traded fund based on Elon Musk's beloved cryptocurrency. But Bitwise still needs to file a comprehensive application with the SEC before any potential fund could come to market.

Finally, crypto-focused investment firm Grayscale has also signaled its intention to launch a Dogecoin ETF. The asset manager launched in late January a Dogecoin Trust, enabling institutional and accredited investors to allocate funds to the meme coin. Shortly thereafter, Grayscale filed a 19b-4 form to convert that Trust into an ETF, joining several of its competitors in planning to roll out such a fund.

The SEC acknowledged Grayscale's filing in February, but then in March delayed its decision, giving the agency until May 21 to make a call either way.

Analysts are bullish that it won't take long for Dogecoin ETFs to hit the market, however. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in January that a spot Dogecoin ETF could theoretically launch as early as April, thanks to a rule that enables federal regulators to weigh in on investment offering proposals within an expedited 75-day timeframe, rather than the typical review period of eight to nine months.

XRP

Funds created around the Ripple-linked XRP—such as the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF, Canary XRP ETF, and 21Shares Core XRP Trust—are up for review in the U.S.

In early February, Chicago's Cboe Exchange applied with federal regulators to list and trade four spot XRP ETFs — a sign of growing investor interest in funds tracking Ripple Lab's crypto asset. The spot XRP ETFs would be issued by WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary Capital, respectively.

Franklin Templeton joined the party in March, right as the SEC punted on making a decision on Grayscale's XRP filing.

The SEC acknowledged multiple XRP applications in late February, saying that comments would be submitted within 21 days of the filings. That brings the ETFs one step closer to be approved in the U.S.

However, it remains unclear whether the ETFs will be approved or not. A rash of expected rule changes at the SEC point to a higher likelihood that regulators could soon green light the funds in the U.S.

If XRP ETFs are approved, then the funds could collectively bring in between $3 and $6 billion in investments, according to a January estimate from J.P. Morgan analysts.

Beyond spot XRP ETFs, XRP futures-based exchange-traded funds such as the ProShares Short XRP and ProShares 2x XRP are also up for consideration in the U.S.

The former would allow investors to short XRP, while the latter would enable investors to make leveraged bets on the cryptocurrency's future price movements.

Bitcoin Plus ETF

Trump Media and Technology Group's Truth.Fi has applied to register a trademark for two “Bitcoin Plus” products, in addition to four other investment vehicles. The funds are called Truth.Fi Bitcoin Plus ETF and Truth.Fi Bitcoin Plus SMA.

It remains unclear which assets the Bitcoin Plus ETFs would hold, if approved. It's possible the “plus” part of their names could refer to another cryptocurrency which the funds would track alongside Bitcoin. Truth.Fi did not respond to Decrypt's request for comment and clarification.

Crypto Index ETF

In early February, asset manager Franklin Templeton filed an amended petition to offer its “Franklin Crypto Index ETF.”

If approved, the exchange-traded fund will track Bitcoin and Ethereum, weighting the assets 86.31% and 13.69%, respectively. It could also include additional cryptocurrencies in the future, Franklin Templeton said in its filing.

Aptos

Crypto asset manager Bitwise submitted an S-1 filing with the Securities Commission in early March, signaling its plans to launch an exchange-traded fund tracking the price of Aptos (APT).

The filing came just a few days after the asset manager had mode moves to establish a Delaware trust—laying the groundwork for its Aptos ETF.

Sui

Sui, another brainchild of ex-Meta stablecoin project members, may soon become available to investors in the form of an exchange-traded fund.

Canary Capital took an early step toward spinning up a SUI-based ETF in early March, filing for a Delaware Trust.

Movement

Rex Shares and Osprey Funds teamed up in early March to file for approval to offer an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks MOVE, the native token of the Movement Network.

The asset managers submitted their filing for a MOVE-based ETF to U.S. regulators as the Ethereum layer-2 network launched its mainnet in beta.

HBAR

Canary Capital filed for the first HBAR ETF last November. HBAR is the native cryptocurrency of the Hedera network.

In an X post in December, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas expressed optimism about a spot HBAR ETF’s odds of receiving approval in the U.S., saying that such a fund could launch before its higher-profile Solana and XRP-based counterparts. Despite that, it remains unclear whether there is sufficient investor demand for such a fund, he said.

Litecoin

A rash of Litecoin-based ETF applications were filed following President Donald Trump's inauguration, as the chilly crypto regulatory environment shows signs of thawing.

CoinShares filed two registration statements for a ""CoinShares Litecoin ETF"" and ""CoinShares XRP ETF,"" while the New York Stock Exchange signaled that Greyscale is trying to convert its existing Litecoin Trust into an ETF.

The new filings came roughly two months after Canary Capital filed for its own Litecoin ETF, and days after Canary submitted an amendment to its application for the fund.

Litecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency created to improve verification time for blockchain transactions. Much like its spot HBAR ETF counterpart, Canary Capital's Litecoin ETF is likely to get approved before Dogecoin, XRP, and Solana-based funds, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas.

That's because Litecoin's regulatory status is less disputed than that of other altcoins such as Solana, which remain at the center of a legal battle between the SEC and major crypto industry players, according to Balchunas.

Polkadot

Grayscale revealed on February 25 that it plans to convert its Polkadot Trust into an ETF, which would trade on Nasdaq.

Just a few weeks later, 21Shares followed its fellow asset manager’s lead, filing its own Polkadot ETF filing to the SEC. The regulator has recognized both submissions as of publication time.

NFTs

Investment firm Canary Capital filed in mid-March for a PENGU and Pudgy Penguins ETF.

PENGU is a Solana-based token linked to the Pudgy Penguins NFT collection on the Ethereum network. Pudgy Penguins is the fourth-largest NFT project based on market cap, according to CoinGecko data. The proposed fund would hold both the fungible token and the NFTs.

BONK, Trump, and beyond

Rex Shares filed with federal regulators in January to launch spot Trump and BONK-based ETFs, respectively.

The proposed funds form part of a growing list of meme coin-based investment products spun up by issuers, who are apparently eager to capitalize on investors’ growing interest in the digital assets market amid the latest crypto bull run.

Bloomberg analysts predict that TRUMP, BONK, and other meme coin-based ETFs could begin trading as soon as April—that is, if issuers’ proposals undergo and pass an expedited review process with federal regulators.

https://decrypt.co,Beyond Strategy: 11 More Publicly Traded Companies That Are Stockpiling Bitcoin,https://decrypt.co/300470/beyond-microstrategy-publicly-traded-companies-buying-bitcoin,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 14:57:00 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Strategy's Bitcoin buying plan—once maligned by big businesses—has produced blockbuster profits for the software company amid the latest Bitcoin boom, pushing its stock price to an all-time high in November as its stash tops $42 billion worth of the coin as of this writing.

And its success has inspired a crop of copycats, though Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor probably doesn’t mind—he’s been advocating for such a movement for years now.

In recent months, several more publicly traded firms have greenlit corporate strategies to stack Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, while others that have already invested in the cryptocurrency are building up their holdings of the asset.

More than 70 companies have dived headfirst into Strategy's crypto-first business strategy at a time when Bitcoin is flying high: President-elect Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a national Bitcoin strategic reserve, and the coin hit an all-time high of $108,000 in January.

And although Bitcoin is hovering around the $85,000 mark as of writing time, new companies are still buying in—and existing reserve firms are boosting their stockpiles.

Here are 11 more publicly traded companies that are following in Strategy's footsteps and stacking Bitcoin.

Tesla

Tesla, the electric car-making company led by Dogecoin aficionado Elon Musk, has held Bitcoin for four years. And although it moved its tokens to new wallets last fall, there's no indication that the car maker is selling its Bitcoin.

Tesla has a long history with Bitcoin. The publicly traded company first revealed that it had invested $1.5 billion in the world's oldest cryptocurrency in February 2021, with plans to accept the tokens as payment for its vehicles.

It backtracked on the latter plans after Musk shared concern about the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, and sold some of the coins—but it still has a substantial stash with recent reports showing the firm still holds 11,509 Bitcoin valued around $978 million.

Block

Financial services conglomerate Block—the firm behind the Square payments platform—owns more than 8,000 BTC worth at least $758 million as of writing time, according to one estimate.

The Jack Dorsey-founded company began buying Bitcoin just a few months after MicroStrategy. Its first Bitcoin purchase came in October 2020, when it snatched up more than 4,700 BTC.

Rumble

In November, video streaming platform Rumble became one of the latest public companies to greenlight a Bitcoin treasury reserve strategy. Under the Bitcoin buying plan, Rumble will invest up to $20 million in the digital asset, according to a company statement.

It is also aiming to reinvent itself as a go-to platform for the crypto community. To achieve that goal, the company has received a $775 million injection from stablecoin firm Tether.

On March 15, Rumble used $17.1 million of the originally planned $20 million to buy roughly 188 Bitcoin.

LEEF Brands

Cannabis company LEEF Brands announced in December it would adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.

The Canadian business plans to make the investment through a $5 million Bitcoin-backed debenture offering, according to a company statement. The company holds 3.9 BTC in a cold wallet, but no details of Bitcoin purchases have been shared as of March 2025.

Semler Scientific

Medical technology company Semler Scientific began purchasing the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization last May, when it debuted its Bitcoin reserve treasury strategy.

Since then, the firm has made several big buys of the token, with its activity ramping up toward the latter half of last year.

“We plan to continue to purchase bitcoin with cash from operations and with cash proceeds from our sales under our ATM program., Semler Scientific CEO Eric Semler said in November. “We are exploring additional financing opportunities that will enable us to acquire even more bitcoin.”

Semler Scientific holds 3,192 Bitcoin as of February 4, a value of nearly $268 million at the time of writing.

Semler Scientific Acquires 871 #bitcoins for $88.5 million and has generated BTC Yield of 152% since July 1, 2024. Now holding 3,192 $BTC. Just getting started 🚀 $SMLR — Eric Semler (@SemlerEric) February 4, 2025

Banzai

Marketing technology solutions firm Banzai announced in November it would spend up to 10% of the funds in its corporate treasury on Bitcoin. Adding Bitcoin to Banzai's balance sheet will diversify the assets in its treasury, in addition to enabling the company to profit off of the cryptocurrency's long-term value growth, Banzai CEO Joe Davy said last year in a statement.

Fold

Bitcoin services firm Fold recently added 475 Bitcoin to its treasury, bringing its total holdings to more than 1,485 Bitcoin, or about $126 million at current prices.

Though the company’s affinity for the leading crypto asset is not new, its place among publicly traded companies is–Fold was listed for trading as FLD on the Nasdaq in February 2025.

“Fold’s Bitcoin treasury serves a dual purpose: providing value to investors seeking Bitcoin exposure, while acting as a corporate strategic reserve to support our growing suite of Bitcoin-native financial products,” said company CEO Will Reeves after its most recent purchase.

The company, which rewards users of its financial services with Bitcoin rewards, has given out more than $20 million in BTC as of early March 2025.

Worksport

Worksport, a company that makes truck covers, announced its plan to implement a Bitcoin and XRP treasury in December 2024. A month later, the company made its first “six-figure purchase” of the assets as a hedge against inflation.

“Our business has been growing rapidly, with revenues up and margins steadily improving. We believe our strategic treasury plan is a low-risk approach to hedge inflation and potentially benefit from increasing regulatory clarity around cryptocurrencies,” said CEO Steven Rossi.

Rossi added that the firm is taking a long-term approach to both BTC and XRP.

Fathom Holdings

Real estate technologies company Fathom Holdings announced a plan in January to use upwards of 50% of its excess cash to create a Bitcoin treasury.

The announcement didn't appear to impress traditional equities investors though, as shares of the firm—which trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker FTHM—are down nearly 35% year-to-date.

Nevertheless, company CFO Joanne Zach spoke positively about the company’s Bitcoin strategy, telling investors that it diversifies Fathom’s treasury holdings and “positions Fathom at the forefront of digital currency transactions in real estate today.”

The firm committed to purchasing up to $500,000 of Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETF equivalents in the closing weeks of January.

Nuvve

Electric vehicle technologies company Nuvve joined the list of publicly traded companies creating a Bitcoin treasury at the end of January.

The firm, which trades on the Nasdaq as NVVE, announced it would use up to 30% of its cash holdings to buy the top crypto asset, pending market conditions.

While its stock price rose slightly on the day of the announcement, it otherwise has struggled this year, dropping more than 55% year-to-date. In addition to implementing Bitcoin purchases with excess cash, the company plans to accept BTC as payment. “BTC acceptance will promote more payment options for customers and suppliers with potentially less transactional friction inherent to digital currencies,” said company CEO and founder Gregory Poilasne.

https://decrypt.co,Does Vibe Coding Really Work? We Built a Game With Claude—Here's How It Turned Out,https://decrypt.co/311183/we-built-game-vibe-coding-ai-claude,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 12:54:31 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

There’s a new trend among AI enthusiasts, and it’s not chatbots or agents. We’re talking about ""vibe coding""—a session in which a person simply talks to an AI, gives an idea of something they want to build, and starts iterating with the model, asking it to fix and improve things along the way.

It's supposedly as easy as talking to a friend, and simple enough for even laymen with extremely modest technical sophistication to do.

I wrote about it here. But to get beyond the hype, I wanted to see if vibe coding could actually produce something useful.

Vibe coding a useful app?

I chose Claude 3.7 Sonnet as my AI partner after Decrypt’s tests showed it outperformed even Grok-3 for coding tasks.

My software project was pretty simple: I wanted to build a typing game in which words cascade down the screen, tasking players with typing them before they reach the bottom to survive.

We started with the most basic prompt possible: ""Write a beautiful, relaxing game in which I must type out words fast to remain alive. The words are falling down and each letter has a vanishing effect as I type on them.""

Within minutes, Claude pumped out what looked like a complete game... But when I tried to run it, nothing happened. The start button was dead. I mentioned the error to Claude and it started to work assuring me it found the bug and was working to fix it.

Claude was done, and the new game was in front of our eyes. I tried it, and nope… still broken. Rather than diving into the code ourselves (that's not vibe coding!), I just told Claude: ""Nope. Nothing happens when I click the button. The game never starts.""

The AI went back to work, and its second attempt actually launched. I also cheated a bit and checked the code, noticing another issue: The game used only about 10 different words, which would get repetitive fast. Instead of asking for a complete dictionary integration, I had Claude mix real words with made-up ones—a practical solution that kept the code simple.

I continued this back-and-forth with Claude, refining through natural language rather than code edits. Fourteen iterations later, I had something satisfactory enough for me to share without being ashamed.

When my colleagues tested the finished game, the reactions were mostly positive. One journalist even beat my high score (which sucked), while others offered ideas for improvements. The only ""bugs"" they found were actually intentional limitations: randomly generated words, but no mobile support.

You can try the game here. As of now, Ryan Gladwin holds the record with 2,830 points, but hopefully I’ll claim my throne back anytime soon.

Lessons learned

After all this and other experiments, here are some things that can be useful for those willing to give vibe coding a try:

1. Rapid prototyping works: We went from concept to playable game quickly, with minimal technical input. This is great for novices with minimal coding abilities. However, it could probably be a good technique for experienced coders who need a rough draft to start iterating.

2. Iteration is key: The first attempt rarely works perfectly. Success comes through conversational refinement and clear feedback. In this stage, experienced coders could probably leave vibe coding behind and stick to normal debugging, using AI as it should be—a digital assistant that helps them with the process. However, those willing to commit fully to vibe coding may benefit from using very specific and detailed language. The richer and better structured your prompt is, the better the results you will get.

3. Don't rush it: Knowing when to simplify requirements helps achieve a working product faster. Ideally, don't ask the model to do everything at once. Instead, think about the experience as adding different layers to a rough structure. Start with the basics, then ask the model to fix one small bug, then another, then add a specific thing you'd like to see—and move on from there.

4. Quality has limits: While we created a functional and enjoyable game, it lacked the polish and optimization of professionally developed software. Don't expect to develop Skyrim with Grok.

5. Debugging is conversational: Rather than searching for problems in the code, we simply described what wasn't working and let the AI figure out how to fix it. This works well, but of course, experts may speed things up by checking the code or talking to the model about the technicalities instead of the expected results.

Overall, vibe coding can indeed produce functional software if you're patient enough to guide the AI through multiple iterations. Is it production-quality code? Definitely not. You'll still need proper debugging, optimization, and various specialized tools to build truly professional applications.

But then again, the guy who built Flappy Bird made millions with a simple game that didn't need fancy architecture or complex systems. Sometimes, all you need is a good idea, and maybe—just maybe—vibing with AI until you start making millions.",decrypt
https://decrypt.co,Vibe Coding: How Devs and Laymen Alike Are Using AI to Create Apps and Games,https://decrypt.co/311144/vibe-coding-using-ai-create-apps-games,"Sun, 23 Mar 2025 12:51:04 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Once upon a time, God said, ""Let there be light""—and there was light. Now you can say, ""Let there be this app,"" and the app will appear right before your eyes, all thanks to the magic of AI.

This is what vibe coding promises.

""I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy-paste stuff, and it mostly works,"" Andrej Karpathy—a co-founder of OpenAI and former AI director at Tesla— tweeted last month, describing his new programming approach on social media.

Instead of meticulously writing code, he explained that he simply talks to an AI assistant and lets it do the heavy lifting. He called this “vibe coding”—and all the AI guys loved it.

There's a new kind of coding I call ""vibe coding"", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It's possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper… — Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) February 2, 2025

The term immediately found product-market fit, and in just a few weeks, Merriam-Webster Dictionary had added ""vibe coding"" to its database, defining it as ""writing computer code in a somewhat careless fashion, with AI assistance."" By March, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan reported that in the accelerator's Winter 2025 startup batch, ""for 25% of the batch, 95% of lines of code are LLM-generated.""

Some think this is the future of technology, when anyone can bring into reality any idea using natural language, and giving machines the responsibility to code. Others see the trend as the tech equivalent of a jam session, in which people start with an idea, and let the flow—and the interaction with their chatbot—guide them through a final result.

Of course, critics see this trend as a recipe for disaster.

“Vibe coding is like buying a kit to build a race car, paying your drunk uncle who ‘knows a thing or two about racing’ to build the kit for you, then telling all your friends that you built it,” said one Reddit user.

From typing code to talking to the code

At its core, vibe coding involves telling an AI what you want to build in plain language, then letting it generate the actual code. Rather than wrestling with syntax or poring over documentation, developers can simply say, ""Create a login form with email validation and password requirements,"" and watch as the AI handles the implementation details. (It's so easy even a layman can do it like me. See how I did it here.)

The vibe coding approach flips traditional software development on its head. Instead of writing code line by line, vibe coders focus on high-level instructions and iterative refinement through natural conversation with AI assistants.

""It’s a new way of coding where you don’t write a single line of code,"" noted tech educator Matthew Berman. ""You do not read the code, you simply try to use it, see if it works—and if it doesn’t, you explain what’s wrong… you do not look at the diffs, and you basically just vibe.""

This is wild. Vibe coding with AI just completely changed the game. People can't stop creating games with Grok, Windsurf, Cursor & Claude 3.7 Sonnet. 10 wild examples: 1. Fortnite meets Minecraft on Three.js 🤯pic.twitter.com/towhyg0oYv — Min Choi (@minchoi) March 21, 2025

Karpathy calls this the ""Accept All"" mentality. ""I 'Accept All' always, I don't read the diffs anymore,"" he said, referring to how he accepts AI-suggested code changes without scrutinizing them.

This approach—where the AI is trusted to write working code without the developer fully understanding every line—is what distinguishes true vibe coding from simply using AI as a sophisticated assistant.

In AI-assisted coding, users rely on AI to help them code, but they debug errors and understand what the AI is doing. The AI simply is a very fast typist that gets the job done. Vibe coders on the other hand don’t debug, don’t code, and don’t know—nor care—about what happens under the hood. All they do is talk, review, and talk again.

In a pure vibe coding session, the prompter doesn't check on the code. They just point out the errors and their ideas for improvement after running what the machine created. It’s the machine, not the human, the one who is supposed to fix everything and improve the code.

Turning coding into a creative flow state

Beyond the technical aspects, vibe coding has spawned its own distinct culture and aesthetic. The term ""vibe"" isn't accidental—it captures the emphasis on creativity, flow, and even playfulness that practitioners bring to coding sessions.

On TikTok and YouTube, videos of vibe coding often feature developers in moody lighting with RGB keyboards, ambient music playing softly in the background as they chat with their AI assistant. The scene looks like anything but traditional software engineering.

This fusion of coding with a chill, creative atmosphere has made programming appear more approachable and emotionally engaging. Riley Brown, a social media influencer who calls himself a ""Sr. Vibe Coder"" on LinkedIn and is now fully dedicated to spreading awareness on this trend, has amassed over a million followers across platforms by posting videos where he builds functioning apps through voice commands alone. Other influencers like Matthew Berman, Nuno Maduro, and The Primeagen have also shared their sessions on YouTube and Twitch.

The aesthetic emphasizes that coding can be fun and expressive rather than dry and technical. It's a stark departure from the buttoned-up, precision-focused culture traditionally associated with software development.

Several high-profile tech figures have championed vibe coding, propelling it from niche concept to mainstream discussion in a matter of months.

Andrej Karpathy's influence cannot be overstated. His initial posts describing his vibe coding workflow received thousands of likes and sparked widespread debate. Given Karpathy's reputation in the AI community, his endorsement lent significant credibility to the approach.

Andrew Chen, general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, has been another evangelist of the trend. Chen described vibe coding as ""brilliant and enormously frustrating.""

""Most code will be written (generated?) by the time-rich,"" he said. ""Thus, most code will be written by kids/students rather than software engineers. This is the same trend as video, photos, and other social media.""

random thoughts/predictions on where vibe coding might go: - most code will be written (generated?) by the time rich. Thus, most code will be written by kids/students rather than software engineers. This is the same trend as video, photos, and other social media - we are in the… — andrew chen (@andrewchen) March 9, 2025

Amjad Masad, CEO of Replit, has reported that ""75% of Replit customers never write a single line of code"" thanks to AI features—a statistic that underscores how vibe coding principles are already changing who can create software.

Detractors speak

But not everyone is convinced. Many developers have raised serious concerns about vibe coding's potential drawbacks.

Code quality is the main criticism. Vibe coding could be a great tool for inexperienced people, but experts argue it is still not good enough to produce quality results. Jonathan Blow, developer of acclaimed indie game Braid, weighed in on the trend in response to vibe coder Levelsio in a popular debate on X, which was triggered after the latter shared a flight simulator built entirely during a vibe coding session.

“I'll put it this way: If you have never tried to make a game, I am sure it is fun to have a game-making experience. For those who have made games, even just simple ones, getting stuff on the screen is not impressive, it's easy; it's making the game good that is hard,” Jonathan Blow, developer of acclaimed indie game Braid, told vibe coder Pietier Levels (aka Levelsio) in a viral debate on X triggered after the latter shared a flight simulator built entirely with AI.

I'll put it this way: If you have never tried to make a game, I am sure it is fun to have a game-making experience. For those who have made games, even just simple ones, getting stuff on the screen is not impressive, it's easy; it's making the game *good* that is hard. — Jonathan Blow (@Jonathan_Blow) February 25, 2025

Security vulnerabilities represent another significant risk. AI assistants don't inherently understand security best practices that are specific to a particular application. Blindly accepting AI-generated code could introduce security holes that might remain undetected until exploited.

""AI makes shit up. Code written by AI is almost always flat-out wrong,"" said Reddit user Dw444 in a recent post. ""My employer pays for AI assistants we can use for work, and even the most advanced models are prone to start writing blatantly incorrect code at the drop of a dime. You really don’t want to use AI code in [production].""

Quick reminder: I'm charging $1,000/hour to fix your vibe-coded mess. pic.twitter.com/iHQEEOMjXV — Santiago (@svpino) March 17, 2025

There's also concern about skill atrophy. If developers increasingly rely on AI for even moderate coding tasks, then their foundational skills might deteriorate over time.""Ease of use is a double-edged sword,"" AI researcher Harry Law told Business Insider. ""Beginners can make fast progress, but it might prevent them from learning about system architecture or performance.""

Debugging can also become particularly challenging when the original code wasn't human-written. As Andrew Chen noted, while getting the first 75% of a project done with AI might be trivial, refining and fixing it afterward can become extremely difficult.

Overall, the best approach thus far appears to be AI-assisted coding.

“Suffice to say (vibe coding) is not mainstream and the first few attempts at generating useful code—in a few minutes—were completely wrong,” AI developer Julian Harris wrote while describing his experience with vibe coding.

But he concluded, ""I found careful prompting with solid software engineering disciplines worked very well. With my background, I expect I’d have spent twice as long hand-writing it all, and honestly probably would’ve given up.""",decrypt

With 1,000x leverage, fractional trading, and enterprise-grade analytics, the exchange is shaping up to be one of the most innovative trading platforms in the space.

However, the real opportunity lies in DTX’s presale phase. Investors have a unique chance to double their token holdings before the official exchange listing. By using the LIST2X promo, early adopters can 4x their investment instead of just 2x, as the token moves from $0.18 to $0.36 at launch. This isn’t just another presale, it’s a game-changing offer that positions investors for maximum gains.

DTX Exchange’s proprietary Layer-1 VulcanX blockchain ensures ultra-fast transactions with 200,000 TPS. Additionally, security is a top priority, with it being audited by SolidProof, giving investors confidence in its long-term stability. The official launch of DTX tokens will create immense market demand, transforming this presale into a top investment choice across the crypto market.

XRP Price Prediction: Can Ripple Skyrocket

XRP price movements have historically been volatile, but 2025 could mark a turning point. Ripple’s payment solutions continue to attract financial institutions into partnerships so the platform emerges as an attractive investment opportunity. Despite SEC-related legal challenges Ripple has demonstrated strength and victory in such cases could drive the XRP price upward.

Historically, XRP price has experienced rapid surges, with one of the most notable being in 2018. The combination of rising institutional adoption and supportive market factors might drive Ripple toward $3 along with possibly surpassing this benchmark. Right now, the XRP price is hovering around $2.5, with a 14% increase in the last week.

While XRP price may see moderate growth if regulatory clarity improves, its potential pales in comparison to DTX, which is set for an immediate 2x listing increase and a fully decentralized trading model.

PEPE: A Meme Coin With Volatility Risks

PEPE, one of the leading meme coins, has shown strong exchange outflows in recent weeks, suggesting that investors are holding rather than selling. Technical indicators like the inverse head and shoulders pattern also signal potential gains.

However, PEPE growth remains highly speculative, relying purely on hype and market sentiment rather than fundamental value. While some traders may profit from short-term rallies, PEPE’s lack of utility and real-world adoption makes DTX a far better option.

Current technical indicator readings of MACD and RSI show bullish trends which forecast an upward movement in prices throughout the upcoming weeks. If PEPE can break past key resistance at $0.000008915, the next price target could be $0.00001457, marking a significant rally from its current level. However, currently, PEPE is trading at $0.000007255.

While PEPE may see short-term gains, DTX’s structured growth model, real-world adoption, and guaranteed listing increase make it a far superior investment.

Conclusion

Ripple has strong utility, but its growth is slow and uncertain due to ongoing regulatory concerns. PEPE has meme coin hype but lacks long-term fundamentals and real-world adoption. However, the biggest potential lies in DTX Exchange, where the 2x listing increase is the focal point for investors looking to 4x their holdings before launch.

As the presale nears its end, investors have a final chance to secure tokens before the exchange listing at a higher price. With a secure, fully-audited trading platform and a massive market potential, DTX is shaping up to be one of the biggest winners in 2025.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) turned early buyers into millionaires. Pepe Coin (PEPE) hit a $1.6 billion market cap practically overnight. That wasn’t luck, it was about being early.

Now we’re heading into the next exciting cycle, and the question isn’t if there will be another breakout—it’s which coin will lead the charge. BlockchainFX is setting up to be the next big play.

SHIB and PEPE made their mark through hype and community momentum. BlockchainFX is building momentum through actual utility. If you missed the last ride, you’ve got another shot; but you need to get in early.

1. Shiba Inu (SHIB) – The Billionaire Meme Coin

SHIB exploded onto the scene in 2020, following in the pawprints created by Dogecoin (DOGE). What started as an homage turned into a multi-billion-dollar ecosystem. ShibaSwap, staking, and the SHIB army kept the momentum alive.

SHIB is still a massive player in the broader crypto market, but it’s facing some structural problems:

High token supply = limited price movement.

Reliant on community hype rather than fundamentals.

Competing with other meme coins like FLOKI and PEPE.

Why SHIB Could Still Win:

SHIB remains one of the top 20 held and traded tokens.

ShibaSwap and staking mechanisms keep community engagement high.

If meme coins surge again, SHIB will likely lead the pack.

But here’s the problem: SHIB’s upside is capped by its supply and reliance on meme culture. Hype fades—but utility lasts.

2. Pepe Coin (PEPE) – The Meme Coin That Refused To Die

PEPE was supposed to be a temporary flash in the pan. It wasn’t. After hitting a $1.6 billion market cap in 2023, it somehow survived the inevitable fall off that followed. Why? The community. PEPE’s meme status keeps it alive—and that’s hard to replicate.

But PEPE has limits:

No staking or revenue model—purely community-driven.

Hype-based price swings = unpredictable returns.

No real ecosystem development.

Why PEPE Could Still Explode:

The meme coin market thrives on community strength.

If the meme coin cycle returns, PEPE is positioned to lead.

Massive liquidity = quick price moves during bullish runs.

PEPE is still alive because people want it to be alive. That’s powerful—but is it sustainable? Probably not.

3. BlockchainFX (BFX) – Utility + Passive Income = Next Big Play

This is where BlockchainFX changes the game. SHIB and PEPE thrive on hype. BlockchainFX is building a business model that rewards traders.

It’s the first trading super app where users can trade crypto, stocks, forex, ETFs, commodities, and bonds—all in one place. But the kicker? 70% of trading fees are redistributed to $BFX holders as staking rewards in $BFX and USDT.

Why BlockchainFX Could 1000x:

500+ tradable assets: Not just crypto—traditional finance too.

Instant multi-asset swaps: Trade Bitcoin for Gold or Solana for Tesla stock in seconds.

No staking fees: What you earn stays in your wallet.

Community governance: $BFX holders vote on platform decisions.

More trades = higher fees = bigger staking rewards. That’s just simple mathematics.

Which One Has the Most Upside?

Let’s break it down:

SHIB: Community strength will keep it alive, but the supply cap limits the upside.

PEPE: Meme power and community backing give it potential, but no utility = high risk.

BlockchainFX: Utility + staking rewards + passive income = scalable, sustainable upside.

PEPE and SHIB rely on momentum. BlockchainFX relies on actual business fundamentals.

What Is an Example of a Blockchain?

An example of a blockchain is Bitcoin—a decentralized ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions in blocks, secured by cryptography and validated by network participants (miners).

BlockchainFX leverages blockchain technology to execute trades instantly and redistribute trading fees to $BFX holders—creating a system where token holders earn from platform activity.

BFX v PEPE v SHIB – Choose Your Fighter

SHIB and PEPE made millionaires because of timing and hype. But hype fades. BlockchainFX is creating a system where value is built in.

SHIB will spike if meme coins rally.

PEPE could pop if the community holds strong.

BlockchainFX will generate consistent returns through staking and platform growth.

The presale starts on March 30. Early-stage buyers aren’t betting on hype, they’re betting on a system designed to pay them back. That’s the play.

Solana (SOL), once considered a top Ethereum rival, has recently encountered setbacks, including declining network activity and technical disruptions. As a result, many investors are exploring alternative opportunities, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gaining significant traction as a high-potential DeFi project offering real-world utility and long-term growth prospects.

Solana’s Recent Challenges

Solana has faced notable obstacles in recent months, with its network activity plunging by nearly 50% since the beginning of 2025. The number of active addresses has dropped from 5.69 million to 2.76 million, indicating waning user engagement. Additionally, a major outage in February resulted in a five-hour service disruption, raising concerns about Solana’s long-term stability and scalability.

Despite these setbacks, Solana remains a major player in the crypto space, having processed over 400 billion transactions and exceeded $1 trillion in total trading volume. However, investors searching for more stable and scalable alternatives are diversifying their portfolios, with Mutuum Finance emerging as a promising alternative in the DeFi sector.

Why Investors Are Turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM)

Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that enables users to earn passive income by supplying assets or accessing liquidity through overcollateralized loans. Unlike purely speculative assets, MUTM operates within a structured DeFi ecosystem, ensuring sustained demand and long-term value retention.

Mutuum Finance offers two distinct lending models, catering to different investor preferences:

Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Users can deposit assets such as ETH, USDT, and DAI into liquidity pools, earning variable APY based on borrowing demand . As utilization increases, so do the returns for liquidity providers.

Peer-to-Peer (P2P): This model allows users to negotiate custom loan terms , making it ideal for volatile assets like SHIB or PEPE , which are typically excluded from conventional DeFi lending platforms. Lenders can set personalized interest rates , giving them greater control over their returns.

For borrowers, Mutuum Finance provides access to liquidity while allowing them to retain asset ownership. For example, a user depositing $20,000 worth of ETH with a 65% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio can borrow up to $13,000 in USDT, enabling them to reinvest, trade, or cover expenses without selling their holdings.

By integrating flexible lending models with a self-sustaining token demand mechanism, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a key DeFi player, making MUTM an attractive investment for both short-term and long-term gains.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Strong Presale Momentum & Future Growth

Mutuum Finance’s ongoing presale has been a massive success, raising over $4.25 million, with 55% of Phase 3 already sold out. Currently priced at $0.02, the next phase will introduce a 25% price increase, making this one of the final chances for early investors to buy at a discount.

With a launch price of $0.06, early investors are guaranteed a 3x return upon listing, with analysts predicting even greater price potential as adoption grows. Unlike many new projects that launch without a functional product, Mutuum Finance is set to introduce its beta lending platform alongside its official token debut, ensuring immediate real-world use and demand.

As Solana faces declining engagement and network concerns, investors are actively seeking alternatives with strong fundamentals and sustainable growth strategies. Mutuum Finance’s DeFi lending ecosystem, rising presale demand, and structured investment approach make it one of the most compelling opportunities of 2024.

The Road Ahead: Major Developments & Exchange Listings

With upcoming exchange listings on the horizon, Mutuum Finance is set to gain significant visibility and liquidity, attracting an even larger investor base. Additionally, the team is working on launching an overcollateralized stablecoin, which will expand borrowing options and further solidify MUTM’s utility within the DeFi space.

As investors move away from underperforming assets, Mutuum Finance is quickly emerging as a top-tier alternative, offering passive income opportunities, sustainable tokenomics, and a rapidly growing ecosystem.

With the presale gaining momentum and key platform features set to launch soon, MUTM could become one of the most sought-after tokens of the year. For those looking to enter before broader market adoption drives prices higher, the current presale phase presents a strategic investment opportunity.
