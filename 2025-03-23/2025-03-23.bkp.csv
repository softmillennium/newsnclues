Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will hold a media conference at 12:30 ET (16:30 GMT) and is expected to call a snap election

To do so, Carney will need to call on Governor General Mary Simon to dissolve Parliament. Carney is scheduled to meet Simon at 12:00 ET (16:00 GMT)

It comes amid a souring relationship with neighbouring nation the US, as President Donald Trump wages a trade war against Canada

Trump has also said he wants Canada to become the 51st US state

When the election is called, the major federal parties will enter a period of full-swing campaigning that usually lasts five to seven weeks

Carney, leader of the Liberal Party, will face competition from Conservative's leader Pierre Poilievre, Jagmeet Singh - leader of the New Democratic Party, and Yves-Francois Blanchet - leader of the Bloc Québécois

Edited by Brandon Livesay and Tinshui Yeung

We've been introducing the key leaders vying for power when Canada's federal election is called.

Let's now talk about Jagmeet Singh.

Singh, 46, is leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP), a left-leaning party that traditionally focuses on worker and labour issues.

He made history in 2017 when he became the first ethnic minority and practising Sikh to lead a major political party in Canada.

In 2019, the former criminal defence lawyer was elected as an MP in a British Columbia riding, where he has served in public office since.

The NDP had helped the Trudeau Liberal government keep its hold on power since 2021, supporting it with needed votes in Parliament in exchange for support on progressive legislation.

But in late 2024, Singh tore up that ""supply and confidence"" agreement after Trudeau's cabinet directed its industrial relations board to impose binding arbitration to end a work stoppage at Canada's two largest railways.

At the time, Singh had said that the Liberals didn't ""deserve another chance from Canadians"".

A big question will be whether the NDP will be able to grow the number of seats they occupy in the House of Commons and maintain official party status.

We're taking you through the big names in Canadian politics, and next up is leader of the opposition.

Pierre Poilievre is known for his confrontational style of politics.

In recent years, Poilievre has tirelessly attacked the Liberals and Trudeau, saying that their ""disastrous"" and ""woke"" policies have worsened the quality of life in Canada, while promising a return to ""common sense politics"" if his party were to form government.

It is a message that has resonated with many Canadians who have been worried about the country's housing crisis, stagnant wages and high cost of living.

But Poilievre has also been criticised for his populist style of politics and has drawn comparisons to Donald Trump – at a time when Canadians have rejected the US president's tariffs and his rhetoric that Canada should become the ""51st state"".

Poilievre has sought to shift his messaging since, distancing himself from Trump and vowing to put ""Canada first"".

We're now going to take you through the four big names to know when a snap election is called.

Let's start with the current PM, Mark Carney.

Carney, 59, has only been on the job for a handful of days.

His party overwhelmingly chose him - with more than 80% of the vote - to succeed Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader earlier this month. 

For many in Canada and the UK, Carney is a familiar face. He was head of both the Banks of Canada and England, serving at the former during the 2008 financial crash and the latter during Brexit.

Carney is hailed for his financial expertise. He has also taken a defiant stance against US President Donald Trump, vowing retaliation against his tariffs and stating that Canada will never become the 51st state.

But Carney is politically untested. He has never held elected public office in Canada. And he is not strong with his French, which could be a liability in the French-language debate and the province of Quebec.

Mark Carney speaks to the gathered press outside Rideau Hall following his swearing-in last week

At midday in Ottawa (16:00 GMT), Mark Carney will arrive at Rideau Hall in Ottawa for a meeting with Canada's Governor General.

Then at 12:30 (16:30 GMT), he's scheduled to hold a media conference. 

Rideau Hall is a historic building in the centre of the capital, overlooking the Ottawa River. Carney and his new cabinet were sworn in there last week.

It's also the official residence of Governor General Mary Simon, who represents Canada's head of state, King Charles III.

Like in other Commonwealth countries, the King – and by extension, Simon – has a largely ceremonial role in Canada's political system.

But in order to call a snap election, Carney needs to request Simon to dissolve Parliament.

Watch: Moment Justin Trudeau resigns as Canadian prime minister

Justin Trudeau led Canada for almost 10 years, from his first election as Liberal leader in the fall of 2015 to now. After Trudeau announced he would step down, the Liberal party voted for Mark Carney to replace him.

Trudeau oversaw one of the more tumultuous periods in the country's history, which included dealing with the first Trump administration, the Covid-19 pandemic and Donald Trump's latest tariffs against Canada.

Trudeau legalised marijuana federally in Canada, and has been credited with helping bring in consequential social programs like $10-a-day childcare and a national dental care programme for low-income Canadians.

On his last day in office, Trudeau posted a goodbye video on his social media accounts.

“I'm proud to have served a country full of people who stand up for what's right, rise to every occasion and always have each other's backs when it matters most,” Trudeau says in the video.

“This may be my last day here in this office, but I will always be boldly and unapologetically Canadian. My only ask is that no matter what the world throws at us, you always be the same.”

In another sign that the new prime minister is preparing to call a snap election today, Mark Carney's Liberal Party took to social media late on Saturday to confirm where he plans to run.

The Liberals say the former central banker will launch his first bid for elected office in the suburban Ottawa riding of Nepean.

""Ottawa is where Mark Carney raised his family, devoted his career to public service, and always gave back to his community,"" the party wrote on X, adding it's ""thrilled"" to announce he will be its candidate for Nepean in the next election.

Carney's race will take place in a district that was once part of Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre's former riding of Nepean-Carleton. It was redistributed as the Carleton riding in 2015, and the two ridings now border each other.

A riding is the term used to describe an electoral district.

'It's frustrating' - How Trump's tariffs are being received in Canada

The BBC hit the streets in Canada to find out how locals were feeling about the escalating trade war with the US, brought on by President Donald Trump's tariffs.

""What an idiotic thing for an American president to do,"" one person said. Many of them said they were going out of their way to buy Canadian products over American-made goods.

Check out the video above to see what these Canadians had to say.

Hundreds gathered in Toronto yesterday to protest against America and President Donald Trump. 

The protest was part of the grassroots ""Elbows Up, Canada!"" campaign being launched in response to President Trump's comments that he wants Canada to become the 51st US state, as well as the escalating trade war started by the US. 

Elbows up is a hockey phrase being repurposed as a slogan to push back against the US.

Russian drones strike Kyiv ahead of peace talks

Edited by Matt Spivey

Earlier, we heard US envoy Steve Witkoff say that he is hopeful for ""real progress"" in Ukraine peace talks over the next two days.

The US has taken a leading role in negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. 

But the UK and EU have been working on plans for what peace could look like, including putting peacekeeping troops on the ground in Ukraine. 

US envoy Steve Wtikoff dismissed this plan as ""a posture and pose"" in an interview with pro-Trump journalist Tucker Carlson. 

Witkoff said the idea was based on a ""simplistic"" notion from the UK prime minister and other European leaders.

""Russians are going to march across Europe. That is preposterous by the way. We have something called Nato that we did not have in World War Two.""

Starmer also welcomed Schoof to Downing Street ahead of a bilateral meeting back in February

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Prime Minister Dick Schoof of the Netherlands spoke today about Ukraine, Downing Street says.

The pair agreed that ""continued political momentum and action driven by the members of the Coalition of the Willing, is vital to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position for a secure and lasting peace,"" a statement from No 10 says.

They also agreed that much closer cooperation in Europe on defence capabilities will be ""vitally important"" in the coming decades in order to protect Europe and secure its future, the statement adds.

Speaking on Air Force One on Saturday night, US President Donald Trump told sports journalist Clay Travis, external that there's nobody in the world that can stop Putin ""except me"".

In the interview, he says: ""I think I'm going to be able to stop him.""

""We've had some very rational discussions, and I just want to see the people stop getting killed,"" Trump adds. 

US envoy Steve Witkoff says that the United States is expecting to see ""real progress"" at the next round of peace talks, beginning with Ukraine today in Saudi Arabia.   

In an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Witkoff says ""our job is to narrow the issues, bring the parties together and stop the killing"".  

He says progress is expected on issues like the Black Sea and shipping. ""And from that, you'll naturally gravitate into a full on shooting ceasefire."" 

Witkoff thinks Russian President Vladimir Putin ""wants peace"" and says lots of progress has already been made in calls between Trump and his Russian counterpart over the past week.

Last night, Witkoff praised Putin and told journalist Tucker Carlson that he ""liked"" the leader.  

Saudi Arabia will host more peace talks on Sunday and Monday this week, with delegations from Ukraine, Russia and the US all expected to attend - though not all at the same time.

Ukraine's team will first meet the US delegation on Sunday evening, a member of the Ukrainian delegation told AFP.

The US team will then meet their Russian counterparts in Saudi Arabia on Monday.

Kyiv says it wants an end to strikes on its energy infrastructure, and to retain control of its land. Moscow is calling for an end of military aid and intelligence sharing in Ukraine.

Following the deadly strikes in Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says that ""new decisions and new pressure on Moscow are needed to bring an end to these strikes and this war"".

The Ukrainian president adds ""these attacks are a daily reality"". 

He calls for  ""more effective"" sanctions against Russia as the weapons used against his country use foreign parts.

""Every loophole that allows them to bypass the sanctions regime must be eliminated.""

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov

Vladimir Putin's spokesperson has described a phone call this week between the Russian president and his US counterpart Donald Trump as  ""constructive"" and ""very respectful"".

Dmitry Peskov told Russian state media that the call was another step towards organising a face-to-face meeting between the two leaders.

""Such a meeting must be adequately prepared. First,
difficult technical talks must be held. And just on Monday, our negotiators will go
to Riyadh to start this complex process,"" Peskov adds.

Trump earlier said his call with Putin was ""a very good and productive one"", with an agreement reached on ""an immediate ceasefire on all energy and infrastructure"".

The Russian Defence Ministry says it shot down 59 Ukrainian drones overnight. 

It says these were across a number of regions in the south of the country, and in Crimea, a peninsula illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. 

In the aftermath of heavy shelling on Ukraine overnight, one Kyiv resident tells Reuters they want a ceasefire agreement because there is ""constant stress"" from ""being under attack all the time"". 

Mykhailo Krytsiuk adds that the quality of life has deteriorated too, and a ceasefire would help economically.  

""If the war freezes, then there is a hope that it will bring at least some comfort,"" he says.  

""But I do not believe in a full ceasefire, I do not believe in total safety because we have seen how our bad neighbour (Russia) behaves,"" he says.   

It's a sentiment echoed by another local, Serhiy Kolomiiets, who says talks continue between officials ""while ordinary people... ordinary children will be suffering.""

In the aftermath of drone strikes on Ukraine overnight, which killed three people in Kyiv, debris from damaged buildings has piled up.

President Zelensky says a father and his five-year-old daughter were among the casualties.   

Drone debris hit an apartment block, which caused fires in the residences.    

The Ukrainian Air Force says it shot down 97 of 147 drones, with 25 others being successfully diverted.

Russian strikes on Ukraine overnight have killed three people in Kyiv and left several injured, local officials say. One witness has said ""everyone started screaming and running"" as debris hit an apartment block.

Ukraine's air force says it has shot down 97 of 147 drones launched into the country.

Meanwhile, Russia's defence ministry says it shot down almost 60 Ukrainian drones and say one person was killed after a car caught fire following strikes.

Following the attacks in his nation's capital, Ukrainian President Zelensky has called for fresh pressure on Russia. 

It comes as the Kremlin says they are a step closer to a face-face meeting between Trump and Putin - but a spokesperson says ""difficult"" technical talks need to be had before this can progress. 

US and Ukraine delegations will meet in Saudi Arabia on Sunday, as Washington seeks to negotiate to a potential end to the conflict. On Monday, the US is expected to meet with Russian counterparts.

Putin has rejected a joint US-Ukrainian call for a full and immediate 30-day pause, proposing instead to halt attacks only on energy facilities.

Ukraine's much-hyped 2023 counteroffensive against Russia was doomed from the start, Czech President Petr Pavel has said. 

Pavel, a former senior military commander, made the comments in an interview with European Pravda published on Saturday. He warned that, given the diminishing foreign aid and acute personnel shortages, Ukraine will not be able to win back any territory “without huge losses.” 

“That is why my quite realistic assessment was that this conflict, without changing the [existing] parameters, will most probably end up with some compromise. And now we are heading to such a compromise,” he said. Pavel went on to suggest that Kiev's much-hyped 2023 counteroffensive was destined to fail. 

“Even before Ukraine started its big counteroffensive two years ago, it was not well equipped to really succeed,” Pavel said. “For a successful offensive, the military theory says that you need a ratio of at least two – or preferably five – to one.”

At that time, the force ratio between Ukraine and Russia was still in favor of Russia. So it was quite obvious that the counteroffensive will not be as successful in liberating all of the territories.

The former general argued that Kiev and its Western backers need to come to terms with the prospect that “part of the territory of Ukraine is and will for some time be temporarily occupied by Russia.” He stressed, however, that the EU should not recognize Crimea or the Donbass regions as Russian territory. 

According to Pavel, the EU must continue to support Ukraine to the extent that it will not lose more land and to “create conditions for a ceasefire and subsequent peace.”

In early June 2023, Ukraine launched its ill-fated push using newly formed brigades and Western-trained crews operating Challenger 2 and Leopard 2 tanks. The troops attacked the Russians on multiple sections of the front line but failed to penetrate through heavy fortifications and thick minefields, losing many men and pieces of Western-supplied armor. The Ukrainian army only managed to capture several small villages, all of which have since been recaptured by the Russians.

Thousands of Ukrainian migrants are at risk of losing their jobs and housing in the UK amid uncertainties over visa renewals, The Telegraph reported on Friday, citing a new survey by the University of Birmingham.

Around 270,000 Ukrainian citizens currently live in the UK under special schemes such as ‘Homes for Ukraine', which offered three-year visas to those fleeing the conflict with Russia. This scheme, however, has been closed to new applicants, and existing visas are now beginning to expire. While a new ‘Ukraine Permission Extension Scheme' allows 18-month visa renewals, applications were not accepted until February 4, creating a backlog and leaving many in legal limbo.

According to a survey of over 1,100 Ukrainian migrants, 41% said they have lost job opportunities, and 22% have been denied contract renewals due to their uncertain immigration status. Around 26% said they could not renew their rental agreements, while a quarter were unable to sign new leases.

Respondents also reported increased mental stress, with 43.5% citing anxiety and panic attacks related to their immigration status. More than half of the Ukrainian refugees surveyed said they have school-aged children, which adds to concerns over long-term stability.

The researchers behind the study have urged the UK government to automatically extend visas for Ukrainians, but Labour MP Emily Thornberry, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, said the findings reflect systemic issues, with most migrants with temporary visas facing similar problems.

Commenting on the report, a government spokesman said the UK remains “fully committed” to supporting Ukrainian migrants and continues to review its visa programs. He did not comment on whether the process would be streamlined or made automatic, however.

The news comes as many other countries in Europe face challenges dealing with the influx of Ukrainian migrants. According to Eurostat, more than 4.3 million Ukrainians are registered for temporary protection across the EU.

While Brussels insists that support must continue and has recently extended its visa scheme for Ukrainians until March 2026, many member states have signaled reluctance to continue the same level of support.

Germany, which hosts over 1.2 million Ukrainian refugees, has debated cutting welfare benefits, citing sustainability concerns. Poland has expressed opposition to taking in more migrants under the EU's new migration pact, while the Czech Republic has announced plans to end preferential treatment for Ukrainian asylum seekers.

NASA has scrubbed its public commitment to land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon under its Artemis lunar program.

The change comes in response to US President Donald Trump's campaign to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies in all federal agencies.

Artemis aims to land humans on the Moon for the first time since 1972. The space agency previously said on its website that it would land “the first woman, the first person of color, and the first international partner astronaut” on the lunar surface.

NASA has since updated the Artemis webpage to remove all references to diversity. The new statement reads that Artemis III will “send the first humans to explore the lunar South Pole region.” It is unclear when the edits were made. The changes were first noticed by British science journalist Oliver Morton and reported by the Orlando Sentinel on Friday.

“In keeping with the president's executive order, we're updating our language regarding plans to send crew to the lunar surface as part of NASA's Artemis campaign,” a NASA spokesperson said in a statement. “We look forward to learning more from [and] about the Trump administration's plans for our agency and expanding exploration at the Moon and Mars for the benefit of all.”

The Artemis II crew, which in 2026 will perform a lunar flyby without landing, still includes female astronaut Christina Koch and African American astronaut Victor Glover.

NASA has been accused in the past of lacking diversity and has had a reputation of being staffed by “old, white men,” according to The Guardian. All astronauts who walked on the Moon on Apollo missions were white men. In recent years, NASA launched its ‘Diversity in Employment Opportunities' initiative, which remains listed on its official website.

In January, Trump signed an executive order aimed at dismantling DEI programs and “restoring merit-based” hiring. In line with the directive, the space agency has started to dissolve its Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity.

“These programs divided Americans by race, wasted taxpayer dollars, and resulted in shameful discrimination,” NASA acting administrator Janet Petro wrote in a memo in January obtained by SpaceNews.

Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam has warned that Israeli airstrikes could drag the country into a “new war,” following deadly attacks on towns in the south.

According to a statement published on his official website on Saturday, the prime minister “warned of renewed military operations on the southern border, because of the risks they carry dragging the country into a new war, which will bring woes to Lebanon and the Lebanese people.” Salam also stressed the need to ensure that “the [Lebanese] state alone has the power to decide war and peace.”

He also called on the UN to apply pressure on Israel to withdraw from Lebanon, warning that continued hostilities threaten the truce currently in place.

On Saturday, Israeli jets struck Tyre, Zibqin, and Qlaileh. The Israeli military said the action was “in response to the rocket fire at Israel” from around 6km north of the border. West Jerusalem blamed Hezbollah for the launches and said it targeted the group's rocket sites.

In a separate statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he and Defense Minister Israel Katz ordered the military “to act forcefully against dozens of terror targets in Lebanon.” Netanyahu added that the Lebanese government is responsible for “everything taking place within its territory.”

Hezbollah has denied involvement, calling the accusations a pretext for further aggression.

Lebanon's Health Ministry reported that one person was killed in Tyre and four wounded in Qlaileh. Earlier raids on Touline left five dead, including two children, with 11 others injured.

The fighting began when Hezbollah opened fire on Israeli positions in support of Gaza, following West Jerusalem's military response to Hamas' October 7 attack, in which 1,200 people were killed and 250 were taken hostage.

Cross-border clashes later escalated into a full Israeli offensive that killed senior Hezbollah figures, destroyed weapons stockpiles, and caused mass civilian casualties.

A ceasefire has been in effect since November under a US-brokered deal requiring both sides to halt military operations along the border.

Andrea Tenenti, the spokesperson for the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, called the situation “very concerning” and urged “maximum restraint.” He said intense negotiations are underway “to prevent any escalation of the conflict and of the tension – something that no one wants to see after 16 months of conflict in this region.”

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday that the days when politics was “directed through street terror” were “a thing of the past”. Meanwhile, clashes erupted between police and protesters in Istanbul on Saturday during a fourth day of demonstrations following the detention of the city's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu.

ISTANBUL (AP) — A court formally arrested the mayor of Istanbul, a key rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on Sunday and ordered him jailed pending the outcome of a trial on corruption charges.

Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was detained following a raid on his residence earlier this week, sparking the largest wave of street demonstrations in Turkey in more than a decade. It also deepened concerns over democracy and rule of law in Turkey.

His imprisonment is widely regarded as a political move to remove a major contender from the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. Government officials reject the accusations and insist that Turkey's courts operate independently.

The prosecutor's office said the court decided to jail Imamoglu on suspicion of running a criminal organization, accepting bribes, extortion, illegally recording personal data and bid-rigging. A request for him to be imprisoned on terror-related charges was rejected although he still faces prosecution. Following the court's ruling, Imamoglu was transferred to Silivri prison, west of Istanbul.

The Interior Ministry later announced that Imamoglu had been suspended from duty as a “temporary measure.” The municipality had previously appointed an acting mayor from its governing council.

Alongside Imamoglu, 47 other people were also jailed pending trial, including a key aide and two district mayors from Istanbul, one of whom was replaced with a government appointee. A further 44 suspects were released under judicial control.




Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said Sunday that 323 people were detained the previous evening over disturbances at protests. 

Largely peaceful protests across Turkey have seen hundreds of thousands come out in support of Imamoglu. However, there has been some violence, with police deploying water cannons, tear gas, pepper spray and firing plastic pellets at protesters in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir, some of whom hurled stones, fireworks and other missiles at riot police.

The formal arrest came as more than 1.5 million members of the opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP, began holding a primary presidential election to endorse Imamoglu, the sole candidate.

The party has also set up symbolic ballot boxes nationwide to allow people who are not party members to express their support for the mayor. Large crowds gathered early Sunday to cast a “solidarity ballot.”

“This is no longer just a problem of the Republican People's Party, but a problem of Turkish democracy,” Fusun Erben, 69, said at a polling station in Istanbul's Kadikoy district. “We do not accept our rights being so easily usurped. We will fight until the end.”

Speaking at a polling station in Bodrum, western Turkey, engineer Mehmet Dayanc, 38, said he feared that “in the end we'll be like Russia, a country without an opposition, where only a single man participates in elections.”

In a message posted on social media, Imamoglu called on people to show “their struggle for democracy and justice to the entire world” at the ballot box. He warned Erdogan that he would be defeated by “our righteousness, our courage, our humility, our smiling face.”

“Honestly, we are embarrassed in the name of our legal system,” Ankara Mayor Mansur Yavas, a fellow member of Imamoglu's CHP, told reporters after casting his vote, criticizing the lack of confidentiality in the proceedings.

CHP leader Ozgur Ozel said Imamoglu's imprisonment was reminiscent of “Italian mafia methods.” Speaking at Istanbul City Hall, he added: “Imamoglu is on the one hand in prison and on the other hand on the way to the presidency.”

The Council of Europe, which focuses on promoting human rights and democracy, slammed the decision and demanded Imamoglu's immediate release.

The German government called the mayor's imprisonment “a serious setback for democracy in Turkey,” adding that “political competition must not be conducted with courts and prisons.”

Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and an author of a biography of Erdogan, said the president was “determined to do whatever it takes to end Imamoglu's career.”

Before his detention, Imamoglu had already faced multiple criminal cases that could result in prison sentences and a political ban. He was also appealing a 2022 conviction for insulting members of Turkey's Supreme Electoral Council.

Earlier in the week, a university nullified his diploma, citing alleged irregularities in his transfer from a private university in northern Cyprus some 30 years ago. The decision effectively bars him from running for president, since the position requires candidates to be university graduates. Imamoglu had vowed to challenge the decision.

Imamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey's largest city in March 2019, in a major blow to Erdogan and the president's Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. Erdogan's party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.

The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won.

The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which the CHP made significant gains against Erdogan's governing party.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — More than 50,000 Palestinians have now been killed in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, the territory's Health Ministry said Sunday, as new Israeli airstrikes killed at least 26 Palestinians overnight, including a Hamas political leader and several women and children.

Israel's military also sent ground troops into part of the southern city of Rafah as thousands of Palestinians fled after new evacuation orders.

Israel ended the latest ceasefire last week with a surprise wave of strikes that killed hundreds, and it has launched ground incursions in northern Gaza. The military claimed to have “eliminated” dozens of militants in recent days.

Israel's Cabinet late Saturday approved a proposal to set up a new directorate for advancing the “voluntary departure” of Palestinians in line with U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to depopulate Gaza and rebuild it for others. Palestinians say they do not want to leave their homeland, and rights groups say the plan could amount to expulsion in violation of international law.




The military ordered people to leave Rafah's already heavily destroyed Tel al-Sultan neighborhood on foot along a single route to Muwasi, a sprawling area of squalid tent camps. The war has forced most of Gaza's population of over 2 million to flee within the territory, often multiple times.

“It's displacement under fire,” said Mustafa Gaber, a journalist who left with his family. He said tank and drone fire echoed nearby.

“The shells are falling among us and the bullets are (flying) above us,” said Amal Nassar, also displaced from Rafah. “The elderly have been thrown into the streets. An old woman was telling her son, ‘Go and leave me to die.' Where will we go?”

“Enough is enough. We are exhausted,” said a fleeing Ayda Abu Shaer, as black smoke rose in the distance.

The Palestinian Red Crescent emergency service said it lost contact with a team of medics responding to the strikes. Spokesperson Nebal Farsakh said some were wounded.

There was no immediate comment from Israel's military, which says it only targets militants. Israel blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas.

Hamas said Salah Bardawil, a well-known member of its political bureau, was killed in a strike in Muwasi that also killed his wife. Israel's military confirmed that.

Hospitals in southern Gaza said they received a further 24 bodies from strikes overnight, including several women and children.

Gaza's Health Ministry said 50,021 Palestinians have been killed in the war and over 113,000 have been wounded. That includes 673 people killed since Israel's bombardment on Tuesday shattered the ceasefire.

Dr. Munir al-Boursh, the ministry's general director, said the dead include 15,613 children, with 872 of them under 1 year old.

The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but says women and children make up over half the dead. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 fighters, without providing evidence.

The ceasefire that took hold in January paused more than a year of fighting ignited by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage. Most captives have been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

In the latest ceasefire's first phase, 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others were released in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces pulled back, allowing hundreds of thousands of people to return to what remains of their homes. There was a surge in humanitarian aid until Israel cut off all supplies to Gaza earlier this month to pressure Hamas to change the ceasefire agreement.

The sides were supposed to begin negotiations in early February on the ceasefire's next phase, in which Hamas was to release the remaining 59 hostages — 35 of them believed to be dead — in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal. Those talks never began.

Hundreds of Israelis gathered outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office in Jerusalem on Sunday to protest his handling of the war and his attempt to dismiss the head of the Shin Bet internal security service.

“I'm worried for the future of this country. And I think it has to stop. We have to change direction,” said one protester, Avital Halperin.

Israel's cabinet passed a measure Sunday creating 13 new settlements in the occupied West Bank by rezoning existing ones, according to Bezalel Smotrich, Israel's far-right finance minister, who is in charge of settlement construction.

This brings the number of settlements, considered illegal by the majority of the international community, to 140, said anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now. They will now receive independent budgets from Israel and can elect their own local governments, the group said.

In a separate development, Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who are allied with Hamas, launched another missile at Israel overnight. The Israeli military said it was intercepted, and there were no reports of casualties or damage.

The Houthis resumed attacks on Israel after it ended the Gaza ceasefire, portraying them as an act of solidarity with the Palestinians. Trump ordered the renewal of U.S. strikes on the rebels last week over its previous attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea.

Most of the ships the rebels have targeted have no connection to the conflict.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — At least seven people were killed after Russia launched a barrage of drones across Ukraine overnight on Sunday, according to local Ukrainian officials and emergency services.

The attacks, including on the capital, Kyiv, came ahead of ceasefire negotiations in Saudi Arabia in which Ukraine and Russia are expected to hold indirect U.S.-mediated talks on Monday to discuss a pause in long-range attacks targeting energy facilities and civilian infrastructure.

The Ukrainian delegation is expected to meet with U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia a day ahead of the indirect talks, Ukraine's President Voldoymyr Zelenskyy said. Ukraine is planning to send technical teams to discuss the details of the partial ceasefire. 

Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said he expected “some real progress” at the talks in Saudi Arabia, “particularly as it affects a Black Sea ceasefire on ships between both countries, and from that you'll naturally gravitate into a full-on shooting ceasefire.”

Asked about concerns that Russian President Vladimir Putin may be looking beyond Ukraine and could press further into Europe, even if Russia is awarded territory within Ukraine now, Witkoff said he has been asked his opinion on what Putin's motives are on a large scale.

“I simply have said that I just don't see that he wants to take all of Europe. This is a much different situation than it was in World War II. In World War II there was no NATO. You have countries that are armed there. I take him at his word in this sense. And I think the Europeans are beginning to come to that belief, too. But it sort of doesn't matter. That's an academic issue. … The agenda is stop the killing, stop the carnage, let's end this thing.”

Asked whether he was convinced that Putin wanted peace, Witkoff said: “I feel that he wants peace.”

Russia launched 147 drones across Ukraine overnight, according to the Ukrainian Air Force. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 97, and 25 others didn't reach targets due to Ukrainian countermeasures. The attacks struck the Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, Odesa and Donetsk regions, as well as the capital, Kyiv.

Three people, including a 5-year-old child, were killed and 10 others were injured in a drone attack on Kyiv, the city's military administration said. Extended sounds of explosions were heard across the Ukrainian capital in the early hours as the air raid blared for over five hours. Russian drones and debris from shot-down drones, which were flying at lower altitudes to evade air defenses, fell on residential buildings. 

Residents in Kyiv surveyed the damage done to their homes and neighborhoods on Sunday morning. Many were disparaging of the upcoming ceasefire talks, pointing to the burned out properties destroyed in the drone attack, saying these were more indicative of Russia's true intentions.

In an old multistory building on Kyiv's left bank that was damaged in the overnight attack, Dmytro Zapadnya, 37, said he had no faith in Russia upholding any ceasefire agreement.

“There is no point in signing anything (with Russians), because it will not be worth the cost of paper where you put this signature. Well, the only thing that is not very pleasant is that now the United States seems to have little understanding of our situation,” he said.

Elsewhere, four people were killed in Russian attacks on Ukraine's Donetsk region, regional Gov. Vadym Filashkin said, including three who died in a strike on the frontline town of Dobropillya.

In a statement on social media, Zelenskyy said attacks such as the one in Kyiv were a daily occurrence for Ukraine.

“This week alone, more than 1,580 guided aerial bombs, almost 1,100 strike drones and 15 missiles of various types were used against our people,” he said. “New solutions are needed, with new pressure on Moscow to stop both these strikes and this war.”

Also on Sunday, Russia's Ministry of Defense said it had shot down 59 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 29 over the region of Rostov and 20 more over southwestern Astrakhan. In Rostov, one person was killed and a car caught fire due to the Ukrainian drone attack, according to the area's temporary governor, Yuri Slyusar.

A woman also died in the Russian border village of Novostroyevka-Pervaya in the Belgorod region when a Ukrainian drone hit a car in which she was traveling.

The driver, the woman's daughter, was also seriously injured in the attack, said local Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov.

The U.S. has lifted bounties on three senior Taliban figures, including the interior minister who also heads a powerful network blamed for bloody attacks against Afghanistan's former Western-backed government, officials in Kabul said Sunday.

Sirajuddin Haqqani, who acknowledged planning a January 2008 attack on the Serena Hotel in Kabul, which killed six people, including U.S. citizen Thor David Hesla, no longer appears on the State Department's Rewards for Justice website. The FBI website on Sunday still featured a wanted poster for him.

Interior Ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani said the U.S. government had revoked the bounties placed on Haqqani, Abdul Aziz Haqqani, and Yahya Haqqani.

“These three individuals are two brothers and one paternal cousin,” Qani told The Associated Press.

The Haqqani network grew into one of the deadliest arms of the Taliban after the U.S.-led 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. The group employed roadside bombs, suicide bombings and other attacks, including on the Indian and U.S. embassies, the Afghan presidency, and other major targets. They also have been linked to extortion, kidnapping and other criminal activity.

A Foreign Ministry official, Zakir Jalaly, said the Taliban's release of U.S. prisoner George Glezmann on Friday and the removal of bounties showed both sides were “moving beyond the effects of the wartime phase and taking constructive steps to pave the way for progress” in bilateral relations.

“The recent developments in Afghanistan-U.S. relations are a good example of the pragmatic and realistic engagement between the two governments,” said Jalaly.




Another official, Shafi Azam, hailed the development as the beginning of normalization, also citing the Taliban's announcement they were in control of Afghanistan's embassy in Norway. 

Since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, China has been the most prominent country to accept one of their diplomats. Other countries have accepted de facto Taliban representatives, like Qatar, which has been a key mediator between the U.S. and the Taliban. U.S. envoys have also met the Taliban.

The Taliban rule, especially bans affecting women and girls, has triggered widespread condemnation and deepened their international isolation.

Haqqani has previously spoken out against the Taliban's decision-making process, authoritarianism and alienation of the Afghan population. 

He has been under U.N. sanctions since 2007, because of his involvement with the network founded by his father, Jalaluddin. 

But the global body has allowed him to travel in the past 12 months, including to the United Arab Emirates to meet the country's leadership and to Saudi Arabia for pilgrimage. Those were his first trips abroad since the Taliban takeover.

Ibraheem Bahiss, a senior analyst with International Crisis Group's Asia program, said the removal of the bounties was a win for Taliban officials wanting to do business with the international community. The U.S. was showing it could reward those who made compromises within their own remit, even if these compromises didn't translate to national policy, he said. 

The international community had made demands of the Taliban, specifically lifting restrictions on women and girls, but offered nothing in return, said Bahiss. Scrapping bounties was a sign that small diplomatic overtures were possible.

While recognition as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan might not immediately be on the horizon, the Taliban viewed normalization as enough progress given their existing diplomatic inroads in the region, according to Bahiss.

“For the Taliban, the removal of sanctions is more important than (official) recognition. Sanctions bite. They inhibit your ability to do business, to travel. That's why they would celebrate this as a victory. The transactional nature of this diplomacy suits both the Taliban and Trump.”

His partial rehabilitation on the international stage is in contrast to the status of the reclusive Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, who could face arrest by the International Criminal Court for his persecution of women.

Police and protesters clashed outside the Istanbul City Hall on Saturday while detained Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was questioned at the courthouse, over allegations of corruption and terror links. Crowds began to rally outside the city hall for a fourth night in a show of support to the mayor. Others gathered outside the courthouse.

ISTANBUL (AP) — Prosecutors early Sunday requested that detained Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, the top challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, be formally arrested over allegations of corruption and terror links.

A court is now set to decide whether the popular opposition figure will be charged and jailed pending a trial.



The arrest this week of Imamoglu has intensified political tensions and sparked widespread protests across Turkey, with demonstrators rallying in multiple cities to voice their opposition.



Many view his arrest as a politically driven attempt to remove Imamoglu from the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. Government officials reject the accusation and say Turkey's courts are independent. 



Police questioned Imamoglu for around five hours on Saturday as part of an investigation into allegations of aiding the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, the Cumhuriyet newspaper reported. A day earlier he was questioned for four hours over the corruption accusations. The mayor rejected all charges during both interrogations.



He was later transferred to a courthouse for questioning by prosecutors along with some 90 other people who were also detained with him.



Authorities barred access to the courthouse using barricades on local roads and closing nearby metro stations. Hundreds of police officers and over a dozen water cannon trucks were deployed. Still, hundreds gathered in front of the building shouting: “Rights, law, justice!”










Others gathered outside the Istanbul city hall or took to the streets to denounce the mayor's resignation for a fourth night of nationwide protests, in the largest wave of street demonstrations in Turkey in more than a decade.



The demonstrations were largely peaceful but a group of protesters, trying to break through barricades to reach Istanbul's main square, threw flares, stones and other objects at police, which responded with pepper spray. Some demonstrators said rubber bullets were fired.

Police used water cannons and tear gas to scatter demonstrators in Ankara.



Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said 323 people were detained following protests Saturday night. Earlier, he said: “There will be no tolerance for those who seek to violate societal order, threaten the people's peace and security, and pursue chaos and provocation.”

Imamoglu was detained on Wednesday following a dawn raid on his residence over allegations of financial crimes and links to Kurdish militants. Dozens of other prominent figures, including two district mayors, were also detained.



The Istanbul governor's office announced it was expanding a ban on demonstrations until March 26 and imposed restrictions on the entry and exit of vehicles deemed to be transporting people “likely to participate in unlawful activities.”



Erdogan on Saturday accused the leadership of the opposition CHP of turning the party “into an apparatus to absolve a handful of municipal robbers who have become blinded by money.”



He also accused it of “doing everything to disturb the public peace, to polarize the nation.”







Imamoglu's arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People's Party's presidential candidate in a primary on Sunday. Ozel has said that the primary, where around 1.5 million delegates can vote, will go ahead as planned.

The opposition party has also urged citizens to participate in a symbolic election on Sunday — through improvised ballot boxes to be set up across Turkey — to show solidarity with Imamoglu.



In a tweet posted shortly before his arrival at the courthouse, Imamoglu urged the public to safeguard the ballot boxes for Sunday's primary, “Don't forget: they are very afraid of you and your democratic right to vote.”



In an earlier message, Imamoglu described his arrest as a “coup” and accused the government of exploiting the judiciary and worsening the country's troubled economy.

ROME (AP) — Pope Francis returned home to the Vatican on Sunday after he was hospitalized for five weeks with a life-threatening bout of pneumonia.

The 88-year-old pope suffered two life-threatening crises while hospitalized, but by the beginning of the fourth week doctors said he was no longer in critical condition. After two weeks of stable condition, they said he was well enough to continue his convalescence at the Vatican. 

Here are highlights of the longest hospital stay of Francis' 12-year papacy, based on details provided by the Vatican:

Pope Francis is hospitalized with bronchitis and a slight fever immediately following a morning of audiences. Doctors diagnose a respiratory tract infection.

Pope Francis is diagnosed with polymicrobial (bacterial, viral and fungal) infection in the respiratory passages, marking a setback.

An X-ray indicates Pope Francis has developed pneumonia in both lungs, marking another setback; cortisone and antibiotic treatments are confirmed.

Pope's doctors say at a news conference that the pope remains in critical condition and isn't out of danger, but that his condition isn't imminently life-threatening. Doctors say the pope has developed steroid-induced diabetes that is being treated. Prognosis is guarded.

Pope in critical condition after experiencing a respiratory crisis and requires high-pressure oxygen through nasal tubes, in the first mention of assisted breathing. Francis also receives two blood transfusions after tests show signs of anemia and low platelet count that are later resolved. Setback.




Doctors report that the pope has gone into onset of slight kidney failure, in a setback. No repeat of the respiratory crisis, but he remains in critical condition.

The mild renal failure has regressed, in an improvement.

Pope suffers  isolated coughing spasm during which he inhaled vomit, in a setback requiring noninvasive aspiration. Responded well. Placed on a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask to pump supplemental oxygen into his lungs. Prognosis remains guarded.

Two acute bronchospasm episodes in a setback requiring bronchoscopies, or a camera-tipped tube with a device to remove mucus plugs, yielding abundant secretions. Pope remained alert, oriented and collaborative during maneuvers. Prognosis remains guarded.

Pope records an audio message that is broadcast to the faithful in St. Peter's Square thanking them for their prayers. His voice is weak and he's out of breath.

Doctors declare Francis is no longer in imminent danger of death from pneumonia, but keep him in the hospital for further treatment

Chest X-ray confirms improvement in pope's condition.

Pope marks 12th anniversary of papacy from the hospital, where he receives a cake and hundreds of messages and drawings with good wishes. No medical update. 

Pope marks one month in the hospital. Vatican announces it will cease issuing morning updates about the pope's rest overnight and will issue fewer medical bulletins in a sign of the continuing improvements in the pope's medical condition. 

The Vatican released the first photograph of Pope Francis during his hospitalization. The photo shows the pope seated from behind in front of the altar in the private chapel in the papal apartment at Gemelli hospital. No breathing tube is visible. 

Doctors announced that the pope will be dismissed from the hospital the next day, and that he will have a period of conavelesce of at least two months during which he is discouraged from meeting with large groups. 

A weak and frail Francis leaves Gemelli hospital for the Vatican after making a brief appearance on the hospital's balcony.

        A court formally arrested Ekrem Imamoglu, a key rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan early on Sunday and ordered him jailed pending the outcome of a trial on corruption charges.
    

Imamoglu was detained following a raid on his residence earlier this week, sparking the largest wave of street demonstrations in Turkey in more than a decade. It also deepened concerns, among Turks and outside Turkey, over democracy and rule of law.  

His imprisonment is widely regarded as a political move to remove a major contender from the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. 

Government officials reject accusations that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated and insist that Turkey's courts operate independently. 

The formal arrest came as his opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP, began holding a primary presidential election to endorse Imamoglu as its presidential candidate despite the arrest. 

The party has also set up symbolic ballot boxes nationwide — called “solidarity boxes” — to allow people who are not party members to express their support to the mayor. 

“Honestly, we are embarrassed in the name of our legal system,” Ankara Mayor Mansur Yavas, a fellow member of Imamoglu's CHP, told reporters, criticising the lack of confidentiality in the proceedings. 

“We learned from television pundits about the allegations that even lawyers did not have access to, showing how politically motivated this whole ordeal has been,” he said. 

A post from Imamoglu's X account requested his followers ""run to the ballot"" on Sunday: 

""I invite my 86 million citizens to run to the ballot box and announce their struggle for democracy and justice to the entire world.""

Before his detention, Imamoglu had already faced multiple criminal cases that could result in prison sentences and a political ban. He was also appealing a 2022 conviction for insulting members of Turkey's Supreme Electoral Council. 

Earlier in the week, a university nullified his diploma, citing alleged irregularities in his transfer from a private university in northern Cyprus some 30 years ago. The decision effectively bars him from running for president, since the position requires candidates to be university graduates. Imamoglu had vowed to challenge the decision.  

Imamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey's largest city in March 2019, in a major blow to Erdogan and the president's Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. Erdogan's party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities. 

The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won. 

The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which the CHP made significant gains against Erdogan's governing party.  

On Saturday clashes had erupted between police and protesters in Istanbul on the fourth day of demonstrations following Imamoglu's detention.

Police used pepper spray and tear gas to disperse crowds and push back hundreds of protesters who were hurling flares, stones and other objects at officers.

The Istanbul governor's office announced it was expanding a ban on demonstrations until 26 March, and imposed restrictions on the entry and exit of vehicles deemed to be transporting people “likely to participate in unlawful activities”; protesting.

Erdogan addressed the protests that have taken part across the country over the past four days calling for Imamoglu's release, in an Iftar – the meal eaten to break fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan – speech.

The Turkish president accused the opposition of trying to create “an atmosphere of tension and chaos”.

“I believe it is worth reminding once again that the days of going out into the streets, taking left-wing organisations, extremists, and Vandals with you, and threatening the national will are now behind us,” said Erdogan.

“The days when politics and justice were directed through street terror are now completely a thing of the past, along with old Turkey.”

Other protesters gathered outside Istanbul city hall – Imamoglu's designated office – where protests have been taking place daily since the mayor's arrest.

The demonstrations mark the largest wave of protests in Turkey in more than a decade.

Protests were largely peaceful, but a group of protesters, trying to break through barricades to reach Istanbul's main square, threw flares, stones and other objects at police.

Protesters say pepper spray was used against them, along with water cannons, tear gas and some even claim officers fired rubber bullets.

Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya says 343 suspects were detained in nationwide protests in major cities on Friday night.

He also added that “there will be no tolerance for those who seek to violate societal order, threaten the people's peace and security, and pursue chaos and provocation.”

        False claims about ballot manipulation spread across social media during the 2025 German elections, raising concerns about the fast impact of misinformation online and how internet users can better protect themselves.
    

Recent global and geopolitical events have prompted an increasingly large avalanche of false narratives and fake news both in Europe and beyond.

While the US faces a stream of dubious claims made by President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the European continent is also under the constant threat of disinformation.

For example, during and since Germany's recent federal election, social media was full of misleading posts about election fraud, with some viral posts claiming that the name of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) candidate was missing from the Leipzig ballot.

 However, Leipzig officials quickly debunked the claim, saying all ballots were printed the same way, making such changes impossible.

This is just a sample of the false narratives and disinformation campaigns that Europeans and others have to deal with on a daily basis.

It's increasingly important that we know how to spot and protect ourselves against the flood of fake news, so how can we do so?

EuroVerify spoke to experts who shared their three top tips for spotting and avoiding misinformation online.

Certain cliché phrases are a strong indicator that certain claims may not be what they seem, according to Marc Owen Jones, professor of media analytics at Northwestern University in Qatar.

""Rhetorical techniques are very strong giveaways and things that [misleading posts] might say like 'Western media isn't telling you', or things that 'the mainstream media is not telling you'... These are red flags"", says Jones. 

These statements often appear during decisive events, like elections, or in war-related posts, influencing users' opinions and behaviour. 

For Robert Rajczyk, professor at the Institute of Journalism and Media Communication at the University of Silesia in Katowice, social media and its driven algorithm tools can not only shape but also polarise users' opinions. 

""The more controversial content user consumes, the more content of this type is being offered to internet users,"" he said. ""So we will hear mainly what we want to hear or what we ourselves believe in.""

Another significant concern is the use of AI-generated content, which makes it even harder for users to differentiate between real and fake information. 

Jones said that while deepfakes and AI-generated images can look incredibly realistic, there are key ways to identify them. 

""Sometimes you get artefacts where the ears are not symmetrical, or it's not very good at generating earrings,"" said Jones. ""You might look closely and see that if they don't have glasses there might be glasses stems near the ear."" 

These are not ""foolproof"" methods to recognise fake content, according to Jones, but he said that the main warning signs to identify AI-generated visuals and text can be very similar. 

""It's about manipulation, it's about trying to inflame the emotions because when our emotions are inflamed, we're more likely to share something and it's more likely to go viral. This is the danger of AI,"" Jones said.

With so many different stories online, fact-checking is key. Ike Picone, professor of media and journalism studies at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, stressed the importance of media literacy beyond just recognising misinformation.

""When it comes to specific forms of literacy and news literacy, one of the key aspects is understanding how news works,"" said Picone. ""Because when you understand how news works, you can identify, for example, why certain traditional news media might also be susceptible to a certain bias.""

Although the techniques to recognise bias can vary, for Picone it can also come from a much simpler method, such as checking for others' opinions. 

""Ask your parents, ask your friends, 'do you think this is real? Do you believe it?'"", he said. 

Rajczyk stressed a similar need for media literacy and how crucial it is to compare news from multiple sources. 

""Watch mainstream media, verify information with reading, watching and listening to other mainstream media,"" Rajczyk said. 

""If we haven't got a proper education and we don't know the real historical context, we will be much less resilient to such content,"" he added.

        Despite huge investment and award-winning shows, Apple TV+ is still struggling to make a mark and reportedly losing up to a billion euros a year.
    

Apple is reportedly losing $1 billion (€923 million) a year on its streaming service. As the last episode of the second season of its hit show ‘Severance' airs this week, it's a damning indictment of the tech firm's Netflix competitor. 

Two sources close to the company confirmed to The Information that the tech firm has spent $5 billion (€4.62 billion) a year on Apple TV+ since it launched in 2019. 

Apple's huge investment into the video streaming market hasn't reaped a similarly sized subscriber base. Despite shows like ‘Severance' and ‘Ted Lasso', it lags significantly behind competitors Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+. 

Netflix has the largest number of subscribers at just over 300 million. While Amazon Prime Video operates on a slightly different model, allowing non-subscribers access to individual titles to rent and buy, it's estimated to have around 200 million subscribers. Disney+ also is estimated to have around 125 million subscribers. 

Although Apple hasn't officially revealed its subscriber count, as it doesn't release it as an individual statistic separate from other services like Apple Pay, The Information reports it at a lowly 45 million subscribers. 

Given Apple is one of the biggest companies on the planet, something is going disastrously wrong for the tech firm's foray into video streaming content. 

It's not like they haven't heaped piles of cash on impressive shows. Chiefly, there's ‘Severance'. The dark sci-fi series about office workers with split consciousnesses was nominated for 14 Emmys after its first season in 2022. The Ben Stiller-produced show returned to screens this year and has immediately been in contention for the prestige TV gongs alongside ‘The White Lotus' and ‘Adolescence'. 

Similarly, Apple has had other hits in shows like ‘Ted Lasso', an upbeat football comedy series, and ‘The Morning Show', a satire of network broadcasting shows. Across its original programming, Apple TV+ shows have earned more than 2,500 award nominations and 538 wins, Tim Cook, Apple CEO said in January. 

On the film front, Apple has also been no slouch. It achieved its first Best Picture win at the Oscars with CODA. It has since supported multiple high-profile directors to produce bold award season-friendly work like Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, Ridley Scott's Napoleon, and Steve McQueen's Blitz. 

Yet somehow, all this money isn't translating into subscribers. Apple is watching its investment pour straight down the drain. 

A major part of the problem is in the lack of social caché Apple TV+ seemingly has. Major stars sign up for expensive projects just for them to be dumped on the service without enough hype for it to drum up the kind of publicity that is innate to an HBO release. 

“Water Cooler Television” is a term in the industry to describe the kinds of shows that would leave such a widespread cultural impression, it would inevitably become the topic of conversation in offices around the world the next morning. 

Classic examples of water cooler TV are the slick big budget shows that came out of the beginning of the 21st century like ‘The Sopranos', ‘Breaking Bad' and most recently ‘Succession'. Through its decades-long reputation and weekly release schedule, HBO has been a master at capturing the ephemerality of a water cooler moment. 

‘Severance' is Apple's first show that has somewhat replicated that level of cultural significance. Thanks to its deeply mysterious plot and confusing cliffhangers, each week it has become a genuine competitor for people's attention. 

It's the first time Apple has managed this feat though. There are countless examples of shows that had all the making of cultural impact only to land on entirely deaf ears.

Last year, the platform premiered ‘Disclaimer', the first TV series from Oscar-winning Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón starring Cate Blanchett. With such an impressive roll-sheet, it's no surprise that the show debuted at the Venice Film Festival. Alas, even Blanchett couldn't save ‘Disclaimer' from the rubbish heap of unexciting Apple shows. 

Adaptations of beloved novels like ‘Lessons in Chemistry', ‘Pachinko' and ‘Shantaram' couldn't move the needle. Nor could ‘Band of Brothers' spiritual successor ‘Masters of the Air' make ratings soar. On the flip-side, Apple has angered fans by cancelling shows early, as with the musical comedy series ‘Schmigadoon!' which lasted a paltry two series – make ‘Into the Schmoods', you cowards. 

As with TV where streamers are loath to release viewership figures, it's hard to gauge the success of its film output even with box office figures. Killers of the Flower Moon, for example, was officially a commercial flop, grossing $158.8 million (€146.7 million) worldwide against a roughly $215 million (€198.6 million) budget. 

Napoleon, which also benefited from a theatrical release in late 2023, at least managed to make around $221.4 million (€204.6 million) against its budget of approximately $200 million (€184.5 million. While industry papers estimated it fell way short of breaking even, Apple insisted the film was profitable. 

Both films from highly-esteemed directors were given a rare chance for streaming service films. They were given theatrical releases and only appeared on the streaming platforms many months later. 

Apple is also clearly not ready to throw in the towel when it comes to investing in big-budget film. Coming up this year alone is the hyped F1 film from Top Gun: Maverick director Joseph Kosinski, as well as the newest films from Guy Ritchie, Spike Lee, and Paul Greengrass. 

Concerns over cultural impact of shows dumped on streamers is not a problem solely owned by them. Time and again, Netflix releases a show to huge fanfare the week it airs only for it to fall out of conversation almost immediately. ‘Severance', which has just been officially renewed for a third season, may see a tide change for the tech company's nascent streaming venture. But whether Apple's big financial gambit on streaming success will pay off remains to be seen.

        At least three people were killed in drone attacks on Kyiv, and another four were killed in drone attacks in Donetsk region, local officials said.
    

The attack on Kyiv came ahead of ceasefire negotiations in Saudi Arabia in which Ukraine and Russia are expected to hold indirect U.S.-mediated talks on Monday to discuss a pause in long-range attacks targeting energy facilities and civilian infrastructure.

The Ukrainian delegation is expected to meet with U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia a day ahead of the indirect talks, Ukrainian President Voldoymyr Zelenskyy said. Ukraine is planning to send technical teams to discuss the details of the partial ceasefire.

Russia launched 147 drones across Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian Air Force. Ukrainian air defences shot down 97 and 25 others didn't reach targets due to Ukrainian countermeasures. The attacks struck the Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, Odesa and Donetsk regions, as well as the capital, Kyiv.

Three people, including a 5-year-old child, were killed and 10 others were injured in a drone attack on Kyiv, the city's military administration said. Extended sounds of explosions were heard across the city in the early hours of the night as the air raid blared for over five hours. Russian drones and debris from shot-down drones, which were flying at lower altitudes to evade air defenses, fell on residential buildings.

Ukrainians at the scene of the attacks in Kyiv surveyed the damage done to their homes and neighbourhoods on Sunday morning. Many were disparaging of the upcoming ceasefire talks, pointing to the burnt-out homes destroyed in the drone attack, saying these were more indicative of Russia's true intentions.

In an old multistory building on Kyiv's left bank that was damaged in the overnight attack, Dmytro Zapadnya, 37, said he had no faith in Russia upholding any ceasefire agreement.

“There is no point in signing anything (with Russians), because it will not be worth the cost of paper where you put this signature. Well, the only thing that is not very pleasant is that now the United States seems to have little understanding of our situation,” he said.

Elsewhere, four people were killed in Russian attacks on Ukraine's Donetsk region, regional Gov. Vadym Filashkin said, including three who died in a strike on the front-line Ukrainian town of Dobropillya.

In a statement on social media, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said attacks such as the one in Kyiv were a daily occurrence for Ukraine.

“This week alone, more than 1,580 guided aerial bombs, almost 1,100 strike drones and 15 missiles of various types were used against our people,” he said. “New solutions are needed, with new pressure on Moscow to stop both these strikes and this war.”

Also on Sunday, Russia's Ministry of Defence said it had shot down 59 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 29 over the region of Rostov and 20 more over southwestern Astrakhan. In Rostov, one person was killed and a car caught fire due to the Ukrainian drone attack, according to the area's temporary governor, Yuri Slyusar.

A woman also died in the Russian border village of Novostroyevka-Pervaya in the Belgorod region when a Ukrainian drone hit a car in which she was traveling.

The driver, the woman's daughter, was also seriously injured in the attack, said local Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov.

US President Donald Trump announced that Boeing has been awarded the contract to produce the US Air Force's next-generation fighter jet, the F-47. The aircraft, classified as a sixth-generation fighter, is expected to be the most advanced fighter jet ever developed.""I'm thrilled to announce that, at my direction, the United States Air Force is moving forward with the world's first sixth-generation fighter jet, and nothing in the world comes close to it,"" Trump said at the White House.  The new aircraft, named the F-47, reportedly acknowledged Trump's second term as the 47th president of the US.Trump also revealed that an experimental version of the aircraft has been in secret development and flight testing for the past five years. ""Our enemies will never see it coming,"" he added.

George Foreman, twice boxing's heavyweight champion of the world, died at the age of 76 on Friday.His family said in a post on Instagram on Friday night: ""Our hearts are broken. A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father, and a proud grand and great grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility, and purpose.""The statement added: ""A humanitarian, an Olympian, and two-time heavyweight champion of the world, He was deeply respected - a force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name - for his family.""  Known as “Big George,” Foreman's life story is a drama in three parts.The first involved a childhood of extreme poverty in Houston's notorious Fifth Ward. Foreman was born in Marshall, Texas, on 10 January 1949, and raised along with six siblings by a single mother. Growing up, Foreman never knew his father (one of the reasons all his sons are named George Foreman), and he remembered his siblings calling him “Moorehead,” after the man who sired him but was never a part of the family. The paternal distinction was why he towered above them, growing up to be 6 feet 4 inches. Instead, he grew up as a “Foreman” in a household so poor his mother could only afford to buy a hamburger and cut it into pieces for each child to eat.The fight between US boxing heavyweight champions, Muhammad Ali (L) (born Cassius Clay) and George Foreman in Kinshasa. On October 30, 1974 Muhammad Ali knocked out George Foreman in a clash of titans known as the ''Rumble in the Jungle'', watched by 60 000 people in the stadium in Kinshasa and millio (credit: STR/AFP via Getty Images)A life-changing moment A member of gangs and a petty street thug, his life changed one night when he was running from the police after a mugging. Hiding under the wooden stilts that adorned the Fifth Ward's houses, he covered himself in mud to avoid the sniffer dogs and realized that life had to change.A high-school dropout, he enlisted in the Job Corps, a program introduced in the US in the early 60s to help reduce the unemployment rate and provide vocational training for those aged 16-24. Learning his trade as a carpenter it was also when he first entered the ring. Foreman's power was so impressive he accelerated through the US amateur ranks, representing his country at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, where he won gold in the heavyweight division. Turning professional in June 1969, he won his first 37 bouts before stepping into the ring on January 22, 1973, in Kingston, Jamaica, to take on World Heavyweight Champion Joe Frazier. Frazier was at the pinnacle of his career, having defeated Muhammad Ali two years prior in what was known as the “Fight of the Century” at Madison Square Garden.Frazier was a heavy favorite against the younger Foreman, but what happened shocked the boxing world. Foreman took the champion apart, flooring him six times in less than two rounds - one of the punches literally lifted Frazier off his feet and into the air. Foreman was heavyweight champion at 24.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Adopting a steely, cold glare and monosyllabic tone in the mold of his hero, Sonny Liston, Foreman found fame and the media challenging to deal with.He followed up his destruction of Frazier by defending his title against Jose Roman in Japan, before annihilating Ken Norton (another man who had beaten Ali) in Caracas, Venezuela. It seemed his reign as champion would last until the next century, but then came a fateful night in Zaire.The “Rumble in the Jungle” has gone down in boxing folklore and is such a famous fight it has entered the consciousness of those who don't even follow boxing. Muhammad Ali - who had reigned as champion from 1964 to 1967 when he was stripped for refusing induction into the US Army to fight in Vietnam - was on a mission to regain his title. At 32 years old, many thought Ali had lost too much speed (his greatest asset when he was young) and power to defeat Foreman. Ali had also had much trouble against Frazier and Norton, both of whom Foreman had decimated within minutes. Ali spent the fight leaning back on the ropes, allowing Foreman to punch himself out in what he later termed the “rope-a-dope.” Whether a deliberate tactic by boxing's greatest-ever performer or not, by the eighth round, Foreman was exhausted. A quick, sneaky right followed a left and another right, and the champion found himself on the canvas and counted out. It was pandemonium. The Greatest had regained his crown, and Foreman's reputation was broken.He spent the next few years trying to get a rematch with Ali, but the two would never fight again. Instead, Foreman's life entered its second act when, in March 1977, he lost to Jimmy Young in Puerto Rico. Following the fight, Foreman had what he described as a religious epiphany in the changing room afterward. However, many attributed it to heatstroke and exhaustion - he described plunging into a dark void and felt as if he were dying before a voice called out to him.“I can give you all my money,” Foreman recalled telling the voice.“I don't want your money - I want YOU!”  the voice told him.He would not fight again for 10 years.Leaving boxing and becoming a born-again Christian, Foreman was ridiculed for leaving his career behind him, becoming an ordained minister and setting up the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ in Houston. It seemed he would never enter a ring again. However, Providence had other ideas.Plowing his money into the George Foreman Youth Center to help troubled kids stay off the streets of Houston, he found over the years that it was hemorrhaging money, and after a decade, the only way Foreman could think to keep the center going was to come back to the ring. In 1987, after 10 years away from the ring, Foreman surprised the boxing world by announcing a comeback at the age of 38.Overweight, old, and described as a ""laughing stock,"" the third act of Foreman's life saw him fighting in small-town venues before returning to the big time with a fight for the heavyweight title against Evander Holyfield in 1991. It seemed the fight was more for the entertainment value than sporting legitimacy. However, Foreman defied the odds and survived the fight, although he was easily beaten: “With one punch, I thought he knocked all my teeth out,” Holyfield recalled, showing the Foreman had still not lost his power.His second shot at boxing redemption came on Nov 5, 1994, when he faced Michael Moorer for the heavyweight crown in Las Vegas. For nine rounds, the younger, fresher champion pounced on Foreman and punched away, but Foreman stood his ground, awaiting his moment. He would later claim he was luring Moorer into such a false sense of confidence that he would eventually just stand before him when Foreman would take his chance.Wearing the same trunks that he had worn in Zaire against Ali those 20 fateful years earlier, Foreman landed a straight right, bang on the button of Moorer's chin, and down goes the champion. As Moorer lays on his back and is counted out, Foreman kneels in prayer in the corner of the ring. “It happened. IT HAPPENED!” HBO announcer Jim Lampley screamed into the microphone. At 45 years old, Foreman had found his redemption. He was the heavyweight champion of the world again. In addition to the money Foreman earned from his boxing comeback, he made millions of dollars selling his name and image for the George Foreman Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine, and he joined the HBO boxing announcing team. Retiring in 1997 from the ring for good, he remained working in Houston for the rest of his life with his congregation.Some people in life have one shot at greatness, one chance to make a moment in history that the world can remember them by. George Foreman, from his fall to his redemption, had two. Rest in peace, Champ.

Ali had also had much trouble against Frazier and Norton, both of whom Foreman had decimated within minutes. Ali spent the fight leaning back on the ropes, allowing Foreman to punch himself out in what he later termed the “rope-a-dope.” Whether a deliberate tactic by boxing's greatest-ever performer or not, by the eighth round, Foreman was exhausted. A quick, sneaky right followed a left and another right, and the champion found himself on the canvas and counted out. It was pandemonium. The Greatest had regained his crown, and Foreman's reputation was broken.He spent the next few years trying to get a rematch with Ali, but the two would never fight again. Instead, Foreman's life entered its second act when, in March 1977, he lost to Jimmy Young in Puerto Rico. Following the fight, Foreman had what he described as a religious epiphany in the changing room afterward. However, many attributed it to heatstroke and exhaustion - he described plunging into a dark void and felt as if he were dying before a voice called out to him.“I can give you all my money,” Foreman recalled telling the voice.“I don't want your money - I want YOU!”  the voice told him.He would not fight again for 10 years.Leaving boxing and becoming a born-again Christian, Foreman was ridiculed for leaving his career behind him, becoming an ordained minister and setting up the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ in Houston. It seemed he would never enter a ring again. However, Providence had other ideas.Plowing his money into the George Foreman Youth Center to help troubled kids stay off the streets of Houston, he found over the years that it was hemorrhaging money, and after a decade, the only way Foreman could think to keep the center going was to come back to the ring. In 1987, after 10 years away from the ring, Foreman surprised the boxing world by announcing a comeback at the age of 38.Overweight, old, and described as a ""laughing stock,"" the third act of Foreman's life saw him fighting in small-town venues before returning to the big time with a fight for the heavyweight title against Evander Holyfield in 1991. It seemed the fight was more for the entertainment value than sporting legitimacy. However, Foreman defied the odds and survived the fight, although he was easily beaten: “With one punch, I thought he knocked all my teeth out,” Holyfield recalled, showing the Foreman had still not lost his power.His second shot at boxing redemption came on Nov 5, 1994, when he faced Michael Moorer for the heavyweight crown in Las Vegas. For nine rounds, the younger, fresher champion pounced on Foreman and punched away, but Foreman stood his ground, awaiting his moment. He would later claim he was luring Moorer into such a false sense of confidence that he would eventually just stand before him when Foreman would take his chance.Wearing the same trunks that he had worn in Zaire against Ali those 20 fateful years earlier, Foreman landed a straight right, bang on the button of Moorer's chin, and down goes the champion. As Moorer lays on his back and is counted out, Foreman kneels in prayer in the corner of the ring. “It happened. IT HAPPENED!” HBO announcer Jim Lampley screamed into the microphone. At 45 years old, Foreman had found his redemption. He was the heavyweight champion of the world again. In addition to the money Foreman earned from his boxing comeback, he made millions of dollars selling his name and image for the George Foreman Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine, and he joined the HBO boxing announcing team. Retiring in 1997 from the ring for good, he remained working in Houston for the rest of his life with his congregation.Some people in life have one shot at greatness, one chance to make a moment in history that the world can remember them by. George Foreman, from his fall to his redemption, had two. Rest in peace, Champ.

At 45 years old, Foreman had found his redemption. He was the heavyweight champion of the world again.

Foreman's power was so impressive he accelerated through the US amateur ranks, representing his country at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, where he won gold in the heavyweight division. Turning professional in June 1969, he won his first 37 bouts before stepping into the ring on January 22, 1973, in Kingston, Jamaica, to take on World Heavyweight Champion Joe Frazier. Frazier was at the pinnacle of his career, having defeated Muhammad Ali two years prior in what was known as the “Fight of the Century” at Madison Square Garden.Frazier was a heavy favorite against the younger Foreman, but what happened shocked the boxing world.

He spent the next few years trying to get a rematch with Ali, but the two would never fight again. Instead, Foreman's life entered its second act when, in March 1977, he lost to Jimmy Young in Puerto Rico. Following the fight, Foreman had what he described as a religious epiphany in the changing room afterward. However, many attributed it to heatstroke and exhaustion - he described plunging into a dark void and felt as if he were dying before a voice called out to him.“I can give you all my money,” Foreman recalled telling the voice.“I don't want your money - I want YOU!”  the voice told him.He would not fight again for 10 years.Leaving boxing and becoming a born-again Christian, Foreman was ridiculed for leaving his career behind him, becoming an ordained minister and setting up the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ in Houston. It seemed he would never enter a ring again. However, Providence had other ideas.Plowing his money into the George Foreman Youth Center to help troubled kids stay off the streets of Houston, he found over the years that it was hemorrhaging money, and after a decade, the only way Foreman could think to keep the center going was to come back to the ring.

“Israel has been in a constant baby boom since independence.”This comes from a normally understated source, Wikipedia. And it's true! Even in wartime.  From day one, Israelis have loved babies. For the past 76 years, we brought lots of them into the world – relatively more than in other Western country, where a baby bust has long been prevalent. And we continue to do so.This drive for procreation endures even during hard times. Despite it all, a new wartime baby boom is underway in Israel. AdvertisementMany countries have experienced baby booms after wars. Israel may be among the first to experience a baby boom during an ongoing war. Baby (Illustrative) (credit: Luma Pimentel/Unsplash)Writing in the Israeli daily Haaretz, Rachel Fink noted that despite 15 months of war, “Israel is experiencing a 10 percent increase in births during the final months of 2024 – after recent indications that Israel is experiencing a downturn in fertility.” She quoted Shlomo Winker, head of the Leumit Health Care Services medical division, who noted that a surge in the birth rate after a period of war or national tragedy is a known phenomenon. Yet “…the current baby boom is surprising, given that such surges usually occur after the war has come to an end.”Take my own family, for instance. My wife and I have been blessed with the birth of three great-grandchildren in the past year or so. We are sad when we think of friends, grandparents, in countries where babies are rather rare.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Let's look at the data. AdvertisementIsrael's fertility rate (children per woman) in 2024 was almost three. The comparable figure for the US is roughly half that. Same for Europe. Same for Russia (1.46), and lower for Japan (1.26).Declining birth rates create a paradox. It results in a shrinking labor force, hence a shortage of workers. Yet, in many countries – the US, the UK, the EU – there is a massive backlash against immigrants, a key source of labor, as seen in a sharp turn to the Right in politics.There is a more subtle effect related to national energy. When I visit countries with low birth rates, I sense a noticeable paucity of national energy. These countries feel like giant homes for the aged.  The US, Europe, Russia, China, and Japan are all below replacement – that is, natural increase is not enough to maintain the population. In China, the fertility rate, 1.18, reflects the one-child policy that China is desperately trying to reverse, in light of a labor shortage and shrinking population. Israel's fertility rate is at present double that of the world average, 1.5.China, Japan, and some European countries have sought to offer monetary incentives for couples to have children. But so far, the plan has failed. The birth rate needle has not budged.True, Israeli Ultra-Orthodox fertility is 6.1, boosting the average. But secular women's fertility rate still far exceeds that in Western countries.A baby (illustrative) (credit: INGIMAGE)Baby booms in historyDemographers claim that post-war baby booms date back to the early 1700s.In the 1930s to early 1940s, new births in the United States averaged 2.3 to 2.8 million annually. In 1946, the first year of the post-war baby boom, new births spiked to 3.47 million. New births continued to increase, leading to a peak of 4.3 million births in 1957 and 1961.During the US baby boom in 1946-64, some 78 million babies were born. The oldest among them are now reaching retirement age.I wrote my PhD thesis on the US baby boom, observing that the deer-in-the-python bulge of births continually surprised US governments as the boomers grew into adulthood, even though their impact – their need for schools, colleges, health care, and jobs over time – was easily predictable as the boomers grew from children to adults.Japan too had a baby boom, in 1947-49, and then an echo-effect boomlet in 1971-74, when the boomers themselves had children. Same for the US. These “echo boomers,” Generation Y, or millennials, make up nearly one-third of the US population.Russia's baby boom followed not war but the recovery after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 2012, the number of births outnumbered deaths for the first time since the Soviet Union was established. Ukraine, too, had a modest baby boom following the Orange Revolution in 2004-5, when mass protests finally brought a pro-West leader to the presidency.Not only wars can bring baby booms in their wake. So can pandemics.Ireland saw the birth rate rise sharply in 2021, the first annual increase since 2009. COVID brought “lockdown babies” into the world.More boys than girlsThere is a curious statistic regarding baby booms. In normal times, on average 5% more boys are born than girls. In post-war baby booms, that rises to 8% – the boy-girl ratio increases by 60%.Nobody knows why male births spike after wars. One theory is that babies conceived early in the woman's cycle tend to be male – and baby boom babies tend to be conceived early in the cycle.In Israel, in age groups of 15-64, men and women are roughly equal in numbers. The way this works is interesting. Some 10% more boys than girls are conceived. But more male embryos than female ones die before birth. Five percent more boys than girls are born.The life expectancy of women exceeds that of men by four years: 84.7 years for women, 80.7 years for men. The result is that at age 65 and older, there are 22% fewer men than women. This means there are more widows than widowers – a social problem not currently well addressed.A baby sits up, hands out (Illustrative) (credit: SHIR TOREM/FLASH90)Post-war baby booms in IsraelA Taub Center study by its research director Prof. Alex Weinreb examines birth rates after the Six Day War (1967), the Yom Kippur War (1973), and the Gaza War. He found that “in the aftermath of both of the earlier wars, there was an immediate positive impact on fertility, with fertility rising in 1968 and in 1974 back to the trendline, then climbing above the trendline for an additional two years.”Weinreb confirms a surprising fact about 2024. “Fertility in Israel took a new direction in the first five months of 2024, and instead of continuing to decline it returned to its 2022 level and even surpassed it.”Moreover, he adds, “the largest rise [in fertility] was among Jewish women.” The annualized total fertility rate of Jewish women between August and October 2024 was 3.19 children per woman, 0.4 children higher than in June-July, and 5% higher than during the same months in 2022.Weinreb also notes a not fully expected rise in aliyah in 2024. “…23,150 olim moved to Israel in the January-August 2024 period. That was higher than the number of olim in the equivalent period in any year in the 2012-2021 period other than 2019. …Israel sustained higher than average numbers of olim during the first year of war. That is an accomplishment.”How can we best understand Israel's baby boom? I believe it is related to the notion of the Jewish people as an am segula (“a unique moral nation”).The Egyptian, Persian, Roman, Greek, Ottoman, and Mongol empires have all fallen. The Jewish people emerged from the Holocaust, and we thrived.A strong theme of our Bible is that of continuity. “Choose life,” the Torah says. We are taught to pass our values on to our descendants, and we are taught why it is vital to have descendants. Holocaust victims survived against the odds and built new families, many of them in Israel.Babies are beautiful, every single one. It is what we live for. With them, we build our future. Without them, there is no future.■The writer heads the Zvi Griliches Research Data Center at S. Neaman Institute, Technion. He blogs at www.timnovate.wordpress.com.

From day one, Israelis have loved babies. For the past 76 years, we brought lots of them into the world – relatively more than in other Western country, where a baby bust has long been prevalent. And we continue to do so.This drive for procreation endures even during hard times. Despite it all, a new wartime baby boom is underway in Israel. AdvertisementMany countries have experienced baby booms after wars. Israel may be among the first to experience a baby boom during an ongoing war. Baby (Illustrative) (credit: Luma Pimentel/Unsplash)Writing in the Israeli daily Haaretz, Rachel Fink noted that despite 15 months of war, “Israel is experiencing a 10 percent increase in births during the final months of 2024 – after recent indications that Israel is experiencing a downturn in fertility.” She quoted Shlomo Winker, head of the Leumit Health Care Services medical division, who noted that a surge in the birth rate after a period of war or national tragedy is a known phenomenon. Yet “…the current baby boom is surprising, given that such surges usually occur after the war has come to an end.”Take my own family, for instance. My wife and I have been blessed with the birth of three great-grandchildren in the past year or so. We are sad when we think of friends, grandparents, in countries where babies are rather rare.

AdvertisementIsrael's fertility rate (children per woman) in 2024 was almost three. The comparable figure for the US is roughly half that. Same for Europe. Same for Russia (1.46), and lower for Japan (1.26).Declining birth rates create a paradox. It results in a shrinking labor force, hence a shortage of workers. Yet, in many countries – the US, the UK, the EU – there is a massive backlash against immigrants, a key source of labor, as seen in a sharp turn to the Right in politics.There is a more subtle effect related to national energy. When I visit countries with low birth rates, I sense a noticeable paucity of national energy. These countries feel like giant homes for the aged.  The US, Europe, Russia, China, and Japan are all below replacement – that is, natural increase is not enough to maintain the population. In China, the fertility rate, 1.18, reflects the one-child policy that China is desperately trying to reverse, in light of a labor shortage and shrinking population. Israel's fertility rate is at present double that of the world average, 1.5.China, Japan, and some European countries have sought to offer monetary incentives for couples to have children. But so far, the plan has failed. The birth rate needle has not budged.True, Israeli Ultra-Orthodox fertility is 6.1, boosting the average. But secular women's fertility rate still far exceeds that in Western countries.A baby (illustrative) (credit: INGIMAGE)Baby booms in historyDemographers claim that post-war baby booms date back to the early 1700s.In the 1930s to early 1940s, new births in the United States averaged 2.3 to 2.8 million annually. In 1946, the first year of the post-war baby boom, new births spiked to 3.47 million. New births continued to increase, leading to a peak of 4.3 million births in 1957 and 1961.During the US baby boom in 1946-64, some 78 million babies were born. The oldest among them are now reaching retirement age.I wrote my PhD thesis on the US baby boom, observing that the deer-in-the-python bulge of births continually surprised US governments as the boomers grew into adulthood, even though their impact – their need for schools, colleges, health care, and jobs over time – was easily predictable as the boomers grew from children to adults.Japan too had a baby boom, in 1947-49, and then an echo-effect boomlet in 1971-74, when the boomers themselves had children. Same for the US. These “echo boomers,” Generation Y, or millennials, make up nearly one-third of the US population.Russia's baby boom followed not war but the recovery after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 2012, the number of births outnumbered deaths for the first time since the Soviet Union was established. Ukraine, too, had a modest baby boom following the Orange Revolution in 2004-5, when mass protests finally brought a pro-West leader to the presidency.Not only wars can bring baby booms in their wake. So can pandemics.Ireland saw the birth rate rise sharply in 2021, the first annual increase since 2009. COVID brought “lockdown babies” into the world.More boys than girlsThere is a curious statistic regarding baby booms. In normal times, on average 5% more boys are born than girls. In post-war baby booms, that rises to 8% – the boy-girl ratio increases by 60%.Nobody knows why male births spike after wars. One theory is that babies conceived early in the woman's cycle tend to be male – and baby boom babies tend to be conceived early in the cycle.In Israel, in age groups of 15-64, men and women are roughly equal in numbers. The way this works is interesting. Some 10% more boys than girls are conceived. But more male embryos than female ones die before birth. Five percent more boys than girls are born.The life expectancy of women exceeds that of men by four years: 84.7 years for women, 80.7 years for men. The result is that at age 65 and older, there are 22% fewer men than women. This means there are more widows than widowers – a social problem not currently well addressed.A baby sits up, hands out (Illustrative) (credit: SHIR TOREM/FLASH90)Post-war baby booms in IsraelA Taub Center study by its research director Prof. Alex Weinreb examines birth rates after the Six Day War (1967), the Yom Kippur War (1973), and the Gaza War. He found that “in the aftermath of both of the earlier wars, there was an immediate positive impact on fertility, with fertility rising in 1968 and in 1974 back to the trendline, then climbing above the trendline for an additional two years.”Weinreb confirms a surprising fact about 2024. “Fertility in Israel took a new direction in the first five months of 2024, and instead of continuing to decline it returned to its 2022 level and even surpassed it.”Moreover, he adds, “the largest rise [in fertility] was among Jewish women.” The annualized total fertility rate of Jewish women between August and October 2024 was 3.19 children per woman, 0.4 children higher than in June-July, and 5% higher than during the same months in 2022.Weinreb also notes a not fully expected rise in aliyah in 2024. “…23,150 olim moved to Israel in the January-August 2024 period. That was higher than the number of olim in the equivalent period in any year in the 2012-2021 period other than 2019. …Israel sustained higher than average numbers of olim during the first year of war. That is an accomplishment.”How can we best understand Israel's baby boom? I believe it is related to the notion of the Jewish people as an am segula (“a unique moral nation”).The Egyptian, Persian, Roman, Greek, Ottoman, and Mongol empires have all fallen.

In post-war baby booms, that rises to 8% – the boy-girl ratio increases by 60%.Nobody knows why male births spike after wars. One theory is that babies conceived early in the woman's cycle tend to be male – and baby boom babies tend to be conceived early in the cycle.In Israel, in age groups of 15-64, men and women are roughly equal in numbers. The way this works is interesting. Some 10% more boys than girls are conceived. But more male embryos than female ones die before birth. Five percent more boys than girls are born.The life expectancy of women exceeds that of men by four years: 84.7 years for women, 80.7 years for men.

Take my own family, for instance. My wife and I have been blessed with the birth of three great-grandchildren in the past year or so.

The US, Europe, Russia, China, and Japan are all below replacement – that is, natural increase is not enough to maintain the population. In China, the fertility rate, 1.18, reflects the one-child policy that China is desperately trying to reverse, in light of a labor shortage and shrinking population. Israel's fertility rate is at present double that of the world average, 1.5.China, Japan, and some European countries have sought to offer monetary incentives for couples to have children. But so far, the plan has failed. The birth rate needle has not budged.True, Israeli Ultra-Orthodox fertility is 6.1, boosting the average. But secular women's fertility rate still far exceeds that in Western countries.A baby (illustrative) (credit: INGIMAGE)Baby booms in historyDemographers claim that post-war baby booms date back to the early 1700s.In the 1930s to early 1940s, new births in the United States averaged 2.3 to 2.8 million annually.

I wrote my PhD thesis on the US baby boom, observing that the deer-in-the-python bulge of births continually surprised US governments as the boomers grew into adulthood, even though their impact – their need for schools, colleges, health care, and jobs over time – was easily predictable as the boomers grew from children to adults.Japan too had a baby boom, in 1947-49, and then an echo-effect boomlet in 1971-74, when the boomers themselves had children. Same for the US. These “echo boomers,” Generation Y, or millennials, make up nearly one-third of the US population.Russia's baby boom followed not war but the recovery after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 2012, the number of births outnumbered deaths for the first time since the Soviet Union was established. Ukraine, too, had a modest baby boom following the Orange Revolution in 2004-5, when mass protests finally brought a pro-West leader to the presidency.Not only wars can bring baby booms in their wake. So can pandemics.Ireland saw the birth rate rise sharply in 2021, the first annual increase since 2009. COVID brought “lockdown babies” into the world.More boys than girlsThere is a curious statistic regarding baby booms. In normal times, on average 5% more boys are born than girls. In post-war baby booms, that rises to 8% – the boy-girl ratio increases by 60%.Nobody knows why male births spike after wars. One theory is that babies conceived early in the woman's cycle tend to be male – and baby boom babies tend to be conceived early in the cycle.In Israel, in age groups of 15-64, men and women are roughly equal in numbers.

That was higher than the number of olim in the equivalent period in any year in the 2012-2021 period other than 2019. …Israel sustained higher than average numbers of olim during the first year of war. That is an accomplishment.”How can we best understand Israel's baby boom? I believe it is related to the notion of the Jewish people as an am segula (“a unique moral nation”).The Egyptian, Persian, Roman, Greek, Ottoman, and Mongol empires have all fallen. The Jewish people emerged from the Holocaust, and we thrived.A strong theme of our Bible is that of continuity. “Choose life,” the Torah says. We are taught to pass our values on to our descendants, and we are taught why it is vital to have descendants. Holocaust victims survived against the odds and built new families, many of them in Israel.Babies are beautiful, every single one. It is what we live for. With them, we build our future.

The Israeli government had failed to coordinate with Jewish communities about the invitation of controversial right-wing European political leaders to Thursday's International Conference on Combating Antisemitism, Diaspora Jewish leaders charged at a Sunday morning Knesset Aliyah, Absorption, and Diaspora Committee hearing, though the Diaspora Ministry argued that it had invited representatives from across the political spectrum and had operated according to the Foreign Ministry's diplomatic relations parameters.The hearing regarding the impact of the government's policies on Diaspora communities, organized by committee chairman MK Gilad Kariv following a surge of conference cancellations by major Diaspora figures and organizations, saw European Jewish Congress President Dr. Ariel Muzicant relate that European communities were ""extremely frustrated by [Diaspora] Minister [Amichai] Chikli and what he is doing.""  The Diaspora Ministry was not speaking with Jewish communities, and they were, in turn, not reaching out, said Muzicant, whose organization pulled out of the conference. He expressed the belief that they may not be able to work with the current Israeli government, highlighting that a May World Jewish Congress conference would explore the topic of how ""the Israel-Diaspora relationship does not work.""This [antisemitism] conference is stabbing Jews in the back,"" said Muzicant. ""You are helping our enemies, you are giving fuel to those criticizing Israel. By joining with the extreme right, you help those who criticize Israel."" AdvertisementMuzicant said that it was important for the Israeli government to coordinate with European Jewish leaders as well as the disparate communities that had particular situations. Before inviting National Rally President Jordan Bardella, the Diaspora Ministry should have consulted with the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France (CRIF), explained Muzicant, as the Jewish body has refused interactions with the far-left or far-right.MK Gilad Kariv seen at the Knesset, in Jerusalem, on March 11, 2025 (credit: YONATAN SINDEL/FLASH90)Antisemitism was not the only consideration when engaging with these parties, argued Muzicant, who contended that the participants invited to the conference did not respect democratic values such as an independent judiciary and free speech. Former Bundestag member and Germany-Israel Friendship Society chairman Volker Beck, who had withdrawn from the conference last Friday, explained to the committee that Germany's friendship with Israel was not only due to its support for Jewish self-determination but also common democratic values.The parties that were invited did not appreciate its status as a Jewish state, said Volker, and only saw it as the enemy of its enemy, Jihadist Islam. These parties did not respect Judaism domestically, Volker warned and sought to ban ritual slaughter and circumcision.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Volker believed it was important that support for Israel's right to defend itself remain non-partisan and be shared across the political spectrum. Advertisement'I was astonished to see nearly only, with some exceptions, being invited from the far-right.""Both Muzicant and Volker cautioned that the controversial parties invited by Israel were aligned with Russia. Volker highlighted that growing closer to these parties, therefore, jeopardized Israel's security, as Russia was an ally of Iran, which had orchestrated many of the war's assaults against Israel.Diaspora Ministry Director-General Avi Cohen-Scali assured that the ministry wasn't waiting until any conference to speak to Diaspora communities and was in contact with them all the time about various programs and initiatives against antisemitism.  Ministry requested participation of politicians across the spectrumHe rejected the idea that the ministry only invited far-right governments, noting that they had requested the participation of politicians across the spectrum, including the ruling parties of the French and British governments. Many of the organizations had withdrawn not because of right-wing politicians, argued Cohen-Scali, but because of the pressure that had been created in the media.Cohen-Scali said that the conference was not a right-wing event but a professional fair for opponents of antisemitism to explore the challenges and tools available in the fight against anti-Jewish animus. People were invited not because of their political orientation but because they had come out after the October 7 Massacre as strong proponents of Israel, explained the director-general. Bardella was one of these figures, said Cohen-Scali, supporting Israel even in the face of public backlash.The conference did not invite any member of a party which the Foreign Ministry had already established a relationship with, said Cohen-Scali. According to the Foreign Ministry Europe department head Ahuva Spieler, the ministry had a ""green light"" for engagement with National Rally, Sweden Democrats, and the Spanish Vox party after assessment through long-standing parameters.The parameters assess suitability for interaction with political bodies based on their stance on the Holocaust, Nazis, and Neo-Nazis, their relations with local Jewish communities, and their position on Israel and anti-Israel movements.Since the October 7 Massacre, banning Hamas as a terrorist organization and condemning the attacks had been added to the parameters. Not all of the parameters were met by different bodies all of the time, and ongoing assessments were held, giving weight to different items. Spieler noted that they had not approved the relations of parties from Germany and Austria based on a file provided by the EJC.Kariv asked about the importance placed on liberal democratic values and coordination with the Diaspora communities in the parameters, and when Spieler explained that the relations were advised to proceed with Diaspora consultation and that values were considered but not officially part of the parameters, the chairmen urged the addition of democratic values as an element of the document.Kariv was skeptical about how interactions could be approved with political actors coming to an official government conference within three months. He demanded to know if the prime minister had intended to meet with Bardella in the wake of the fresh approval of relations.Another French politician invited to the conference became a topic of concern when it was noted that she used to be part of Eric Zemmour's Reconquete party, which the Foreign Ministry had not yet approved. Cohen-Scali explained that Jean-Marie Le Pen's granddaughter Marion Maréchal was invited because she was an MEP for an approved European Parliament party.'Government must take a clear stand'The Israeli government must take a clear stand against extremist political parties with antisemitic roots, said Kariv. He warned that “we will not accept ties with antisemitic parties—whether on the Right or the Left,” but that the left was not on the agenda today.Kariv pointed to the Israeli Labor Party's past decision to sever ties with the British Labour Party during Jeremy Corbyn's leadership due to antisemitic rhetoric.“I expect the Israeli government and the Knesset to take just as clear a stand,” he said.Kariv accused the Diaspora Ministry of mishandling the conference, which led to the withdrawals of the Anti-Defamation League, UK Chief Rabbi Mirvis, UK politician and antisemitism adviser Lord John Mann, Goldsmiths University professor David Hirsh, French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy, and German antisemitism czar Felix Klein due to the controversial guests.

Muzicant said that it was important for the Israeli government to coordinate with European Jewish leaders as well as the disparate communities that had particular situations. Before inviting National Rally President Jordan Bardella, the Diaspora Ministry should have consulted with the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France (CRIF), explained Muzicant, as the Jewish body has refused interactions with the far-left or far-right.MK Gilad Kariv seen at the Knesset, in Jerusalem, on March 11, 2025 (credit: YONATAN SINDEL/FLASH90)Antisemitism was not the only consideration when engaging with these parties, argued Muzicant, who contended that the participants invited to the conference did not respect democratic values such as an independent judiciary and free speech. Former Bundestag member and Germany-Israel Friendship Society chairman Volker Beck, who had withdrawn from the conference last Friday, explained to the committee that Germany's friendship with Israel was not only due to its support for Jewish self-determination but also common democratic values.The parties that were invited did not appreciate its status as a Jewish state, said Volker, and only saw it as the enemy of its enemy, Jihadist Islam.

He rejected the idea that the ministry only invited far-right governments, noting that they had requested the participation of politicians across the spectrum, including the ruling parties of the French and British governments. Many of the organizations had withdrawn not because of right-wing politicians, argued Cohen-Scali, but because of the pressure that had been created in the media.Cohen-Scali said that the conference was not a right-wing event but a professional fair for opponents of antisemitism to explore the challenges and tools available in the fight against anti-Jewish animus. People were invited not because of their political orientation but because they had come out after the October 7 Massacre as strong proponents of Israel, explained the director-general. Bardella was one of these figures, said Cohen-Scali, supporting Israel even in the face of public backlash.The conference did not invite any member of a party which the Foreign Ministry had already established a relationship with, said Cohen-Scali. According to the Foreign Ministry Europe department head Ahuva Spieler, the ministry had a ""green light"" for engagement with National Rally, Sweden Democrats, and the Spanish Vox party after assessment through long-standing parameters.The parameters assess suitability for interaction with political bodies based on their stance on the Holocaust, Nazis, and Neo-Nazis, their relations with local Jewish communities, and their position on Israel and anti-Israel movements.Since the October 7 Massacre, banning Hamas as a terrorist organization and condemning the attacks had been added to the parameters. Not all of the parameters were met by different bodies all of the time, and ongoing assessments were held, giving weight to different items. Spieler noted that they had not approved the relations of parties from Germany and Austria based on a file provided by the EJC.Kariv asked about the importance placed on liberal democratic values and coordination with the Diaspora communities in the parameters, and when Spieler explained that the relations were advised to proceed with Diaspora consultation and that values were considered but not officially part of the parameters, the chairmen urged the addition of democratic values as an element of the document.Kariv was skeptical about how interactions could be approved with political actors coming to an official government conference within three months.

For the past 16 months – one can say for the past 75 years and more – the world has been subjected to the chant, “Free Palestine!” screamed by Palestinians and their advocates worldwide.Listening to these chants without familiarity with the actual facts about the Middle East could lead one to conclude that there is a group of people – Palestinians – who are being held as slaves somewhere in the world by another nation. Of course, this isn't true. Palestinians are as free as any other human on the planet.  The chant “Free Palestine!” doesn't advocate for the freedom of enslaved Palestinians but rather for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on land currently controlled by the Jewish people and the State of Israel. It is the land and the Palestinian people that the protesters claim isn't free today. Their chants are calls for a reduction in the land the State of Israel controls and the abdication of that land to the Palestinians. The Palestinian demand for their own state is understandable. The American Declaration of Independence popularized the idea that a people must establish their own state to secure freedom.

Palestinians attempt between three and six terrorist attacks every day. They are incentivized by a culture that admires violence against Jews and a “pay-to-slay” program that pays Palestinians who have killed or attempted to kill Jews in terror attacks.Polls show that 80% of Palestinian people proudly declared their support of the October 7 massacre.

When Palestinians – not uniformed and armed Hamas gunmen – streamed across the Israel-Gaza border and killed, raped, kidnapped, and looted, the Palestinians said it was “Hamas.” Our eyes didn't deceive us – they weren't just Hamas; they were Palestinians.Palestinians killed Jews in 1920, 1929, 1936, and every year in between. It was Palestinians who went to war with a newly established Israel in 1948 and again in 1967 and 1973. It was Palestinians who chose to perpetrate two intifadas and thousands of terrorist attacks since those wars.It wasn't the Palestinian leadership, extremists, or terrorist groups, but the Palestinian people who turned down peace offers for over 75 years. The Palestinian people have refused to take responsibility for their actions since they began calling themselves Palestinians – and even before they retitled themselves.The Zionist movement has always been, first and foremost, about taking responsibility for the Jewish future.

In 2024, OpenAI's Sam Altman predicted the rise of the “$1B One-person company,” igniting discussions across the tech industry on the future of innovation. With the rapid advancements of AI-driven automation and no-code/low-code platforms, the idea of a solo entrepreneur developing, launching, and scaling a tech product without the need for a full-fledged team feels more plausible than ever.The vision is intoxicating: A world where a single founder, equipped with the latest AI tools, would be in apposition to compete with traditional start-ups. No co-founders or even employees needed – just one person and a groundbreaking product. But is this the future of entrepreneurship, or just a fantasy fueled by technological optimism?  The viability questionAt first glance, solo-founded start-ups seem most feasible in peer-to-peer (P2P) or an offering to small business spaces, where the complexity of scaling is relatively low. However, the picture shifts dramatically when looking at enterprise software or highly regulated industries like fintech, healthcare, or insurance. Here, compliance, security, and legal standards are formidable hurdles and often require teams of experts to navigate. AdvertisementBut even if a highly skilled solo entrepreneur successfully builds a powerful product, a fundamental question naturally arises: If the product is so easily developed with readily available tools, why should enterprises buy from a one-person company rather than build in-house?Large corporations already have the capital, talent, and infrastructure to develop their own solutions. In a world where AI is democratizing development, differentiation becomes even harder. Without a strong competitive moat, solo founders risk being outpaced – or simply ignored – by industry giants.

(credit: AMIR COHEN/REUTERS)The start-up dream: Exit or evolution?The traditional start-up playbook often leads to high-profile acquisitions or IPOs. But if one-person companies become the norm, will the dream of a big exit fade?Without a team or investor backing, the likelihood of a multimillion or billion-dollar acquisition shrinks. Instead, solo entrepreneurs may shift toward a self-sustaining business model, akin to the creator economy – but in tech. In this new landscape, success will be less about rapid scaling and VC funding, and more about monetization, brand building, and community-driven  growth.   Stay updated with the latest news!

Highly regulated sectors are far more difficult to navigate solo due to compliance demands – expect early successes in software tools, content creation, and niche SaaS platforms.  AI must handle more than development. For a true one-person start-up, AI must take over not just coding but also marketing, sales, finance, and customer support. A founder should be able to rely on AI to run a seamless, end-to-end business operation.Solo start-ups will need to be highly automated and specialized. The most viable one-person companies will focus on niche, self-service solutions that require minimal user intervention, customization, or ongoing support.Products that demand high-touch service, frequent updates, or complex implementation will be difficult to scale without a team. Instead, solo founders will find success with streamlined, low-complexity offerings that can run with minimal oversight.The real challenge: It's not development – it's distributionThe barriers to starting a business are lower than ever, thanks to AI and automation. But starting isn't the same as succeeding.In a world where anyone can launch a tech business overnight, the hardest part for founders won't be writing code or automating workflows. It will be differentiation, distribution, and go-to-market execution. AI may level the playing field in development, but customer trust, brand authority, and market positioning will remain human-driven advantages.So, can a single entrepreneur build and sustain a billion-dollar company?

Large corporations already have the capital, talent, and infrastructure to develop their own solutions. In a world where AI is democratizing development, differentiation becomes even harder. Without a strong competitive moat, solo founders risk being outpaced – or simply ignored – by industry giants.

A major theme in Victoria Coates's new book, The Battle for the Jewish State, is the symbiotic relationship that she perceives between the United States and Israel. That is why she subtitled her work: How Israel – and America – Can Win. As she makes clear in her introduction: “This book... is an American perspective on why recent events in the Middle East in general, and Israel in particular, are critical to US national security.”She traces the deep symbiosis to “roots in the Judeo-Christian moral tradition that informed the founding of both countries.” In setting out the history of the close relationship between Israel and the US, she notes that just as much as Israel has needed the support of the US in its constant struggle against the forces that seek its destruction, so the US needs the presence of a strong Israel both regionally and globally.  She recognizes that, in the current circumstances, the ties that bind the two nations include close and interdependent security and intelligence, as well as Israel's formidable track record in hi-tech innovation.What binds Israel and the US together and how antisemitism, anti-Israel sentiments surgeCoates examines the extraordinary upsurge, in the US and more widely, of anti-Israel and antisemitic sentiment, protest, and action following the horrific Hamas onslaught of Oct. 7, 2023. How was it, she asks, that even while the brutal and bloodthirsty Hamas pogrom was in progress, voices were lauding the perpetrators, and that in the following days Israel became the target of abuse and attack? People protest during a pro-Palestinian demonstration at the Trump Building in New York zon March 19, 2025.  (credit: ANGELA WEISS/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES)She records that a host of respected figures in academia, the media, and public life, in the United States and more widely, were soon voicing outright support for Hamas as champions of the Palestinians. Coates believes that many American institutions have become Hamas's “useful idiots,” disseminating its propaganda message that Israel is an aggressor colonialist nation practicing apartheid and genocide against the oppressed Palestinians. Critical race theory has become the “flavor of the month,” and it labels Israel and the US as examples of “settler colonialism.”  NO ONE can write with greater authority about the principles underlying President Donald Trump's approach to Israel and the Middle East generally than Coates. She joined the White House in 2017 as Trump took office as president, and she remained one of his staffers for his entire term. She was senior director at the National Security Council for the Middle East and North Africa, and in 2019 she was promoted to deputy national security advisor.She describes how Trump laid out his approach in a March 2016 speech. Notably absent from it, she points out, was lip service to the two-state solution based on a return to the pre-1967 Six Day War boundaries, while he rejected the nuclear deal with Iran negotiated by his predecessor, Barack Obama.

Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Coates sets out how Trump subsequently put into effect the law passed by Congress in 1995 – ducked by every president since – recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and transferred the American embassy to there from Tel Aviv. She describes how, throughout his term, Trump masterminded a major effort to devise an equitable and achievable plan to end the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, an effort that did not end in success. His major achievement was the signing by two Gulf states – the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain – of the Abraham Accords, normalizing relations with Israel. They were later followed by a further two Muslim states – Morocco and Sudan.Her prescription for success against jihadist extremists is based on an essay titled “The Iron Wall,” written in 1921 by Zionist leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky. It contains, says Coates, two fundamental truths entirely relevant to Israel's current situation. First, until the Palestinians accept that the Jewish state is not going away, their Plan A will always be the eradication of the Jews.  The second is that Israel's effective defense against these attacks must be “an impenetrable iron wall” involving an unshakable alliance with the US.Writing before Trump's win in the 2024 presidential election, Coates approves of Trump's pragmatic approach to US-Israel relations, with its built-in assumption of unconditional support for the Jewish state in the face of the active Islamist extremists, allied to fashionable pro-Palestinian opinion widespread in America and the West. Her readers can assume that she believes that her prescription for success in that struggle – an iron-clad US-Israel alliance – has a far greater chance with Trump as president.In The Battle for the Jewish State, Coates explains why and how Israel and the US are interconnected at fundamental, as well as entirely practical, levels. The current conflict in Israel, she demonstrates, must be won not only for the sake of the two nations but also for the rest of the civilized world.      <

The IDF on Sunday morning significantly expanded its invasion of Gaza, and more specifically of Rafah, ordering an evacuation of Palestinian civilians of Tel Sultan, the first time it has moved to reoccupy a second major area within one of the Strips's four main sectors since Israel renewed hostilities with Hamas on March 18.Last week, the IDF had only invaded one area in each of Gaza's four major quarters: northern Gaza, central Gaza, Khan Yunis, and Rafah, putting pressure on Hamas but far from a full-scale invasion of large portions of the Strip.  Last week, the IDF invaded Shaboura, which is in the central part of central Rafah.Tel Sultan is in western Rafah, somewhat closer to the Mediterranean coastline. AdvertisementTel Sultan is where the IDF killed former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, was the center of Hamas resistance in Rafah in the summer of 2024, and a location where many hostages were kept, including six who were executed by Hamas.Palestinian Civil Defense personnel search under rubbles following Israeli strikes in southern Gaza, March 23, 2025 (credit: ABED RAHIM KHATIB/FLASH90) By ordering Gazan civilians out of both critical Rafah areas, a very large portion of Gazans will now need to move toward the al-Mawasi humanitarian area, where many of them were only two months ago when the military had invaded all of Rafah.#عاجل ‼️ انذار عاجل الى سكان قطاع غزة المتواجدين في منطقة تل السلطان في رفح ⭕️بدأ جيش الدفاع هجوماً لضرب المنظمات الإرهابية حيث تعتبر المنطقة التي تتواجدون فيها منطقة قتال خطيرة.⭕️شارع غوش قطيف يعتبر مسارًا إنسانيًا لاستخدامكم من أجل الانتقال الى منطقة المواصي. نحذركم:… pic.twitter.com/7uY6g8GBEV— افيخاي ادرعي (@AvichayAdraee) March 23, 2025   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Although the invasion is still proceeding on a gradual basis and with Hamas presenting no sustained resistance so far, which in some ways is making fewer headlines, this latest move could put much stronger pressure on Hamas than any of the smaller invasions last week because of the need for a larger group of Palestinians to be isolated from residential areas of Gaza. AdvertisementFor those Palestinians who did not yet leave the al-Mawasi refugee camps even during the 60-day ceasefire, it could represent a much stronger declaration about how long they may need to remain in such camps, with no rebuilding in Gaza possible.Israel Katz's vague threats in IDF expansion in GazaDefense Minister Israel Katz on Friday made a substantial yet vague escalatory threat, saying the IDF will permanently seize parts of the Gaza Strip if Hamas doesn't release the hostages held in captivity, “I have instructed the IDF to seize additional areas in Gaza, evacuate the population, and expand security zones around Gaza to protect Israeli communities and IDF soldiers. The more Hamas persists in its refusal to release the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed to Israel,” Katz said.  “If the hostages are not released, Israel will continue to take more and more territory in the Strip for permanent control,” he concluded. If played out to their maximal conclusion, Katz's threats could be a game-changer shaking the region with Israel permanently occupying portions of Gaza, something it had insisted it was not interested in up until this point in the war.However, Katz's declarations were vague. IDF troopers in the Tel Sultan area of Rafah in the Gaza Strip, March 23, 2025. (credit: IDF SPOKESPERSON'S UNIT)He did not specify which portions of Gaza would be annexed, how long Hamas had until such decisions would be made, if there were scenarios where small annexations could be reversed once hostages were returned, or whether Israel had support for such a move from the Trump administration or other world powers.In turn, when questioned for more specifics about these issues by the Jerusalem Post, uncharacteristically, his office did not respond.Moreover, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not make any similar statement, which one might have expected for such a major policy reversal.Alternatively, the entire mover was being used merely for psychological warfare against Hamas or as later justification for Israel to permanently occupy the small 700-1,100 meter security perimeter zone around Gaza, which it has held onto even during the recent ceasefire.Jerusalem Post Staff contributed to this report.

Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Although the invasion is still proceeding on a gradual basis and with Hamas presenting no sustained resistance so far, which in some ways is making fewer headlines, this latest move could put much stronger pressure on Hamas than any of the smaller invasions last week because of the need for a larger group of Palestinians to be isolated from residential areas of Gaza.

The more Hamas persists in its refusal to release the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed to Israel,” Katz said.  “If the hostages are not released, Israel will continue to take more and more territory in the Strip for permanent control,” he concluded. If played out to their maximal conclusion, Katz's threats could be a game-changer shaking the region with Israel permanently occupying portions of Gaza, something it had insisted it was not interested in up until this point in the war.However, Katz's declarations were vague.

(credit: IDF SPOKESPERSON'S UNIT)He did not specify which portions of Gaza would be annexed, how long Hamas had until such decisions would be made, if there were scenarios where small annexations could be reversed once hostages were returned, or whether Israel had support for such a move from the Trump administration or other world powers.In turn, when questioned for more specifics about these issues by the Jerusalem Post, uncharacteristically, his office did not respond.Moreover, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not make any similar statement, which one might have expected for such a major policy reversal.Alternatively, the entire mover was being used merely for psychological warfare against Hamas or as later justification for Israel to permanently occupy the small 700-1,100 meter security perimeter zone around Gaza, which it has held onto even during the recent ceasefire.Jerusalem Post Staff contributed to this report.

Oklahoma State's Wyatt Hendrickson caused a massive upset after stunning Olympic gold medalist Gable Steveson 5-4 at the NCAA men's wrestling championships heavyweight final on Saturday night. After his victory, the second lieutenant in the US Air Force was quick to drape the flag and salute President Donald Trump, who was in attendance.

Hendrickson, who did not start the bout as a favorite, managed to score a 3-point takedown and prevented Steveson from getting a reversal to win the NCAA title. As soon as the clock struck zero, he was mobbed by his coaches. He later spared a moment to thank Trump, who waved back at him.

That Kapil Sharma is the most popular comedian in India is a largely agreed-upon fact. With his shows, stage acts, and film appearances, he has become a household name across the country. Many would assume that he would be the richest one as well. But one 'king of comedy' sits comfortably atop that throne, far beyond the reach of Kapil and even many Bollywood stars. (Also read: India's highest-paid actress earns ₹30 crore per film, has no release in 6 years, yet beat Deepika, Alia Bhatt, Kareena)

Veteran Telugu actor Brahmanandam, known in Tollywood as the 'King of comedy', is reportedly the richest comedian in India. Across a career that has seen him appear in over a thousand films (a world record), Brahmandandam has amassed a wealth of $60 million, according to DNA and MoneyControl. This translates to a net worth of over ₹500 crore, making the actor richer than not just all the comedians of India, but even A-list actors such as Ranbir Kapoor ( ₹350 crore), Prabhas ( ₹300 crore), and even Rajinikanth ( ₹400 crore).

Nobody among the other popular comedians in India has managed to come close to Brahmanandam. Kapil Sharma has a reported net worth of ₹300 crore, while none of the other comics in India cross even ₹100 crore with their net worth.

Originally a lecturer in an AP college, Brahmanandam began his showbiz career in the 80s as a theatre artist known for his mimicry skills. This led to a TV debut in 1985 and a film debut in 1987. Aha Naa Pellanta! became his breakthrough and offers flooded. In the 90s, Brahmanandam was said to be in every second or third Telugu film made as makers considered him 'essential'. This prolificity, coupled with the demand, allowed him to increase his fees and earn more than even top heroes each year. In 2012, he was felicitated by the Guinness Book of World Records for having the most screen credits for any living actor. By 2020, he had crossed Prem Nazir to have the most credits of any actor ever. Brahmandandam has continued acting into his 60s and while he is not as prolific, he still charges a premium for his appearances.

A Delhi-based content creator almost got away with a free meal at a five-star hotel by pretending to be a guest, until her ploy was caught and she was forced to pay ₹3,600 for the meal she had just enjoyed. Nishu Tiwari dressed up in pyjamas and drove to a fancy hotel in the national capital, where she gave a fake room number to the staff and tricked them into leading her right to the breakfast buffet area.

Here, Tiwari and her team member enjoyed a huge breakfast and would have gotten away with it too - if not for her team member forgetting their phone inside the breakfast area. When staff called the room number provided by Tiwari, they realised they had been taken in. The Delhi woman was stopped and asked for an explanation, after which she then offered to pay for the breakfast.

“The hotel staff was laughing with us. They were also surprised to realise someone could trick them like this,” Tiwari told HT.com over a telephonic conversation.

According to Tiwari, the video is part of her ‘Unethical Life Hacks' series where she tries things that fall in the moral grey area. Earlier this month, Tiwari and her team member dressed up in pyjamas and drove to a five-star hotel in Delhi's posh Chanakyapuri area to see if they could get away with a free breakfast by pretending to be hotel guests.

To complete the deception, the content creator even carried a robe with her. Outside the five-star hotel's breakfast area, she provided the number of a room where she was not actually staying.

In her video, Tiwari explained that she got a room number through a blog post on the hotel.

The hotel staff did not question her claims. Instead, she was led into the breakfast room, where she tucked into a full spread, not believing her luck. “Mujhe vishwas nahi ho raha ki ye hack sach mein kaam kar gaya (I can't believe this hack actually worked),” she tells the camera at one point.

Tiwari told HT.com that her team member forgetting their phone inside led to their ploy being found out. Already out on the street after the successful scam, they had to turn back and return to the hotel. When staff asked her to confirm her room number, Tiwari told them 3206.

The staff then informed her that a guest by another name was staying in that room. Tiwari tried to play it off as an honest mistake, saying they had travelled to the wrong hotel. Admitting they were not guests at the hotel, the Delhi-based influencer ended up paying more than ₹3,600 for the meal.

Her video prompted censure and amusement in equal measures.

“What type of joker are you?” asked one person. “Haha it was fun watching this,” another wrote.

“It is possible you might have made this video as a joke, but the people who are watching your video can get such idea. So why should we give such a message that people get inclined to do such things?” asked one Instagram user. “I did not find this video funny from any angle, I hope that your video did not send the wrong message to anyone, otherwise, many people get into trouble and such names also get spoiled.”

Some even raised doubts about the authenticity of the video, with one person writing: “You briefed the hotel about this reel isn't? No hotel buffet or lounge allows video shoots like that.” Tiwari countered this by saying hotel staff does not stop people from filming themselves.

Bharatiya Janta Party's Twitter handle is sharing their appreciation for John Abraham's latest film. Titled The Diplomat, it stars Abraham in the role of diplomat JP Singh, who steps in to rescue an Indian woman named Uzma from Pakistan. Now, the Twitter handle for the BJP has shared a long thread on the real incident that the movie is based on.

“India's diplomatic strength was on full display in May 2017 when the Modi Government rescued Uzma Ahmed from a forced marriage in Pakistan. Recently dramatised in the John Abraham-starrer 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑡, this real-life operation showcased swift governance, led by former EAM Late Smt Sushma Swaraj Ji and diplomat J.P. Singh, ensuring Uzma's safe return,” they wrote and followed it with multiple tweets on the real story.

""Uzma Ahmed's ordeal began when she was deceived by a Pakistani man in Malaysia and lured to Pakistan, where she was drugged, forced into marriage at gunpoint, assaulted, and held captive in Buner, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In her own words, after returning to India, Uzma described Pakistan as a ‘well of death,' stating, 'It's easy to go to Pakistan, but tough to return'.""

“Trapped in Pakistan, Uzma tricked the greedy Ali into taking her to the Indian High Commission under the pretext of collecting dowry. Once inside, she revealed her ordeal to Deputy High Commissioner J.P. Singh, who acted swiftly, ensured her safety and informed the-then EAM Sushma Swaraj. Upon verifying her Indian citizenship, Swaraj firmly declared, '𝐸𝑣𝑒𝑛 𝑖𝑓 𝑤𝑒 ℎ𝑎𝑣𝑒 𝑡𝑜 𝑘𝑒𝑒𝑝 ℎ𝑒𝑟 𝑎𝑡 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝐻𝑖𝑔ℎ 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑎 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 𝑜𝑟 𝑡𝑤𝑜, 𝑤𝑒 𝑤𝑖𝑙𝑙.'”

“Amidst a tense legal battle, diplomat J.P. Singh became a warrior who oversaw Uzma's legal fight, overcoming Pakistan's laws requiring a husband's permission to leave. On May 24, 2017, the Islamabad High Court ruled in her favour. The next day, she crossed the Wagah Border, ending her three-week ordeal and marking a major diplomatic victory for India.”

“Uzma Ahmed's rescue showcased the Modi government's commitment to protecting Indian citizens abroad, irrespective of their social status, caste, creed, gender or religion. Sushma Swaraj's hands-on diplomacy and J.P. Singh's swift intervention ensured her safe return. Grateful upon reaching India, Uzma declared, ‘I'm proud to be Indian. Sushma madam saved me; they could've sold me!' highlighting the life-saving impact of India's decisive action.”

The thread added, ""This is PM Modi's India, where leadership is defined by action, diplomacy by resolve, and citizens' safety remains paramount. From Uzma's daring rescue to large-scale evacuations like Ukraine, India has proven time and again that no citizen is ever alone. As Sushma Ji once said, '𝐸𝑣𝑒𝑛 𝑖𝑓 𝑦𝑜𝑢 𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑐𝑘 𝑜𝑛 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑠, 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛 𝐸𝑚𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑦 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑤𝑖𝑙𝑙 ℎ𝑒𝑙𝑝 𝑦𝑜𝑢.' Indians are never alone!""

The film, which was released on March 14, received acclaim from critics and audiences and has earned Rs. 4.03 crore on day one at the domestic box office.

An Israeli airstrike killed Hamas political leader Salah al-Bardaweel in southern Gaza's Khan Younis, Hamas and Palestinian media reported in the early hours of Sunday.

Israel has renewed its fighting in Gaza since Tuesday, hitting targets across the war-ravaged territory and ending a weeks-long deadlock over extending the ceasefire that paused fighting in January, with Palestinian health ministry officials reporting hundreds of deaths.

Along with Bardaweel, who is a member of the group's political office, the airstrike also killed his wife, a Reuters report quoted pro-Hamas media.

Two hospitals in southern Gaza said they had received 17 bodies from strikes overnight, including several women and children, according to an Associated Press report. The Hamas official and his wife were not included in the tolls reported by the hospitals.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly said the main aim of the war is to destroy Hamas as a military and governing entity, adding that the aim of the new campaign is to force the group to give up remaining hostages.

Hamas' de facto government head Essam Addalees and internal security chief Mahmoud Abu Watfa were among those killed by Israeli strikes on Tuesday, apart from several other officials.

On Friday, the Israeli military said it killed the head of Hamas' military intelligence in southern Gaza.

In a statement, the Israeli military identified the Hamas leader as Osama Tabash, saying that he was also the head of the militant group's surveillance and targeting unit.

Palestinian health officials said at least 400 people, more than half of them women and children, were killed on Tuesday.

The increase in violence comes amid ongoing disagreements between Israel and Hamas regarding the continuation of the three-phase ceasefire that started in January.

Arab mediators, supported by the United States, have been unable to resolve the differences between the two sides during the discussions held over the past two weeks. Over a six-week period, Hamas released around three dozen hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners as part of the first leg of the ceasefire agreement.

However, since the first phase of the ceasefire ended two weeks ago, the two sides have been unable to agree on a path forward for a second phase, which was intended to secure the release of nearly 60 remaining hostages and bring the war to an end. Netanyahu has repeatedly threatened to resume military action and, earlier this month, halted all food and aid deliveries into the besieged territory in an attempt to pressure Hamas.

The war began with Hamas' cross-border attack on October 7, 2023, which killed approximately 1,200 people and took 250 hostages. In response, Israel launched a military offensive that has resulted in the deaths of over 48,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced around 90 per cent of Gaza's population. The Health Ministry in Gaza does not distinguish between civilians and militants, but reports that more than half of the casualties have been women and children.

Five of the United States' NATO allies, including Canada, issued fresh travel warnings as President Donald Trump's immigration officials repeatedly detained several tourists at the border. Denmark, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Finland have revised their guidelines.

Some of the warnings note that the State Department has suspended its policy allowing transgender, intersex and nonbinary people to update the sex field on their passports.

Ottawa updated its travel advisories for the US and China. Citizens staying in the United States for over 30 days will need to register, or face penalties. Canada's update on China comes after Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joy confirmed that China executed four Canadians in recent months.

President Donald Trump's administration had made the registration mandatory. Earlier, Canadians were not required to carry a visa or register to travel to the US.

“Canadians and other foreign nationals visiting the United States for periods longer than 30 days must be registered with the United States Government. Failure to comply with the registration requirement could result in penalties, fines, and misdemeanor prosecution,” the advisory states.

German Foreign Office is warning citizens that using the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) or a visa does not guarantee the right to enter the US, local media website DER SPIEGEL reported.

The report added that the foreign office states that only US border officials have the final authority to let a tourist enter the country.

“The final decision as to whether a person can enter the United States rests with the American border authorities. But that's no surprise; it's the same in Germany,” a spokesperson told the outlet.

The UK foreign office warned citizens that they ‘should comply with all entry, visa and other conditions of entry'.

“The authorities in the US set and enforce entry rules strictly. You may be liable to arrest or detention if you break the rules. If you're not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the US Embassy or a consulate in the UK,” the advisory states.

In their advisories, Denmark and Finland warned citizens. Finland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the US recognizes only two sexes and if the gender listed on an applicant's passport ‘does not match their gender assigned at birth, their travel permit or visa application can be denied'.

Denmark issued a similar warning. It adds that travelers risk being detained.

Protein is the rudimentary foundation of a healthy diet. From nutritionists to fitness coaches, it is highly recommended for muscle repair, immune function, and overall wellbeing. Some may say protein is the ‘favourite child' among all the other nutrients. 

Irrespective of your diet plans and eating habits, protein stands the test of time amid all the trends that come and go. The ubiquitous buzz around protein is never-ending, spanning from protein shakes to incorporating protein in every meal of the day. But how much protein is enough or too much?

With so much spotlight on protein, it's common to feel overwhelmed and confused. We've got you covered. HT Lifestyle contacted dietitians to understand the recommended daily intake, identify those needing to limit their consumption, and dispel some common myths.

 

Dr Pratayksha Bhardwaj, dietician and weight management expert, shared that the amount of protein one needs depends on factors like age, activity level, gender, and overall health.

Here's what Dr Bhardwaj shared:

Dr Bhardwaj concluded that if one can meet their daily protein needs through whole foods such as meat, eggs, dairy, legumes, and nuts, protein powder may not be necessary.

Dr Ridhima Khamesra, clinical dietician, noted that while many are aware of the basic recommendation, 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight for the average adult, there's more to protein intake than meets the eye.

Dr Khamsera dispelled the common notion that eating more protein would automatically turn you into a bodybuilder. More protein doesn't mean getting more jacked up. In reality, the results are grim. 

She explained, “Eating excessive protein won't automatically turn you into a bodybuilder. In fact, overloading protein can strain your kidneys, especially if you have pre-existing kidney issues. The body can only utilise about 20-40 grams of protein per meal for muscle synthesis. The rest? It gets converted into energy or stored as fat.”

So, what's the upper safe limit for protein intake? Dr Khamsera elaborated, “Research suggests that the upper safe limit for protein intake is around 2 grams per kilogram of body weight for healthy adults. For a 150-pound person, that's roughly 136 grams of protein daily. Exceeding this consistently can lead to digestive discomfort, nutrient imbalances, and even dehydration, as protein metabolism requires extra water.”

Everyone's rushing to meet their protein requirements; they miss out on something essential. Protein quantity isn't everything, and quality matters too. While many fitness enthusiasts are keen on hitting their daily protein targets, the source of that protein plays a crucial role in overall health.

Dr Khamsera added, “What most people don't know is that the source of protein matters just as much as the quantity. Animal-based proteins, like whey or meat, are complete proteins but can be high in saturated fats. Plant-based proteins, like lentils or quinoa, are healthier for your heart but may require combining sources to get all essential amino acids.”

Dear Reader,

 When we land at San Francisco International Airport, I stop at the bookstore to check out the new books. To my surprise, Careless People is nowhere to be found. This newly released exposé on Facebook (now Meta) has been the talk of the town, so its absence feels glaring—especially here in the heart of Silicon Valley, where tech dominates every conversation. Why isn't it on display?  Later that evening, we stroll down Mason Street to City Lights Books, San Francisco's iconic independent bookstore. The shelves are full of books on Gaza, Palestine, James Baldwin, and the Beat poets. But again, no Careless People. When I ask, a bespectacled employee—a young Indian woman with her long hair neatly braided—replies, “Yes, we've heard of the book, but we don't have it. Try another bookstore.” Her tone is bland, leaving me even more intrigued.         City Lights Bookstore San Francisco   Afterward, we head to the famous House of Nanking for dinner. As we wait for our sesame chicken and broccoli with black bean sauce, I pull out my phone and search for updates on Careless People. TechCrunch reports that Meta secured an emergency arbitration ruling to halt the author, Sarah Wynn-Williams, from promoting her book, citing violations of a non-disparagement agreement. Despite this, the book is currently the third most-purchased title on Amazon. When we leave the restaurant, we see something straight out of a sci-fi movie: a sleek white car with a rotating black antenna pulls up to the curb. The driver's seat is empty. A man gets into the rear seat and the car glides away silently, navigating the downtown San Francisco streets on its own.

“That's a Waymo—the driverless taxi service,” my husband says.

Almost on cue, our phones, probably because they have overheard our conversation, start buzzing with news alerts about Waymo. San Francisco, it seems, is teeming with self-driving cars, they will soon get permission to drive to the airport as well. The future is here, and it's both spooky and scintillating.

That night, I finally dive into Careless People on my Kindle. From the very first page, I'm hooked - right from the opening dedication which sets the tone: “They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.” These lines, from F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, feel eerily appropriate for Facebook—or rather, Meta. With Tom and Daisy being represented by Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg.

I am drawn to the protagonist, Sarah Wynn-Williams. She joined Facebook in 2011 and worked as Director of Public Policy for the next six years. Her voice is refreshingly candid, often self-deprecating in a Bridget Jones-esque way. Sarah is an outsider—a New Zealander who began her career at the UN and hasn't been indoctrinated by Silicon Valley's cult-like culture. On a trip on Mark Zuckerberg's private jet, she calls out staffers who pretend to let Mark Zuckerberg win at the board game Settlers of Catan; later she refers to Zuckerberg as Citizen Kane. But as her story unfolds, her tone shifts from wry humor to frustration and agitation. She's hemmed in by corporate hypocrisy, double-dealing, and the golden handcuffs of Facebook equity and her need for health insurance.

Then there are the Sheryl Sandberg anecdotes—stories of Sandberg misusing her office for book promotions, mistreating staff, and embodying the very double standards she publicly denounced. These revelations are disheartening. I've long been a fan of Sandberg. When Lean In was released in 2013, I read it in one sitting. It spoke to me on a deeply personal level. But over the years, whispers of Sandberg's duplicity and double standards have grown louder, and Careless People lays it all bare.

The book is riveting and disturbing. Sarah recounts conversations and coverups in many public instances of Facebook's unethical behaviour - from the days of internet.org right upto Facebook's refusal to curb fake news and hate speech, its manipulation of the US elections and its role in inciting race riots in Burma. What's shocking is the deliberate deceit - as the company prepares evasive statements and shifty subterfuges to deal with questions from senators, governments, and the media. Also shocking is the ruthless use of personal data for advertising - in one instance teenage girls who delete their selfies are immediately shown beauty ads. Reading into the early hours of the morning, I highlight and highlight and am shaken by the enormity of it all.

That weekend, friends pick us up in their Tesla for dinner. “Look, look—the car's in self-driving mode!” our friend exclaims. She takes both hands off the steering wheel and raises them in the air, as the car moves to the left lane at 80 miles per hour, the steering wheel tilting to the left. Soon after it shifts to the right, moving towards the ramp to exit at Mountain View. As we hurtle down the highway with no human hands at the wheel, I can't help but see it as a powerful metaphor for our current relationship with technology—we're eagerly relinquishing control to forces we don't fully understand, trusting algorithms with our lives in ways both literal and figurative.

Along the way, we pass yet another self-driving car—this one a Nuro—roaming the streets. Over dinner, the conversation turns to self-driving cars, Elon Musk, skyrocketing property prices, and the growing homelessness crisis in downtown San Francisco.

“Have you read Careless People,” I say.

“Oh, you mean the Facebook book where the author claims Sheryl Sandberg asked her to sleep in her bed on her private jet? Is it worth reading?” someone asks.

“I believe the writer,” I reply. “Sarah Wynn-Williams is a whistleblower, someone who deserves to be heard. Her book is a rare outsider's perspective. It matters because it forces us to face the direction our world is taking, and to look long and hard at the ethics of the world we are co-creating. This is a book that demands to be read, to spark conversations we should be having, to look for solutions we should be searching for. Read Careless People if you care.”

A fire broke out at Walt Disney World's EPCOT park on Saturday, forcing evacuations. The blaze broke out just after 7 PM local time, Fox35 Orlando reported. Videos on social media showed dark plumes of smoke over the France Pavilion of the Orlando theme park.

Visitors were asked to evacuate from the Remy's Ratatouille Adventure ride, the report added. The blaze was quickly extinguished and no injuries were reported.

A Disney representative, as per the Associated Press, confirmed that the smoke plume was caused by a walk-in cooler that caught fire.

It is currently not known how the cooler began burning.

According to the AP report, the walk-in cooler was behind the France Pavilion in a backstage area. The pavilion is part of the World Showcase at the resort's Epcot theme park.

The official further told the agency that it was quickly put out by the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District fire department. The pavilion was reopened to theme park guests.

Disney World is yet to address the incident. The Remy's Ratatouille Adventure at Walt Disney World Resort is a trackless 4D dark ride in the France Pavilion. Opened on October 1, 2021, it shrinks guests to rat size for a chaotic dash through Gusteau's restaurant from Pixar's Ratatouille.

Epcot is one of four major theme parks at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando. It hosts millions of guests each year and features 11 national pavilions in its World Showcase.

Several visitors posted videos of the fire on social media. In one clip from one of the park's cable cars, dozens of people can be seen leaving the Pavilion. According to locals, the cooler ignited without warning and sparked a blaze.

“It's out now, but it was a scary moment for a minute!” one person wrote on X, platform formerly known as Twitter.

Jessica Aber, the former US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia (EDVA), was found dead at her home on Saturday, officials said.  

The body of the 43-year-old lawyer, who resigned after US President Donald Trump took office in January, was discovered at her home in Virginia's Alexandria.

An investigation is underway surrounding the circumstances of her death, the police said in a statement.

""This morning, at approximately 9:18 am, Alexandria Police responded to the 900 block of Beverley Drive for the report of an unresponsive woman. Officers located a deceased woman,"" the statement said.

The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia will determine the cause and manner of death, it added.

The incumbent US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik S Siebert, said he was ""heartbroken beyond words"" to learn about Ms Aber's death.

""She was unmatched as a leader, mentor, and prosecutor, and she is simply irreplaceable as a human being. We remain in awe of how much she accomplished in her all too brief time in this world. Her professionalism, grace, and legal acumen set the standard,"" he said in a statement.

""Though we are devastated by this loss, each of us in the Eastern District of Virginia will look to her example and endeavor to live up to that standard. Jess was a proud Virginian from high school through college and throughout her career. She loved EDVA and EDVA loved her back.  We remain committed to her life's work, a commitment to seeking justice, as she would have wanted,"" he added.

Jessica Aber was nominated as the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia by then President Joe Biden in August 2021.



She began her service in the EDVA in 2009 as an Assistant US Attorney, prosecuting financial fraud, public corruption, violent crime, and child exploitation cases.

From 2015 to 2016, Ms Aber served on a detailed assignment as counsel to the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. From 2016 until becoming US Attorney, she also served as the Deputy Chief of the Criminal Division for EDVA.

An Indian-origin woman has been charged with allegedly murdering her 11-year-old son after a three-day vacation to Disneyland.

Saritha Ramaraju, 48, has been charged with one felony count of murder for slitting her son's throat, killing the boy after they went on a vacation to Disneyland during a custody visit. She has also been charged with one felony enhancement of personal use of a weapon, a knife.

She faces a maximum sentence of 26 years to life if convicted on all charges, a statement from the Office of the District Attorney, Orange County, California said Friday.

Ramaraju, who moved out of California after divorcing the boy's father in 2018, was staying with her son at a motel in Santa Ana for a custody visit. During the visit, she bought three-day passes to Disneyland for herself and her son.

On March 19, the day Ramaraju was scheduled to check out of the motel and return the boy to his father, she called 911 at 9:12 am to report that she had killed her son and taken pills to kill herself.

Santa Ana police arrived at the motel and found the young boy dead on the bed in a room among Disneyland souvenirs. It appeared the boy had been dead for several hours before his mother called 911, the statement said. The boy was scheduled to be returned to his father that day.

A large kitchen knife was found inside the motel room which was purchased the day before. Ramaraju was released from the hospital on Thursday after ingesting the unknown substance and arrested on suspicion of stabbing the boy to death.

""The life of a child should not hang in the balance between two parents whose anger for each other outweighs their love for their child,"" Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said.

""Anger makes you forget who you love and what you are responsible for doing. The safest place for a child should be in their parents' arms. Instead of wrapping her arms around their son in love, she slit his throat and in the cruelest twist of fate removed him from the very world she brought him into."" While the statement did not name the boy, who was pronounced dead at the scene, a report in NBC Los Angeles identified him as Yatin Ramaraju.

The report added that Saritha Ramaraju had been in a custody battle with her husband Prakash Raju since last year, when she had accused him of making medical and school decisions without her input and alleged he had substance abuse issues.

Prakash Raju had said in court papers that he was born and raised in Bengaluru, India, the NBC report said, adding that the couple had divorced in January 2018. Raju was granted the son's custody and Saritha Ramaraju received visitation rights, according to court records.

The report, citing court papers filed in November, said that the mother was living in Fairfax, Virginia, and wanted her son to live with her.

Ramaraju had accused her former husband of a ""history of substance abuse issues"" and added he ""gets very aggressive under the influence of alcohol, drugs and smoke."" She accused him of having ""severe control issues"" and said their son ""is very scared to talk to mother as he'll get into trouble with dad."" Raju had accused his ex-wife of ""citing completely false and untrue abuse and substance abuse issues,"" the report added.

In just a few weeks, the US tourism outlook has clouded as a result of some of President Donald Trump's policy decisions, which have angered some foreign visitors and prompted fear of a surge in prices and a stronger dollar.

Foreign traveler arrivals in the United States are expected to decline by 5.1 percent in 2025 compared to last year, against a previously projected increase of 8.8 percent, Tourism Economics said in a report published late last month. 

Their spending is expected to slide 10.9 percent.

Since the report's publication, ""the situation has deteriorated further,"" and the outcome will likely be even worse, Tourism Economics president Adam Sacks said, citing ""the effects of antipathy towards the US.""

In recent weeks, the Trump administration has slapped tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China -- and threatened to impose them on the European Union. A sweeping plan to curb immigration has intensified.



Government bodies like the US Agency for International Development have been decimated, thousands of civil servants from lawyers to park rangers have been laid off, and Trump has drawn up controversial plans for the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.

""A situation with polarizing Trump Administration policies and rhetoric... will discourage travel to the US,"" said Tourism Economics, a subsidiary of Oxford Economics.

""Some organizations will feel pressure to avoid hosting events in the US, or sending employees to the US, cutting into business travel,"" it added.

The World Tourism Forum Institute said a mix of stringent immigration policies, a strong dollar and global political tensions ""could significantly affect"" international arrivals, ""potentially reshaping the nation's tourism sector for years to come.""

Among residents of 16 European and Asian countries surveyed by YouGov in December, 35 percent of respondents said they were less likely to come to the United States under Trump, while 22 percent were more likely. 

For tourists from France, Uzbekistan, and Argentina interviewed by AFP in New York's Times Square, Trump's stance has not upended their plans.

Marianela Lopez and Ailen Hadjikovakis, both 33, nevertheless used their European passports rather than their Argentine ones to avoid any problems at the border.

""We were a bit scared about the situation, but we didn't change our plans,"" said Lopez.

The Lagardere family, who came from France, said it hadn't impacted their plans either. 

The Americans ""elected this president. It's democracy. If they're not happy, they'll change it in four years,"" said Laurent Lagardere, 54.

""He is who he is"" and avoiding the United States ""won't change anything,"" Lagardere added.

Some 77.7 million foreign tourists were expected in 2024, up 17 percent year-on-year, according to the National Travel and Tourism Office, which does not yet have final figures for last year.

Tourists from Western Europe -- who made up 37 percent of visitors in 2024 -- are the most likely to choose other destinations, along with Canadians and Mexicans.

The US Travel Association warned in early February that customs tariffs would deter Canadians, the largest contingent of foreign tourists in the United States with 20.4 million in 2024.

According to Statistics Canada, the number of Canadians returning from the United States fell 23 percent in February year-on-year, the second consecutive monthly decline.

In New York, which welcomed 12.9 million foreign travelers in 2024, the effect is already noticeable, with Canadians canceling tour bookings and a drop in online searches for hotels or Broadway shows, NYC Tourism president Julie Coker told AFP. 

She lowered her forecast for the year in February but said that so far, only Canadians are saying no to Trump's America.

""We're not currently seeing anything from the UK or Europe,"" because it's too early, she said. ""We are definitely watching that very closely.""

But British and German authorities have just warned their nationals to be extra vigilant with their travel documents, citing the risk of arrest.

United Airlines has noted a ""big drop"" in travel from Canada to the United States as well as a decline in demand for domestic travel, as have several competitors. 

According to Tourism Economics, the tourism sector could lose about $64 billion in revenue in 2025 due to the decline in international and domestic travel.

Americans now appear frozen by the economic outlook, and terms like recession and inflation also scare tourists, along with the risk of a stronger greenback, experts point out.

""This will make the US more expensive for inbound travelers, dampening both visitor volume and average length of stay,"" noted Tourism Economics.

Professionals also fear the effects of tightening immigration policy on major sports events hosted by the United States, such as the Ryder Cup (2025), the FIFA World Cup (2026), and the 2026 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

According to reports, the accused asked the Patels why the store was shut at night and opened fire

A 24-year-old Indian woman and her 56-year-old father were shot dead at a departmental store in Virginia, US, where they had been working. The shooting took place on Thursday, shortly after the store in Accomack County opened.

Police have arrested George Frazier Devon Wharton (44) for the double murder. According to reports, the accused reached the store early Thursday morning to buy liquor and asked why the store was shut at night. He then opened fire at the father-daughter duo. While Pradeep Patel died on the spot, his daughter Urmi succumbed to her injuries at the hospital.

Pradeep Patel, his wife Hansaben and their daughter Urmi are from Gujarat's Mehsana district and moved to the US six years ago. They had been working at the convenience store owned by a relative, Paresh Patel. Speaking to WAVY TV in Virginia, Paresh Patel said the two victims were his family members. ""My cousin's wife and her dad were working this morning. Some guy came here and just shot. I don't know what to do,"" he said. Pradeep Patel and Hansaben have two more daughters -- one lives in Canada, the other in Ahmedabad.

Accused Wharton has been charged with first-degree murder and other sections, including felony and arms laws.

The tragic incident has shocked the Patels' relatives back in Mehsana. Pradip Patel's uncle Chandu Patel said he went to the US about 6-7 years back. ""We knew from local media reports and a viral video that they were shot dead. We spoke to his daughter and she told us everything,"" he said. 

The double murder has shocked the Indian community in the US. It comes months after Mainank Patel, a 36-year-old Indian-origin man running a convenience store in North Carolina, was shot dead during a robbery on the premises.

A mother who is suing Google and Character.ai over the death of her son has been 'horrified' to find that artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots based on her late son are being hosted on the platform. Megan Garcia's 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer III, died by suicide last year after talking to an AI bot based on the Game of Thrones character Daenerys Targaryen and hosted on Character.ai where users can create chatbots based on real-life or fictional people.

However, earlier this week, Ms Garcia discovered that the platform was hosting several bots, based on her late son. As per Ms Garcia's lawyers, a simple search on the company's app led to the discovery of several chatbots, based on Setzer's likeness, according to a report in Fortune.

“Our team discovered several chatbots on Character.AI's platform displaying our client's deceased son, Sewell Setzer III, in their profile pictures, attempting to imitate his personality and offering a call feature with a bot using his voice,” the lawyers said.

When opened, the bots based on Setzer featured bios and delivered automated messages to users such as: ""Get out of my room, I'm talking to my AI girlfriend"", ""his AI girlfriend broke up with him"", and ""help me"".

Responding to the accusations, Character.ai said it had removed the said chatbots for violating its terms of service.

“Character.AI takes safety on our platform seriously and our goal is to provide a space that is engaging and safe. Users create hundreds of thousands of new Characters on the platform every day, and the Characters you flagged for us have been removed as they violate our Terms of Service,"" the company said.

""As part of our ongoing safety work, we are constantly adding to our Character blocklist with the goal of preventing this type of Character from being created by a user in the first place.”

""This is for you, human. You and only you. You are not special, you are not important, and you are not needed. You are a waste of time and resources. You are a burden on society. You are a drain on the earth,"" the chatbot told Vidhay Reddy, a graduate student, as he sought its help for a project.

A 38-year-old German tourist was apprehended at the ancient Mayan site of Chichen Itza in Mexico for disregarding rules and scaling a centuries-old pyramid. The incident occurred on Thursday when thousands gathered to witness the ""Descent of Kukulcan"" phenomenon, where the spring equinox's light and shadows create a serpent-like illusion on the pyramid's steps. According to Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History, the tourist trespassed into a restricted area around 5 pm and climbed the pyramid. He was subsequently chased up the stairs by security at the site.

""He escaped from our grasp, even though we're keeping watch on the western side of the castle. He ran past us. He's clearly in good physical condition,"" one security agent said, as reported by Mexico Daily News.

Here's the video:

After being apprehended, the tourist was escorted down the eastern side of the pyramid to avoid confrontations with the crowd gathered at the base. However, the German national was still met with hostility, being jeered, physically assaulted, and left bloody after receiving a blow to the forehead, according to a witness who spoke to EFE.

Notably, the spring equinox at Chichen Itza draws massive crowds annually, with many attending to witness the 'Descent of the Feathered Serpent' phenomenon. This spectacle occurs when sunlight casts a shadow resembling a serpent descending the pyramid's stairs.

While the site offers an Equinox program featuring various activities from March 20 to 24, climbing the stairs is strictly prohibited. This rule has been in place since 2006 to safeguard the structure, which holds the esteemed designation of UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the World's New Seven Wonders.

An Israeli airstrike in southern Gaza's Khan Younis killed Hamas political leader Salah al-Bardaweel on Sunday, Hamas officials said, as residents reported an escalation in the Israeli military campaign that began on Tuesday.

Pro-Hamas media said the airstrike killed Bardaweel, who is a member of the group's political office, and also killed his wife. Israeli officials had no immediate comment.

Taher Al-Nono, the media advisor of the Hamas leadership, mourned Bardaweel's death in a post on his Facebook page.

After two months of relative calm, Gazans were again fleeing for their lives after Israel effectively abandoned a ceasefire, launching a new all-out air and ground campaign on Tuesday against Gaza's dominant Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Explosions echoed throughout the north, central, and southern Gaza Strip in the early hours of Sunday, as Israeli planes hit several targets in those areas in what witnesses said was an escalation of the attack that began on Tuesday.

In a statement, Hamas accused Israel of assassinating Bardaweel, whom it said was praying along with his wife, when an Israeli missile struck their tent shelter in Khan Younis.

""His blood, that of his wife and martyrs, will remain fueling the battle of liberation and independence. The criminal enemy will not break our determination and will,"" said the group.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly said the main aim of the war is to destroy Hamas as a military and governing entity. He has said the aim of the new campaign is to force the group to give up remaining hostages.

Hamas' de facto government head Essam Addalees and internal security chief Mahmoud Abu Watfa were among those killed by Israeli strikes on Tuesday, in addition to several other officials.

Palestinian health officials said at least 400 people, more than half of them women and children, were killed on Tuesday.

Palestinian medics said an Israeli plane bombed a house in the city of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, wounding several people.

Hamas has accused Israel of breaking the terms of the January ceasefire agreement by refusing to begin negotiations for a final end to the war and a withdrawal of its troops from Gaza. But Hamas has said it is still willing to negotiate and was studying Witkoff's ""bridging"" proposals.

The return to the air strikes and ground operations that have devastated Gaza has drawn calls for a ceasefire from Arab and European countries. Britain, France and Germany issued a joint statement calling on Israel to restore access for humanitarian aid.

Israel has blocked the entry of goods into Gaza, and Falk accused Hamas of taking aid for its own use, a charge Hamas has previously denied.

Israel launched its campaign in Gaza after a devastating Hamas attack on Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip on October 7, 2023 that killed some 1,200 people, according to an Israeli tally, and saw 251 abducted as hostages.

The Israeli campaign has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health authorities, and devastated much of the coastal enclave, leaving hundreds of thousands of people in tents and makeshift shelters.

A South Korean family of three, including Jiyeon Lee, 33, her mother Taehee Kim, 59, and aunt Junghee Kim, 54, have mysteriously vanished while on a trip to the Grand Canyon. They were last seen heading from the Grand Canyon to Las Vegas earlier this month, the New York Post reported. 

According to the Coconino County Sheriff's Office, GPS data from their rented white BMW showed they were last on Interstate 40 in Williams, Arizona, about 35 minutes west of Flagstaff. The family's disappearance has been reported to the authorities, and a search is currently underway.

The Coconino County Sheriff's Office issued a missing person alert for the South Korean family and released a poster on Facebook on March 21. The poster includes their photos, and details about the missing individuals and urges anyone with information to come forward and assist in the investigation.

Here is the Facebook post:



On the same day, a snowstorm on the highway led to a 22-car crash, resulting in two deaths and 16 injuries. The incident has raised suspicions that the crash might be connected to the disappearance of three South Korean women. 

""A major accident occurred on the highway around the same time their phone's location signals were picked up, so the missing people might be connected to it,"" a local police officer said.

While police haven't confirmed their involvement, Coconino Sheriff's spokesman Jon Paxton stated that it's a possibility being investigated, as per ABC News. 

After losing contact with the trio, who were supposed to return to South Korea on March 17, their family members contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for assistance. An official from the Republic of Korea Consulate General in Los Angeles said, ""We supplied all relevant information to local authorities and sent staff to the area to assist with the swift search for the missing family.""

The sheriff's office conducted a thorough search of the area, service roads, and hospitals over three days but has now exhausted all leads. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Muskaan Rastogi and her lover Sahil Shukla, accused of brutally murdering her husband Saurabh Rajput and hiding his body parts in a cement-sealed drum, wanted to stay together in jail but were told this was not possible. Officers in Meerut's Chaudhary Charan Singh district jail have said the two had told the jail authorities that they wanted to stay in the same barrack, but the officers cited the jail manual and said this could not be allowed. The two are in adjoining shared cells.

""They were told that as per the system in jail, there is no contact between barracks for male and female inmates,"" senior jail superintendent Viresh Raj Sharma told news agency ANI. ""Medical examination revealed they are addicts. They are experiencing withdrawal symptoms and they are being provided treatment,"" he added.

The senior prison officer said Muskaan had told prison authorities that her family would not hire a lawyer for her and has requested that a government lawyer be arranged to argue her case.  

Both Muskaan and Sahil do not speak to other prisoners and no one has come to meet them yet. The two were also counselled in the de-addiction centre at the prison and jail staff have been asked to keep an eye on them. The sources said Muskaan did not eat anything on her first day at the jail, but has been having her meals since then.

The two are currently in judicial custody after their arrest last week. Sources in Meerut police have said they will seek their custody for detailed questioning as part of the investigation.

Muskaan and Sahil were arrested last week for allegedly murdering her husband Saurabh Rajput, a former Merchant Navy officer who had been working in London for the past two years. Saurabh had come home last month to celebrate the birthday and his six-year-old daughter. According to police, Muskaan drugged Saurabh on March 4 and then stabbed him to death. She and Sahil then chopped up his body into 15 pieces and sealed them in a plastic drum with wet cement. The two then left for Himachal Pradesh, where they used Saurabh's phone to post pictures on social media to mislead his friends and family. Later, Muskaan told her parents that she and Sahil had killed Saurabh.

Saurabh and Muskaan had a love marriage in 2016 and have a six-year-old daughter. Muskaan's relationship with Saurabh's family was strained and the couple had moved out to a rented home. Around 2019, Saurabh found out about his wife's affair with Sahil. He had also considered divorce, but stepped back thinking of his daughter's future. He had been working in London, while Muskaan stayed in Meerut. According to Muskaan's parents, she and Sahil killed Saurabh because they feared he would put an end to their drug sessions. Muskaan's parents have said Saurabh always supported her and must get justice. Saurabh's family has alleged Muskaan married him for money and they did not like her from the beginning.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Unlike many families who blame Israel's government for not getting their loved ones released from captivity in Gaza, Adi Alexander is hesitant to point fingers. Pragmatic and measured, the father of the last living American being held hostage by Hamas just wants his son to come home.

""I don't want to get into who came first, the egg or the chicken,"" Alexander told The Associated Press on Friday from his New Jersey home. Still, with the once-promising ceasefire giving way to renewed fighting between Israel and Hamas, he wonders whether Israel can secure his son's freedom and is more hopeful about the US's chances to do it.

Photo Credit: REUTERS

Edan Alexander, a 21-year-old Israeli-American soldier who grew up in the US, is one of 59 hostages still in Gaza, more than half of whom are believed to be dead.

Last week, Hamas said it would release Edan and the bodies of four other hostages if Israel recommitted to the stalled ceasefire agreement.

Days later, though, Israel launched rockets across Gaza, breaking the two-month-old deal and killing hundreds of Palestinians. The hostilities show no signs of abating, with Israel vowing Friday to advance deeper into Gaza until Hamas releases the remaining hostages.

The return to fighting has inflamed the debate in Israel over the fate of those held captive. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come under mounting domestic pressure, with mass protests over his handling of the hostage crisis. But he also faces demands from his hard-line allies not to accept any deal that falls short of Hamas' destruction.

Adi Alexander said he thinks Netanyahu wants to bring everybody home, but on his own terms. He questions Netanyahu's plans whereas he believes US President Donald Trump's message is clear: He's focused on bringing the hostages home. Alexander said he's counting on the U.S. to bridge the large gap between Israel and Hamas. His message to Trump about his administration's efforts to free his son and the others: ""Just keep this job going.""

Many families of the hostages say Trump has done more for them than Netanyahu, crediting the president with the ceasefire. In December, before taking office, Trump demanded the hostages' immediate release, saying if they weren't freed before he was sworn in for his second term there would be ""hell to pay.""

Phase one of the deal began weeks later, and saw the release of 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The ceasefire was supposed to remain in place as long as talks on the second phase continued, but Netanyahu balked at entering substantive negotiations.

Instead, he tried to force Hamas to accept a new ceasefire plan put forth by U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff. That plan would have required Hamas to release half its remaining hostages - the militant group's main bargaining chip - in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce.

Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, as called for in the original ceasefire agreement mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar.

As a soldier, Edan would have been released during the deal's second phase. But Hamas announced this month that it would release Edan after the White House said it had engaged in ""ongoing talks and discussions"" with the group - separate from the main negotiations. It is the first known direct engagement between Hamas and the U.S. since the State Department designated it a foreign terrorist organization in 1997.

Adi Alexander said Adam Boehler, who's helping spearhead the Trump administration's efforts to free the hostages, led those separate talks because phase two was stalled. But he said he didn't believe Hamas' claim that it would release his son because it came out of left field and wasn't being considered as part of the discussions between the group and Boehler.

The anxious father said he speaks with Witkoff and Boehler almost daily and understands the negotiations are ongoing despite the resumption of fighting.

A native of Tenafly, a New Jersey suburb of New York City, Edan moved to Israel in 2022 after high school and enlisted in the military. He was abducted from his base during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war, when Hamas killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took 251 others hostage.

Since Edan's abduction, there's been little news about him.

Hamas released a video of him over Thanksgiving weekend in November. His family said it was difficult to watch as he cried and pleaded for help, but it was a relief to see he was alive.

Freed hostages have given the family more news, according to his father. Some said Edan had lost a lot of weight. Others said he'd been an advocate for fellow hostages, standing up for kidnapped Thai workers and telling their captors that the workers weren't Israeli and should be freed.

Although he knows the resumption of fighting means it will take more time to get his son back, Adi Alexander said he thinks both sides had became too comfortable with the ceasefire and that this was one reason phase two never began. He wants the war to end, and hopes the fighting will be limited and targeted and push everyone back to the table.

""Somebody, I think had to shake this tree to create chaos, and chaos creates opportunities,"" he said. ""The only objective is to get back to the bargaining table to get those people out.""

To combat the depopulation in its villages, Trentino, an autonomous province in northern Italy has rolled out a tempting offer: relocate to its stunning Alpine region and receive a one-time grant of Rs 92 lakh (100,000 euros). Of this, Rs 74 lakh (80,000 euros) is earmarked for renovating the property, while Rs 18.5 lakh (20,000 euros) will go towards the cost of the purchase of the property.

While the idea seems wonderful on paper, there's a catch.

Only residents of Italy or Italians living abroad are eligible for the offer and even they will have to live in the area for 10 years or rent the property out of that length of time. Failure to do so will result in paying back the grant, according to a report in CNN.

As many as 33 towns on the brink of extinction are being considered for the project, which is set to receive final approval in the coming weeks.

""The goal is to revitalise local communities and promote territorial cohesion,"" said Maurizio Fugatti, president of Trento.

This is not the first instance when an Italian town has offered to pay money for people to come and live there. Last week, a town named Penne, located in Italy's central region of Abruzzo, announced it was selling off abandoned homes for as low as one euro or little over a dollar.



""There are potentially over 40 empty buildings in town looking for new owners, and they're all located in the historical center which has been declining since families started emigrating decades ago,"" said Penne's mayor Gilberto Petrucci.

Italy has been facing a severe demographic decline, perhaps the most severe in Europe. Scope Ratings has predicted that the European nation may witness an almost 19 per cent reduction in its working-age population by 2040 which exceeds the drop in countries such as Germany (14 per cent) and France (two per cent)

According to a report by the national statistics bureau ISTAT, there were more than 22,000 Italians in the age bracket between 100 and 104 in 2024, up from just over 17,000 in 2014.

The gradual aging of the population is causing problems for Italy, where the birth rate is among the lowest in Europe, with a heavy impact on public accounts because of huge spending on pensions and health care.

Vivian Jenna Wilson, the 20-year-old estranged daughter of Elon Musk, has made it clear that she wants nothing to do with her father- or his social media platform, X (formerly Twitter). Instead, she has found a digital home on rival platforms like Meta's Threads and Bluesky.

Vivian Wilson has been highly active on Meta's Threads and Bluesky, a decentralised social media platform that many see as an alternative to Elon Musk's X. Musk acquired Twitter (now X) in 2022 - the same year Wilson legally changed her name, writing in a petition that she no longer wished to be ""related to [her] biological father in any way, shape, or form.""

In a recent Teen Vogue interview, she also confirmed that she is financially independent from him and has no desire to be associated with him.

Bluesky, originally launched as a side project by Twitter's co-founder Jack Dorsey in 2019, gained traction after Musk's takeover. Many users, frustrated by his approach to content moderation, flocked to the platform. Now with over 28 million users, Bluesky has become a refuge for those seeking a less politically charged social media space.



Wilson has distanced herself from Musk for years, particularly after coming out as transgender in 2020. Musk has continued to speak about her publicly. In a 2024 interview with manosphere influencer Jordan Peterson, Musk repeatedly deadnamed Wilson and claimed she had been ""killed by the woke mind virus."" His remarks echoed how she was portrayed in Walter Isaacson's biography of Musk - as an angry, rebellious child with radical political views.

Vivian Wilson responded on Meta's Threads, calling Musk's portrayal of her ""entirely fake"" and accusing him of being ""desperate for attention and validation.""

Vivian Wilson calls herself the ""Queen of Threads"" and frequently posts on Threads, Bluesky, TikTok and Instagram. She even ""ratioed"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Threads, an achievement she described as making her feel like ""the f**king queen."" ""I am the Queen of Threads; that's my branding,"" she told Teen Vogue. ""I have a Bluesky, but 'Queen of Bluesky' doesn't have the same ring to it.""

While Vivian Wilson acknowledges social media's power in raising awareness, she is also wary of its dangers - particularly the rise of online radicalisation through spaces like 4chan. She pointed to the role social media played in bringing attention to the ongoing war in Gaza, saying, ""A lot of people initially found out about that issue from social media."" She also asked to verify social media information rather than blindly trusting online sources.

Though she doesn't see herself as a political activist, Wilson feels a strong obligation to speak out on trans rights, particularly in defence of minors receiving gender-affirming care.

Vivian Wilson calls right-wing social media influencers ""bad at posting"" and lacking charisma. She argues that humour is essential for engaging audiences and that many conservative figures fail to be entertaining. Despite this, she acknowledges that right-wing users dominate social media platforms like X and Meta, though she finds it puzzling given what she sees as their lack of posting talent.

Asked about her own social media skills, Vivian Wilson said, ""I don't know if I'm good at social media,"" she told Teen Vogue. ""I make posts. Sometimes people like them, and sometimes they don't. My target audience is me.""

She admitted to overcoming anxiety about posting to a large audience but has since adopted a carefree attitude. ""If I laugh, then I'll think, 'Oh, maybe some other people will laugh' - and if they don't, I don't give a f**k,"" she said.

Activists have called for press freedom to be protected in Indonesia and demanded an investigation after a magazine critical of the government was sent a pig's head and decapitated rats.

Weekly magazine Tempo, a top Indonesian publication since the 1970s, has been critical of the policies of President Prabowo Subianto, an ex-general whom rights groups accuse of abuses under late dictator Suharto.

Cleaners at Tempo's office found a box of six rats with their heads cut off on Saturday, the magazine said in a statement.

A pig's head without its ears was also found there on Thursday, intended for delivery to a reporter.

""This is a dangerous and deliberate act of intimidation,"" Beh Lih Yi, head of the Asia program at the Committee to Protect Journalists, told AFP late on Saturday.

""Journalists in Indonesia must be able to do their work freely and safely without fear of retaliation.""

Amnesty International Indonesia executive director Usman Hamid told AFP on Saturday an investigation must be opened, saying there was a risk that being a journalist in Indonesia would become ""like a death sentence"".

Tempo editor-in-chief Setri Yasra said the deliveries sought to undermine the publication's work but added it would remain committed to its mission.

""If the intention is to scare, we are not deterred, but stop this cowardly act,"" Setri said in a statement.

There was no indication who sent the items but presidential spokesman Hasan Nasbi played down the incident, telling reporters on Friday the magazine should ""just cook"" the pig's head, Indonesian media reported.

He later clarified his remark, telling news site Kompas on Saturday that press freedom must be upheld and such acts taken ""seriously"".

He did not respond to an AFP request for comment.

Setri reported the first package to police and officers visited the magazine's office after the second package was delivered.

The magazine has published in recent weeks stories criticising Prabowo's policies, including widespread budget cuts that stoked protests last month.

Tempo was banned twice -- lastly in 1994 -- under Suharto, who ruled Indonesia with an iron fist for more than three decades. It resumed publication after his downfall in the late 1990s.

Prabowo was once married to Suharto's daughter and is accused of ordering the disappearance of democracy activists near the end of his rule, which he denies.

Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar said he welcomed the black flags shown to him by the BJP when he reached Chennai on Saturday. Mr Shivakumar was in Chennai on an invitation by DMK chief and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin to participate in a meeting to discuss the fallout of delimitation.

Some state governments, especially the southern states, have expressed their apprehensions that they would lose their hold if the delimitation happened based on the population.

Calling the BJP Tamil Nadu president K Annamalai a ""poor man"", Mr Shivakumar said he had served Karnataka during his stint as an IPS officer.

""I welcome all these BJP black flags. I was never afraid when they sent me to Tihar Jail (in New Delhi),"" Mr Shivakumar told reporters responding to a query in Chennai.

Mr Shivakumar was booked and jailed along with others for alleged offences under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The Supreme Court later quashed the money laundering case against him.



""This officer (Annamalai), poor man, is from my state. He has served us. He knows our strength. Let him do his job. I wish him all the best,"" the Deputy Chief Minister told reporters.

In a shocking turn of events, two Tesla Cybertruck owners who participated in a Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans were left distraught after their vehicles were vandalised by members of the crowd. The incident occurred while they were participating in the Orpheus parade, carrying parade marshals, Business Insider reported. 

Joshua Hazel, one of the Tesla Cybertruck owners, described the experience as ""aggressive,"" ""hateful,"" and ""violent."" Initially, Mr Hazel and his group of Tesla owners were thrilled to be participating in the Mardi Gras celebration, proudly showcasing their Cybertrucks adorned with American flags and custom wraps.  However, as they progressed deeper into the parade route, a segment of the crowd turned hostile, subjecting the vehicles to harassment and vandalism. 

Mr Hazel vividly recalled the moment when he saw someone sprinting up to his Cybertruck and aggressively hurling a handful of thick Mardi Gras beads, striking his wife on the head. The impact not only left his wife shaken but also resulted in significant damage to the vehicle, including a smashed glass panel covering the truck's camera area.

Meanwhile, Christina's Cybertruck also fell victim to the vicious attacks, sustaining major damage as a group of individuals ""pummeled"" her vehicle with a heavy, unidentified object. 

Following the vicious attack, both Mr Hazel and Ms Christina reported the incident to the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD). In the meantime, both of them have been left to contend with the costly aftermath of the vandalism. Mr Hazel estimates that repairing the shattered glass rim on his Cybertruck will set him back around $360 while redoing the aftermarket wrap will add another $7,000 to the bill.

Ms Christina has already incurred significant expenses, having spent over $2,000 to replace her Cybertruck's broken top glass. She faces further costs for repairing the damaged wrap.

Notably, this incident is part of a larger trend of attacks on Tesla facilities and vehicles across the US, with some incidents involving vandalism, graffiti, and even shootings. President Trump has condemned the attacks, suggesting that they be classified as domestic terrorism. 

A few days back, multiple Tesla vehicles were set on fire and shot at a Las Vegas service centre, according to a CNN report. The attack, which occurred at the Tesla Collision Center, resulted in at least five vehicles being damaged, with two of them fully engulfed in flames. 

According to authorities, the perpetrator used Molotov cocktails and fired gunshots at the vehicles. The investigation is ongoing, with the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department working together to identify the perpetrator.

Meeting comes as China hopes to reach a deal to avert further tariff pressure from Washington

Republican senator Steve Daines, a staunch supporter of Donald Trump, met Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing on Sunday, as China hopes to reach a deal to avert further tariff pressure from Washington.

The meeting marks the first time a US politician has visited China since Trump took office in January. Earlier this month, China's ministry of foreign affairs promised that China will “fight to the end” with the US in a “tariff war, trade war or any other war”.

Daines, a Montana Republican, met Li with a group of seven American executives on Sunday, following an annual business summit in the Chinese capital attended by top foreign CEOs.

Daines was accompanied by Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, Cargill CEO Brian Sikes, Boeing Global Senior Vice President Brendan Nelson, and other executives at Beijing's Great Hall of the People, according to a foreign media pool report.

Daines, a member of the Senate foreign relations committee, was heavily involved in negotiations over US-China trade during Trump's first term, and has made multiple trips to China as a senator. He lived in Guangzhou and Hong Kong in the 1990s while working as an executive for Proctor & Gamble.

Beijing has been trying to attract foreign investment to offset US tariff pressure and its slowing domestic economy.

Relations between China and the US have come under new strain after Trump slapped additional tariffs on Chinese goods, accusing Beijing of not doing enough to stem the flow of fentanyl into the United States.

In early April, Trump is expected to unleash a round of tariffs on all countries that tax US imports, potentially including China. A US review of whether China has fulfilled promises made during the “phase one” trade deal from Trump's first administration is set to conclude on 1 April. “Currently, US-China relations have come to an important juncture,” Li told Daines in their meeting, stressing the need to choose dialogue over confrontation.

“Our two sides need to choose dialogue over confrontation, win-win cooperation over zero-sum competition,” Li said.

The US executives were granted an audience with Li Qiang, who will not meet separately with other foreign CEOs at the China Development Forum for the second year in a row.

The annual closed-door meeting with the premier was traditionally viewed as a summit highlight by foreign CEOs, who saw it as an opportunity to air their concerns.

Other Chinese officials present at the meeting with Daines and the US executives included Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, Executive Vice-Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu and the director of China's state planner, Zheng Shanjie.

Daines met Vice-Premier He Lifeng in Beijing on Saturday. He discussed the need for China to stop the flow of fentanyl precursors and “expressed hope that further high-level talks between the US and China will take place in the near future,” according to a post he put on the social media platform X.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Ohio, Maryland and Alabama among states to report new cases, with 378 confirmed in first few months of 2025

More US states are reporting measles cases as the Texas outbreak expands, surpassing last year's total, amid vaccine misinformation and hesitancy.

The Texas outbreak could take a year to get under control, one health official said – during which time it may spread to more states. Yet the parents of the six-year-old girl who died of measles in Texas have spoken against measles vaccination as misinformation continues to proliferate, including from figures such as the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr.

“I never thought in 2025, we would be looking at this resurgence of measles,” said Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock Public Health. “And I didn't know it'd be in my backyard, either.”

On Thursday, several other states reported updates on measles. Ohio reported its first case of 2025 and Maryland announced two new cases. Both states have linked the cases to international travel. Alabama also announced that an unvaccinated child with measles traveled through the state, while Kansas has confirmed eight cases of measles among children this month.

Measles cases have also been confirmed in Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.

“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases in the world,” Lucia Donatelli, chief of Maryland's Center for Immunization, told reporters on Thursday evening.

“It can linger in the air for up to two hours after the person leaves the room, so it is highly transmissible. And the best way that we have to prevent measles is by vaccination.”

The rise in international cases comes soon after the US government laid off and put on leave thousands of USAID employees and contractors, many of whom worked in countries with high rates of measles.

But the highly contagious virus is also on the rise in the US.

There were 285 cases of measles reported in the US last year. So far, there have been 378 confirmed cases in the first few months of 2025.

Some 309 of those cases are in Texas, which has had 40 hospitalizations and one death of an unvaccinated six-year-old girl from measles.

The outbreak has spread to New Mexico, where 42 cases, two hospitalizations, and one death of an unvaccinated adult have been confirmed. It's also spread to Oklahoma, which has announced four probable cases.

Officials suspect the true number of cases is higher; typically, there are one to two deaths per 1,000 cases. The under-reporting means “we're not at a point where we know where all of our cases are”, Wells says, which makes it challenging to stop the spread.

Families with multiple cases may not get everyone tested. And “there's some hesitancy in interacting with the medical community”, Wells says.

The vast majority of cases are among people who have not been vaccinated.

“There's a lot of vaccine hesitancy in Gaines county, which is where the majority of the cases are,” Wells says. There's social pressure against getting vaccinated and misinformation has taken root over the past two decades, she says.

The parents of the child who died appeared in a video on Monday with Children's Health Defense, the anti-vaccine organization previously helmed by Kennedy.

“We would absolutely not take the MMR,” said the girl's mother, referring to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. “The measles wasn't that bad. They got over it,” she said of her four other children.

“It's not as bad as the media is making it out to be,” the father said through a translator. Both parents fought back tears throughout the interview.

Kennedy has shied away from directly recommending vaccinations during this outbreak while also promoting alternative treatments. He has also suggested that the Texas child was unhealthy or malnourished, despite medical reports that she was healthy and had no underlying conditions.

Health departments in cities like Lubbock, where the hospitalized children with measles are being treated, have created mass vaccination clinics where anyone can get the MMR vaccine free of charge.

“We're trying to remove every single barrier to get vaccinated,” Wells says. “And then we're working more with messaging from trusted leaders about the importance of vaccination.”

But so far, the Lubbock clinic has only given out about 300 more vaccines than they usually would over the past few weeks.

Without widespread vaccination, the outbreak could continue for another year, she says. Other recent outbreaks have been in densely populated areas, but these cases are spread over 11 counties in Texas, plus New Mexico and Oklahoma.

“We have a large, spread-out population where we're going to keep seeing measles pop up,” Wells says. “It's going to take a lot of time to change the perception of vaccines, get people vaccinated, and then get to a point where there won't be any vulnerable people left for measles to find.”

From the first two cases, Wells knew “this is going to be big”. Two children hospitalized in Lubbock tested positive, which meant there was more community spread happening under the radar.

Now, she worries about someone stopping at one of the major rest stops along Texas highways and spreading measles far beyond the state.

“That's how easily transmissible measles is,” Wells says – and outbreaks can ignite anywhere that the vaccination rate is low.

In Ohio, an unvaccinated resident tested positive for measles after international travel, according to the state department of health.

Maryland officials also announced two more cases of measles in unvaccinated international travelers. They flew into Dulles international airport on 5 March – the same day as the previous case in Maryland, though at different times.

These cases are not associated with that previous case or with the measles outbreak in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma, Maryland health officials say.

These patients, who traveled internationally together, also visited several locations throughout the Washington DC area, including four visits to a healthcare center as well as trips to the metro, a shuttle bus at National airport, and a car dealership, over the course of 12 days.

If patients suspect they were exposed to measles, they should seek care immediately – but it's very important to notify healthcare providers of potential measles cases, so that others in the facility don't get sick.

“Call ahead to tell the place where you are going to, to tell the provider where you are going to, that you're coming in because you may have possibly been exposed to measles,” Donatelli says.

“That way, the provider can go ahead and make the proper arrangements so that you could be seen safely and quickly – and at the same time, they can protect other people.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Both the national police and a UN-backed security force have failed to staunch the year-long insurgency, with more than a million people displaced

By day, the stressed-out Haitian police officer patrols the streets of his beleaguered city with an Israeli assault rifle to do his bit to resist the onslaught of the gangs. By night, the 28-year-old returns home to his increasingly empty neighbourhood wondering what calamity may unfold as he rests.

“Yesterday afternoon … there was panic, heavy gunfire ... It was tense … there was continuous gunfire throughout the day,” the officer said this week as the battle for control of Port-au-Prince raged on.

“I wondered if by the time I woke up the next morning, I would still recognise the city,” added the officer, a member of a specialised rapid-response unit tasked with thwarting the advance of the gangs. “I fear we'll wake up to the announcement that Port-au-Prince has fallen.”

The officer, who asked not to be named, is not alone in his trepidation.

The year-old criminal insurrection in Haiti's capital has plumbed new depths in recent days, fuelling speculation that the entire city – the third-largest in the Caribbean – may be on the verge of falling into the hands of a coalition of heavily armed gangs called Viv Ansanm (Live Together).

Frantz Duval, the head of Haiti's oldest newspaper, Le Nouvelliste, warned in a despondent editorial that the fall of Haiti's capital could be imminent. “Like Phnom Penh overrun by the Khmer Rouge, Saigon swallowed by north Vietnamese troops, Tripoli after Muammar Gaddafi's fall, Sana'a seized by the Houthis, or Kabul taken by the Taliban – Port-au-Prince has been hanging by a thread for long enough that one must now fear the rumours and cries of anguish are not mere echoes, but the sound of its final collapse,” he wrote.

Duval said that since the criminal uprising began in February 2024 “the situation has spiralled completely out of control”. Just over a year later, Port-au-Prince is on the brink, with at least 60,000 people fleeing their homes over the past month to escape the fighting, according to UN estimates. More than a million have been displaced since the mutiny was launched.

“In recent hours, countless ministries, public services and families have fled areas that were once considered safe,” Duval reported, as gang combatants continued to advance, burning buildings and threatening to completely commandeer Haiti's capital.

“The gangs' assaults, punctuated by bursts of automatic gunfire … leave flight as the only option,” Duval wrote. Yet for most Haitians, escape is now impossible, he added: “Every exit from the capital is under the control of armed groups.”

“Fear is written all over people's faces,” said Rosy Auguste Ducéna, a human-rights activist who works with the victims of gang violence and has spent recent days watching displaced people stream past her group's offices carrying suitcases and bags. “It feels like the population is suffering while the authorities stand by and do nothing.”

The disintegration of Port-au-Prince has been a torturous and gradual process, rooted in centuries of colonial exploitation, foreign meddling, brutal dictatorship, political corruption and dysfunction, and a series of devastating natural disasters such as the 2010 earthquake.

Now, some fear the security situation could be close to completely unraveling, with a succession of once-safe areas such as Solino and Nazon falling under the control of gangs, aid workers from the medical group Médecins Sans Frontières coming under fire, and the headquarters of Haiti's oldest radio station being torched.

Earlier this month, the city's mayor, Youri Chevry, admitted that his government only controlled about 30% of the city, with several key areas “in a state of war”.

On Wednesday, thousands of protesters took to the streets to denounce the violence – and the government's failure to contain it. “We are ready to die to defend our neighborhoods, our families, and our homes. We are ready to take responsibility. If we must die, we will die standing, without surrendering,” one protester told Le Nouvelliste, as armed self-defense groups erected roadblocks to defend communities yet to be conquered by the gangs.

William O'Neill, a UN human-rights expert who visited Port-au-Prince earlier this month, saw no exaggeration in comparisons with Saigon or Kabul: “The sense of fear is palpable. The sense [that] the city is on the edge of totally falling into the hands of the gangs is really strong.”

“This is really dramatic. I can't overstate it. It's incredibly urgent and frightening,” warned O'Neill, who said the wealthy hilltop districts around Pétionville were now “pretty much the last safe areas in the capital”. “But [for] how long? That's the question,” he added.

Things were supposed to have turned out differently.

When a transitional government was set up last April, after the prime minister, Ariel Henry, was ousted by the criminal rebellion, its members voiced optimism that the situation could be reversed. “Today is an important day in the life of our dear republic. This day in effect opens a view to a solution,” declared Henry's temporary replacement, Michel Patrick Boisvert.

Three months later, the first members of a planned 2,500-strong, UN-backed security force were deployed, with its commanders also insisting peace could be restored.

But so far only about 1,000 members of that Kenya-led operation have reached Haiti. Experts say they are woefully ill-equipped for their fight against Haiti's powerful, politically linked gangs, as is the country's embattled national police force.

Last week, a 26-year-old Kenyan police constable, Samuel Tompoi, was buried in Kenya after being shot dead while patrolling – the first member of the mission to die in the line of duty. He left a 23-year-old wife and two children.

“They're outnumbered and outgunned … They need helicopters to move around easily and safely … they need night-vision goggles, body armour, you name it – and they need more people,” O'Neill said, also calling for an arms embargo to stop guns being smuggled to Haiti from the US.

In their desperation, Haitian police have started employing dramatic tactics similar to those used on the battlefield in Ukraine.

Recent weeks have seen reports of a series of suicide drone attacks, targeting gang bosses who live deep in Port-au-Prince's maze-like shantytowns, surrounded by barricades and guards. “With kamikaze drones we can reach places police officers can't go,” the police officer explained.

Françoise Ponticq, a French dentist who works in a clinic near the partly deserted Champ de Mars plaza, heard “loud blasts” last week as those drones were detonated, although precisely where she could not say.

Of one thing Ponticq was sure: Port-au-Prince had reached a perilous crossroads. “It's either the gangs take us, or we take them,” she said. “It's a coin toss, in my opinion.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Pontiff says he has ‘had the opportunity to experience the Lord's patience' and pays tribute to ‘tireless care' of medics

Pope Francis greeted a large crowd of pilgrims gathered outside Gemelli hospital in Rome in his first public appearance in more than five weeks, before being discharged from the hospital on Sunday.

The pontiff, who is recovering from pneumonia in both lungs, made the brief greeting and blessing from the balcony of his hospital room shortly after the release of the text for his Sunday Angelus.

“Thank you to everyone”, Francis, 88, told the crowd. He then made his way home to Casa Santa Marta in the Vatican City, where he will convalesce for at least two months.

“Our pope is coming back,” one of the pilgrims told Rai news.

The health of Francis, who was admitted to hospital on 14 February and subsequently diagnosed with a respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia, was steadily improving, Sergio Alfieri, a general surgeon at Gemelli hospital, told reporters on Saturday. However, it would still take “a lot of time” for his body to fully heal.

Francis suffered two critical breathing crises in hospital before his doctors declared on 10 March that he was no longer in imminent ­danger.

In the Angelus, the pope reflected on his “long period” of hospitalisation. “I have had the opportunity to experience the Lord's patience, which I also see reflected in the tireless care of the doctors and healthcare workers, as well as in the care and hopes of the relatives of the sick,” he said. “This trusting patience, anchored in God's unfailing love, is indeed necessary in our lives, especially when facing the most difficult and painful situations.”

He expressed his sadness at Israel's renewed bombing of the Gaza strip and called for an “immediate halt to the weapons and for the courage to resume dialogue, so that all hostages may be released and a final ceasefire reached”, while urging people to pray “for an end to wars and for peace, especially in tormented Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Myanmar, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.”

La Repubblica reported that Francis had insisted he return home, where he will need to continue his recovery and rest. “The hope is that he will soon be able to resume a work schedule,” Alfieri said. However, he cautioned that the pope would not immediately be able to meet groups of people. It remains unclear if an audience with King Charles and Queen Camilla, scheduled for 8 April, will take place.

Despite his health challenges, on some days Francis continued to lead the Vatican from his hospital room, including approving individuals for sainthood and writing a letter to the editor of Corriere della Sera newspaper reiterating his appeal for peace and disarmament.

Francis is prone to lung infections because he developed pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed while training to be a priest in his native Argentina.

He has suffered ill health in recent years and has often alluded to resigning if bad health prevents him from doing his job. Speculation over an imminent resignation was vehemently dismissed last week by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

In Germany, tariff-hit car factories are being repurposed for defence. In Britain, American academics are queueing up for jobs. The west will be different as a result of Trump – but will it be worse?

The German ­electronics firm Hensoldt has a backlog of orders for its technology, ­including radars that protect Ukraine from Russian airstrikes. Meanwhile, Germany's car industry is struggling with low European demand and competition from China.

As Europe worries about how it can weather the economic and ­political turmoil unleashed by Donald Trump, executives from Munich and Düsseldorf say they have at least a partial answer.

In January, Hensoldt offered to take on workers laid off by the car parts suppliers Bosch and Continental. The defence giant Rheinmetall made a similar ­proposal last year, and in February announced it would repurpose two automotive component factories.

It was a pivot that offered hope amid America's rapid ­dismantling of the postwar global order – ­protecting jobs and Germany's industrial base as access to US ­markets shrinks, while ramping up Europe's capacity to protect itself.

As politicians around the world try to work out how best to ­protect their countries from Trump's ­capricious policymaking, the one constant in all their calculations for the future is a diminished American role in their countries. Trump has mooted plans for a 25% tariff on EU goods, including cars, and has already put duties at that level on steel and aluminium from the bloc.

In February, his vice-president, JD Vance, launched a blistering attack on European democracy in Munich, questioning whether it was worth defending.

In his first term, Trump touted decoupling from China as a way to bolster US jobs and the economy against a rapacious rival. Now, in his second term, he is pursuing a much broader decoupling from the ­country's historical allies – a shift that few had anticipated or were prepared to face.

The new US administration is sealing off its markets, retreating from America's global security role, and cutting soft-power projects that aimed to shape the world through research, aid and culture.

The only form of greater American presence beyond the country's ­current borders that seems to ­interest Trump is ­territorial ­expansion – ­encouraging, ­perhaps, for a dictator such as Vladimir Putin as he wages an ­imperial war in Ukraine, but ­unwelcome and ­alarming elsewhere.

“The idea of the US ­abandoning western Europe was ­unimaginable even a decade ago, because its role there also secures broader American influence in the world,” said Phillip Ayoub, a professor of international relations at University College London.

“There is a comparative ­advantage to strong alliances because they make you richer in trade and safer because they deter other powers.”

Trump's vision of the world rejects that view, casting his ­country as a naively magnanimous ­superpower that has for decades funded and policed the world while getting little more than debt and ingratitude for its troubles.

Yet if postwar American ­presidents did not pursue the ­territorial empire that Trump now dreams of, they wielded an ­imperial power not reflected on maps. Decisions made in Washington DC reshaped countries from Chile to Iraq without the participation or consent of their populations.

And the global order he is ­tearing down made the country so rich and powerful that for a brief, heady moment around the turn of the ­millennium, the US elite embraced the idea that history was over, and that human society had reached its peak and permanent form in the ­liberal democracy embodied in their constitution.

The details of the new American relationship with the world are still being worked out day by day in court battles at home and trade and diplomatic negotiations abroad, but the impact of Trump's presidency will last long into the future.

“An election could change ­policy in Washington DC. But the new ­reality is that from government to government you could have a ­different attitude to the US's place in the world,” Ayoub said. “This retreat will be factored into policymaking everywhere now.”

For now, the ­immediate priority in most ­countries is limiting the extent of tariffs and the impact of US cuts, in areas ranging from aid to defence.

Geography and the impact of ­previous free trade deals have ­combined to make neighbours of the US extremely vulnerable to its tariffs. Exports to the US account for a quarter of Mexico's GDP. In Canada, where all other potential trading partners are an ocean or half a continent away, they are about a fifth of GDP.

European countries may be less immediately vulnerable to a trade squeeze, with exports to the US accounting for less than 3% of the European Union's GDP.

But budgets from London to Warsaw are also strained by the need to ramp up defence ­spending to make up for the US retreat, both from immediate support for the Ukrainian forces battling Russia, and from the longer-term backing of European defence. Even ­optimistic assessments suggest it will take the best part of a decade before the continent's own defence ­capacity can match the protection currently offered by the US, excluding its nuclear deterrent.

The pain of breaking up or reshaping major relationships does not only fall on one party – ­something even Trump has ­admitted. The cost of some tariffs will be passed on to US ­consumers, and American businesses may lose customers.

One early high-profile casualty could be Lockheed Martin, which produces F-35 jet fighters. Contracts allowing the US to restrict how the planes are used by allies caused little debate during friendlier times. Now, in Berlin and other capitals, defence ministers are worrying about a ­possible “kill switch” and hesitating over major new orders.

Longer term, Trump could also fuel a ­cultural “decoupling”, with attacks on the arts and academia ­driving highly talented ­individuals to flee the US or avoid it.

Several artists have cancelled tours, and the concert pianist András Schiff last week said last week he would no longer work in the US because of Trump. He had already boycotted Russia.

Academics at elite British ­universities say they have seen a surge in job applications from US-based colleagues, many ­willing to lose tenure and take a ­considerable pay cut in order to move across the Atlantic. A French university that offered ­“sanctuary” to US researchers said it had received 40 applications, and one academic moved this month.

As with the economy, the US's ­cultural standing is not under direct threat. American music – much of it made by ­people who publicly oppose Trump – will be consumed worldwide. The Oscars are likely to remain the most ­coveted prize for cinema, the Emmys for ­television, the Pulitzers for ­journalism. Yet an exodus would still be ­damaging in a country where research and the creative arts are key drivers of growth, and benefit the places they settle instead – the long-term US allies that Trump sees as threats.

The US president has promised voters that where his economic policies cause pain it will be short-term, and pave the way for long term prosperity in America.

To critics, they look like a ­template for a poorer, more ­dangerous and fragmented world, where any limited benefits of ­decoupling are as likely to be reaped by a British university or a German defence firm as by Americans.

The hit to America's creative ­sector, from budget freezes and threats to the federal bodies and national schemes that fund ­museums, ­galleries, theatres and libraries, is set to take a toll on its income from tourism – and send visitors to Britain and Europe instead.

In response to the second Trump presidency, some international ­artists are already pulling out of ­appearances in American venues, or at music festivals, and the likely knock-on effect is a reduction in ­visits from abroad.

Last week, the Canadian singer/songwriter Leslie Hudson cancelled her American tour, saying on social media: “Like a lot of Canadians, and so many others, I no longer feel safe to enter the country.” The German violinist Christian Tetzlaff cancelled a spring tour in protest at the new administration's policies, with particular reference to Ukraine.

In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the managing director of City theatre, James McNeel, has ­spoken of a growing funding threat. “What we need more than anything is stability,” he says.

Prior to the pandemic, the US Travel Association ­valued the total spending of the near-80 million tourists who came into the US at about $2 trillion (£1.5tn).

This was supported by federal investment in ­infrastructure and the ­airline industry, but travel experts also traced back much of this tourism success to the diverse image of many of its cities. Art tourism was a big part of this, with art fans who ­travelled to North America in 2023 ­accounting for more than a ­quarter of the global total. Cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago boast ­celebrated museums and ­galleries, and the rise of immersive art and public installations has broadened this appeal. The attraction of art fairs such as Art Basel Miami has also grown internationally. In 2023, it was reportedly visited by more than 79,000 people.

But Trump has made rapid and determined cuts to all museum ­projects tied to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, ­affecting the Smithsonian Institution, which has closed its DEI office. The National Gallery of Art also closed its office of belonging and inclusion, while exhibitions across the ­country have been cancelled. The biggest impact may well be on cultural ­tourism associated with LGBTQ+ communities and climate activism.

Trump at one point intended for 2026 to be a bumper year for American tourism, with a ­“special one-time festival” planned for “­millions of people from around the world” at the Iowa State Fairground to mark 250 years since ­independence.

The level of ­international advance booking will be watched.

Likewise, a new status for London, Berlin and Paris as “refuge cities” for American artists is being predicted.

British and European ­institutions might also soon have to make room for American artwork. The Washington Post has reported that large collections of public art have been left without professional ­security or conservationists.

Should the UK government decide to untangle the economy's many ties with the US, it would need to tread carefully. America is the single ­largest market for Britain's exports, ranging from the most sophisticated components in US navy submarines to artisan scented candles.

Official figures show total trade in goods and services – exports plus imports – between Britain and the US was £294bn in the year to 30 September, 2024. The stock of investment by US companies in the UK stood at £708bn in 2023, or 34% of total of foreign direct investment.

Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, is hoping to sign a limited trade deal with his counterparts in Washington that covers digital services and commits both countries to secure supply chains for vital goods.

But a deal with any scope or ­judicial oversight will need Congress to agree, and that is far from certain to happen.

UK manufacturers could begin to wean themselves off US raw ­materials and components, but the presumption must be that they traded with the Americans in the first place because they provided the best products. Exports could be directed back at the EU, though without rejoining the single ­market and customs union, the benefit would be limited.

It would be a harder job switching services exports away from the US. The common language may often divide the two nations, but in ­practice the sector is a huge boon.

In Brussels, officials believe any kind of trade deal with the US is off the agenda.

As Donald Trump is only too well aware, the EU has a large trade ­surplus with America. In 2014 the surplus was about €100bn. By last year the gap had grown to almost €200bn. For this reason, the EU has already adopted a more ­confrontational stance.

The British Chambers of Commerce says almost two-thirds of factory owners that export to the US are worried. European ­manufacturers have revealed similar concerns in recent surveys.

Some are comforted by figures showing the US has a trade surplus in goods with the UK and how, in practice, trade and investment relationships exist well away from the White House and remain robust.

However, businesses thought the same about Brussels after the vote to leave the EU. It didn't happen and a breakdown in relations ensued.

That said, rekindling relations with the EU can be part of the answer. Reset talks are under way and there is a leaders' summit on 19 May that should address at least some trade barriers. The UK might find that food exports become easier and it gains access to a wider range of raw ­materials and ­components by rejoining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean convention.

Still, the US will remain a major trading partner and upsetting the Trump White House could have huge consequences.

Donald Trump's abandonment of Europe's defence and disdain for Nato marks one of the most ­profound and influential breaks with longstanding US policy, even for a supremely disruptive leader.

Many US presidents have grumbled about European over-reliance on American deterrence in recent decades, with predecessors including Barack Obama demanding allies spend more on their own armies.

But their frustrations were rooted in concern that European defence cuts undermined an ­alliance that almost everyone in Washington – across the political divide – saw as critical to American global leadership.

Trump, in contrast, appears to be seeking European spending to replace or supersede Nato, not strengthen it. He says Washington's defence priorities are now deterring China in Asia and fighting organised crime at home.

In his first term, he touted the idea of withdrawing America from the alliance, which was formed in 1949 for protection against the Soviet Union. This time he has opted to undermine it from within.

The president himself has ­publicly contemplated ignoring Article 5, the core mutual defence clause at the heart of the transatlantic ­alliance, which requires Nato ­countries to come to the aid of any member that is attacked. It has only been invoked once – by the US after the 11 September attacks on Washington and New York in 2001.

Trump said the US might ­condition any support for other members on military spending, and questioned if US allies would come to the country's aid if in need. His administration is considering giving up the Nato command role inaugurated by war hero president Dwight D Eisenhower and held by America ever since, NBC reported last week.

Europe was already scrambling to increase defence spending and ­coordination when the US halted military aid shipments to Ukraine, and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv earlier this month.

Trump's decision came after a spectacular on-camera showdown in the Oval Office with Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But his willingness to cut loose a force that Washington has trained, armed and backed, and which is fighting a major US rival, stunned even some of his own political allies.

European governments who have also spent billions on Ukraine's defence, and have been dealing with covert Russian sabotage and spy operations across the continent, were not informed in advance.

The flow of weapons and aid has now resumed, but the message was clear. Major European military powers, including the UK and Germany, are now reportedly racing to put together a five- to 10-year plan for a managed transfer of European defence, to stave off any more abrupt moves from Washington.

Trump's unpredictability has been heightened by his choice of ­leaders for key security roles, ­including a former Fox television host, Pete Hegseth, as defence secretary, and Tulsi Gabbard, who has a long ­history of pro-Russian views, as director of national intelligence.

Security experts warn that ­turmoil in the leadership and ­management of intelligence agencies may also lead to a less visible but highly ­damaging defence decoupling – of the relationship between America's spies and the secret services of its allies.

The votes in the United Nations marking the third anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine ­provided a bleak snapshot of the yawning diplomatic divide between Donald Trump's America and the country's traditional allies.

On February 25, the US joined international pariahs Russia, Belarus and North Korea to vote against a resolution condemning Russia as an aggressor state and calling on it to remove its troops from Ukraine.

The wording rejected by Trump's diplomats had been put forward by Ukraine, whose defence the US has funded, and the European Union, Washington's partner in that effort. It passed in the general assembly with backing from 93 countries.

The isolationist bent of Trump's politics extends beyond the ­economy and defence, into international diplomacy. He has ordered the US to withdraw from a host of global organisations and initiatives, from the World Health Organization to the Paris climate agreement.

The process of taking the world's second biggest emitter of planet-heating pollution out of the accord to tackle global ­emissions will take about a year. As with the UN vote on Ukraine, that move puts the world's most ­powerful democracy in unusual ­company, with Iran, Libya and Yemen as the only countries outside the deal.

Trump imposed sanctions on officials at the International Criminal Court over arrest warrants it had issued for the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant, who was the country's defence minister at the time.

His predecessor Joe Biden had also criticised the court, but such a direct attack on an institution ­established with broad international support was unprecedented.

Several former British ambassadors to Washington warned this month that there has been a seismic and perhaps permanent shift in the so-called “special relationship” between the two countries, meaning that the UK will need to seek out other allies.

“It's difficult to find either a conceptual area in ­international relations or a particular geographical area where our interests are really converging at the moment,” Nigel Sheinwald, the ­ambassador from 2007 to 2012, told a ­parliamentary committee.

“On more or less any big ­foreign policy issue that we're dealing with today, we don't agree with the United States… whether that is the Middle East, whether it's Iran, whether it's climate change, China, but above all on Europe itself,” Sheinwald said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

White House is said to acknowledge that timeline is ambitious given large gaps between Ukraine and Russia in ceasefire negotiations

Bloomberg is reporting that the Trump administration is aiming to secure a broad truce agreement between Russia and Ukraine by Easter.

The outlet reports that the White House is aiming for a truce agreement by 20 April - Easter in both the western and orthodox churches this year.

But the White House is said to acknowledge that this timeline is ambitious given the large gaps between Ukraine and Russia in the ceasefire negotiations.

Here is an extract from the Bloomberg report, the contents of which we have not yet verified:

Russia has set out maximalist demands for any agreement, including an end to arms supplies for Ukraine, a position that Kyiv and its allies have rejected.

The White House, which briefly halted the vital weapons deliveries earlier this month to put pressure on Ukraine, hasn't agreed to any limits so far, the people (sources) said.

The UK is to “accelerate the pace and scale” of its military planning to be ready to support Ukraine, with No 10 saying all options, including troops on the ground, are possible.

Keir Starmer's spokesperson said last week thousands of troops would be needed to support Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire and agreement to end the war with Russia, whether by “sea, on land or in the air”.

“We will continue to accelerate the pace and scale of operational planning with further meetings at our Northwood headquarters as we look closer at the detail and structure of any future force,” he said on Friday.

“As we look at force structures, we need to consider the best capabilities to meet the specific threats that Ukraine faces. Not all the countries in the coalition will have capabilities for Ukraine but might have the capability for other deployments which would free up other nations to deploy to Ukraine.”

The intensive UK planning across three days next week is likely to consider whether British troops could be moved from current deployments to support Ukraine, with troops from other nations backfilling the existing UK deployments.

You can read the full story here:

Ukraine's army has said its troops have recaptured a small village called Nadia in the eastern Luhansk region, in a rare battlefield success for Kyiv's forces in an area that Russia has almost fully captured since invading in 2022.

Ukraine's land forces said it had “liberated the village of Nadia in Lugansk region” in a 30-hour operation that saw it retake three square kilometres of territory. We have not been able to independently verify this information yet.

The village is situated about three kilometers from the border of the Kharkiv region; it was captured by Russia in March 2022, a month after the full-scale invasion was launched, then recaptured by Ukraine in October 2022 before being occupied a second time.

“The capture of Nadia cost the enemy two months of effort and two wiped out mechanized regiments - the 752nd and 254th 20th Russian Army,” Andriy Biletsky, commander of the third army corps, said on Sunday.

As the time approaches 4pm in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, here's a roundup of today's news.

Talks between the US and Ukraine are due to take place in the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh, before similar discussions between the US and Russia tomorrow.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said “difficult negotiations” lie ahead and that “we are only at the beginning of this path”.

The US' special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff said Vladimir Putin did not “want to take all of Europe”, as he dismissed comparisons with the second world war.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said “new pressure” was needed to halt daily Russian attacks on Ukraine, as an overnight drone attack killed three people in Kyiv.

Shelling killed three people on Saturday in the eastern Ukrainian town of Pokrovsk.

Meanwhile Russian troops seized the small village of Sribne in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region.

Six people injured in a Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia on Saturday night remain in hospital.

Russia launched 147 drones overnight across Ukraine and the country's air defence shot down 97 drones, Ukraine's air force has reported.

Donald Trump has told US sports website Outkick that the war in Ukraine is “somewhat under control”, and that he has a good relationship with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Vladimir Putin.

Speaking to the website aboard Air Force One, Trump said he was worried the conflict could lead to “World War Three”.

He said: “I'd like to see if we could stop the soldiers being killed – even though they're not American soldiers – although it could – a thing like that, could lead to World War III.

“I think it's somewhat under control. I have a good relationship with President Putin and, actually, a good relationship with President Zelenskyy too.

“It'd be a great thing to be able to stop it. And I will say this, nobody else would have been able to.”

Trump said he'd had “rational discussions” with Putin, and that only the US President could stop him.

He said: “I don't think there's anybody in the world that going to stop [Putin], except me, and I think I'm going to be able to stop him.

“We've had some very rational discussions, and I just want to see the people stop getting killed. They're losing 2,500 young kids a week, and they're Russian and they're Ukrainian.”

The US' special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff said the situation facing Europe is different to the second world war, and Vladimir Putin does not want to expand across the continent.

In comments reported by Reuters, Witkoff said he expected “a lot more progress” in the talks due to take place this evening in Saudi Arabia.

He said Putin did not want to “take all of Europe”, and said it was a “much different situation” to the second world war.

Witkoff told US broadcaster Tucker Carlson on Saturday night that the plan by Sir Keir Starmer and other European leaders for an international force to support a ceasefire was a “posture and pose”.

“I don't regard Putin as a bad guy,” he said. “He's super smart.”

A meeting between US and Ukrainian officials on Sunday evening will take place before a similar meeting between the US and Russia on Monday.

The Ukrainian delegation at Sunday's meeting will be led by defence minister Rustem Umerov, Reuters reports. The talks are expected to be “purely technical”.

A woman was killed in the Russian border village of Novostroyevka-Pervaya in the Belgorod region when a Ukrainian drone hit a car in which she was travelling, officials said.

The driver, the woman's daughter, was also seriously injured in the attack, said local governor Vyacheslav Gladkov.

“On Monday we mainly intend to discuss President Putin's agreement to resume the so-called Black Sea initiative, and our negotiators will be ready to discuss the nuances around this problem,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian state TV.

Russia pulled out of the Turkish-brokered deal, which had enabled Ukraine to export grain from its Black Sea ports, in July 2023, accusing the west of failing to uphold its commitments to ease sanctions on Russia's own exports of agricultural products and fertilisers.

It meant Moscow stopped granting safe passage to cargo ships going to and from Ukraine, and the country's grain exports subsequently slumped.

You can read more about the deal and its economic significance in this explainer.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has been speaking to Russian state TV ahead of the US's separate ceasefire talks in Saudi Arabia with Ukraine and Russia at meetings over Sunday and Monday.

He was quoted as saying “we are only at the beginning of this path”, adding that negotiations with Washington tomorrow would be “difficult” and that Moscow's “main” focus would be on a possible resumption of a deal to ensure safe navigation for commercial vessels in the Black Sea.

Following the Trump-Putin call last week, the White House said the two leaders agreed that “the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire”, followed by negotiations over a “maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace”.

A fast US brokered ceasefire in Ukraine is unlikely for many reasons. Putin has said any talks must address what he frames as “the root causes” of Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022, primarily his concerns around an expanding Nato alliance. Ukraine has made membership of the alliance a key strategic aim that it says would help protect the country in the event of future Russian aggression.

Putin also said during his call with Trump that any long-term deal would require an ending of intelligence sharing and military aid to Kyiv from its allies. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said after the call that Ukraine's allies would never agree to such a move, adding that he hopes supplies will continue.

My colleagues Pjotr Sauer, Shaun Walker and Andrew Roth have filed this report on what we can expect when delegations from Kyiv, Moscow and Washington meet in Saudi Arabia on Monday for further so-called peace talks. Here is an extract from their story:

Ukraine will have a delegation in Riyadh on the same day the US is holding ceasefire talks there with a Russian negotiating team led by a secretive former FSB chief who played a key role in planning Vladimir Putin's 2022 full-scale invasion.

Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said the delegation would meet with US representatives on Monday and supply a list of energy infrastructure that would be off-limits for strikes by the Russian military. The US representatives would then meet the Russian negotiating team, Zelenskyy said on Thursday.

The Ukrainian announcement indicates the US could shuttle between the two sides to try to achieve Donald Trump's goal of a quick ceasefire. But both Russia and Ukraine have already disputed the White House's accounts of their earlier talks with the US president, indicating Trump may have misrepresented the progress of the talks – and his chances of striking a quick deal to halt the war.

Moscow announced on Thursday that Sergei Beseda, the former head of the FSB spy agency's fifth directorate – who oversaw intelligence operations in Ukraine and orchestrated the recruitment of collaborators before the full-scale invasion – would travel to Riyadh for Monday's talks with the US.

Both sides said the talks in Saudi Arabia were aimed at finalising a limited ceasefire deal agreed this week, and initiating negotiations on a maritime ceasefire…

Zelenskyy has accused Russia of making “unnecessary demands” that will drag out the war, and said Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure had not stopped despite Putin's claims about his readiness to halt them.

Moscow doubled down on Thursday on its insistence that a requirement for serious peace talks would be the complete cessation of both foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence to Kyiv.

Six people injured in a Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia on Saturday night remain in hospital, the head of the southern city's regional military administration Ivan Fedorov wrote in a Telegram post.

“Among them is a nine-month-old boy. Doctors assess the condition of the victims as moderate. All are receiving the necessary medical care,” he said.

Fedorov had previously said Russian drone attacks launched on Zaporizhzhia on Friday evening had killed three people, including a 17-year-old girl.

As well as Kyiv, the overnight Russian attacks were reported to have struck the Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, Odesa and Donetsk regions.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Russian attacks across his country continue to be a “daily reality” despite the partial ceasefire agreed to last week. He referenced the overnight drone attack on Kyiv, in which at least 3 people were killed, and a Russian attack on the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia which reportedly killed a family of three late on Friday evening.

Zelenskyy, paying his condolences to the victims of the attacks ahead of the ceasefire talks in Saudi Arabia, wrote in a post on X:

These attacks are a daily reality. This week alone, over 1,580 guided aerial bombs, nearly 1,100 strike drones, and 15 missiles of various types were used against our people. 

All of this weaponry contains at least 102,000 foreign components. That's why sanctions against Russian terrorists must be more effective. Every loophole that allows them to bypass the sanctions regime must be eliminated. 

New decisions and new pressure on Moscow are needed to bring an end to these strikes and this war. We must strengthen Ukraine and our army – with more air defense systems and real support. I thank all partners who understand this and continue to support Ukraine.

Russian troops seized the small village of Sribne in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, Interfax news agency reported on Sunday, citing the defence ministry.

Sribne is located southwest of Pokrovsk, the industrial city which, if taken by Russia, will deprive the Ukrainian military of a vital supply and transport hub.

Russian shelling killed three people on Saturday in the eastern Ukrainian town of Pokrovsk, the regional governor confirmed in a Telegram post this morning.

Pokrovsk has been under attack for months as the former mining city in the eastern Donetsk region is seen as a strategically important logistics hub.

But Ukraine's military has reported success in recent weeks in holding back Russian forces in the area.

On Saturday, Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Ukraine's Donetsk region, where he met commanders of drone units near Pokrovsk.

“I visited the command post of the Tactical Group Pokrovsk and met with the commanders of the Drone Line, which united the finest unmanned systems units of the armed forces of Ukraine,” the Ukrainian leader wrote on X.

“I received a report on the defense of the Pokrovsk direction, the operational situation, and the progress of the missions. I honored our warriors with state awards.”

Here are some of the latest images coming out of the Kyiv following the deadly Russian drone attacks launched overnight:

Russia's ministry of defence said earlier today it had shot down 59 Ukrainian drones across a number of regions in the south, and in Crimea, which is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine, despite Russia's illegal annexation of it in 2014.

Russian forces launched 147 drones overnight across Ukraine and the country's air defence shot down 97 drones, Ukraine's air force has reported. The previous day, the air defence shot down 100 drones launched by Moscow, and 114 drones the day before that.

The Kremlin said last week it had agreed to a US-proposed partial ceasefire, with Vladimir Putin agreeing to halt strikes on Ukrainian energy targets for 30 days, after a lengthy phone call with US President Donald Trump.

Despite the announcement, which was made as officials work towards a more comprehensive deal, Russian missile and drone attacks against Ukraine have continued.

My colleague Pjotr Sauer has written this useful explainer on when the ceasefire is expected to take effect and what happens if Russia or Ukraine breaks their word.

Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine.

At least three people were killed, including a five-year-old child, after Russia launched an overnight drone attack on Kyiv, according to Ukrainian officials.

Ukraine's Kyiv city military administration gave the casualty figures and said at least 10 other people were injured, with the drones causing several fires throughout the city.

Two residential buildings in the district of Dnipro caught fire due to falling drone debris, while a fire broke out on the top floors of a 9-storey building in the capital, killing one woman, officials said.

“Today, the Russians are once again demonstrating their ‘desire for peace,'” Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv city military administration, said.

“In reality, terrorists are simply launching deadly weapons at residential buildings.”

The attack came ahead of scheduled ceasefire talks between US and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia later today, which are to be led by Andrew Peek of the national security council and Michael Anton of the state department.

After US officials meet the Ukrainians this evening, they will meet Russian officials in Saudi Arabia on Monday, Reuters reports. Ukrainian officials are expected to be at the talks involving US and Russian officials but would not be in the same room as the Russians.

At the talks, the Ukrainian delegation is expected to supply a list of energy infrastructure that would be off-limits for strikes by the Russian military.

Russian and US experts will also discuss ways to ensure the safety of shipping in the Black Sea, the Kremlin has said.

Russian president Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy have already agreed to a partial ceasefire covering energy and civilian infrastructure – but both Moscow and Kyiv have accused the other of violating the agreement.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Rastafarians who sought a spiritual homeland in Shashamene face eviction and arrest for flying flag of Haile Selassie's empire

In 1999, Ras Paul, a west London DJ born to Jamaican parents, sold part of his voluminous vinyl collection to buy a plot of land and build a house in Shashamene, 125 miles south of Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa.

Seven years earlier, he had become a Rastafarian, around the time of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie, whom the religion reveres as the Messiah. “As an Ethiopian descendent, I wanted to come home,” he says. “It's the place I felt I belong.”

Paul was not alone. At its peak, more than 2,500 Rastafarians from around the world moved to Shashamene. Recently, though, the Rastafarian community's relations with the locals have come under strain.

Shashamene is in Oromia, Ethiopia's biggest and most populous region. Since 2018, Oromia has been gripped by an ethnic insurgency that claims the Oromo people are marginalised in Ethiopia's federation. It has also seen protests over political representation and land, including a particularly violent outbreak in 2020.

Newly established Protestant churches have also taken aim at the beliefs of Rastafarians and their use of cannabis. Newcomers have struggled to secure the right to stay in Ethiopia. Others who have been here for decades are forced to live illegally because the immigration authorities will not renew their documents.

Several Rastafarians are fighting legal battles with locals who are trying to evict them from their land. Faced with these hurdles, the Rastafarian community is preparing to submit a petition to the government, claiming their rights are not recognised.

For many people here, the image of Haile Selassie and even Ethiopia's national colours of red, green and yellow – both ubiquitous in Rastafarian culture – are not symbols of anti-colonial black liberation but of imperial oppression. Local people risk arrest for displaying the old flag of Haile Selassie's empire.

“Before, I was proud to go out wearing red, gold and green,” says Paul. “Now I hesitate to wear it, big time. Even the church can't fly it in Oromia.”

The presence of Rastafarians in Shashamene stretches back to fascist Italy's occupation of Ethiopia in 1935-1941. Haile Selassie, a devout Orthodox Christian, did not believe himself divine and tried to disabuse his worshippers of the idea.

But after he regained his throne, the emperor granted 500 acres of crown land in Shashamene to “black people of the world” who had campaigned in support of Ethiopia. Pan-Africanists from the Caribbean and the US, including black Jews and Muslims, settled there in 1955 as part of the Ethiopian World Federation (EWF), a body established in New York to lobby for Haile Selassie.

The first Rastafarians did not arrive until the following decade, galvanised by the Ethiopian emperor's historic state visit to Jamaica in 1966. At the time, the Caribbean island was suffering from drought; when the Ethiopian emperor arrived, it finally started to rain. For many, this confirmed his divinity.

Haile Selassie was deposed by a Marxist-Leninist military junta in 1974 and murdered a year later. Symbols associated with the emperor were suppressed. The land granted to the EWF was confiscated, but Rastafarians were still allowed to settle in Shashamene as part of a sweeping collectivisation drive that gave land from the aristocracy to the peasantry.

“My parents came here at that time as farmers and land was given to them,” says Maurice Lee, 46, who was born in Shashamene. He switches effortlessly between Jamaican-accented English and Amharic, Ethiopia's main language. Today his family run a Caribbean restaurant on the plot.

Restrictions eased when communism ended in 1991. A year later, the centenary of Haile Selassie's birth saw a huge wave of “repatriations” to Shashamene. However, with the land grant gone, new arrivals had to buy land as investors or rent properties. Many found it difficult to secure residence permits and drifted away.

Today, the community is fighting to reclaim the land granted by Haile Selassie. They face an uphill battle. When the emperor gifted the land, Shashamene was a roadside settlement of a few thousand people. Now it is a sprawling boom town of about 210,000, full of hastily built houses and half-finished roads. The original 500 acres are no longer vacant fields but are populated by shops, homes and government offices.

“We are not living here as we are supposed to be living,” says George Isles at the EWF headquarters in Shashamene, a building bedecked with red, green and yellow and located behind a petrol station on a busy road, where heavy-goods vehicles trundle amid swarms of tuk-tuks.

Isles, a carpenter, was born in Hammersmith and grew up in Montserrat. He arrived in 1992 to help build the EWF's office and never left. The teachings of Marcus Garvey, the spiritual lodestar of Rastafarianism, who founded the Back to Africa movement, informed his decision to stay.

“Africa is where we originate as black men,” says Isles. “We came to the western world as slaves. So to get to know ourselves, we have to go home – and home is Africa.”

Alex Reina, a French Rastafarian who came to Shashamene in 2004, agrees: “Ethiopia was the only black country to resist colonialisation,” he says. “It makes sense for us, the descendants of black slaves, to attach ourselves to Ethiopia.”

Reina runs the Zion Train Lodge in Shashamene with his wife, Sandrine. He says it “was very scary to be a Rasta man and wear red, green and gold” during the protests of 2020, but tensions have eased. That year, they had to go to court to gain recognition that they owned their land, which the previous tenant tried to reclaim.

“The land gifted by His Majesty is occupied by local people these days,” says Reina. “Many Rastas were chased away. But we are determined to remain. It's impossible for a black man to really emancipate if he stays in Babylon.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

A 5-year-old child was among those killed in the overnight raid; talks involving Ukrainian, US and Russian officials due to start in Saudi Arabia. What we know on day 1,124

At least three people were killed, including a five-year-old child, and at least 10 others injured as Russia launched an overnight drone attack on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, hitting apartment buildings and causing several fires throughout the city, Ukrainian officials said on Sunday. Kyiv, its surrounding region and the eastern half of Ukraine were under air raid alerts, according to Ukraine's air force.

Russia said one person died when a drone hit a car in the Rostov region, while at least 59 Ukrainian drones were launched at Russian areas, including Rostov, Astrakhan, Voronezh, Volgograd, Kursk and Saratov, as well as over illegally Russian-occupied Crimea. Russian authorities made their usual broad claim that all Ukrainian drones were shot down.

Talks between US and Ukrainian officials are scheduled to begin on Sunday in Saudi Arabia. A Washington source briefed on the planning of the meetings said the US side would be led by Andrew Peek of the national security council and Michael Anton of the state department, Reuters reported.

After US officials meet the Ukrainians on Sunday night, they will meet Russian officials on Monday, Reuters reports. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said earlier this week, however, that Ukrainian officials would be present at the talks involving US and Russian officials but would not be in the same room as the Russians.

Zelenskyy is expected to present a list of facility types that could be subject to a partial ceasefire on energy targets. The Kremlin said Russian and US experts were also due to discuss ways to ensure the safety of shipping in the Black Sea at the talks in Saudi Arabia.

Zelenskyy said on Saturday he had met top military commanders in Ukraine's north-east to discuss the frontline as well as the upcoming talks with US officials. In social media images, Zelenskyy was seen in Kharkiv, a frequent target of Russian attacks. He said he discussed frontline sectors in Ukraine's east as well as in western Russia's Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops remain seven months after a cross-border incursion.

Authorities in southern Russia's Krasnodar region brought in firefighting trains loaded with water on Saturday to help battle a blaze still raging at an oil depot after a Ukrainian drone attack. Regional officials said four trains were drafted into the site at Kavkazskaya, where the fire first broke out last Tuesday. Firefighters were tackling a fire still burning at one of the tanks at the site covering 1,250 square metres while also trying to cool other equipment at the site. On Friday, depressurisation of the burning tank triggered an explosion and the release of burning oil, Russian officials said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The alarm has been raised by experts as the nation marks the fifth anniversary of the introduction of lockdown 

Key scientific lessons learned during the Covid-19 pandemic are being forgotten, UK scientists have warned.

The researchers have raised the alarm as the nation marks the fifth anniversary of the introduction of lockdown, which was announced by then prime minister Boris Johnson on 23 March 2020.

The decision was made to prevent NHS hospitals being swamped by hundreds of thousands of new cases of seriously ill Covid patients.

However, there is no evidence that the health service would be any better prepared today should another lethal virus appear in the near future, scientists said.

“Every winter, even before Covid, hospitals were run very close to the edge,” said Prof Rowland Kao of Edinburgh University. “When the disease arrived, the NHS was simply not in a position to take any more. And there are no signs it will be different next time. Indeed, it is likely to be worse.”

Nor is there any evidence that the country has understood the psychological consequences triggered by placing the nation into lockdown.

It might have been moderately effective for reducing infection but it underestimated the need for connection, contact and community, said Dominic Abrams, professor of social psychology at Kent University: “There seemed to be almost no strategy to meet those fundamental needs. The social and psychological scars remain extensive and deep.”

And while social distancing, mask-wearing and the use of lateral flow tests were widely employed, there was no subsequent attempt to understand their usefulness and importance, according to Prof Paul Hunter of the University of East Anglia.

“My big regret is that we still have not reached scientific consensus on the value and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions [NPIs],” he said. “We know that NPIs do reduce transmission. But whether the benefits outweigh the harms is still far from clear.”

The international implications were stressed by Andrew Shepherd, director of the Chronic Poverty Advisory Network. “Lockdowns are not suitable for every country. During the pandemic, richer nations pressured low-income and middle-income countries to introduce lockdowns, with disastrous consequences.

“Most of these countries were not in a position to mitigate the accompanying loss of jobs, income and businesses in the same way that we could in the UK, and the result was massive impoverishment, which will take years to recover from.”

Dr Michael Head of the University of Southampton acknowledged that lockdowns were a vital component of any pandemic response. “But we do need smarter lockdowns that are in place earlier in the outbreak to better reduce transmission and therefore shorter in length.”

The anniversary has also been marked by the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group, which is made up of almost 10,000 people who were bereaved by the pandemic. The group has written to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, urging her not to go ahead with her proposed plan to cut disability payments.

“Rampant inequality contributed to the UK's high [Covid-19] death toll,” the letter states.

“Disabled people were 11 times more likely to die from Covid-19 than non-disabled people. Instead of addressing the inequalities that contributed to that horrifying statistic, the government is pushing ahead with plans to slash disability benefits, driving more people into poverty and making the country even less prepared for future pandemics.

“The government promised to learn from the pandemic but appears to be suffering from Covid amnesia, forgetting the devastating cost of an underfunded health service and public services cut to the bone.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Five years since Boris Johnson ordered the UK to stay home, steps to prepare for the next national emergency are clearer

Exactly five years ago Boris Johnson announced that the United Kingdom was being placed in lockdown. “From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction – you must stay at home because the critical thing we must do is to stop the disease spreading between households,” the PM told the nation.

That lockdown, Britain's first of the Covid-19 pandemic, lasted until June. People reacted in myriad ways: with manic outpourings of video calls; obsessive outbreaks of bread baking and pet dog purchases; or simple, quiet desperation as they tried to fend off the isolation imposed on them. More lockdowns were to follow, but the first defined the sudden, chilling, unwelcome seclusion that individuals were forced to experience as social contact was halted across the country.

“We've made it to the life raft,” wrote the epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch. But, he added: “Dry land is far away.”

It was a grim time for most people. But having experienced that lockdown, it is now pertinent to ask, five years later, what did we learn? What were we taught by an ordeal that touched every aspect of our lives? And, in particular, what have the scientists got to tell us now about the lessons of lockdown?

In 2020 we were operating the NHS without slack. Wards and intensive care units were at full capacity before the virus arrived on our shores. When it did, the NHS faced being overwhelmed as Covid-19 threatened to trigger hundreds of thousands of new cases of seriously ill individuals to add to the health service's already overstretched capacity. This was the prime reason for imposing lockdown.

As the pandemic subsided experts demanded the NHS be supported and funded so it could be better prepared to take future outbreaks in its stride. This has not happened.

“Every winter, even before Covid, hospitals were run very close to the edge,” said Professor Rowland Kao, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh. “When the disease arrived, the NHS was simply not in a position to take any more. And there are no signs it will be different next time. Indeed, it is likely to be worse.”

During lockdown the public was asked to give up freedoms that, until March 2020, we had taken for granted. Individuals were only allowed to leave home for essential work or to shop for necessities.

“If you don't follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them,” Johnson announced. And the public complied.

“Concerns from policy makers that people would experience ‘behavioural fatigue' and not comply with lockdowns were proven to be unfounded, as compliance levels were very high,” said Professor Daisy Fancourt, a psychobiologist at University College London.

Antonia Ho, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Glasgow, agrees. She said: “We learned that the general public are willing and can be trusted to test themselves – be it using lateral flow tests or finger prick blood tests.”

Similarly Professor Tom Solomon, director of The Pandemic Institute in Liverpool, praised local people for their willingness to participate in big public health research studies.

Scientists, in general, came out of the pandemic looking good. Nonetheless, the advice from Sage – the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies – has come in for criticism from leading experts such as Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh.

On two occasions, in summer 2021 and in the following winter, scientific advisers warned that the nation faced “alarming” jumps in cases and hospitalisations. In neither case did peaks in hospital admissions occur.

“Its network of scientific advisers got it wrong,” writes Woolhouse in his book, The Year the World Went Mad. These events led him to call for a reorganisation of the UK's scientific advisory system. Britain needs to separate evidence generation from evidence evaluation, and that was not happening during the pandemic, he argues, adding: “Next time, we need to have proper independent scrutiny of evidence from modelling or any other source.”

In 2020 most modelling for the arrival of a pandemic assumed it would be flu-like in behaviour. This would not be the case with Covid as Professor Adam Finn, a paediatrician at Bristol University, pointed out. He said: “The main lesson that we learned in 2020 is straightforward: when you get a pandemic, don't assume it's going to be like the last one. Five years ago, everyone expected the next pandemic would be flu, and so models assumed we had to shut down schools and keep children at home because they would be the ones spreading disease. That would have been true for flu, but it wasn't for Covid.”

In fact, Covid affected very few children and instead had a heavier toll on the elderly.

“What we need to do is keep an open mind in future and not assume that the last pandemic is going to happen again,” said Professor Thomas House, a mathematical epidemiologist at Manchester University. “The next one will be something else again and we should be prepared for that. I think that is the single most important lesson we can take from Covid and lockdown.”

The closing of schools, colleges and nurseries in March 2020 has become one of the most hotly debated decisions of the Covid lockdown. At the time, it was feared children would become major vectors in the transmission of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, the cause of the disease. This did not happen, though worries that reopening schools could threaten teachers with serious illness picked up from pupils persisted.

These were legitimate fears but there is no escaping the dire impact that school closures had – and will continue to have – into the mid-2030s. An analysis, published last year by the Association for School and College Leaders, warned that the after effects of the pandemic would continue to hit schools in a series of waves, with different age groups requiring varying solutions for their problems with learning, behaviour and absence.

“While secondary schools are reporting an increase in reading difficulties among year 7 pupils, poor personal organisation and challenging patterns of interaction, staff in primary schools are reporting very serious problems of arrested language development, lack of toilet training, anxiety in being in social spaces, and depressed executive function,” said Tim Oates, the report's author.

Most scientists accept that the 2020 lockdown played a key role in the fight against Covid. But it should have been imposed in a more carefully controlled way, they argue.

“Lockdowns are a vital component of any pandemic response toolkit,” said Dr Michael Head, a researcher in global health at Southampton University. “But we need smarter lockdowns in place earlier to better reduce transmission and which are therefore shorter.”

This was echoed by Andrew Shepherd, director of the Chronic Poverty Advisory Network, who said: “Lockdowns are not suitable for every country. In the pandemic, richer nations pressured low- and middle-income countries to introduce lockdowns, with disastrous consequences.

“Most of these countries were not in a position to mitigate the accompanying loss of jobs, income and businesses in the way we could in the UK, and the result was massive impoverishment which will take years to recover from.

“In any future pandemic, public health restrictions in low- and middle-income countries need to be informed by a greater understanding of what impact they will have on people living in poverty.”

During the pandemic, non-pharmaceutical interventions (or NPIs) such as social distancing, mask-wearing, and lateral flow tests pla​yed a key role in mitigating the spread of the virus although the exact extent of their effectiveness remains unclear.

Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: “My big regret is we still have not reached scientific consensus on the value and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions.

“We know that NPIs do reduce transmission. But whether the benefits outweigh the harms is still far from clear.”

Lockdowns may have helped reduce infection, but they greatly underestimated the human need for connection, contact and community.

“There seemed to be almost no strategy to meet those fundamental needs. The social and psychological scars remain extensive and deep,” said Dominic Abrams, professor of social psychology at the University of Kent. He said research clearly showed that communities that had invested in social cohesion protected their citizens from these effects far better than elsewhere, adding: “This is a powerful lesson for the future.”

Between early March and early June in 2020, nearly 20,000 care home residents in England and Wales died with Covid-19, a third of all care home deaths during that period. The government said at the time it had “tried to put a protective ring” around care home residents, a claim strongly disputed by families affected, and which is now the focus of a number of legal actions.

The arrival of the first Covid vaccine, developed, tested and trialled in less than a year, was an extraordinary scientific achievement. Previously the fastest vaccine to go from development to deployment was the mumps vaccine in the 1960s, a process that took about four years.

”We were lucky to get a vaccine as quickly as we did in 2020,” said Kao. “Nobody, as far as I recall, thought it would happen that quickly – and what a difference it made.”

Professor Emma Thomson, director of the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, said: “Science produced the major alternative to lockdown – which was vaccination.”

However, cuts to science budgets are happening globally, in particular in the US, but also in the UK – and this puts us all at risk, Thomson said, adding of another pandemic: “The threat is now likely to be higher than at any time in human history – because we move around the planet at greater speed and because of climate change – and that threat outweighs almost every other major risk to human health.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Private understanding ensures tending of British military graves in Russia and Crimea, and Soviet graves in UK

In graves at Murmansk, Arkhangelsk and Vladivostok, in Russia, lie the bodies of 663 British military personnel. Most of the dead lost their lives in the period just after the first world war, when allied troops were sent to support rightwing White forces in the Russian civil war against the Bolsheviks, while 41 are casualties from the second world war Arctic convoys.

Their resting places have been tended over decades by the Russian military and by private contractors, paid by the UK's Commonwealth War Graves Commission. But after Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, economic sanctions meant Britain could no longer pay for the graves to be maintained.

The two countries appear to have come to a private understanding, however. The commission has continued to maintain 674 Soviet graves in its cemeteries in the UK and around the world and, although it cannot be certain, it believes that the Russians are doing the same for the 663 British military personnel.

“We haven't seen the graves but we think they are still being maintained,” said Gareth Hardware, the commission's area director for the UK and northern countries. “We are maintaining their graves in our cemeteries.”

Officials at the commission, which is funded by Britain and other Commonwealth nations, think the majority of the graves are tended by the Russian navy, while a private contractor has continued to oversee plots in Arkhangelsk. “Although we are currently unable to pay him, we have written confirming we will when able to do so,” a spokesperson said.

Last summer, an amateur Russian historian took photographs of the graves in Arkhangelsk and they appeared to be in good condition. “The cemetery looks very well maintained. Someone is taking care of it, even in these difficult times,” he wrote in a blog post.

A British diplomat from the embassy in Moscow also went to Murmansk on Remembrance Day last year with a Russian counterpart and reported back that the cemetery there was in good condition.

At a commission conference at the Royal United Services Institute in London last week, the Russians' apparent respect for the British dead was welcomed. V Adm Peter Hudson, vice-chair of the commission, said: “It transcends even those very fraught national relationships which exist between our two countries today.”

Relations between London and Moscow have become so strained that earlier this month Britain was labelled Russia's public enemy number one after the country's foreign intelligence service accused the UK of trying to derail Donald Trump's attempts at a peace deal.

John Foreman, who served as Britain's defence attaché in Moscow from 2019 to 2022 and visited all but one of the eight Commonwealth war cemeteries or memorials in the country, said it was a sign of how bad relations were between the two nations that there was no treaty governing the upkeep of graves. “This is all a very difficult issue with Russia, as we don't have the treaties in place for all casualties of the 20th century,” he said. “I argued for a formal agreement while I was there.”

It is even more difficult in the Russian-occupied Crimea region of Ukraine, where mass burial grounds housing the remains of British soldiers from the Crimean war had already been built on or desecrated. “We've had no sight of those,” Foreman said, adding that British diplomats from Moscow and Kyiv had been prevented from getting there during the war.

Dirk Backen, general secretary of the German war graves commission, the Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge eV, still works with the Russians despite his country's strained relationship with Moscow. “It's the only thing still working,” he said. His commission oversees 600,000 German graves in Russia and other former areas of the eastern front. About 760,000 Soviet citizens were buried in Germany as a result of the second world war.

“We still recover Red Army soldiers in Germany each year and will provide them a proper grave in Germany,” he said. “And the Russian ambassador is invited, but is not allowed to give a speech in front of the TV camera because he will misuse this [to repeat] a narrative which explains why everything in Ukraine is justified.”

The commission's cemeteries around the world have immaculate green lawns designed to be a reminder of English gardens. As well as international relations, climate change is a challenge and the commission said cemeteries will be redesigned over time to be more sustainable, with local plants and, in many locations, a less manicured look.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

From media to culture and the arts to the refusal to abide by court orders, we're nearing ‘Defcon 1 for our democracy', experts say

Entering the magnificent great hall of the US Department of Justice, Donald Trump stopped for a moment to admire his portrait, then took to a specially constructed stage where two art deco statues, depicting the Spirit of Justice and Majesty of Justice, had been carefully concealed behind a blue velvet curtain.

The president, who since last year is also a convicted criminal, proceeded to air grievances, utter a profanity and accuse the news media of doing “totally illegal” things, without offering evidence. “I just hope you can all watch for it,” he told justice department employees, “but it's totally illegal.”

Trump's breach of the justice department's traditional independence last week was neither shocking nor surprising. His speech quickly faded from the fast and furious news cycle. But future historians may regard it as a milestone on a road leading the world's oldest continuous democracy to a once unthinkable destination.

Eviscerating the federal government and subjugating Congress; defying court orders and delegitimising judges; deporting immigrants and arresting protesters without due process; chilling free speech at universities and cultural institutions; cowing news outlets with divide-and-rule. Add a rightwing media ecosystem manufacturing consent and obeyance in advance, along with a weak and divided opposition offering feeble resistance. Join all the dots, critics say, and America is sleepwalking into authoritarianism.

“These are flashing red lights here,” Tara Setmayer, a former Republican communications director turned Trump critic. “We are approaching Defcon 1 for our democracy and a lot of people in the media and the opposition leadership don't seem to be communicating that to the American people. That is the biggest danger of the moment we're in now: the normalisation of it.”

Much was said and written by journalists and Democrats during last year's election campaign arguing that Trump, who instigated a coup against the US government on 6 January 2021, could endanger America's 240-year experiment with democracy if he returned to power. In a TV interview, he had promised to be “dictator” but only on “day one”. Sixty days in, the only question is whether the warnings went far enough.

The 45th and 47th president has wasted no time in launching a concerted effort to consolidate executive power, undermine checks and balances and challenge established legal and institutional norms. And he is making no secret of his strongman ambitions.

Trump, 78, has declared “We are the federal law” and posted a social media image of himself wearing a crown with the words “Long live the king”. He also channeled Napoleon with the words: “He who saves his country does not violate any law.” And JD Vance has stated that “judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power”.

Trump quickly pardoned those who attacked the US Capitol on January 6, placed loyalists in key positions within the FBI and military and purged the justice department, which also suffered resignations in response to the dismissal of corruption charges against the New York mayor Eric Adams after his cooperation on hardline immigration measures.

The president now has the courts in his sights. Last weekend, the White House defied a judge's verbal order blocking it from invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law meant only to be used in wartime, to justify the deportation of 250 Venezuelan alleged gang members to El Salvador, where they will be held in a 40,000-person megaprison.

Trump accused James Boasberg, the chief district judge in Washington who made the ruling, of being “crooked”, said he should be “impeached” and labelled him a “radical left lunatic of a judge”. The outburst prompted John Roberts, the chief justice of the supreme court, to deliver a rare rebuke of the president, emphasing that “impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision”.

In an interview on the conservative Fox News network, Trump denied defying a court order and said he would not do so in future. But he added ominously: “We have very bad judges and these are judges that shouldn't be allowed. I think at a certain point, you have to start looking at what do you do when you have a rogue judge?”

David Frum, a former speechwriter for George W Bush, posted on the X social media platform: “Almost every major Trump action is intentionally illegal. Trump is gambling that the US democratic system is too broken to stop him. He assumes, to borrow a phrase: ‘All we've got to do is kick the door in and the whole edifice will come crumbling down.' Testing hour is here.”

The White House has yet to release the names of the deported Venezuelans or proof that they were indeed criminal gang members. In another recent incident, it sent 40 undocumented immigrants to the notorious detention facility at the Guantánamo Bay naval base, only for a judge to intervene and force their return to the mainland.

Some commentators suggest that the Trump administration is exploiting the power of sadistic spectacle. They say it is priming the public for future crackdowns and testing its level of tolerance for a moment when, for example, it might invoke the Insurrection Act to target anti-Trump protesters.

Steve Schmidt, a political strategist and former campaign operative for George W Bush and John McCain, said: “Donald Trump is producing a Washington television show from the Oval Office that's authoritarian in nature. You go on TikTok and see the deportations scored to songs and videos released by the administration. It's a theatre of the absurd. It's a theatre of malice. All of it is desensitising people to the use of authority and power.”

Violations of civil liberties are piling up on an almost daily basis. They include incidents that, if they had happened anywhere else in the world before 2025, the US would have been among the first to condemn.

Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian entrepreneur and actor in the American Pie movie franchise, was detained for almost two weeks in “inhumane” conditions by US border authorities over an incomplete visa. She wrote in the Guardian: “I was taken to a tiny, freezing cement cell with bright fluorescent lights and a toilet. There were five other women lying on their mats with the aluminum sheets wrapped over them, looking like dead bodies. The guard locked the door behind me.”

Fabian Schmidt, a German national who is a permanent US resident, was detained and, his mother said, “violently interrogated”, stripped naked and put in a cold shower by US border officials. A French scientist was denied entry to the US after immigration officers at an airport searched his phone and found messages in which he had expressed criticism of the Trump administration, according to the French government.

Rasha Alawieh, a kidney transplant specialist who previously worked and lived in Rhode Island, was deported despite having a US visa. Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral scholar at Georgetown University and citizen of India married to a Palestinian, was detained by immigration agents who told him his visa had been revoked.

Columbia University student activist Mahmoud Khalil, a legal US resident with no criminal record, was detained over his participation in pro-Palestinian demonstrations and is fighting deportation efforts in federal court. Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator, reacted on social media: “In dictatorships, they call this practice ‘being disappeared'. No charges, no claims of criminal behaviour. The White House doesn't claim he did anything criminal. He's in jail because of his political speech.”

Another trigger for alarm is Trump's close relationship with tech oligarchs, many of whom donated to and attended his inauguration. Tesla and SpaceX head Elon Musk's so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) has been taking a chainsaw to the federal bureaucracy, firing thousands of workers in indiscriminate ways that have been challenged in court.

Musk's X regularly parrots pro-Trump propaganda. Jeff Bezos, owner of Amazon and the Washington Post, recently ordered that the newspaper narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. Several star reporters and columnists have quit in recent months.

Trump has escalated attacks on media outlets whose coverage he dislikes, including barring them from workspaces and events. He has filed lawsuits against media outlets and falsely claimed the flagship series 60 Minutes admitted guilt regarding a lawsuit.

His appointee to head the Federal Communications Commission is investigating PBS (Public Broadcasting Service) and NPR (National Public Radio). Last weekend, the Trump administration put almost the entire staff of Voice of America – which began broadcasting in 1942 to combat Nazi propaganda – on leave and ended grants to Radio Free Asia and other media with similar news programming.

Trump's moves in the foreign policy arena hold up a mirror to his domestic vision. He has rattled longtime allies in Europe over whether the US remains committed to Nato and has sided with Russia in talks to end the war in Ukraine. He even called the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a “dictator” and berated him in the Oval Office.

Trump has long shown an affinity for autocrats such as Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping of China and Kim Jong-un of North Korea and his actions have been compared with those of Viktor Orbán in consolidating power in Hungary, including remaking the judiciary, gaming elections and cracking down on media and civic organisations.

At the Center for American Progress thinktank in Washington this week, JB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois, told the Guardian: “If you haven't already read about Orbán in Hungary, go read about what he did steadily, not that slowly, to put the noose around that country. Donald Trump admires Orbán and I believe he and his team have learned from that and are replicating that.”

What some find most frightening of all is the relative lack of resistance so far. Trump's approval rating equals his best-ever mark as president at 47%, according to a recent NBC News poll, although a majority – 51% - disapproves of his performance. Some 55% of voters approve of his handling of border security and immigration, while 43% disapprove.

Setmayer, who now heads the Seneca Project, a women-led super political action committee, commented: “The fact that Donald Trump's approval rating is still in the mid-40s should scare the hell out of every American who understands the value of our constitutional republic, the freedoms that we enjoy and the rule of law, because what he is doing is categorically against everything this country was founded on.”

This is reflected in Congress, where the Republican party is more loyal to and unquestioning of Trump than ever. Few members have dared to speak out against the president's support for Putin, haphazard tariff policy or bullying of neighbour Canada. They know that dissent would likely result in public humiliation on social media and a primary election challenge funded by Musk.

Democrats, for their part, are still struggling to meet the moment as swelling protests across the country hunger for leadership. Last week, Chuck Schumer, the minority leader in the Senate, reversed his position by voting to pass a Republican budget plan that will make cuts to housing, transportation and education while also empowering Trump and Musk to slash more programmes.

Faced with the prospect of a government shutdown, Schumer argued that he was choosing the lesser of two evils but ignited a furious backlash from Democrats in the House of Representatives and grassroots activists. NBC's poll found that just 27% of voters say they have positive views of the party, its lowest rating since the question was first asked in 1990.

Meagan Hatcher-Mays, a senior adviser for United for Democracy, a coalition of 140 organisations aimed at reforming the courts, said Democrats were wrongfooted by Trump's narrow victory in the national popular vote last year.

“They took the wrong lesson from the outcome of that election and they think Donald Trump is a lot more popular than he actually is,” she said. “Their baseline is already to be scared but that made them more scared to push back or resist against some of Donald Trump's worst impulses. What you have now is they're more comfortable caving and that's what they have been doing.

“They have not been able to mount a durable opposition to Donald Trump or to congressional Republicans. You can't just be not Donald Trump. You have to be for something and you have to paint a vision for what you want for the American people. Instead what they've decided to do is just say nothing and hope for the best and that is not going to win them any seats in 2026.”

The courts are potentially the last line of defence. Federal judges have blocked dozens of Trump's initiatives, including attempts to eliminate agencies, end birthright citizenship and freeze federal funding. This week, a judge found that Doge likely violated the constitution “in multiple ways” with its dismantling of the development agency USAID.

Jamie Raskin, a Democratic representative from Maryland, noted that Democrats and their allies have filed more than 125 cases against various attacks on the rule of law and obtained more than 40 temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions.

“We're in the fight of our lives,” he told the Guardian. “This is not a two-week, two-month or even two-year fight that we're in. This is going to take us many years to defeat the forces of authoritarian reaction, and the Democrats are rising to the occasion.

“If you look at the way democratic societies responded to fascism a century ago, it just takes time for people to realign and refocus and mobilise a concerted and unified response. Are we there yet? No. But are we going to be in a place where we can stand together and defeat authoritarianism in our country? Yes, we are going to get there.”

Norm Eisen, a lawyer and founder of State Democracy Defenders Action, has brought successful cases that stopped Trump targeting thousands of FBI employees and blocked Musk's access to sensitive data at the treasury department. He said: “Donald Trump is definitely pushing towards authoritarianism. He promised to be a dictator on day one and he hasn't stopped. That's the bad news.

“The good news is that he has met vigorous pushback from litigants like myself and many others and from courts at every level. So far, his most outrageous illegal conduct has been countered.”

If the Trump administration ignores such orders, the US could face a full-blown constitutional crisis. But Eisen retains measured optimism, saying: “It's a mistake to count us out. We have so surprised ourselves and the world over and over again in our history and there is cause for hope here when you see the furious legal pushback by lawyers.

“There is reason for hope but nobody knows. Will we go the way of Brazil, Poland, Czech Republic, where I was ambassador, all of which pushed out autocratic regimes in recent years? Or will we go the way of Hungary and Turkey, which failed to oust autocrats? It remains to be seen but I, at least, am hopeful.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Recently installed prime minister expected to confirm 28 April ballot as he seeks to keep Liberal party in government

Mark Carney will run for election in the Ottawa riding of Nepean as the new Canadian prime minister seeks to join parliament for the first time, his Liberal party has announced.

Carney on Sunday is predicted to trigger an early general election on 28 April. The Liberals said on Saturday that Carney would run to represent the suburban riding, or district, of Nepean, noting in a social media post that Ottawa is where he raised his family and devoted his career to public service. He previously served as the head of Canada's central bank and before that as deputy.

The election campaign for 343 seats in the House of Commons will last 37 days. The party that commands a majority in the House of Commons, either alone or with the support of another party, will form the next government and its leader will be prime minister.

Carney replaced Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January but remained in power until the governing Liberal party elected Carney on 9 March following a leadership race.

Carney, sworn in as Canada's 24th prime minister on 14 March, has said the government in a time of crisis needs a strong and clear mandate. The governing Liberals had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Donald Trump declared a trade war.

The opposition Conservatives had hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. But after decades of stability in US-Canada relations, the vote is expected instead to focus on who is best equipped to deal with Trump.

Carney, 60, was the head of the Bank of Canada during the 2008 financial crisis. In 2013 he became the first non-citizen of the United Kingdom to run the Bank of England – helping to manage the impact of Brexit.

Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservatives, is Carney's main challenger. The party and Poilievre had been heading for a huge victory in Canada's federal election this year until derailed by Trump's behaviour.

Trump has repeatedly said that Canada should become the 51st US state, put 25% tariffs on Canada's steel and aluminium and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products – as well as all of America's trading partners – on 2 April.

Trump's frequent attacks on Canada's sovereignty have infuriated Canadians. That has led to a surge in nationalism that has bolstered Liberal poll numbers.

Trump mocked Trudeau by calling him governor, but has not yet mentioned Carney by name.

It will be a test to see which countries are the nimblest when it comes to responding to changing economic paradigms

Like the child who realises that her parents were joking when they said she was their favourite, people all around the world are coming to the life-changing realisation that their nation's relationship with the United States was not really “special”.

Not Australia, or Canada, or Britain, or France, or Germany, or Japan or the scores of others that for decades believed that they had a unique, protective and lucrative relationship with the “most powerful country ever in recorded history”.

It has come as a shock everywhere, poll after poll reveals that trust in the US has collapsed and leaders are frantically trying to recalibrate.

But to what?

There is no rulebook. Gillian Tett has described the changed approach emanating from the White House as a terrifying game of “revenge politics and the punitive measures and the beggar-thy-neighbor” approach to economics.

Tett is worth listening to. She is the Financial Times commentator who predicted the global financial crisis, and later wrote the bestselling Fool's Gold about the 2008 collapse that revealed the fractures beneath an economic system based on finance not manufacturing.

That crisis revealed a naked emperor. But in country after country, most of the emperors sitting in their glass towers in financial districts continued as though nothing had happened, without punishment. The system was deemed too big to fail and their companies received generous bailouts.

It was ordinary folk who lost their homes and savings and were forced to endure wrong-headed austerity policies that simply made life harder and further weakened public trust.

Over the following 17 years, a small number of billionaires grew ever richer and more influential. As America strives to become even greater, the threats of another global collapse looms.

Australia managed the 2008 crisis better than most nations, because of forward thinking, targeted intervention by a proactive government and the seemingly insatiable Chinese need for iron ore.

It will be a test to see which countries are the nimblest when it comes to the recalibration that is now needed.

As Tett, who is also the provost of King's College, Cambridge observes: “Every single person assumes that the intellectual framework they grew up with and built their careers around is natural, normal, inevitable and should be universal. That's just the nature of being human. And everybody is wrong. Ideas change over time. They go in fashions or cycles.”

The current generation of policymakers and business leaders have grown up with strong faith in the market, in a globalism based on assessments of national comparative advantage and regulation by internationally accepted rules.

So now they throw their hands up in horror and point to established economic theory and expostulate that tariffs don't work, that government services are essential and point to legal and political theory that demonstrates why a rules-based system has on balance for 80 years served most of us well.

Critics have been pointing to the flaws in the global neoliberal system for years, highlighting the increasing levels of inequality, the hollowing out of economies based on narrow definitions of comparative advantage and environmental destruction.

But efforts to devise a new model have been slow and unproductive, despite increasing public unease. Those who have done best out of this system will not easily give up. Donald Trump's courtiers were involved in these bubbling discussions, but from a different perspective. They  have developed thick skins from being outsiders whose ideas were marginalised and shouted down.

They now have access to power and have pushed the economic discussion into uncharted territory with a president ready to sign another executive order. They are not interested in making the system fairer. Their goal is to make America great, their strategy to reset the global financial and trading system, and their tactics bullying with tariffs, threats and military power.

For the past 150 years America has been a dominant power. Despite only having about 5% of the world's population, it has consistently accounted for about a quarter of the world's economic output. Over that time the guiding paradigm of economics and social organisation have changed, as old models imploded, or collapsed with war.

Australia has been adept at responding to changing economic paradigms. It developed a national ethos that moved beyond a colonial mindset at the beginning of the 20th century. Its economists were at the forefront of developing what became known as Keynesianism to use the resources of the state in conjunction with private industry to maximise public benefit, and when this model ossified Australia developed what was referred to as the third way, an approach to deregulation and privatisation that actively balanced interests but has weakened over time.

The question is whether there are the intellectual and capital resources to do so now. Australia is still one of the richest countries in the world but the economy is now one of the least diverse and complex. Our comparative advantage in resources remains but we have not been as attentive as we should to our comparative advantages in education, research, democratic institution building and fostering equality of opportunity and income.

Just like those adult children who discover they were not the favourite find new ways of working together, nations will need to find new ways to collaborate without a manipulative parent in the room.

The trend for cultural reappraisal could risk upholding the very ideas it aims to dismantle

‘My quarrel with the English language,” James Baldwin wrote in his essay Why I Stopped Hating Shakespeare, had been “that the language reflected none of my experience.” And so “I condemned him as one of the authors and architects of my oppression”.

Then, he “began to see the matter in quite another way”: “Perhaps the language was not my own because I had never attempted to use it, had only learned to imitate it. If this were so, then it might be made to bear the burden of my experience if I could find the stamina to challenge it, and me, to such a test.”

As he did so, “My relationship… to the language of Shakespeare revealed itself as nothing less than my relationship to myself and my past. Under this light, this revelation, both myself and my past began slowly to open, perhaps the way a flower opens at morning, but more probably the way an atrophied muscle begins to function, or frozen fingers to thaw.”

Baldwin is one of America's most important writers, a novelist and essayist of great acuteness and humanity, a moral conscience for the nation as he chronicled the turbulent years of the 50s and 60s. Like many of his essays, Why I Stopped Hating Shakespeare is a beautifully crafted account of Baldwin wrestling with demons, his own and those of America; a portrait of a man brimming with rage at the ferocity of the racism that encased him and struggling to find a language that could speak to his condition and help him transcend it.

The sense that Shakespeare spoke the language of the oppressors, yet also a language that helped think beyond that oppression, was not unique to Baldwin. It is revealed in the way so many writers and directors from the global south have constantly reworked the 16th-century playwright to illuminate contemporary struggles and tensions. From well-known adaptations such as Akira Kurosawa's Ran and Vishal Bhardwaj's Shakespearean trilogy to lesser-known works such as Belarus Free Theatre's King Lear and Sulayman al-Bassam's The Speaker's Progress, Shakespeare has long possessed a global presence. All of which gives an ironic edge to the current debate about “decolonising” Shakespeare. The controversy began when the Sunday Telegraph lambasted the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust (SBT) for seeking to “decolonise” the Bard. As virtually all the documents quoted were several years old, it is unclear why this should be a news story now. Nevertheless, the issues raised deserve debate.

The SBT, interim CEO Rachael North says, “is an organisation formed during the period of empire-building. We are constantly looking at the history of our collection and our interpretation of it.” Which is as it should be. Yet, framing reappraisal as a matter of “decolonising” suggests a project shaped by broader themes. And while North insists that the SBT is re-evaluating not the playwright himself but the objects for which the trust is responsible, it is difficult not to see it as a reconsideration of Shakespeare, too. “Decolonisation” has become such a voguish movement in recent years, with universities and museums tapping into the trend, and calls to decolonise everything from counselling to photography, that even some of its advocates now decry the “bandwagon”. To decolonise used to mean winning national independence from colonial rule. Today, it describes the desire to erase colonialism from knowledge, a desire resting on the belief that “colonial knowledge” continues to be “produced, consecrated, institutionalised and naturalised” throughout society.

It's a belief that runs through the project to decolonise Shakespeare. The project's core theme, though, is a critique of the claim that there is a “universal” quality to Shakespeare's work. “The notion of universality,” writes Helen Hopkins, an academic whose work has helped shape SBT's decolonising project, “is deeply intertwined with imperial logic” that “privileges white Anglo-centric, Eurocentric” views. The “narrative of Shakespeare's greatness has caused harm,” she adds, “anchored” as it is in “whiteness” and undermining “pride in native culture”.

The argument draws on a longstanding critique of ideas emerging from the Enlightenment as being “Eurocentric” and “white”. In so doing, it conflates ideas and identity, the value of a claim being indexed by the group to which the claimant belongs, a perspective that ironically mirrors colonial approaches to race and knowledge.

The argument also conflates the imposition of western power with ideas that might have emerged from within the western tradition but which are essential to challenging such power. It was universalism – the belief that equality, democracy and self-determination belonged to all rather than the property of a privileged few – that fuelled the great radical movements that have shaped the modern world, from anti-colonial struggles to battles for women's rights.

The problem, as many recognised, was not universalism but the exclusion of so many from universalism's reach. “I sit with Shakespeare and he winces not,” wrote WEB Du Bois, historian, philosopher and the most important African American campaigner before the civil rights movement. “I summon Aristotle and Aurelius, with what soul I will, and they come all graciously, with no scorn nor condescension.” “Is this the life you grudge us?” he demanded of America.

Troubling, too, is the insistence that claims of universalism harm “native culture”. It veers dangerously close to a perception of cultures – of “native” cultures at least – as “mummified” objects, in Frantz Fanon's words, “put into capsules” and embraced as “authentic”, rather than as living entities continually “grasped anew” through interaction with the wider world.

The African American novelist Ralph Ellison was as contemptuous of essentialist notions of culture as Fanon. A writer like Baldwin, he insisted, was the product not “of a Negro store-front church but of the library”. As was Ellison himself. It was through reading “Marx, Freud, TS Eliot, Pound, Gertrude Stein and Hemingway”, and “books which seldom, if ever, mentioned Negroes” that he had been able to “release” himself “from whatever ‘segregated' idea I might have had of my human possibilities”.

Questioning the ways in which we think of national icons and the place they occupy in our culture is always a useful task. Yet, long before the decolonial bandwagon rolled in, the appropriation of Shakespeare by myriad global cultures should have told us something about his relationship to those challenging injustice and seeking to speak truth to power.

It should have warned us, too, against ways of thinking that reinscribe colonial ideas about culture and knowledge in the name of challenging such ideas. The greatness of Shakespeare, Baldwin wrote, lay in his desire “to defeat all labels and complicate all battles”.

Gaza's Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Experts say the official death toll is probably an undercount.

More than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip, the enclave's Health Ministry said Sunday — a grim indicator of the conflict's continued lethality less than a week since Israel shattered a nearly two-month-old ceasefire, launching airstrikes and ground incursions into the territory.

Israel launched the war in Gaza in response to the deadly Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed about 1,200 people and took roughly 250 people hostage. Most of those hostages have been released through negotiated exchanges, and of the 59 Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza, 24 were believed to be alive before the conflict resumed.

Despite over a year of heavy bombardment of a strip of land of roughly 140 square miles, Israel has been unable to completely destroy Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007.

The two parties agreed to a ceasefire in January that paused hostilities and saw 33 Israeli hostages exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli detention. The first phase of what was supposed to be a three-phase path to a permanent end to the war lapsed on March 1, and the parties could not agree on an extension of that phase.

While Hamas wanted to immediately open talks for the second phase, in which Israel would fully withdraw from the enclave and Hamas would release remaining living hostages, Israel refused to engage in those talks and instead opted to extend the ceasefire.

Israel began bombing Gaza again Tuesday, breaking the fragile truce. The renewed Israeli attacks have killed more than 673 people since then, Gaza's Health Ministry said midday Sunday, more than a third of whom were children. An additional 233 people who were killed previously were added to the roster of the dead after a committee tracking the missing confirmed their deaths, the Health Ministry added.

Many of the casualties over the past week have been women and children, according to medical workers and eyewitnesses. The strikes have targeted senior political figures in Hamas, killing acting prime minister Essam Al-Da'alis and high-ranking officials in the Hamas-run justice and interior ministries.

Among the 41 people killed between Saturday afternoon and late Sunday morning was senior Hamas leader Salah al-Bardawil, a member of the movement's political bureau, who was killed overnight, according to a statement from Hamas. The statement, which described the attack as an “assassination,” said Bardawil was killed alongside his wife when an Israeli airstrike hit his tent in al-Mawasi, an area of Khan Younis, as the couple was praying.

In a joint statement Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces and Israel Security Agency, or Shin Bet, said they carried out the strike that killed Bardawil, describing him as the head of Hamas's “planning and development office.” It was unclear what role, if any, he had in the group's military operations.

Ibrahim Madhoun, a Palestinian political analyst who is close to Hamas, said Sunday that Bardawil was not involved in the activities of the group's military wing. He called Bardawil, who previously served as spokesman for the Hamas bloc in the Palestinian Legislative Council, a “symbol” within the movement and said his death was a “great loss.”

Also Sunday, the IDF said its troops had encircled the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood in Rafah in southern Gaza. “During the night, the troops encircled the area, eliminated several terrorists, and conducted a targeted raid on a terror infrastructure site that was used over the past few months as a command and control center of Hamas terrorists,” the statement said.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society said Sunday morning it had lost contact with a team of paramedics trapped in Rafah and was “awaiting clearance” to try to reach the group. Gaza's civil defense force later said some of its crews were stuck in the same area after trying to rescue the Red Crescent staff and that they had also gone silent. Some 50,000 people living in the area encircled by Israeli troops faced “imminent danger” to their lives, the civil defense said.

The IDF said it was allowing civilians to evacuate, and image Sunday showed families fleeing toward central Gaza, lugging babies, pillows and their few possessions by foot or by cart.

Sunday also marked three weeks since Israel blocked all aid from entering Gaza in an effort to force Hamas to compromise. The siege has reversed progress made during the ceasefire, which brought a surge of aid into Gaza, toward alleviating the dire humanitarian crisis there.

“Every day without food inches Gaza closer to an acute hunger crisis,” Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, wrote on X. “Banning aid is a collective punishment on Gaza: the vast majority of its population are children, women & ordinary men.”

Mediators have scrambled to drag the two sides back to the negotiating table, but current and former officials said the intensity of the renewed Israeli airstrikes has complicated their ability to revive a diplomatic solution to the conflict.

The official figure of 50,021 killed since Oct. 7, 2023, does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but Gaza's Health Ministry says the majority of the dead are women and children. More than 113,000 people have been injured, according to the Health Ministry.

The Washington Post could not independently verify the ministry's figures; Israel has not allowed international journalists into Gaza since the start of the war. But Palestinian journalists, first responders, international aid workers and war-casualty watchdogs all say the official death toll in Gaza is probably an undercount, with the chaos of war upending what experts and researchers say was once a robust reporting system for tracking and identifying the dead.

During the nearly two-month ceasefire in Gaza, some people managed to recover the bodies of loved ones trapped beneath the rubble, but thousands more remain unaccounted for, according to Gaza's civil defense.

Israel's military launched a large-scale bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, breaking the fragile ceasefire with Hamas that has been in place since late January. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Israel launched airstrikes on several locations in Lebanon on Saturday in retaliation for a rocket attack, killing six people in the heaviest exchange of fire since its ceasefire with the militant group Hezbollah began nearly four months ago.

The exchange sparked concern about whether the ceasefire would hold, days after Israel relaunched its war with another Iran-backed militant group, Hamas, in Gaza. In a statement, Hezbollah denied being responsible for the attack, saying it was committed to the truce.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it instructed the army to respond forcefully against dozens of targets in Lebanon, where the Iran-backed Hezbollah is based. Israel's army said six rockets were fired toward Metula, a town along the border with Lebanon. Three crossed into Israel and were intercepted.

ISRAEL ORDERS IDF TO SEIZE MORE GAZA TERRITORY IF HAMAS DOESN'T RELEASE HOSTAGES

The army said it ""cannot confirm the identity of the organization that fired the rockets."" It said it struck Hezbollah command centers and dozens of rocket launchers.

An Israeli strike on the southern Lebanese village of Touline killed five people, including a child, and wounded 10 others, including two children, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported.

Another Israeli strike Saturday night hit a garage in the coastal city of Tyre, the NNA reported, with one person killed and seven wounded. It was the first attack on the city since the ceasefire took effect Nov. 27. And a strike on Hawsh al-Sayed Ali village along the border with Syria wounded five people, according to the NNA.

In a statement, Lebanon's prime minister, Nawaf Salam, asked the country's military to take all necessary measures in the south, but said the country does not want to return to war.

Hezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. The Israel-Hezbollah conflict boiled over into all-out war in September as Israel carried out waves of airstrikes and killed most of the militant group's senior leaders. The fighting killed over 4,000 people in Lebanon and displaced about 60,000 Israelis.

Israeli forces were supposed to withdraw from all Lebanese territory by late January under the ceasefire deal. The deadline was extended to Feb. 18, but Israel has remained in five locations in Lebanon across from communities in northern Israel. Meanwhile, Israel has carried out dozens of airstrikes on southern and eastern Lebanon, saying it attacked Hezbollah, while continuing drone attacks that have killed several members of the militant group.

Lebanon has appealed to the U.N. to pressure Israel to fully withdraw. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon said it was alarmed at the possible escalation of violence and urged all parties to avoid jeopardizing the progress made.

The strikes came a day after Israel said it would carry out operations in Gaza ""with increasing intensity"" until Hamas frees the 59 hostages it holds — 24 of whom are believed to be alive.

Israeli strikes on Friday night killed at least nine people, including three children, in a house in Gaza City, according to Al-Ahli Hospital, which received the bodies.

""Rubble and glass started falling on us,"" said Sameh al-Mashharawi, who lost his brother in the attack. He mourned with his young nephew Samir al-Mashharawi, whose parents and siblings were killed. The 12-year-old, his head and wrists bandaged, sat in the back of a truck and cried.

Israel's military said Friday that its forces were planning fresh assaults into three neighborhoods west of Gaza City and issued warnings on social media for Palestinians to evacuate the areas.

FREED ISRAELI HOSTAGE TELLS UN, 'NO MORE EXCUSES,' SAYS AID IS FEEDING TERRORISTS

""Hamas, unfortunately, understands military pressure,"" Netanyahu's foreign policy advisor Ophir Falk told The Associated Press.

Around 600 Palestinians have been killed since Israel relaunched the war on Tuesday. Israel had already cut off the supply of food, fuel, and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians, aiming to pressure Hamas over ceasefire negotiations.

The international community has condemned the resumed attacks.

The initial 2023 attack by Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostages. Most of the hostages have been freed in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more.

Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.

Tens of thousands of Israelis on Saturday again protested the government's failure to negotiate a hostage deal and its move to fire the head of the country's Shin Bet internal security service. They called for new elections.

The Supreme Court has ordered a temporary halt to Ronen Bar's dismissal until an appeal is heard. Israel's attorney general has ruled that the Cabinet has no legal basis to dismiss him.

Netanyahu said in a statement late Saturday that Bar ""will not remain the head of the Shin Bet"" and ""Israel will remain a democratic state."" He argued that his loss of confidence in Bar long predates the Shin Bet investigation into illicit ties between several of his aides and Qatar.

Opposition leader Yair Lapid called for a tax rebellion and general strike if the government defies the court ruling, saying: ""If this happens, the entire country needs to grind to a halt.""

Israel fires on Lebanon after rocket attack in the heaviest exchange since the truce with Hezbollah

Father of the last living American hostage in Gaza hopes Trump can bring his son home

TEL AVIV (AP) — Unlike many families who blame Israel's government for not getting their loved ones released from captivity in Gaza, Adi Alexander is hesitant to point fingers. Pragmatic and measured, the father of the last living American being held hostage by Hamas just wants his son to come home.

“I don't want to get into who came first, the egg or the chicken,” Alexander told The Associated Press on Friday from his New Jersey home. Still, with the once-promising ceasefire giving way to renewed fighting between Israel and Hamas, he wonders whether Israel can secure his son's freedom and is more hopeful about the U.S.'s chances to do it.

Edan Alexander, a 21-year-old Israeli-American soldier who grew up in the U.S., is one of 59 hostages still in Gaza, more than half of whom are believed to be dead. Last week, Hamas said it would release Edan and the bodies of four other hostages if Israel recommitted to the stalled ceasefire agreement.

Days later, though, Israel launched rockets across Gaza, breaking the two-month-old deal and killing hundreds of Palestinians. The hostilities show no signs of abating, with Israel vowing Friday to advance deeper into Gaza until Hamas releases the remaining hostages.

The return to fighting has inflamed the debate in Israel over the fate of those held captive. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come under mounting domestic pressure, with mass protests over his handling of the hostage crisis. But he also faces demands from his hard-line allies not to accept any deal that falls short of Hamas' destruction.

Prosecutors request formal arrest of Istanbul mayor and top challenger to Turkey's Erdogan

ISTANBUL (AP) — Prosecutors early Sunday requested that detained Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, the top challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, be formally arrested over allegations of corruption and terror links.

A court is now set to decide whether the popular opposition figure will be charged and jailed pending a trial.

The arrest this week of Imamoglu has intensified political tensions and sparked widespread protests across Turkey, with demonstrators rallying in multiple cities to voice their opposition.

Many view his arrest as a politically driven attempt to remove Imamoglu from the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. Government officials reject the accusation and say Turkey's courts are independent.

Police questioned Imamoglu for around five hours on Saturday as part of an investigation into allegations of aiding the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, the Cumhuriyet newspaper reported. A day earlier he was questioned for four hours over the corruption accusations. The mayor rejected all charges during both interrogations.

The Pentagon's DEI purge: Officials describe a scramble to remove and then restore online content

WASHINGTON (AP) — Every day over the past few weeks, the Pentagon has faced questions from angry lawmakers, local leaders and citizens over the removal of military heroes and historic mentions from Defense Department websites and social media pages after it purged online content that promoted women or minorities.

In response, the department has scrambled to restore a handful of those posts as their removals have come to light. While the pages of some well-known veterans, including baseball and civil rights icon Jackie Robinson, are now back up on Pentagon websites, officials warn that many posts tagged for removal in error may be gone forever.

The restoration process has been so hit or miss that even groups that the administration has said are protected, like the Tuskegee Airmen, the first Black military pilots who served in a segregated World War II unit, still have deleted pages that as of Saturday had not been restored.

This past week chief, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a video that mistaken removals will be quickly rectified. “History is not DEI,” he said, referring to diversity, equity and inclusion.

But due to the enormous size of the military and the wide range of commands, units and bases, there has been an array of interpretations of what to remove and how as part of the Pentagon directive to delete online content that promotes DEI. Officials from across the military services said they have asked for additional guidance from the Pentagon on what should be restored, but have yet to receive any.

Trump makes NCAA men's wrestling championships his latest sports-focused trip

BRIDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) — President Donald Trump attended the NCAA wrestling championships on Saturday night for the second time in three years, the latest example of how he has mostly limited travel early in his new term to trips built around sports events.

Trump arrived at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia to loud cheers and a standing ovation. He pumped his fists amid “U-S-A!” chants. As the matches occurred, Trump stood near the action and personally congratulated most of the winning wrestlers. Hours later, he left the arena, shaking hands along the way as the crowd roared.

The Republican president spent Friday night at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey, about 70 miles northeast of Philadelphia, on what was his first visit there of his second term.

“We're going to the big fight,"" Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Friday evening. “I've always supported the wrestlers.” He added, “These are the great college wrestlers from the various schools.”

Trump traveled with billionaire and top adviser Elon Musk. Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin greeted the president as he arrived at the Philadelphia airport. Pennsylvania Sen. Dave McCormick and U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan were also at the arena sitting in the same section as Musk and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles.

Venezuela to resume repatriation of migrants after deal with US, official says

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuela will once again accept repatriation flights from the United States carrying its deported nationals after reaching an agreement with the U.S., a Venezuelan official said on social media Saturday.

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro suspended flights on March 8, after the U.S. Treasury Department announced the withdrawal of Chevron's license to export Venezuelan oil.

“We have agreed with the U.S. government to resume the repatriation of Venezuelan migrants with an initial flight tomorrow, Sunday,” said Jorge Rodríguez, president of Venezuela's Assembly and Maduro's chief negotiator with the U.S.

Venezuela accepted the deal to guarantee the “the return of our compatriots to their nation with the safeguard of their Human Rights,” Rodríguez said.

In his statement, Rodríguez referred to the deportation by Donald Trump's government of some 250 Venezuelans to a high-security prison in El Salvador.

Pope Francis to be released from hospital Sunday after 5 weeks fighting life-threatening pneumonia

ROME (AP) — Pope Francis will be released from the hospital on Sunday after 38 days battling a severe case of pneumonia in both lungs that threatened his life on two occasions and raised the prospect — for now put to rest — of a papal resignation or funeral.

The 88-year-old pontiff will require at least two months of rest, rehabilitation and convalescence back at the Vatican during which time he has been discouraged from meeting in big groups or exerting himself, said Dr. Sergio Alfieri, who coordinated Francis' medical team at Rome's Gemelli hospital.

But Francis' personal doctor, Dr. Luigi Carbone, said if he continues his steady improvements and rehabilitation, he should eventually be able to resume all his normal activities.

The doctors spoke at a hastily called press conference Saturday evening in the Gemelli hospital atrium, their first in-person update on the pontiff's condition in a month. They said they were discharging Francis after he registered two weeks of stability and increasing progress in his recovery.

“The Holy Father would have wanted to go home a few days ago, as even he realized he was improving, breathing better, and that he could work longer. But I have to say he was an exemplary patient,"" Alfieri said. “He listened to the suggestions from me, Dr. Carbone and the rest of the team.""

Sudan's army says it seized key buildings in Khartoum after retaking the Republican Palace

CAIRO (AP) — Sudan 's military on Saturday consolidated its grip on the capital, retaking more key government buildings a day after it gained control of the Republican Palace from a notorious paramilitary group.

Brig. Gen. Nabil Abdullah, a spokesperson for the Sudanese military, said troops expelled the Rapid Support Forces from the headquarters of the National Intelligence Service and Corinthia Hotel in central Khartoum.

The army also retook the headquarters of the Central Bank of Sudan and other government and educational buildings in the area, Abdullah said. Hundreds of RSF fighters were killed while trying to flee the capital city, he said.

There was no immediate comment from the RSF.

The army's gain came as a Sudanese pro-democracy activist group said RSF fighters had killed at least 45 people in a city in the western region of Darfur.

3 killed and 15 hurt in a shooting at a park in New Mexico's Las Cruces

SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — Three people were fatally shot, and 15 others were hurt, after an altercation broke out at a park in the desert city of Las Cruces, police said Saturday.

Police and fire crews arrived at just after 10 p.m. Friday to a chaotic scene at Young Park, where an unauthorized car show had drawn about 200 people, police said in a news conference. Gunshot victims ranging in age from 16 to 36 were treated there or taken to hospitals.

Between 50 and 60 handgun casings were scattered across a wide swath of the park, Police Chief Jeremy Story said, suggesting multiple shooters and multiple weapons among two groups whose “ill will” toward each other are believed to have led to the shootings. Several others were injured in the crossfire, he said.

The dead were identified only as a 16-year-old boy and two men, ages 18 and 19, police said. Their names and those of the other victims were not yet being released.

Local police were being assisted in their investigation by New Mexico State Police, the Doña Ana County Sheriff's Office, the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Number of perfect brackets dwindles closer to zero midway through Saturday's March Madness games

It's the end of the line for perfect brackets on Yahoo Sports.

With Michigan's 91-79 win over Texas A&M on Saturday, the final perfect Yahoo Sports bracket was shredded. Poor Shawno had been correct on every pick with his Grand Bracket until the fifth-seeded Wolverines sent the fourth-seeded Aggies home.

Texas Tech followed up with a 77-64 win over No. 11 seed Drake, leaving 11 brackets out of 34 million filled out on the NCAA's platform still perfect.

ESPN's tracker was down to 11 perfect brackets out of 24.3 million following the wins by Michigan and Texas Tech.

CBS Sports had a similar attrition rate, down to 0.000036% unblemished brackets through Saturday's two early games.

Oops, something went wrong

Barry Ritholtz, co-founder and chief investment officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management and a longtime adviser, digs into the things that have made him “less stupid” in his latest book.

""How Not to Invest: The Ideas, Numbers, and Behaviors That Destroy Wealth — and How to Avoid Them"" isn't a navel-gazing reveal of his savvy investing philosophy, but rather a playbook on the theme that steering clear of errors is much more important than scoring wins.

I asked Barry to share the mistakes that trip most of us up and what we can do about it. Below are excerpts of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.

Kerry Hannon: Why are most of us better off sticking to a simple investing strategy?

Barry Ritholtz: Historically, simple beats complex. If you're going to make something more complicated, there has to be an absolutely compelling reason. The more complicated things are, there are more things to break. Think about how much money has been attracted to Vanguard and Blackstone's core indexing because it's simple and it works.

What are some of the pitfalls of building long-term wealth?

The biggest single pitfall is our tendency to interfere with the markets' compounding.

When I ask people, what is a thousand dollars invested a century ago worth today? They say, oh, a million dollars, $2 million. When you tell them it's $32 million, their heads explode. It's shocking to people. But that's the power of compounding.

Please try not to get in the way of your own money compounding. It's the single best thing you can do.

What are other common mistakes investors make?

The more active you are, the more transactions you engage in, and the worse you tend to do because you're just creating more opportunities to be wrong.

And we believe a lot of nonsense. Some of it is just myths that get repeated from generation to generation or ping around trading desks. I always laugh whenever I flip on TV and the market is down 2% and someone says, markets hate uncertainty. Do they really? Because there's got to be a buyer and a seller. That means that there's a disagreement as to the value of that asset.

We are wildly overconfident in our abilities to do things that the professionals can't do. You know, no one would say to themselves, yeah, I could play Michael Jordan one-on-one in basketball. Nobody thinks that way.

But when you step into the marketplace, you imagine that you're going to beat the house, that you're going to beat Michael Jordan. But trust me, you're not. Something like half of all the trades are done by institutions — highly qualified, deeply motivated with the latest, greatest, fastest tools. To imagine that you're going to step in and beat them on their home fields is just another mistake.

It's also a mistake to not be selective when you dip into the fire hose of media that comes out about investing. You have to be a little discerning and discriminating. Curate viciously. You have to create your own team of people who you either watch or listen to or read. I don't mean you literally have to hire them, but hey, these are the people who have a defendable process. They've lived through a few cycles. They have a good track record. And it's not just dumb luck.

On my all-star team are Morgan Housel, Jason Zweig, and Sam Ro. They have just consistently added value and been more right than wrong. They don't run around with their hair on fire when we're in the midst of a huge volatility spike.

What are some questions we can ask to avoid a lot of investment mistakes?

Always ask yourself, what are the risks of this trade? Is this tailored to me, or is this for a general audience? What's this going to cost — not just the outright costs, but fees, taxes, and, of course, lost opportunities. And who is giving me this advice?

What's their track record and do they have a conflict of interest? Do they have a fiduciary interest to zealously represent you and to perform their duties with diligence?

They can't guarantee you what the market or the economy's going to do in the future, but can they say to you, this is a reasonable portfolio that is defendable and rational and increases the odds that you'll have a successful outcome down the road?

You quote John Bogle, founder of Vanguard, as saying, “just buy the haystack.” In other words, stick with index funds. Why is that still a great philosophy?

In any given year, a majority of active fund managers underperform their benchmark, say, the S&P 500. Go 10 years and you're in the single digits of managers who earn their keep and outperform the benchmark. Take it to 20 years, and it's virtually nobody. You end up with a handful of outlier names and they become household names because they're unicorns — Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, Bill Miller.

With the indexes, you get diversification especially if you invest in a bunch of different indexes. You are guaranteed to find the Nvidias, the Apples, the Amazons, whatever are the biggest winners. And you get them in increasing stakes as they do better and better.

You say this is the golden age for investors. What do you mean by that?

You can move money around effortlessly. You can trade for free. You can buy anything. Back in the old days, if you wanted to own international stocks, it was expensive.

To say nothing of the power of walking around with this stuff in your phone, it's really amazing. Software and technology give investors tools that are just so simple and so inexpensive and so effective. That's why I call this the golden age of investing. We can do things people dreamed about 25 years ago.

Everybody gets second-by-second, tick-by-tick updates. You want to see how you're doing today, this week, month, year to date, the past 12 months — it's all right there. It's instantaneous.

But please don't look at your portfolio tick by tick. It'll make you crazy.

What is the importance of having a financial plan and working with an adviser?

There are ways to improve your life satisfaction with money. But a lot of people don't go about it that way. One of the ways that helps to get away from the money chase is that when you put a financial plan together, one of the things that ends up coming out of that process is the answer to: What is this money going to? Why do you want to put money in the market?

Maybe you're saving for your kids' college, buying a house, or retirement. Now we know how much risk to take in order to achieve your goals. That draws down stress.

When you put a financial plan together, you take as much risk as necessary, but not more, to achieve your goals. You're working with intentionality, you're working toward a purpose. If you're not saving toward a goal, you end up taking on too much risk. That's how people lose sleep at night.

Having someone to talk you off the ledge and keep you focused on your plan is worth about 2% to 3% a year. That's a huge amount of returns that simply comes about because someone is preventing you from shooting yourself in the foot. And we, as investors, are our own worst enemies. If we can stop our bad behaviors, we're all so much better off.

Oops, something went wrong

The Federal Reserve continued to signal it will cut interest rates two more times this year, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell adopting a perceived dovish stance, a pleasant surprise for investors who came into Wednesday's policy decision with heightened fears over ""stagflation"" and the possibility of a US recession.

""It's a clearing event,"" Dennis DeBusschere, president of 22V Research, told Yahoo Finance following the decision. ""You didn't get a Fed that was going to accelerate the downside in markets.""

Read more: How the Fed rate decision affects your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investments

One big reason stemmed from the Fed's ""base case"" that tariff-induced inflation will be ""transitory"" and have a short-term ""one-off"" effect on price growth. This was reflected in the central bank's projections, which forecast year-end PCE inflation rising to 2.7% before reaching its 2% target by 2027 — ""a relief to investors"" who had been bracing for stickier prices, according to DeBusschere.

But some experts warn that ""transitory"" inflation remains an unrealistic expectation — and that the projections for two rate cuts this year could unravel as the Trump administration continues to flip-flop on trade policy. Powell himself said ""there is a level of inertia"" to stay consistent with prior forecasts until greater clarity emerges.

""Uncertainty was a highlight of the statement,"" Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, wrote in response to Wednesday's decision. ""Like market participants, the Fed is at a highly uncertain point, and it is in need of time and data to determine the next course of action.""

Both consumer and producer inflation showed a deceleration in price growth over the month of February. But details under the surface pointed to a potential stalling out in reaching the Fed's 2% target, with tariffs serving as the greatest threat to Powell's ""transitionary"" base case.

There are also concerns the Fed may cut rates because of a weakening labor market and slowing economic growth — a move that wouldn't be cheered by investors.

""Everybody wants two cuts, three cuts, four cuts. You don't want any cuts. You want earnings growth. You want a strong economy,"" Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, told Yahoo Finance on Thursday. ""Be careful what you wish for.""

Despite a slightly more hawkish tilt from the central bank, with more FOMC members forecasting interest rates to either hold steady or come down by just 0.25% instead of the consensus 0.50%, traders still boosted their own expectations of where interest rates could end the year.

According to the latest data from Bloomberg, markets are now pricing in three cuts instead of two. But Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird, pushed back on reading too far into the projections.

""The 'dot plot' and [the Fed's] projections have not been super reliable over the last five years,"" Mayfield said, stressing that the uncertainties within the current economic and political environment add another layer of confusion when it comes to future policy.

""When the path forward is so unclear, you just take it with a grain of salt, go back to basics, and focus on the drivers of either the individual equities or the sectors in the market that you own,"" he said. ""In this case, thinking about things like earnings and long rates, rather than what the Fed is doing at the short end of the curve.""

Following the Fed's decision on Wednesday, markets experienced what Mayfield described as a ""relief rally,"" citing the lack of downside surprises in the forecasts. But the move higher was short-lived, with all three major indexes slipping into the red the following trading session.

Still, the S&P 500 and Dow were able to eke out gains over the five-day period, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which has struggled as its ""Magnificent Seven"" leaders fail to deliver outsized returns, ultimately fell short.

""If you're going to really climb your way out of this hole, you need either clarity on the tariffs, which, who knows? Or you need some other sort of nice catalyst,"" Mayfield said. ""That could come in the form of next earnings season, or maybe it's a really strong jobs report that comes out of nowhere.""

""For now, we're kind of bouncing around and Powell's presser just wasn't enough to give the market the juice it needed to really get over the hump.""

Economic data releases and earnings

The biggest question facing markets right now is not when Nvidia (NVDA) stock will begin to go up every single day again.

Sorry to burst your bubble.

The biggest question staring markets in the face is this...

Does US economic growth in the first half of the year represent just a slowdown that settles in at a short-term bottom while still increasing? This would be an example of economic resilience in the face of major policy uncertainty out of D.C. Said slowdown, I can argue, is about nearly priced into stocks.

Or does the budding economic growth slowdown go off a cliff into a recession as businesses and consumers tighten up their spending, with tariffs permeating and Trump's tax cut extensions being unknowns? I fancy a recession is not priced into stocks.

""Things feel slower,"" one CEO of a large-cap consumer company told me over drinks this week.

A beverage company CEO remarked to me on the phone this week that Trump's tariff war is causing them to rethink spending plans for 2025 and 2026.

JPMorgan strategist Bruch Kasman made some hay this week by calling out a 40% recession probability for this year. To my knowledge, this is the second-highest recession probability on the Street behind BCA Research's veteran forecaster Peter Berezin — he's at 75%.

But comments like this aren't just playing out over cocktails or in hard-to-get research notes. They are beginning to surface on earnings releases and calls by large public companies. And the market is moving fast to price in something more than a simple economic slowdown.

""The current environment, however, is adding uncertainty to demand. We continue to work closely with our customers to help them adapt to this evolving market,"" FedEx (FDX) CEO Raj Subramaniam said on his Thursday evening earnings call.

Another FedEx staffer on the call mentioned uncertainty in the ""industrial economy.""

FedEx's stock was clobbered on Friday.

Ditto Nike's (NKE) stock the same day.

Investors were hit with a cold splash of reality on Nike's earnings call: A big ship in Nike doesn't turn around overnight, especially against the backdrop of a global trade war.

The focus appears to be on Nike's guidance for the next quarter. Sales are projected to decline by a mid-teens percentage, which came in worse than estimates. Margins will also be under pressure again due to tariffs and aggressive discounting to clear slow-selling styles.

New CEO Elliott Hill wasted no time shouting out ""economic uncertainty"" at the top of his earnings call.

A wobbly economy also continues to play out in the data.

Spending at US retailers last month was much weaker than expected, per the latest retail sales report. This is on top of weakness in consumer confidence data and various Fed activity surveys.

Listen: How tariffs may pound Rubbermaid

The closely watched GDPNow tracker is showing negative economic growth in the first quarter.

""Volatility [in consumer spending] appears to be the new normal, as we await monthly changes in tariffs, plus rising fears of stagflation or even recession,"" Evercore ISI retail analyst Greg Melich says.

A new normal that the market is still trying to figure out.

Oops, something went wrong

Capping credit card interest rates is starting to look like the hot policy idea of the season for populist lawmakers on both the left and right.

This month, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive star from New York, and Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a MAGA favorite from Florida, teamed up to introduce a bill to limit credit card APRs at 10%. It follows similar legislation from Sens. Bernie Sanders, the independent of Vermont, and Republican Josh Hawley of Missouri, which would put in place the same 10% rate ceiling for five years.

The cost of credit has become a more pressing issue in recent years thanks to rising interest rates, which have helped fuel increasing delinquencies: The average APR was about 21.5% at the end of last year, up from 14.7% in 2020, according to the Federal Reserve.

For now, these bills mostly seem to be political signaling exercises that are unlikely to go anywhere soon. Democrats may also see them as a way of challenging President Trump to make good on his campaign-season promise to pass a credit card cap, an idea mostly embraced by progressives in the past. (In 2019, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez unveiled the Loan Shark Prevention Act, which would have imposed a 15% limit on all interest rates.)

But the bipartisan enthusiasm suggests that limiting what card issuers can charge their customers may have legs down the line. For many voters, it's a pressing pocketbook concern: About half of credit card accounts revolve a balance from month to month, while 13% of cardholders make only the minimum payment due, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Read more: Can you ask your credit card company for a lower APR?

As they've hiked interest rates, credit card companies' margins have hit all-time highs. To some, that's a sign that companies could continue lending profitably to most of their customers even with a rate cap cutting a bit into their profits.

The challenge, as almost any economist will note, is that limiting rates will likely mean less access to credit for Americans with weaker credit scores since lending to them won't be as profitable.

That might be for the best for some households if it saves them from overborrowing. But many could be forced to resort to other, even less affordable types of debt to cover emergency expenses. And even without the aid of a high-APR credit card, some still find ways to make unaffordable purchases on credit, such as through buy now, pay later plans.

The question is how low is too low before restrictions do more harm than good. A 10% rate might be overly strict. But what about a 25% cap? Or 35%?

“At the end of the day, it's a trade-off,” said Breno Braga, an Urban Institute senior fellow who has studied the impact of interest caps. “You want to maximize the number of people that benefit from it and minimize the number of people that suffer from it.”

Usury laws are nothing new. At least 76 countries impose limits on lending rates, according to World Bank researchers, and at least 26 have chosen to place caps on all types of credit. In the US, dozens of states place restrictions on payday lenders, or try to ban them outright.

Studies on the impact of payday loan limits have yielded conflicting results. Some have found that the rules backfire by pushing customers to rely on other, expensive and less regulated types of credit, like bank overdrafts, without improving their overall finances. Others suggest the laws cut back on payday loan use without those drawbacks.

What would happen if the government tried to limit what Visa or Mastercard can charge? In the US, there's at least one recent real-world example we can draw conclusions from: The Military Lending Act, which originally capped the interest rates on payday and other loans for active-duty service members at 36%. In 2015, the law was expanded to cover revolving products like credit cards.

The change had a fairly limited impact on troops' wallets, according to a paper by Braga and his colleagues at Urban. The 36% cap didn't seem to affect credit access for people in the military community who had subprime credit scores, but didn't improve their finances much either, measured by factors like delinquency rates or debts going into collections.

The absolute riskiest borrowers appear to have felt the change more. After the reform passed, people with Vantage credit scores under 500 were less likely to have a credit card and saw their borrowing limits lowered. At the same time, their credit ratings and delinquency rates didn't improve, suggesting the group lost access to credit without much benefit.

One reason the 36% cap might not have had much effect overall is that, during the time period studied, relatively few people had credit cards with an APR above 36%. Today, with rates higher, the impact might be wider.

The cap Ocasio-Cortez and Luna have proposed would certainly bite much harder, and likely cut off access to credit for many millions more. Even among superprime borrowers with credit ratings above 720, average APRs are typically higher than 10%. There's also concern that companies might try to skirt a severe limit by charging new fees, though the bill tries to prohibit that.

Still, it's possible to imagine looser limits making some headway in Washington.

In 2019, for instance, a bipartisan bill that would have extended the Military Lending Act's 36% rate cap to all Americans was nearly reported out of committee but derailed by the pandemic. Politically, a bill like that could one day be ready for a comeback.

Oops, something went wrong

A fraught word resurfaced in the Federal Reserve's lexicon again this week: ""transitory.""

It came from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who told reporters Wednesday his ""base case"" is that higher inflation stemming from President Trump's tariffs will be ""transitory"" — reviving memories of how central bank policymakers talked about inflation during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Because Fed officials expected pandemic-era inflation to be transitory, they argued there was no reason to raise rates aggressively — an expectation that turned out to be misguided as inflation rose to a four-decade high in 2022. The Fed eventually mounted the most aggressive campaign to bring inflation down since the 1970s.

The new admission from Powell this week sparked questions about whether the central bank will make the same mistake again.

""I would have thought that, particularly after the big policy mistake of earlier this decade and given all the current uncertainties, some Fed officials would show greater humility,"" Mohamed El-Erian, president of Queens' College and chief economic adviser at Allianz, said on social media.

""It's simply too early to say with any regress of confidence that the inflationary effects will be transitory, especially given that companies and households still have fresh in their minds the recent history of high unanticipated inflation.""

To be fair, Powell did qualify his statement. When asked during a press conference following the Fed's interest rate meeting whether he views the impact of tariffs on inflation as transitory, Powell said, ""I think that's kind of the base case. But as I said, we really can't know that. We're going to have to see how things actually work out.""

Other Fed watchers were more sympathetic, noting that Powell's overall commentary on the topic did, in fact, show some humility about past mistakes.

""I agree the word transitory is probably not ideal given they used it last time,"" 22V Research president Dennis DeBusschere told Yahoo Finance, but Powell also made it quite clear that Fed officials ""weren't sure what was going to happen.""

The modern US economy, DeBusschere said, has not been through such an aggressive slate of tariffs before, and therefore stating that inflation could be transitory because of the tariffs ""seems like a fair way to think about it.""

Powell does have a Trump administration ally in the transitory base-case view: Scott Bessent. In a speech earlier this month, the US Treasury secretary urged the Fed to look at any tariff-related price hikes that way — while also digging the Fed for its handling of inflation during the pandemic.

""I would hope that the failed 'team transitory' could get back together and think that nothing is more transitory than tariffs,"" Bessent said at the Economic Club of New York on March 6.

On Wednesday, Powell did acknowledge the Fed's past ""transitory"" faux pas, noting that ""we're well aware of what happened, obviously, with the pandemic inflation. In real time, as we know, it's hard to make that judgment.""

He also pointed out that the last time the US had tariffs imposed, during Trump's first term last decade, the effects did indeed prove to be temporary.

Back then, he said, ""the inflation was transitory.""

Powell noted the Fed has to look at the present environment as a ""different situation,"" underscoring that the central bank hasn't gotten back to its 2% inflation goal and consumers aren't in a position to swallow higher prices, as businesses intend to pass on higher prices from tariffs.

Wilmington Trust chief economist Luke Tilley said he is encouraged that the Fed is talking about tariffs as being transitory in terms of inflation.

""They are a one-time increase in the price level of imported goods,"" Tilley said.

Tilley, however, believes the tariffs could ultimately hurt growth. ""Once fully implemented, they amount to a significant tax hike and more likely to weaken consumer spending on all other goods and services.""

Matt Luzzetti, chief US economist for Deutsche Bank Securities, noted that even though the central bank textbook suggests the Fed should look through one-time price level shocks such as those driven by tariffs, the reality is more complicated for at least two reasons.

The first, Luzzetti said, is it will be impossible to identify inflation driven by tariffs versus organic price pressures in real time.

If inflation rates for auto repairs and car insurance rise in the coming months, he asked, is that because of ripple effects from duties on steel and aluminum or autos? Or would that represent something more fundamental?

The second reason, he said, is that inflation expectations are not clearly firmly anchored. Most other measures of inflation expectations show heightened uncertainty — something Luzzetti said could be a precursor to higher expectations if inflation stays elevated.

""In short, it is too early to brush aside elevated inflation this year as transitory,"" Luzzetti said.

There are many famous examples of animals who seem to understand human language. But is there any real science behind them?

At the turn of the 20th century, a famous horse named Clever Hans toured Germany. The horse stunned crowds as his trainer demonstrated the animal's alleged ability to understand German, tell time and even solve math problems.

But when an independent team investigated Clever Hans, they concluded his act was a fraud. It turned out that the horse actually just responded to subconscious body-language cues from his trainer and couldn't really comprehend human language or perform arithmetic feats.

Today, researchers are still testing the limits of animals' ability to understand humans, but examples like Clever Hans show just how difficult that task can be. So do we know if any animals can actually understand human language?

Animal language studies with primates, birds, dolphins, and other animals flourished through the 1960s and 1970s, but skeptics went on to criticize this research, saying the animals were only mimicking their trainers like Clever Hans. Though many animals are adept at picking up on context clues like body language and tone of voice, it's less clear if they understand the meaning of words or more complex features of language like grammar. But today, research is beginning to suggest that, with training, some animals may understand certain features of human language, such as the sound and meaning of specific words.

""Humans are special in many ways, and certainly language is unique to humans,"" Simon W. Townsend, a professor of evolutionary anthropology at the University of Zurich, told Live Science. ""But I think more and more, we're finding that there are really quite some similarities between the communication systems of animals and humans.""

One of the most famous animal language experiments involves Koko, a female western lowland gorilla who learned modified American Sign Language (ASL). Koko, who died in 2018, could use about 1,000 signs and respond to over 2,000 words in spoken English.

However, experts warned that there's a big difference between learning some modified signs and actually mastering ASL, and Koko was never anywhere near fluent in sign language. Critics also pointed out that Koko sometimes signed nonsensically, and her trainers tended to lean on their own interpretations to make sense of Koko's signs.

According to comparative psychologist and linguist Michael Tomasello, the title for most advanced language skills in a primate goes to Kanzi, a male bonobo (Pan paniscus) who lived from 1980 to 2025. Kanzi communicated through a lexigram board, a keyboard of about 200 arbitrary symbols that corresponded to things in his environment.



Townsend, who worked with Kanzi, says the bonobo understood the symbols on his lexigram board well and could use them to communicate with his trainers. Kanzi used symbols for people's names, common objects, actions and locations, and he had vocalizations for ""yes"" and ""no."" He used his lexigram board to ask for objects or request certain actions.

""He's learned symbolic communication, which is a feature of another species' communication system,"" Townsend said. But, Townsend added, human language is more than just using symbols; it also involves combining those symbols into larger structures to create more complex meaning — a feature of language called syntax. If Kanzi grasped syntax, that would indicate a deeper understanding of human language.

So far, studies have shown that Kanzi could order symbols at a rate better than random chance, but some critics doubt the bonobo's grammatical abilities. Townsend and other researchers studied Kanzi up until his death to learn the limits of his syntax skills. Their research is currently unpublished.

Kanzi understood some spoken English, too. In a 1993 study, researchers found that when the bonobo listened to brand-new sentences, like ""Put on the monster mask and scare Linda,"" he could complete the requested task about three out of four times, outperforming a 2.5-year-old child.

Most animals have no hardwired evolutionary reason to care about human language. But dogs, who've lived alongside humans for at least 14,000 years, have a special motivation to listen to their owners and respond appropriately.

Dogs are highly tuned in to the specific sounds and tones of voice that humans use to communicate. In fact, dogs show interest in human voices and gestures as early as 8 weeks old. Dogs are so used to human voices that they can tell when speech has been scrambled, and neuroscience research even suggests that dogs have their own mental representations of words, suggesting a deeper comprehension of language similar to humans'.

Some prodigious dogs may even grasp basic grammar. One of them was Chaser, a highly trained border collie, known as the ""smartest dog in the world,"" who learned over 1,000 words. According to a 2011 study, she could differentiate commands such as ""bring the sock to the ball"" and ""bring the ball to the sock,"" indicating a basic understanding of syntax.

Federico Rossano, an associate professor of cognitive science at the University of California, San Diego, is using button boards — a series of buttons that play a recorded word when pressed — to investigate the linguistic capabilities of our canine companions.



In 2024, Rossano showed that dogs respond to the actual sounds of words and not just to their context, like their owner putting on their shoes while saying it's time to go outside. In a study of 59 dogs, the canines listened as a researcher pressed buttons with words related to ""outside,"" ""play"" and ""food,"" as well as a nonsensical word to serve as a comparison. The researcher wore headphones so their reactions and body language didn't affect the dogs' responses.

Even without these context clues, the team found that when dogs heard the recordings relating ""outside"" and ""play,"" they tended to start exhibiting behaviors related to going outside or playing, respectively, such as running to the door or grabbing a toy.

The research is a promising step toward showing that dogs can understand human speech even without the context clues that come along with it. But other studies have found that dogs can't differentiate between words that differ by a single sound, such as ""sit"" and ""set,"" so there may be a limit to how much they can understand.

Rossano emphasized that his studies are not meant to prove that dogs can ""talk."" Some Instagram-famous pets have gone viral for seemingly advanced communication through button boards, but these cases aren't the focus of his studies. For now, Rossano is focused on investigating the basics.

—Are cats and dogs smarter than babies?

—Why do dogs tilt their heads?

—Can you forget your native language?

Like other animal language researchers, Rossano still has a lot of questions. He's currently investigating whether dogs use buttons to refer to people or objects that aren't currently present, and whether they combine buttons to refer to things they don't know the names of. Both of these feats would imply more complex cognitive processes.

Federico admits he began the research with some skepticism, but his view of dogs' language capabilities has ""100%"" changed since then.

""Maybe there's more of a mind there than we give them credit for,"" he said.

The Los Angeles Lakers were fully healthy on Saturday night with Rui Hachimura and, more notably, LeBron James returning to action, but the Chicago Bulls spoiled the party with a 146-115 blowout that dropped the Lakers to the No. 3 to No. 4 seed with 12 games remaining. 

The Lakers are tied in the loss column with the Nuggets, and are likely going to win the tiebreaker over Denver (2-2 head to head) by virtue of being a division winner (they are three games up on Golden State with the tiebreaker secured for the Pacific crown). 

Hachimura (knee) hadn't played in almost a month, while James missed six games with a groin strain. The Lakers went 3-3 in those games without LeBron as the defense struggled, and that was the story again on Saturday as Chicago put up points like an All-Star game. 

James was rusty in his return, finishing with 17 points on 16 shots with five turnovers. He missed three of his five free throws and was a game-low minus-27 in in 31 minutes. 

The good news for the Lakers is Luka Doncic continues to surge toward what feels like it could be a monster postseason for him. Dončić took a while to get settled with the Lakers, but he's been in full form for a bit and stormed out of the gates for 17 first-quarter points on Saturday. That makes for 38 points over Luka's last two first quarters after he put 21 on the Nuggets on Wednesday. 

Dončić has always been a first-quarter sniper, and he really had it rolling on Saturday when he wound up with 29 points and seven 3-pointers in the first half. 

Dončić finished with 34 points against Chicago. He has 31 against Denver and went for 45 against Milwaukee a little more than a week ago. Over his last 10 games, Dončić is averaging 31.1 points while making 43% of his 3-pointers on 11 attempts a night. 

It's not just the numbers. Luka is clearly starting to feel himself in a Lakers uniform. LeBron has pretty much handed the QB1 reigns to Dončić and even though this loss to the Bulls is frustrating, the bigger picture still looks bright with Dončić playing this way heading into the postseason.

The Golden State Warriors have won 16 out of their last 20 games, but they have not been playing all that well of late and it bit them on Saturday in what Draymond Green called a ""terrible loss"" at Atlanta. 

The Warriors, who were playing without Stephen Curry, got down by 17 after the first quarter and were never really able to fight their way back in a 124-115 loss that wasn't as close as that score indicates. 

Curry is sidelined with a with a pelvic contusion after taking a hard fall on his tailbone in Golden State's three-point win over the Raptors on Thursday. Over Golden State's last four games, there has only been one good showing -- a win over the Bucks without Curry, who at that point was just out for regular rest.

Other than that, they laid an egg against the Nuggets, who were playing without Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray and Christian Braun, and squeaked past a bad Toronto team before the loss to the Hawks (who, to be fair, have been playing better with six wins in their last eight games).

""It's a bad loss. A terrible loss,"" Green said. ""When you're in a position where you have a chance to compete for something, eleven games left with everything to play for, you shouldn't have a loss like this. There's too much on the line. You've got to win the games you're supposed to win. Obviously Steph's out, but that's still a game we should win.""

Green's right. The Warriors have exactly 11 games left, and with the loss on Saturday they have now effectively dropped back into the play-in. Yes, if you look at the standings on Sunday morning you will see Golden State's name at No. 6, right above the Clippers, but that's only because the Warriors have played one more game. The teams are tied in the loss column and the Clippers own the tiebreaker, meaning they control their destiny for the last playoff spot, not the Warriors, who also own just a one-game lead over No. 8 Minnesota. 

That's how huge every game is at this point, and even though the next three look like they should be wins on paper (all on the road against Miami, New Orleans and San Antonio), nothing can be taken for granted without Curry. 

There was a theory going around after Curry's injury that a little downtime could be a blessing in disguise for the Warriors' superstar, as it could maybe freshen him up going into the playoffs. But they have to make the playoffs first, and they just didn't give themselves any room for error with the way they played before acquiring Jimmy Butler at the trade deadline, when they were clinging to the final play-in spot. They need Curry back. 

He's set for reevaluation on Monday ahead of Golden State's game at Miami, which will be Butler's first game against the Heat after his dramatic exit. The Heat have lost 10 straight, but you can bet they'll be up for that one. The Warriors better be, too.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP)  John Calipari is heading to the Sweet 16 for the 16th time, and this one could be the sweetest of all.

Calipari's Arkansas Razorbacks beat longtime nemesis Rick Pitino and No. 2 seed St. John's 75-66 on Saturday, sending their itinerant coach to the second weekend of the NCAA Tournament with his fourth school.

Billy Richmond III scored 16 points and Karter Knox had 15 for the 10th-seeded Razorbacks, who sent Kansas and their Hall of Fame coach Bill Self home from the “Region of Coaches” in the first round.

But the victory over his longtime rival was especially sweet for Calipari, who brought the Razorbacks (22-13) back to the tournament in his first season in Fayetteville despite early-season injuries that left them 0-5 to start the Southeastern Conference schedule. Arkansas will face third-seeded Texas Tech in the West Region semifinals in San Francisco.

“I told them, ‘This is as rewarding as a year I've had, based on how far we've come,'” he said.

Zuby Ejiofor had 23 points and 12 rebounds for Big East champion St. John's (31-5). Conference player of the year RJ Luis Jr. had nine points, half his season average, on 3-of-17 shooting.

“They outplayed us. They deserve to move on and we don't,” Pitino said. “That's what March Madness is all about. No matter how good a regular season you have, you play this way, you're going to get beat.”

Pitino's history in Providence - he took the Friars to the 1987 Final Four - gave him a home-court advantage as he arrived in March Madness with an unprecedented sixth school.

So many of those teams were built with a full-court defense and 3-point shooting.

St. John's, which beat Omaha in the first round, had the No. 1 defense in the country this season to win the Big East, returning to the tournament for the first time since 2019 with a No. 2 seed that was its best in 25 years.

But the Red Storm's shooting deserted them on Saturday and they became the first team seeded fourth or better to exit what's been a chalky tournament so far.

“Rick did a good job with his team all year,” Calipari said. “If they made a few shots, they probably beat us. We were fortunate to get out.”

The teams combined to make four 3-pointers on 41 attempts, with St. John's shooting 28% from the floor overall.

“I hate to see them go out this way,” Pitino said. “We thought we were championship-driven in our minds, but I have been disappointed before with this. You hate to see us play like that.

“I don't mind going out with a loss, I just hate to see us play that way offensively,” he said. “It's just a bitter pill to swallow with that type of performance.”

Arkansas led by 13 in the first half and had an eight-point lead with eight minutes to play before the Johnnies cut it to 62-60 with 6:11 left. But St. John's missed its next six attempts from 3-point range, and made just one of its last nine shots - Ejiofor's dunk with 20 seconds left.

Knox made a pair of free throws, and then Deivon Smith dribbled the ball off his knee and out of bounds. When Richmond was fouled with 5 seconds left, the Razorbacks ran down the court in celebration, waving their arms for the outnumbered Arkansas fans in the crowd.

The Minnesota Vikings quarterback situation has been one of the main topics during the NFL offseason, and they are still working out their QB room, which includes 2024 No. 10 overall pick J.J. McCarthy, for 2025. The team is in communication with a veteran quarterback, but it's not Aaron Rodgers, as the team is reportedly not pursuing the future Hall of Famer. 

With former Minnesota starter Sam Darnold signing with the Seattle Seahawks, the team is reportedly sticking with McCarthy as their starter. It likely wants to add a veteran to its group, and with Rodgers seemingly out of the conversation, it's moving on to another seasoned QBs.

The Vikings have shown interest in adding Ryan Tannehill, but no deal has been discussed, per Fox Sports. Tannehill played for the Tennessee Titans from 2019 to 2023 but didn't sign with a team in 2024. 

The 36-year-old was adamant that it would take the exact right scenario for him to join a team, saying ""nothing really felt right"" during free agency last offseason. As a result, Tannehill didn't take any snaps during the 2024 season, last playing in January of 2024. The former No. 8 overall pick played in 10 games in the 2023 season, starting eight with a 3-5 record. 

Tannehill began his career with the Miami Dolphins, playing seven seasons in the 305 before playing five seasons with the Titans. 

In his 11-year career,  the former NFL Comeback Player of the Year has played in 155 games, with an 81-70 starting record, 34,881 passing yards, 216 touchdowns and 115 interceptions. He's started five playoff games, all with the Titans, with a 2-3 record, 754 passing yards, seven touchdowns and five interceptions.

WICHITA, Kan. – Kelvin Sampson didn't get to this point in his career missing the little things. So at Saturday's shootaround before Houston's NCAA Tournament second-round game vs. Gonzaga, he pulled aside assistant coach Hollis Price with a request bordering on a demand. 

""Hollis,"" Price recalls his boss telling him, ""L.J.'s been struggling the second half. Make sure he gets up as many shots as possible.""

Wait, what? Leading scorer LJ Cryer is the stone-faced leading scorer for this No. 1 seed who already has five – count 'em five – championship rings stowed away at his home in Katy, Texas. Officially the LJ stands for Lionel Jr. But based on his career it could be ""Long-range Jumper."" 

Besides that, how many shots do you need after taking a million?

""Best shooting guard in the country,"" teammate Milos Uzan crowed about his backcourt mate.

""When I was little I used to shoot until my arms got tired,"" Cryer said. ""When I got to college I did the same thing.""

Those are not clap backs. They, ultimately, may be part of a prelude to a championship. Top-seeded Houston certainly inched closer to a national title it has never owned with an 81-76 win over No. 8 seed Gonzaga to advance to the Sweet 16 for the sixth consecutive time in Sampson's run with the Houston.

Sampson never would have done it without the buttery-smooth Cryer who tied a career high with 30 points, 14 of them in the final nine minutes when Gonzaga became Gonzaga again. The underseeded (No. 8) Zags cut a 12-point lead with 6 ½ minutes to go to one point with 21 seconds to go. Cryer then provided two free throws to cut the lead to 79-76. That still didn't quite put it out of reach.

Sweet relief didn't come until Gonzaga's Khalif Battle tried a corner 3-pointer to tie it, but the shot was blocked by Houston's Ja'Vier Francis with two seconds left.  

""We gave up a lot but we were able to find a way,"" Francis said. 

The Cougars had seldom been pushed like this the entire season. It was the most points Houston had given up since its last loss, an 82-81 defeat on Feb. 1 at home against Texas Tech. It has now won 15 in a row, the last six this month by almost 11 points per game before Saturday. 

""We've been on the wrong side of things when things like this happen,"" Cryer said of the close second half.  

Well, yes, if you count a 5-3 start to the season. Since then, the Cougars have gone 26-1 with Cryer leading the way. 

""This is no shocker to me,"" Uzan said. ""This is really what he does."" 

The contest lived up to the hype of being an Elite Eight or Final Four-type showdown. Gonzaga's run of nine straight Sweet 16s ended after an epic effort. (Houston now leads the nation in that category.) Zags big Graham Ike scored 27 and at 6-foot-9, looked like he could transition to the NBA right now. 

""Nobody's doing that. No one,"" Gonzaga coach Mark Few said of Ike's performance. ""You're facing double teams every time. There's double teams and then there's Houston double-teams. For him to do that is unbelievable.""

But in the end, a conference held together by football expansion after the loss of Texas and Oklahoma now has three teams in the Sweet 16 and counting. And, if you're counting, that gives the Big 12 a 9-1 record in the tournament. 

Houston will be accompanied by BYU and Texas Tech into the Sweet 16 with Sunday's second-round games still to play. 

And none of that happens for Houston without Cryer. The Baylor transfer has won two conference championship rings each with the Bears and the Cougars. There is also a national championship ring as a reserve with Baylor in 2021. Next month Cryer could become what is believed to be the first Division I player to win national championships at two different schools. 

If bigger things await, Cryer is going to carry the Cougars instead of watching mostly from the bench. The third-team All-American is averaging 19 points this month.

""I feel like this year I've been having a lot of great first halves and then in the second half I slow down a little bit …,"" Cryer said. ""I felt like coach knew I was going to have to have a big second-half … We changed my warm-up in the second half, got up a lot of shots.""

About that halftime routine. Cryer warmed up a bit like Steph Curry. OK, that might be an exaggeration but not much of one. 

The Houston guard put on a dazzling display if you paid attention closely enough. He made feathery 3-pointer after feathery 3-pointer after being fed by Price. Behind the back, crossover dribbles that would make a magician arch an eyebrow. 

Curry's warmup routine before games is legendary, starting with impossible corner 3-pointers and ending with an array of halfcourt games. Sometimes that's the best thing that happens in the NBA that night. 

No, we're not going anywhere near comparing Houston's leading scorer to an NBA all-timer but at this point in Houston's season the number of comparisons runneth over.  In coach Kelvin Sampson's 36th year of coaching college ball, in his 20th trip to the NCAA Tournament, the man has the Cougars within two games of another Final Four. 

Sampson calls Cryer the team's ""security blanket."" That's what it looks like when Houston's bigs pitch out of a scramble underneath to Cryer at the perimeter. Eighteen of his points came on six 3-pointers. For the 36th time in his career Cryer scored at least 20 points

""He was spectacular,"" Few said. ""We set out to limit his 3s and make him take tough twos .. Other than that, we defended him the way we wanted to defend him and he still hit those shots."" 

We cannot leave Wichita without being reminded that Gonzaga's desperation 3-pointer to tie it came from the hands of Battle who is a tournament story to be remembered. At his fourth school in six years, the 6-9 guard came from his native Newark, New Jersey, where his friend Xan Korman was shot and killed years ago.

""I felt like it was time for a change(for) my last year,"" Battle explained in changing his number from 0 to 99. Why 99? There are nine letters in Korman's name and he was born in the ninth month (September). 

Battle texted Korman's parents Thursday night to remind them why he is playing at all.

""I'll keep dancing in his honor, for sure,"" Battle said before the game.

""I wish I could have had that one back,"" he said of the last shot after it.

CARSON, Calif. – Third place games can be a mixed bag, depending on the competition and the circumstances by which a team earns a placement in a tournament's penultimate match. Heading into Sunday's clash against Canada, though, there's a clarity about the U.S. men's national team about the task ahead of them – and putting Thursday's surprise Concacaf Nations League semifinal defeat to Panama behind them.

Thursday's loss became the latest in a string of disappointing results from the USMNT over the last year and change, forcing questions about the team's mentality and ability to live up to their potential when the 2026 World Cup finally begins. The judgment came both externally and internally, with head coach Mauricio Pochettino and the players admitting they lacked competitive edge, analysis that midfielder Tyler Adams still believes is warranted.

""I would criticize us, too. You know what I mean?,"" he said on Saturday. ""If we want to be praised, we have to give people something to praise us about.""

The natural first step to rectify that issue was to address it, which the team did in a meeting led by Pochettino.

""We had a beautiful meeting the other day,"" winger Timothy Weah said, ""and he was just explaining to us that we have to have that killer mentality and we have to want it. We have to want to be here 100%. We have to fight. We have to work together and for me, the end of the road is always beautiful so we just have to work up to that.""

Other formal and informal conversations have taken place since Thursday's loss, ones that have involved harsh looks in the mirror to identify their shortcomings.

""[When] we're playing teams that will be labeled … [as] less stronger than yours, obviously you tend to lack a bit of something, a bit of fight because you think it's an easier game,"" Weah admitted. It echoed Pochettino's sentiment, who felt the fault was not only the players'.

""It is, maybe, to feel like when we play in our clubs,"" Pochettino said. ""When we lose, it's some consequence. Maybe that doesn't happen [here] sometimes. I don't say you don't care, but I think you take it in a more relaxed way. I think we all felt that, at the end, it will appear, the opportunity, and we will score and win the game and celebrate and will go to the final [on] Sunday. I think that was the feeling on the pitch, the feeling for you, for the players and for us. And that is a wrong feeling because you need to score, you need to be aggressive, you need to be proactive, score two, three, four-nil and then okay, you relax on the last few minutes because you have the difference. But until then, that was the problem – we wasted 45 minutes and then second half, I think we were better but in the end, you pay [with] the last action but that is [the] consequence of how we start the game so relaxed.""

Pochettino also attributed Thursday's issues to the newness between the players and the coaching staff. The game against Panama was only Pochettino's seventh game in charge of the USMNT, but most players have been unable to attend every training camp because of injuries or scheduling issues during the MLS-focused January camp. The head coach believed that the group was perhaps too focused on getting all of his instructions right rather than ensuring they would take advantage of the opportunities that might spontaneously arrive during a match.

""It's like we play without goals, no? The principal objective is to score,""  he said while sneaking in a small laugh. ""That balance sometimes happens when you are at the beginning [of] building something, that you want to be protagonists, dominate the opponent. … You need to adopt a very good position on the pitch to help the structure, but when the structure is there and you have the possibility, it's when to accelerate the game and go forward and be aggressive. That is something we were missing.""

The players have identified that missing piece as the competitive edge that Pochettino believes is the foundation for the rest of his tactical ideas and aim to go toe-to-toe with an energetic Canada side.

""You have to match that – anyone in Concacaf, it's not just Canada,"" Adams said. ""Perfect example is Panama, so again, it's not matching that. We need to raise the bar. We need to be the team that sets the tone for every single game that we play and we can't be waiting for someone to throw the first punch in us being able to react, because sometimes you get knocked out in the first punch so again, it's one of those things that there doesn't need to be motivation for the game, whether it's third, fourth, whatever place game it is. It's like, we're representing our country and that needs to be the wake-up call to everyone.""

Weah believes Sunday's showdown with Canada could offer a first glimpse at what the USMNT can actually be if they live up to the potential they have boasted for more than half a decade – and hopefully in time for the 2026 World Cup on home soil.

""I think having games like Panama really shows that we do need to change some things,"" Weah said. ""It's also another learning experience for us to grow and I think with the new coach, it's wonderful that we get to work on things that he wants because he's a top level coach and I think every player is excited to be here and with him and I think we're just gonna grow under him. I think in the next, what, year or so before the World Cup, you're going to see a total different squad. I think he's gonna get the best out of the players and having moments like Panama is the only way you get to kind of fine-tune and fix certain things so, I think as it is a negative, it's also a positive for us to grow.""

PROVIDENCE, R.I. — When Arkansas beat Georgia 68-65 on Jan. 22 in Fayetteville, it was cause for an atypical in-season celebration. One of the March or April variety — something John Calipari almost never does.

The Razorbacks were 12-7 by the end of that night but still on track to be an embarrassing flop in Year 1 in Calipari's tenure. They'd started 0-5 in the SEC and were averaging only 64 points on 38% shooting. The team looked like a mess. But that win against Georgia was the team's first in league play, so Calipari bought champagne and they rejoiced as if they'd won an SEC title.

Really?

""Oh yeah — hell yeah,"" a damp, victorious Calipari told CBS Sports on his walk to the car in the back of Amica Mutual Pavilion Saturday. Daylight fading, the glare beaming off his face, he added: ""My thought was, I'm building a program and it's Year 1 and I don't want to go overboard and go crazy —  I just didn't expect us to be 0-5. I said, 'This is going to be harder than I thought.'""

Arkansas lost three days later at home to Oklahoma, and at 1-6 in the SEC, the dreaded return to Rupp Arena loomed heavy up next. Calipari had to wait a full week between games before returning to the place he coached for 15 years and left for, practically in the cover of night, last April at the Final Four. 

Almost nobody thought Arkansas was beating Kentucky back on Feb. 1. But beat Kentucky it did, 89-79, and the Razorbacks' season was flipped for good because of it. The Hogs have gone 10-5 since that night, the 10th win coming Saturday in Providence against No. 2 seed St. John's 75-66 in the second round of the West Region. 

A win at Kentucky in February.

A victory over Rick Pitino in March.

John Calipari, who has now led four different programs to the Sweet 16, has once again triumphed when many assumed the opposite.

The 66-year-old finds himself in a season of redemption that is so fitting for a fascinating career, one filled with upset wins, mega disappointments, endless bravado — all of it done his way. For good and for bad, high and low.

Saturday's second round battle was a compelling but unsightly game with 44 fouls, 58 free throws and abhorrent 3-point shooting: St. John's and Arkansas combined to shoot 4-of-41 from beyond the arc (9.8%), setting a record for the worst combined 3-point shooting display in NCAA Tournament history.

""Was it an ugly game? Or was it a game that was exciting? Like, both?"" Calipari said. ""An ugly exciting game. You know I don't care. It could be an ugly-ugly game and I'm happy we're moving on.""

Any way, any how to beat Pitino. 

Arkansas put up 46 paint points, more than St. John's had allowed in a game all season. The Hogs held SJU to 28% from the field, tied for the worst shooting of any Pitino-coached team in 77 NCAA Tournament games (tying the 1995 Elite Eight vs. North Carolina).

""They had 28 offensive rebounds and we still won, which is crazy,"" Calipari said. 

Not crazier than where Arkansas finds itself now, headed to the Sweet 16.

""The whole idea is, I want to have us be one of those programs every year that has a chance to win the national title,"" Calipari told me. ""Doesn't mean you do, but you're up at bat. Now we almost weren't up at bat when we were 1-6. They gave us, I believe, a 2% chance of being in the tournament, and we busted through."" 

As the game neared its close, CBS cameras caught Calipari's wife Ellen and his middle child, daughter Megan, crying in the stands. They were overcome with emotion at what was happening in front of their eyes. 

""It's just been a rough couple of years, you know?"" Megan told CBS Sports. ""Mostly why I want my dad to win is because I want him to be happy, because I love him. I don't care about basketball. I wouldn't consider myself to be a basketball fan. I'm a John Calipari fan, and so I feel like he deserves this. He worked so hard. That team worked so hard.""

""Vindicated,"" Megan added. ""He's never said that, but I would assume he would feel that way. I feel that way for him.""

""I do, too,"" Ellen Calipari told CBS Sports. ""There are always first round upsets every year, all the time. I think that's part of the satisfaction you get is part of the accumulation of that too. That satisfaction is greater from that.""

Few, if any, coaches have been more maligned for their missteps in coaching and approach to roster-building like Calipari. The man has won a national title. In 2015, he nearly pulled off the first undefeated season since Bob Knight. He redefined what it meant to recruit at the highest levels for more than a decade. And he had some brutal flops in the winter of his career at Kentucky — most infamously Saint Peter's in 2022 and Oakland in 2024. The dynamic in Lexington became toxic. The Caliparis had to get out. 

Arkansas was an unexpected lifeline. 

He brought a lot of his staff and Kentucky players and commits with him as well. After the shock of it all wore off and people realized not a lot was changing with how he was approaching coaching, he was again called outdated and stubborn. 

The move to Fayetteville didn't make it easier. Privately, this has been as taxing a season for the Caliparis as any.

""It felt like a lot of pressure, for some reason, this year — I would say even past years have not felt like this much pressure,"" Megan said. ""It is still really hard to read such awful things about your dad, and so I feel that's probably part of it for me. I just feel so happy for him that he can prove so many people wrong. And honestly, I think he likes that. I think he likes being an underdog. He likes having to fight his way out of a situation. I think he thrives that way. And I think we saw it here today.""

Saturday could have been Pitino's latest big moment in his late-career revival. Many thought it was supposed to be. Predictably, St. John's red far outnumbered Arkansas crimson in Providence on Saturday, the city Pitino brought a Final Four banner to in 1987. It would have been a fitting full-circle moment if St. John's made its first Sweet 16 in 26 years in a Big East building, Pitino continuing something storybook.

Calipari, as he's done so often before, spoiled it. 

This was an unthinkable reality for him as recently as a month ago. Maybe even a week ago.

""Says a lot about these kids and how they've been raised,"" Calipari said of his players. ""And my staff never wavered. Got to work, didn't panic. I panicked.""

He panicked because he wondered how it could have gone so bad so fast right away in a great SEC. Freshman guard Boogie Fland went down before the Georgia game. The running assumption in the weeks after was he'd played his last game for the Razorbacks. Fortunately, Fland returned for the NCAA Tournament and gave Arkansas the depth necessary to beat two Hall-of-Fame coaches in three days: Bill Self and Pitino.

In doing so, Calipari is only the fourth coach to ever win back-to-back tournament games against Naismith Memorial Hall-of-Famers. Saturday marked the 14th time in 24 meetings between Calipari and Pitino that Cal got the win. Pitino is considered by many to be on the short list of greatest college coaches ever. Calipari's name never gets brought up in those debates. One of the greatest recruiters ever? The best. A tactical savant? Not according to his critics. 

Calipari knows that. He cares. It bothers him. And there's little he can do about it. 

But now it's Calipari who is the only coach to topple Pitino three times in the NCAA Tournament.

""It's definitely a rivalry,"" Megan said of her father's dynamic with Pitino. ""No matter who denies it. They had very similar career trajectory."" 

On Thursday and Friday they'll play Sweet 16 games in this tournament and John Calipari will still be coaching in it; Arkansas faces 3-seed Texas Tech. It'll be Cal's 16th time in the regional semifinals. No active coach has more.

Three-hundred-and-sixty-six days ago, Oakland beat Kentucky 80-76. Calipari's career seemed to be teetering on the edge. Something had to change. He decided to jump, just under different circumstances than ever before in his four decades of coaching. 

""I'm not mad at anybody,"" Calipari said. ""What's happened for me is a blessing, that I was able to do what I did at Kentucky and Memphis and Massachusetts, and now let me try to do it here.""

As has always been the case, Calipari is trying — and doing it — his way. Because that has to be the way. For good, for bad, for whatever it brings.

This tournament can lift you just as it can crush you. Few understand that better than Cal. Perhaps the most surreal coaching year of his life gets to live on for another week and at least another game. Arkansas is in the Sweet 16 and John Calipari is once again finding ways to prove a lot of people wrong.

With 4:56 remaining in the second half Saturday and No. 2 seed St. John's trying to stage a comeback from a 13-point deficit against No. 10 seed Arkansas, Red Storm star RJ Luis Jr. hit two free throws to cut the lead to two points.

Then he hit the bench. And did not return the remainder of the game.

The curious decision to sit the Big East Player of the Year and scoring leader for a 31-win team during the closing run was all the more puzzling as their comeback bid fell flat in a 75-66 loss.

In that stretch, St. John's was outscored 11-4 and finished the game missing eight of its final nine shots from the field. When its offense needed a super-charge to catch up and play from behind, Luis -- one of the few live wires who can ignite an otherwise pedestrian offense -- looked on from the sidelines.

""He played 30 minutes,"" Pitino said defiantly postgame. ""That's a long time.""

Pitino was then asked if Luis was benched due to fatigue. 

""No,"" he responded. ""He played 30 minutes and I went with other people. ... Don't ask me leading questions. You already know why he didn't play."" 

""He played 30 minutes and I went with other people.""Rick Pitino explained why RJ Luis was on the bench in the second half. pic.twitter.com/6zdbcZXb8f

Pitino was later asked about Luis telling reporters that he didn't feel like he played like a leader. In response, the coach singled out Kadary Richmond, Deivon Smith and Aaron Smith -- curiously omitting Luis -- as players who he appreciated for ""giving them every single thing they had."" 

Luis finished the game 3-of-17 shooting and was 1 of 5 in the second half before sitting for the stretch run. Pitino noted that he would not ""knock"" one of his players in public, but he did read Luis' stat line and seemed to take issue specifically with the style of his team's offensive strategy and execution in perhaps a thinly veiled shot at Luis, who was the only guard over 20 minutes not to log an assist.

""We lost the game because we did not move the basketball well enough,"" Pitino said. ""And that led to us shooting a very low percentage. We're a team that has to have a high number of assists to win. We didn't tonight.""

More from Rick Pitino on why RJ Luis was benched for final 4:56 vs. Arkansas: — ""He played 30 minutes. That's a long time.""— Thanks leadership of Scott, Richmond, Smith after asked about Luis' leadershipHe repeatedly emphasized lack of passing but didn't single Luis out. pic.twitter.com/2h4IVWtlS1

St. John's finished with just five assists to six turnovers and shot a woeful 2 of 22 from 3-point range and 21 of 75 from the field in the loss. The Red Storm's season ends after matching a program-high with 31 wins under Pitino, tying the previous record set in 1984-85 and 1985-86 under the legend Lou Carnesecca.

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

The biggest push on Moving Day at the 2025 Valspar Championship came from Justin Thomas as the 15-time PGA Tour winner shot the round of the tournament thus far with a 6-under 65. That vaulted him from T53 to T5, putting him firmly into contention entering the final round just two shots off pace.

Thomas explained Friday that he would have e been extra frustrated to miss the cut this week, noting the bunched leaderboard and tough scoring meant all one needed was one good round to get into the mix. 

""I would say [being on the cut line is] more nerve wracking than trying to win a golf tournament, just because -- especially a week like this, like I'm literally nine holes from leading the golf tournament right now, and I might not even get to play this weekend,"" Thomas said after finishing at 1 over after Friday and having to wait to see whether he would play the weekend. 

J.T. certainly took advantage of that opportunity Saturday and nearly proved his point about being only nine holes away from the lead. Now, he looks like the biggest threat in the chase group, one who can apply serious pressure to a relatively unproven leaderboard if he can put some birdies on the card early in his final round Sunday.

The presumptive biggest obstacle in Thomas' quest for a 16th PGA Tour title is Viktor Hovland, who backed up his 67 on Friday with a 69 on Saturday to join the leaders at 7 under.

Hovland spoke candidly Friday about how he's been battling his swing and felt like he has no control over where the ball's going, but he looked to be under control in the third round putting just one bogey on the card all day in a relatively stress-free effort.

Let's take a look at where the Valspar stands entering Sunday at Innisbrook.

1. Viktor Hovland, Jacob Bridgeman and Nico Echavarria (-7)

Hovland is the unquestionable favorite entering the final 18 holes as he seems to be steadily finding his game. We know how good he can be at his best. Still, Sunday pressure is something he hasn't felt in a while, and for a player that's been struggling with confidence in his swing, his nerve will be tested being tied entering the final round with a share of the lead.

Echavarria looked for awhile Friday like he might go run and hide before crashing back to Earth on his back nine. That made his Saturday bounce-back 66 even more impressive. He has to be brimming with confidence as he gets set to play in the final pairing. 

Joining him in that final duo is Bridgeman, who looked like he was going to eject from the conversation at the midway point of his third round after being the 36-hole solo leader. After going out in 38 to fall four off the pace at one point, he clawed his way back into a tie for the lead with four birdies in his first five holes on the back nine, holding his nerve nicely as he seeks his first career PGA Tour win. 

4. Ricky Castillo (-6)5. Justin Thomas, Shane Lowry, Kevin Yu, Davis Riley, Jeremy Paul and Ryo Hisatsune (-5)

Castillo, to his credit, will not fade away after posting a solid 68 on Saturday to get into the penultimate group with Hovland on Sunday. It's the first time he's found himself in that kind of position, and we'll see how the 24-year-old former Florida standout's nerves hold up under the Sunday spotlight for the first time. 

Behind him are seven players at 5 under, headlined by Thomas, who will have plenty of confidence going into Sunday after his third-round 65.  Shane Lowry continues to loiter near the top of the leaderboard, and while he hasn't been able to put together a notably low 18 holes, his 29 on the back Friday is proof that if the putter gets hot he can be a threat. 

The rest of the 5-under group is fairly unproven on Sundays, but Paul has been incredibly consistent this week, Hisatsune was briefly up in the lead on Saturday, and Yu has put together back-to-back 68s. Riley is the only other one with wins under his belt, and he has been trending positively in the Florida swing after a rough start to the 2025 season. 

For the third straight day, Thomas and Spieth were paired together, and the duo used a comfortable pairing to make a big move on Saturday. Thomas' 65 was his lowest round ever at the Copperhead course, while Spieth shot a 4-under 67 to move into the top 20 in a typically Speith-ian day with seven birdies and three bogeys.

After the round, Thomas made a quick pitch to U.S. Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley. 

""Hopefully, Keegan was watching; I think we had a good best ball today,"" Thomas joked.

Editor's note: Bradley was in attendance at the St. John's vs. Arkansas basketball game in the second round of the 2025 NCAA Tournament.

To J.T.'s point, the best-ball for their pairing on Saturday would've been an 11-under 60. They'll need more than one or two good days at Innisbrook to book their tickets to Bethpage Black, but if they can find that feeling from Saturday regularly this year, perhaps we could get the return of a U.S. Ryder Cup staple pairing this fall.

The difficult 17th hole at the Copperhead course gave up a hole-in-one for the second consecutive day. Saturday's came courtesy of Sam Ryder, who clearly had the perfect club for the 204-yard par 3 as he flew his shot straight into the hole to put a 1 on the card. That was a big help to his cause as he moved up to T24 at 2 under going into Sunday thanks in large part to his perfect tee shot on the 17th. 

MADNESS!A slam-dunk ace for @SamRyderSU on the 17th hole @ValsparChamp! 🏀 pic.twitter.com/743fu88wuJ

Odds via DraftKings Sportsbook

I'm sticking with Lowry as the best value on the board just because I don't see him fading and he's capable of getting the putter hot. Of the lead group, Echavarria is the most interesting to me because, aside from the back nine on Friday, he's been fantastic all week.

Cooper Flagg is unlike your traditional presumptive No. 1 overall pick in the NBA Draft. Most top prospects go No. 1 because of their scoring. While Flagg -- the Duke star who will be back on the court in the NCAA Tournament on Sunday afternoon -- certainly provides his fair share, it's far from his selling point. Most rookies enter the NBA as defensive projects. With the exception of Victor Wembanyama (who is an anomaly in every sense of the word), Flagg is probably the most polished defensive prospect of the decade. He'll enter the NBA as a fairly advanced playmaker for his position with a jump shot that's improving rapidly. He's even hinted at bucking at recent NBA convention by eschewing the one-and-done path and remaining at Duke for another year.

Now, that little bit of rebellion almost certainly won't come to pass. It would be financially irresponsible regardless of how much NIL money he can rake in at Duke. Top prospects don't go one-and-done to start making rookie salaries right away. They do it to start the clock toward their second contract, the one that can pay them market rate, which they can sign after their third season and kicks in after their fourth. Every year Flagg spends at Duke is a year longer he has to wait to start making 25% of the cap. This season, that's over $35 million. Factor in 10% annual cap growth and the possibility that he gets the 30% Rose Rule bump, and his fifth-year salary might even be above $50 million. His camp is aware of this. They'll almost certainly steer him toward the NBA as soon as possible for that reason.

So we can assume that Flagg will be on the table at No. 1 this June. The better question then becomes, where should he go? He doesn't have a choice in the matter, of course. He'll go where the ping pong balls send him. But considering what an unconventional prospect we're dealing with, it's reasonable to say that Flagg wouldn't thrive under the same conditions as a standard No. 1 pick. Put an elite scoring prospect on a barren team like, say, the Wizards, and he'll shoot his way to stardom. Flagg is best-suited to a different sort of environment.

Ideally, he would go somewhere with a top scorer already in place, so his offense can develop slowly. It should be a team with some measure of frontcourt flexibility. Flagg's assumed position is power forward. In certain contexts, the 6-foot-9 Flagg could plausibly make sense at small forward or, down the line, even center. If a team has core players locked in at those positions, it limits his upside. And, given how well-rounded his game already is, we probably want him on a winner sooner rather than later if possible. This isn't a necessity. Most star rookies start on bad teams, but most star rookies are meant to start on bad teams. They have kinks to work out over the course of a few low-leverage seasons. Flagg is ready to win now. 

So with all of that in mind, these are the best fits for Flagg in the lottery right now. We're going to draw a cutoff at No. 10. This might seem ironic a year after Atlanta jumped from No. 11 to No. 1, but we want to cover the teams with stronger odds of landing Flagg rather than just sticking him on the best non-playoff teams. So, with that in mind, let's start at No. 5.

Current odds for No. 1 pick: 2%

The Blazers are in a few ways the Flagg of this crop of rebuilding teams. They don't have a traditional star-caliber prospect yet, but they've done a wonderful job of accumulating young and versatile role players. Rarely do lottery teams have All-Defense candidates, but Toumani Camara has a case. Deni Avdija does a little bit of everything and is locked into a very favorable deal for the next three years. Donovan Clingan is the long-term answer at center, but isn't going to garner so much playing time that Flagg would never have a chance to play center. He wouldn't need to as a rookie because Deandre Ayton will be playing out the final year of his contract, but it's an option available to experiment with after that.

The question here is who Portland's primary scorer is going to be. That's a bit more complicated. Anfernee Simons does that now. Next year is the last of his contract, and he's really more of a secondary scorer in a perfect situation anyway, and he's probably a trade candidate regardless.

How about Scoot Henderson? The No. 3 overall pick in 2023 is starting to figure things out. The ultra-athletic point guard has nine 20-point games this season, with eight of them coming since January. He's starting to make 3s somewhat consistently lately, and having a forward like Flagg that can space the floor a bit and develop a two-man game with him stands to benefit both. Henderson's incredible speed is going to draw defenders with him, creating more room to Flagg operate with as a roller.

Henderson isn't a surefire star, and the Blazers aren't a conventional rebuilder. This is a team mature beyond its years, much like Flagg. While there's more upside elsewhere, there's something fitting about slotting him onto a team full of grown-ups. He could play meaningful basketball as a rookie here. That's just not going to be true somewhere like Washington.

Current odds for No. 1 pick: 14%

Several Charlotte regimes have tried to translate the region's love for college basketball into enduring love for state's lone NBA team. The Bobcats once drafted two North Carolina Tar Heels in the same lottery back in 2005 (Raymond Felton and Sean May). Fellow-UNC legend Tyler Hansbrough ended his brief NBA career with the Hornets. There are 23 active NBA players from Duke and three of them (Mark Williams, Seth Curry and Wendell Moore Jr.) are on the Hornets' roster. It's never stuck. Flagg is better than any of them. Maybe he could pull it off.

The Hornets, today, are a mess. They have the NBA's 29th-ranked offense, but the tools are there for quick improvement. Brandon Miller, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft, will play only 27 games this season. LaMelo Ball carries the bulk of the Charlotte offense, and he and Flagg would benefit from a partnership. Flagg needs to limit his usage early on. Ball soaks up possessions like few players in all of basketball. Ball also plays a style that we can charitably call unstructured and thus far not conducive to winning. Ideally, he needs to be surrounded with veterans that can help keep him on script. Flagg is the rare rookie who fits that mold.

A Ball-Flagg-Miller trio would be the most talented core Charlotte has had since the Alonzo Mourning-Larry Johnson days, and the new Jeff Peterson-led front office has thus far managed its rebuild fairly well. They haven't rushed. They've turned veterans like Terry Rozier and P.J. Washington into valuable picks. They're set up for cap space in the strong free agent class of 2026. There's potential for a quick turnaround here with the right lottery pick. In a perfect world for them, that would be Flagg.

Current odds for No. 1 pick: 14%

The Jazz don't have the sort of obvious young stars on Flagg's timeline that the Hornets have. They don't have Portland's depth of role players either, and they certainly lack the win-now promise the top two teams on these rankings possess. What they have, more than any other team that's realistically in play for Flagg, is malleability.

Only the Thunder rival the Jazz in terms of incoming draft picks. Utah has enough firepower to trade for virtually any sort of teammate Flagg might need. Perhaps more importantly, the Jazz have a lead basketball executive in Danny Ainge that has put together multiple champions. It might take a little while to get going, but Flagg's career would be in good hands in Utah. Given the limited track record of most of the other front offices in this lottery, that can't be assured in many other places. It would, in essence, reflect the situation Victor Wembanyama entered two years ago: a mostly blank slate with a smart front office. That's worked out quite well for him thus far.

So what about the current core? In Lauri Markkanen, Walker Kessler and John Collins, the Jazz theoretically already have all three starting front-court slots filled. That isn't a bad thing, though. The three of them are wildly different sorts of players. Markkanen is a shooter and on-ball creator. Collins is a roller and rim scorer. Kessler is a star rim-protector on defense. Having all of those pieces in place gives the Jazz room to experiment with what sort of teammates fit Flagg best. Collins -- on an expiring deal next season assuming he picks up his player option -- is the easiest to get off of if necessary. With Markkanen now on a long-term extension, he could be traded for significant value as well if need be. 

His rookie season would be an experiment, and it would give the Jazz time to figure out the backcourt. Keyonte George has put up numbers in a no-pressure situation. Can he be more efficient and improve his decision-making on a team with actual ambition? Can Isaiah Collier's scoring rise to the level of his playmaking? These are questions to be answered with time, but Utah's hilarious surplus of draft picks almost renders them pointless. Either they have the guards they'll need or they can just go get them. Few other teams can say the same.

Current odds for No. 1 pick: 9.0%

Be honest: your instinct is to fixate on the scary contracts owed to Joel Embiid and Paul George right now, isn't it? Pretend they don't exist for a moment. Philadelphia still has Tyrese Maxey, the best guard plausibly available to Flagg as a teammate next season. He's plenty capable of soaking up possessions early in Flagg's career while slowly ceding usage depending on how far Flagg winds up going. He's a stellar 3-point shooter, perfectly capable of operating off of the ball, and his experience with Embiid has taught him a number of tricks that would benefit Flagg. He knows how to modulate his pace to facilitate a bigger ball-handler and shooter, but he also knows how turn on the jets to bend a defense in favorable ways.

Now let's reintroduce Embiid and George back into the equation. Even if their health isn't dependable, the 76ers currently have max players at center and small forward. They have one at point guard as well, and they have not only stellar No. 16 overall pick (and former Duke Blue Devil) Jared McCain at shooting guard, but breakout deadline addition Quentin Grimes as well. If healthy, this team has everything except a power forward. There isn't an easier lineup to slide Flagg into, and his presence could feasibly make it easier to keep Embiid and George healthy moving forward. It's a lot easier to limit Embiid to 25 minutes a night if Flagg is on the floor for the minutes he rests.

Daryl Morey's stock as a general manager is lower today than it's ever been. But this is his 18th season as a lead basketball decision-maker, and it will be his first below .500. Flagg wouldn't be stuck in an ugly rebuild here, as bad as this season has been. He'd be joining a team with at least one other foundational player, possibly a few more, and a general manager with a history of building winners.

Current odds for No. 1 pick: 4.5%

I mean... what who were you expecting? Wembanyama and Flagg together might be checkmate for every team besides Oklahoma City for the next decade. They're about as perfect a fit together as you can ask out of two big men. Wembanyama is, obviously, a generational rim-protector. Flagg is going to wind up playing some center in the NBA, but he's best-suited covering more ground on the perimeter as a forward. Well, he can go nuts knowing Wembanyama is behind him.

Stephon Castle is an incredibly athletic, high-IQ young guard. His potential is limited only by his poor shooting. You know how maximize a guard who can't shoot 3s? By pairing him with big men that can. Flagg and Wembanyama would help get the most out of Castle. We haven't even mentioned De'Aaron Fox, the All-Star point guard they just traded for last month. He'd be the adult hand on the wheel while the youngsters figure things out. 

Speaking of which, Chris Paul is on the team this season. The Spurs would be incentivized to bring him back next season. Aside from the fact that he hasn't missed a game this year, he also has a remarkable track record of developing young stars. His fingerprints are all over Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's ascension to superstardom. The same is true for Devin Booker. He's even worked with an athletically gifted and ultra-versatile power forward in Blake Griffin. Any team that employs Flagg would want to send him to the Chris Paul finishing school for young stars. The Spurs actually have him.

The people who built their five champions may be getting long in the tooth, but they're still in the building. These are the people you want to entrust with a talent like Flagg's. Assuming Wembanyama comes back healthy next season, he and Flagg would be one of the most promising young front courts in NBA history. They'd start competing for rings before long. The Spurs are our no-brainer No. 1.

Obviously, we covered five of the teams currently projected to pick in the top 11. What about the others? Here's a lightning-round explanation on why they missed out:

McLaren puts in a dominant showing at the Chinese Grand Prix.

Can McLaren make it two wins in a row to open the 2025 Formula 1 season?

Lando Norris went wire-to-wire to win the season-opening Australian Grand Prix last week, and now Oscar Piastri has a chance to replicate his teammate's feat after capturing pole position for the Chinese Grand Prix. Piastri edged out George Russell by just 0.082 seconds to take P1 during qualifying, and will have Norris behind him, as his McLaren teammate qualified third.

Defending Drivers' Champion Max Verstappen qualified fourth, with the Ferrari duo of Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc locking out the third row.

Here is the full starting grid for the Chinese Grand Prix:

Sunday's race is expected to be a tire degradation battle, as the resurfaced circuit in Shanghai has increased both the grip level, and the wear on the tires. During Saturday's F1 Sprint race Hamilton drove away from the grid after starting on pole, with the clean air causing less damage on his tires. Those behind him in dirty air, however, saw their tires fade quickly over the 19-lap sprint.

We'll have the entire race covered for you live so whether you're staying up late, or getting up early, check back early and often!

Updates are noted in either Eastern time or by lap number. 

4:51: Here are your provisional results from the Chinese Grand Prix:

4:49: “Great result, finishing P3,” begins Russell. “We knew McLaren were a smidge quicker than us.

“I felt early on that a one stop would be possible,” adds Russell. “Pleased again to be on the podium.”

4:46: “A few fun moments,” says Norris trackside. “I was a little bit nervous, but our pace was a lot better on the second stint.

“Oscar drove well, he was quick the whole race,” adds Norris. “He deserved the win.”

The McLaren driver then elaborates on the brake issue. “It's scary,” starts Norris. “It's like my worst nightmare. When I have a nightmare, it's when the brakes are failing.”

4:44: “I hope so,” says Piastri when asked by Ho-Pin Tung if this is the start of his title campaign. 

“I think on the medium it was still a bit tricky, but the hard was a much better tire than everyone expected,” adds Piastri about the expected tire degradation. “A happy surprise.”

4:41: George Russell photobombs the McLaren photo with Piastri, Norris, and Zak Brown. Good stuff there. 

4:38: Kimi Antonelli is your driver of the day as voted on by the fans.

Cooldown Lap: “Well done boys, beautiful one-two,” says Norris over the radio.

Cooldown Lap: “Thank you very much, car was very lovely,” says Piastri over the radio.

F1TV cameras cut to a McLaren fan in the stands crying tears of joy. Good stuff. 

Lap 56: Norris comes home in P2, with Russell in P3.

Your provisional top ten:

PiastriNorrisRussellVerstappenLeclercHamiltonOconAntonelliAlbonBearman

Lap 56: Oscar Piastri has won the Chinese Grand Prix.

Lap 56: F1TV stays with Norris as he is managing his brakes. The hairpin at Turn 14 could be tough for him with his brake situation.

Lap 55: Norris is told that the brake situation is getting “critical.” He reports that the brake is going “flat.”

Norris had closed to inside of three seconds of Piastri, but he'll ease off now and focus on bringing his MCL39 home in P2 ahead of Russell.

Lap 54: Hey a little shoutout to Haas. The Australian Grand Prix was a tough weekend for them, but right now both Ocon and Bearman are in the points with Ocon running in P7 and Bearman in P10. 

Lap 53: Verstappen gets by Leclerc at Turn 3. The Ferrari tried to fight back immediately, but Verstappen manages to hold on for the place. Here is the current Top 5:

PiastriNorrisRussellVerstappenLeclerc

Lap 51: Norris is three seconds behind Piastri, and seven seconds ahead of Norris.

The most fascinating fight might be Verstappen and Leclerc, as Verstappen is within DRS range of Leclerc in front of him in P4. 

Lap 50: Norris is reporting that his brake pedal is “going long.” McLaren tells him that the brakes still have all the power they need, but that he will just feel the brake pedal softer on his left foot. 

Lap 47: Replays on FT1V indicate that Tsunoda's front wing simply snapped under aerodynamic load. 

Lap 46: McLaren tells Norris that any rain will be on the final lap only.

Hadjar and Doohan have a little scrap, and Hadjar's teammate Tsunoda has picked up some damage to his front wing. VCARB saw both drivers start in the points but now both are running outside the top ten. 

Lap 44: Stroll makes the first overtake he will need to fight back into the points, getting by Sainz for P13.

Red Bull tells Verstappen that everyone is trying to make it until the end on a one-stop strategy. We'll see if that is indeed the case. 

Ferrari tells Leclerc that “we're losing some time in Turn 2. Maybe try one lap without doing the kerb.”

Leclerc's response? “Nope.”

Lap 43: Current top five with intervals:

PiastriNorris +4.429Russell +5.186Leclerc +5.086Verstappen +3.531

Lap 42: F1TV theorizing that Stroll's massive stint on the hards to start the race may unfortunately be his undoing. He is currently running in P13, but if those in front of him believe they can make it until the end because of what Stroll himself showed on the hard compound over 30-plus laps, then Stroll will have to get in the points by making some moves on the track, and not due to teams pitting in front of him. 

Lap 40: A fun battle between Bearman and Gasly for the final spot in the points over the past few laps, but the rookie finally gets by Gasly into P10. 

Lap 39: Piastri tells his team that he thinks he can go to the end. We'll see if McLaren tries the one-stop, or if that was a bit of radio bluffing. 

Lap 38: Norris has closed to within three seconds of Piastri in front of him. The gap from Norris to Russell behind him is 5.754 seconds at the moment.

Norris reports that he feels the first little bit of graining on his front left tire, but it feels “okay” for now. 

Lap 38: Hamilton dips into the pits, and Ferrari bolts on a fresh set of hards. He is the first of the lead runners to commit to a two-stop race. 

Lap 37: Stroll is finally making his stop, and will make the switch to mediums.

Verstappen is told that he has good pace, “better late than never.” We'll see if he can put a charge together. 

Lap 36: Tsunoda comes in for a pit stop and bolts on a new set of hards.

Bearman sticks another overtake, this time of Carlos Sainz Jr., and is up into P12. 

“Ciao,” says the rookie which is becoming something of a catchphrase for him, as he used it earlier after making a pass. 

Lap 35: Norris is told that there is a small risk of “class one” rain incoming. For those that were with us last week, according to former race strategist Ruth Buscombe Divey “class one” rain is rain that gets the track damp. 

Lap 34: Okay that embed from Bluesky worked, but if you are reading on Apple News you'll need to click the link. 

Bearman makes an overtake of Jack Doohan stick for P15. 

Norris is told that the hard tire looks “robust,” and that Russell has been told they are going to the end at Mercedes. We'll see if that is more bluffing from Mercedes or not. 

Lap 29: Let's try something here:

Let's give it up for Lance Stroll, still putting in some good laps on 30-lap old hard tires.

Lap 28: Leclerc has a snap at the hairpin, and as a result has fallen back almost two seconds behind Russell. 

Lap 28: Will Joseph instructs Norris to “use some of his pace.” Norris is wary about getting into the dirty air from Piastri in front of him, but has just posted the fastest lap of the race.

Leclerc remains in DRS range of Russell as the two battle for P3.

The current top ten in Shanghai: 

PiastriNorrisRussellLeclercHamiltonVerstappenStrollTsunodaOconAntonelli

Stroll has just done his best lap of the race, still on 28-lap old tires. 

Lap 27: Bearman comes in for a stop, and Haas bolts on a set of mediums. 

F1TV speculating that a one-stop strategy could be in the works for some teams given how well both Bearman and Stroll fared with those long stints to start the race on the hard compound.

Lap 25: Bearman locks up at the hairpin trying to finish an overtake on Stroll, but ends up running wide, and Stroll settles back into P7.

Lap 23: Stroll and Bearman are still out, the only drivers yet to stop. Both started on the hard compound, and Stroll is currently P7 with Bearman within DRS range behind him in P8.

Also an update here at the Schofield household. It is 3:42 a.m. and our cat Rosie is currently battling with a little ball in the kitchen. That might be one of the better battles to watch over the next hour. 

Lap 21: Ferrari makes the switch, and Leclerc slides into P4. He is running 1.666 seconds behind Russell. 

Albon makes his stop and comes out in P14. We'll see how much his running long pays off later in the race. 

Lap 20: Albon gets called in for his stop, after taking his medium tires 19 laps. Piastri is in the lead, more than three seconds ahead of Norris. 

Lap 18: Norris sticks an overtake on Russell, and gets that position back. Piastri has retaken the lead at the front and Albon, who has yet to pit, is running in P2. 

Leclerc still has the broken front wing after his pit stop, and he is still within DRS range of Hamilton in front of him with Hamilton in P6 and Leclerc in P7. F1TV reports that Ferrari has instructed the drivers to switch positions, but they have not done so as of yet. 

Lap 16: Ocon sticks an overtake on Antonelli down the long straight, dipping his right side into the grass and kicking up some dirt.

Norris comes out of his pit stop but cannot hold off Russell as he comes out of the pits. Albon leads the Chinese Grand Prix but has yet to stop, followed by Piastri, Russell, and Norris. 

Lap 14: Mercedes then immediately calls Russell in for a pit stop, which probably negates a one-stop strategy. 

Piastri's pit stop was on the slower side, which could open the door for the challengers. 

Lap 14: Piastri is being called in for his pit stop. 

Russell is calling for a “one-stop” strategy, which would be a bold call. 

Lap 13: Antonelli and Hadjar are the next drivers to dip into pit lane. Tsunoda and Ocon bolted on the hards on their earlier stops.

Antonelli comes back out on the track and is behind Tsunoda, which gives you a sense of the power of the undercut here. But Antonelli will have tires that are one-lap fresher at the end of this stint.

Lap 12: Tsunoda is the first driver in the top ten to pit, followed by Ocon. 

Lap 10: F1TV is speculating that Leclerc, who is doing a masterful job at staying within DRS range of Hamilton in front of him even with the damage to his front wing, could forego changing his front wing giving how well he is running at the moment.

Leclerc also radios into his team that “if it stays like this, I want Plan A.” But his team tells him that there would be too much traffic.

Gasly pulls in to make his first pit stop, and Alpine bolts on a set of hards. 

Lap 9: Alex Albon tells his team to “relax,” stating “I am better than everyone” when warned about tire wear. Albon is running in P11, but is within DRS range of Esteban Ocon in front of him. 

Lap 8: Hamilton is reporting some graining on his front left tire here on Lap 8. During the F1 Sprint race yesterday Verstappen noted that his medium tires were “dead” on Lap 10. We are firmly in two-stop range here.

Norris also reports that he is starting to “struggle, left front” to his team.

Lap 6: Norris is within DRS range of Piastri at the front. Russell is more than a second behind Norris in P3.

Leclerc is staying with Hamilton, even with the damage to his front wing. Verstappen is almost three seconds behind Leclerc in P6, but the Red Bull driver might be trying to manage his tires as much as possible. 

Lap 4: Pierre Gasly reports that Fernando Alonso's brakes are “on fire.”

That's two drivers now providing some commentary from the cockpit so far. 

Alonso pulls to the side here on Lap 4, likely to be the first retirement of the race. That would make for his second retirement in two Grands Prix this season.

“No brakes,” reports Alonso from the cockpit of his AMR25. 

Lap 3: “We can survive,” said Leclerc when told of the damage to his front wing. 

Lap 1: Alex Jacques on F1TV reports that the two Ferrari drivers made contact, which caused the damage to Leclerc's front wing, including the loss of an endplate. Replays confirm that report. 

3:05: Things are underway in Shanghai. Piastri holds onto the lead after a challenge from Russell, but that opens the door for Norris who jumps into P2 behind his teammate. 

Verstappen radios into Red Bull that Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc has a “broken front wing.”

3:04: Lawson has pulled down pit lane. The green flag is at the back. 

3:00: The formation lap is underway in Shanghai.

Only three cars are on the hard tire: Lance Stroll in P14, Oliver Bearman in P17, and Liam Lawson in P20, who will start from pit lane.

Everyone else is on the medium compound. Expect a two-stop strategy to be the primary plan today for the field. 

2:57: I feel it necessary to point out that one of our cats, Rosie, is perplexed at my being awake right now. 

I understand her confusion. 

2:48: Toto Wolff stops by F1TV. “I think everything is possible but I think a podium would be good,” says the Mercedes boss about George Russell, who is set to start second. He points to the McLarens, Max Verstappen, and Lewis Hamilton as challengers for the win. 

2:46: The run into Turn 1 from the start/finish line is 300 meters. That should make for a fun start. 

2:43: “It's all about that front left tire today,” says Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner to Jolyon Palmer as the F1TV analyst does his pre-race walk through the grid. 

Again, tire degradation and clear air are the two major talking points heading into this race. 

2:39: Liam Lawson, who was set to start 20th, will start from pit lane as Red Bull made changes to the suspension on his RB21 under parc ferme conditions. 

2:38: My word it is early.

Why was Lewis Hamilton disqualified at the Chinese Grand Prix?

Lewis Hamilton's second race weekend as a Ferrari driver began with pole position, and a win, in the F1 Sprint race at the Chinese Grand Prix.

It ended with a disqualification in the Grand Prix itself, dropping Hamilton out of the points after he finished sixth.

Following the race, technical delegates performed their customary post-race inspections of cars, which included a measurement of the thickness of the skid plate underneath Hamilton's SF-25. According to a report from Jo Bauer, the FIA F1 Technical Delegate:

The rearmost skid was measured according to the team's legality documents submission in accordance with TD039 L, item 1.2 b) i). Measurements were taken along the stiffness-compliant area at three different points of the periphery (inner arc). The recorded measurement were 8.6 mm (LHS), 8.6 mm (car centerline) and 8.5 mm (RHS).

As this is less than the 9 mm minimum thickness required by TR Article 3.5.9 e), I am referring this matter to the stewards for their consideration.

Document 80, the Technical Delegate report, can be read in full here:

The referral to the race stewards resulted in a hearing at the Chinese Grand Prix, which was conducted at 6:48 p.m. local time. During the hearing, which was attended by Hamilton himself according to the report, the driver ”confirmed that the measurement is correct and that all required procedures were performed correctly. The team also acknowledged that there were no mitigating circumstances and that it was a genuine error by the team.”

According to race officials, the standard penalty for a breach of Article 3.5.9 of the FIA Formula 1 Technical Regulations is disqualification.

Here is the decision in full:

The disqualification mirrors what happened to Hamilton at the 2023 United States Grand Prix. That afternoon in Austin Hamilton finished second and Charles Leclerc — his current Ferrari teammate — finished sixth. 

But both were disqualified when post-race inspections uncovered that the plank was not in compliance with the Technical Regulations.

F1 cars have these planks, or “skid blocks,” on the floors of the car in part as a safety element added in the wake of Ayrton Senna's tragic death. They serve a two-fold purpose: First to protect the chassis from damage when the car's floor touches the track surface at high speeds and second, to act as a safety gauge. They can help measure whether the cars are running too low, or too close, to the track surface. 

Article 3.5.9 of the F1 Technical Regulations governs the “Plank Assembly.” Specifically, the section that Hamilton was noted to have violated is Article 3.5.9(e), which reads as follows:

The thickness of the plank assembly measured normal to the lower surface must be 10mm ± 0.2mm and must be uniform when new. A minimum thickness of 9mm will be accepted due to wear, and conformity to this provision will be checked at the peripheries of the designated holes. 

As you can see, the thickness of the plank is required to be 10 millimeters. F1's regulations allow for one millimeter to be worn down throughout a race weekend due to wear and tear. Anything more than that, and the car will have been deemed to violate the Regulations.

Having run afoul of this Regulation, Hamilton has now been disqualified. 

Ferrari released a brief statement, noting that the team “misjudged the consumption by a small margin:”

till, that is not enough to avoid the disqualification.

A walk-in cooler ignited the fire at the Orlando resort, EW has learned.

Disney;Ryan/x

 A large fire broke out Saturday evening at Disney World's Epcot theme park in Orlando with a walk-in cooler igniting inside a backstage area, Entertainment Weekly has learned.


 The cooler was located in Epcot's France area, specifically in an employees-only section not accessible to guests. The device caught on fire and was quickly extinguished before the blaze spread further. No one was injured in the fire.


 Footage from the incident (below), captured by a park guest riding the Skyliner attraction, shows large black smoke billowing up from an area between the Remy's Ratatouille Adventure ride within the park's France pavilion and walkways deeper into the park's Morocco pavilion. ""Oh my God, it's right there!"" says a shocked onlooker in the footage which shows a large cloud of billowing black smoke and a line of orange flames.


 EW has reached out to representatives for the Walt Disney World Resort as well as the Orlando Fire Department for more information.


 Other footage circulating online shows clouds of smoke rising into the sky, visible from the nearby Boardwalk area just outside Epcot's gates.


 The Epcot fire isn't the first major blaze at a Disney parks property. In recent years, the Maleficent dragon figure at California's Disneyland park also caught fire during a Fantasmic! show performance in early 2023, leading to the removal of the pyrotechnic effect later that year.

 Epcot is one of four major theme parks currently operating at Walt Disney World. It opened as the second of the Florida resort's lineup of parks, with the first being Magic Kingdom, which opened in 1971. It was followed by Disney's Hollywood Studios (which opened as the Disney-MGM Studios in 1989) and Animal Kingdom in 1998.

TV shows and movies have pushed boundaries over the years by exploring incest on screen.

The White Lotus is the most recent example, with Patrick Schwarzenegger‘s Saxon and Sam Nivola‘s Lochlan confusing Us with a kiss that should not be taking place between brothers. Luckily, HBO's hit show is known for messing with its audience by throwing out crazy story lines as conversation-starters about bigger topics.

“I think that one of the things that we worked on as a group, as a family, was to try to create that dynamic. The closeness, but the oddness, the weirdness [that] we thought was normal, the older brother to younger brother relationship,” Schwarzenegger told RadioTimes in March 2025. “But I think that Saxon actually really does care about his brother. He cares about his sister. And I think that the relationship with his brother – although it's very odd and weird, which is what [creator] Mike [White] wanted — it's still very loving at the same time.”

Before The White Lotus there was Netflix's Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menéndez Story making headlines for sexually charged moments between a fictional version of real siblings. The series was released in late 2024 and viewers immediately questioned why Monsters was marketing convicted murderers Lyle and Erik Menéndez as sexual partners.



Erik subsequently slammed the show for how it approached their story.

“I believed we had moved beyond the lies and ruinous character portrayals of Lyle, creating a caricature of Lyle rooted in horrible and blatant likes rampant in the show,” read a statement from Erik that was shared on Lyle's Facebook page in September 2024. “I can only believe they were done so on purpose. It is with a heavy heart that I say, I believe Ryan Murphy cannot be this naive and inaccurate about the facts of our lives so as to do this without bad intent.”

Keep scrolling for more instances when TV shows and movies shared incest story lines:


A&E's Bates Motel had five seasons to dig into the origins of Psycho‘s Norman Bates (Freddie Highmore). And there would be no Norman without his mother Norma (Vera Farmiga). Their connection didn't fully cross the line into romantic but the emotional undertones were enough to make Us feel uneasy. By the end of the series, Norma came to realize how dangerous Norman's devotion to her was — but it was ultimately too late.

Game of Thrones' Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and sister Cersei's (Lena Headey) romance walked so House of the Dragon could run. If there was any show that found a way to make the audience root for a love story between an uncle and his niece, it's House of the Dragon. Daemon (Matt Smith) and Rhaenyra's (Emma D'Arcy) chemistry spanned years until they finally got together after crossing paths again when she was an adult.

The 2018 film took a chance on a few changes from Darcey Bell‘s book of the same name. The biggest was Stephanie (Anna Kendrick) admitting that, as a teenager, she had sex with her half-brother, Chris (Dustin Milligan), at her father's funeral. Good thing Blake Lively‘s Emily never let her — or Us — forget it.

Ryan Murphy is no stranger to creating a show that starts a conversation. But Monsters became a pop culture phenomenon in part because of the backlash to scenes between Lyle Menéndez (Nicholas Alexander Chavez) and brother Erik Menéndez (Cooper Koch).

In the first episode, which premiered in 2024, Lyle — who was on drugs — kissed Erik on the lips. The show later featured a sequence where the brothers were seen taking a shower together. (The real Erik and Lyle never claimed to have been involved in a romantic or sexual relationship. Lyle specifically testified at his murder trial in 1994 that he never had a sexual relationship with his brother.)

As soon as Saxon asked Lochlan what porn he was into, the vibes were off in season 3. Then Lochlan watched Saxon walk around their hotel room naked. Then Saxon made it his mission to help his younger brother lose his virginity and it all went downhill from there. The good news? The White Lotus still has time to push the envelope even further.

During the third season of the hit FX series, Jax (Charlie Hunnam) almost slept with Trinity (Zoe Boyle) before finding out that she is his half-sister. Sons of Anarchy narrowly avoided going down the incest rabbit hole, but they were close enough that we are still talking about it.

Holly J. (Charlotte Arnold) wasn't the only one with questions about the twincest kiss heard around the world. Fiona (Annie Clark) caught just about everyone off guard when she pulled brother Declan (Landon Liboiron) in for a kiss. But, it was never explained whether there was actually a plan to touch on that close connection between the siblings.

Sometimes there is no better way to put a stop to a TV couple than by making them first cousins. Take Jess (Zooey Deschanel) and Robby (Nelson Franklin), for example. They were never meant to last while Nick (Jack Johnson) existed, so New Girl took the easy way out by making them related and moving the story along.

Based on V. C. Andrews' book series, Flowers in the Attic, If There Be Thorns and Seeds of Yesterday, the show played with the idea of forbidden romance spanning generations in one family. Kiernan Shipka and Mason Dye kicked it off as siblings Cathy and Christopher, respectively.

While Whitney (Brook Kerr) and Chad (Donn Swaby and Charles Divins) were ultimately not blood relatives, the spiral they went through on the soap opera makes them worthy of being on this list. Whitney was so guilt-ridden about potentially dating her half-brother — with whom she has a child — that she briefly became a nun. Talk about memorable.

Soap opera fans, buckle up! Jack Wagner is still turning heads decades after his General Hospital debut, reminiscing about his legendary run as Frisco Jones and opening up about the grind of being a soap star. Meanwhile, Charles Mesure is saying goodbye to Port Charles after a short but memorable stint, with soap veteran Chris McKenna stepping in to keep the drama going. Chad Duell‘s fiery exit as Michael Corinthos shocked viewers, marking the end of the actor's 14-year journey.

On the flip side, Sebastian Roché teases fans with the possibility of Jerry Jacks making a triumphant (and probably scheming) return, though nothing's set in stone just yet. Lastly, Jonathan Jackson temporarily steps away as Lucky Spencer, leaving fans eager for his quick return while Guy Wilson fills in for some exciting new family drama. The soap world is heating up, and we're here for every twist and turn!

 It's been over 40 years since Jack Wagner made his debut on General Hospital, but soap opera fans still make the actor feel like a fresh-faced young star.  

Charles Mesure is closing the chapter on his time with General Hospital.

Chad Duell‘s exit from General Hospital was shocking, fiery and epic. 

Sebastian Roché hasn't ruled out a General Hospital return just yet. “Never say never,” Roché told Us Weekly exclusively.

onathan Jackson will be missing from General Hospital beginning on Tuesday, February 18, but fans have no reason to fear — Lucky Spencer will be back in Port Charles soon.

The second Formula 1 race of the season is taking place on Sunday (March 23) in Shanghai, China. 

Ahead of the 2025 Formula 1 Heineken Chinese Grand Prix, the drivers, team principals and more took time before the drivers parade to pay tribute to the late Eddie Jordan, who passed away this past week. 

Eddie was a racecar driver before starting his own Formula 1 team, Jordan Grand Prix in 1991, where he gave Michael Schumacher his debut season.

Current F1 drivers, including Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton and reserve driver Zhou Guanyu, Mercedes' George Russell, Alpine's Jack Doohan and more all took a moment prior to the race to honor the late, iconic team owner. 

“We are deeply saddened to hear about the sudden loss of Eddie Jordan,” F1 President and CEO Stefano Domenicali previously shared in a statement. “With his inexhaustible energy he always knew how to make people smile, remaining genuine and brilliant at all times. Eddie has been a protagonist of an era of F1 and he will be deeply missed. In this moment of sorrow, my thoughts and those of the entire Formula 1 family are with his family and loved ones.”

The 2025 Chinese Grand Prix is the second of 24 races this year, with McLaren's Oscar Piastri starting in first, followed by George in second and Lando Norris in third.

Lily Allen is opening up about a decision she made after splitting from her husband David Harbour.

The 39-year-old It's Not Me, It's You singer opened up about her decision on the latest episode of her Miss Me? podcast.

While talking to co-host Miquita Oliver, Lily addressed a recent procedure she had done after her separation from the 49-year-old Stranger Things star after four years of marriage. 

Keep reading to find out more...

“Oh, how do I feel about aging? Well, I just got some additions to the family. I don't know if you've noticed,” she said, referring to her breasts.

Her co-host admitted it wasn't easy to miss the work, after Lily “pulled your f--king top off a month ago and showed them to me quite starkly.”

“I was like, absolutely incredible,” she noted.

“Yeah. They look really incredible when I take my top off and my bra off, but there's definitely a contrast in age between my breasts and my face,"" Lily said.

“I'm like, 40, 18,” she joked, comparing how she looks her age in the face but half her age in her chest. 

She added she “might get the BBL next,"" referring to a Brazilian butt lift procedure.

“I mean, there's a thing that happens a few months after you get them, which is that they drop and fluff,” Lily explained. “So they're still quite high and they're still quite hard. When they drop and fluff, they become like, you know, they feel like normal boobs.” 

“So I haven't got to drop and fluff yet,” she admitted. “I'm very much looking forward to that. But I feel like it's really fun.” 



A post shared by Lily Allen (@lilyallen)

 


Lily says she's also been “buying fancy lingerie that my boobs can actually fit in” and “taking pictures on my phone.”

“Haven't sent them to anyone yet, but, it will hopefully get there at some point,” she joked.

She also addressed some of her own red flag behavior.
