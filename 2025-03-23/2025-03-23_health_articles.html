An inaugural report by the New York City Health Department aimed at cracking down on sky-high prices hospitals charge patients has gaping holes in it because the Big Apple's largest public-employee insurer refuses to turn over records, officials said.

The 263-page report quietly released Friday through the agency's new Office of Healthcare Accountability says hospital prices are wildly inconsistent. The study focused on payments made through the city's health care provider, Anthem Blue Cross, and not private-sector insurance plans.

The city's GHI-Comprehensive Benefits Plan through Anthem paid on average $45,150 for inpatient services last fiscal year at New York's top 10 hospital systems, the report said.

The highest prices for full in-patient treatment were at New York-Presbyterian ($92,727) and Montefiore Medical Center ($83,573), while Stony Brook University Hospital was the lowest ($36,876).

The report noted the city spent $3.3 billion paying for employee hospital care during the fiscal year ending June 30, and half went to three hospital systems: Northwell Health ($759 million), New York-Presbyterian ($485 million) and NYU Langone Health ($443 million).

New York-Presbyterian had the highest prices for 11 of 12 inpatient procedures analyzed and 14 of 27 outpatient procedures, the report said.

Prices at hospital systems ranged widely, from $940 to $12,000 for a colonoscopy, and $7,000 to $58,000 for a cesarean-section delivery.

And the city is now spending more on hospital outpatient care than inpatient.

The report cited Anthem — which the city pays a whopping $3 billion yearly to provide insurance to roughly 900,000 employees — for refusing to provide the OFA the full costs of health care at hospitals and other data it needs to determine whether these prices are warranted.

Anthem claimed releasing some of the pricing data would violate confidentiality agreements it has with hospitals that predate a 2021 federal rule requiring hospitals to disclose their prices to the public.

However, Councilwoman Julie Menin (D-Manhattan), who sponsored legislation creating the first-of-its-kind health care watchdog office in 2023, isn't buying it.

“It's a slap in the face to the City of New York when federal rules require hospital pricing be made public, but Anthem won't comply with city law due to so-called ‘preexisting agreements,'” she said. “This health care industry cat-and-mouse game is costing the city billions, and we need full transparency now.”

“It's so distressing to see these prices,” added Menin. “It's extremely high and is why we need price transparency. Why should New York City be paying so much for health care? It's sickening and unsustainable.”

The city's health care insurance contract is up later this year, and the city “must require full disclosure of pricing” to whoever gets it,” said Menin. Anthem is among the bidders for the new deal.

The Post two years ago reported on analyses by 32BJ SEIU, the city's building-services employee union, showing the Big Apple could save taxpayers as much as $2 billion annually by auditing exactly how much municipal workers pay for care at various hospitals and making recommendations on ways to lower the prices.

Manny Pastreich, president of 32BJ, said his union pushed hard to create the OFA but added it's unfortunate the “inaugural report is more noteworthy for what is missing.”

“It's clear that hospitals and insurers are still exerting their influence to block sharing certain data the city needs to reverse the trend of exorbitant health care costs,” he said.

The OFA was created in large part to offer greater transparency to patients on costs of medical procedures at a private hospital vs. city-run medical facilities as it has the authority to publicly release hospital pricing citywide. It operates with a $2 million budget and 15 staffers.

“Health insurance companies and New York City hospitals must remove arbitrary barriers to data access that would otherwise support transparent and equitable pricing of medical services,” said Henry Garrido, executive director of District Council 37, the city's largest municipal employee union. 

“We must utilize every tool at our disposal to fight these unfair practices, including ensuring the Office of Healthcare Accountability is adequately staffed to fulfill its primary purpose of tackling disparity pricing that exploits the vulnerabilities of New Yorkers in need of care.”

Anthem reps did not immediately return messages.</p>

WADENA — Sen. Amy Klobuchar's team, including Senior Regional Outreach Director Chuck Ackman, and Outreach Director Allie Glass, visited Astera Health on March 5, to engage with health care professionals, and local advocates on critical issues facing seniors. 

The meeting focused on preserving and strengthening programs essential to seniors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the growing need for support systems for caregivers.

Klobuchar, a champion for policies benefiting Minnesota's aging population, emphasized how crucial it is to safeguard and enhance the health care and retirement programs that millions of seniors rely on. 

"We must ensure that Medicare and Medicaid continue to provide quality care to those who have worked hard their whole lives, and we need to address the increasing demands on families who are stepping up to care for elderly loved ones," Klobuchar said in her address via Zoom.

Local health care professionals shared insights into how current policies are impacting care delivery for seniors, as well as the growing strain on caregiving systems. A notable theme throughout the meeting was access to transportation and housing.

Cheri Dodds, community-based services supervisor for Wadena County Human Services, attended the meeting and echoed that transportation is an important piece of helping seniors gain access to the support they need.

“Transportation, as they said in the meeting, there is a huge lack of transportation in our area to get people to medical appointments,” said Dodds, who noted that Friendly Rider is a huge asset to senior residents. “But with senior citizens, and even some people with disabilities, accessing the bus can be difficult." 

Additionally, seniors with health issues need assistance with getting to and from appointments as well as everyday needs such as grocery shopping and yard maintenance and housekeeping, Dodds said.

Wadena County human services provides support and resources for seniors including working with home health providers, clinics, transportation providers, mental health providers to create a supportive environment for seniors. The goal, Dodds said, is to help seniors with a wide range of needs, including housing to transportation.

“We need more individualized transportation services where they can come at an exact time and just serve them individually based on some of their challenges,” said Dodds, who added the lack of supportive services in the community is an obstacle.

As Minnesota's population ages, the conversation about how to best meet the needs of seniors is becoming increasingly urgent, Klobuchar said. She concluded the event with a commitment to continue working in Washington, D.C. to advocate for policies that protect and support seniors and their families.

Today, the Obesity Action Coalition (OAC) and The Obesity Society (TOS) sent a letter to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA), along with more than 20 leading organizations and providers across the healthcare continuum, urging the agency to enforce federal regulations around compounding following the recent resolution of GLP-1 medicine shortages. Among the signatories include: the Alliance for Women's Health & Prevention, the Association of Black Cardiologists, the National Hispanic Medical Association and the National Consumers League. 

The letter follows recent announcements from the FDA that Eli Lilly's tirzepatide, marketed as Zepbound for weight loss and Novo Nordisk's semaglutide, marketed as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss, are no longer in shortage. In addition, a federal court in Texas recently declined to issue an injunction blocking the FDA's tirzepatide decision – underscoring the "ceasing" of all copycats by compounders.  

Following the recent resolution of GLP-1 shortages, we applaud the FDA's clarification issued last week for GLP-1 compounders which indicates that outsourcing facilities making versions of tirzepatide have until March 19 to cease operations. Pharmacies must stop compounding semaglutide by April 22 while larger outsourcing facilities have until May 22, or until the district court rules on a pending injunction in the district court case – what comes first will take precedence. 

The letter also acknowledges that U.S. regulations permit some compounding pharmacies to produce versions of brand-name medications under limited circumstances, including when they are in short supply or where necessary to meet the individualized needs of a specific patient.  However, continued mass-production compounding of GLP-1s, in the absence of a shortage, undermines the regulatory framework designed to protect patients from potential risks associated with unapproved and unregulated drug formulations. 

To address this issue, the signatories urge FDA to take the following action: 

Enforce Existing Regulations: Ensure that compounding pharmacies adhere to federal regulations by discontinuing the production of GLP-1 medications now that the shortage has been resolved. 

Monitor Compliance: Implement measures to monitor and enforce compliance during and after the grace period to prevent unauthorized compounding of these medications. 

Educate Stakeholders: Provide clear guidance to healthcare providers, pharmacists, and patients about the transition back to FDA-approved medications and the importance of obtaining treatments through appropriate channels.  

Enforce Existing Rules Against Misleading Information: Ensure that companies promoting misleading information about compounded GLP-1s are held accountable under existing regulatory authority of the FDA. 

GLP-1 medications have made a transformative impact in the obesity care space. As these medicines continue to grow in popularity, regulatory action and enforcement is critically needed at the state and federal level to ensure that patients have access to safe, FDA-approved treatments."

Joseph Nadglowski, President and CEO of the Obesity Action Coalition

"Now that the GLP-1 shortage is resolved, FDA faces a critical juncture in upholding its commitment to patient safety," said Anthony Comuzzie, PhD, FTOS, CEO of TOS. "Our message is simple – FDA, the time is now to take decisive action by enforcing the existing regulatory framework around compounding."
