Oops, something went wrong

Barry Ritholtz, co-founder and chief investment officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management and a longtime adviser, digs into the things that have made him “less stupid” in his latest book.

"How Not to Invest: The Ideas, Numbers, and Behaviors That Destroy Wealth — and How to Avoid Them" isn't a navel-gazing reveal of his savvy investing philosophy, but rather a playbook on the theme that steering clear of errors is much more important than scoring wins.

I asked Barry to share the mistakes that trip most of us up and what we can do about it. Below are excerpts of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.

Kerry Hannon: Why are most of us better off sticking to a simple investing strategy?

Barry Ritholtz: Historically, simple beats complex. If you're going to make something more complicated, there has to be an absolutely compelling reason. The more complicated things are, there are more things to break. Think about how much money has been attracted to Vanguard and Blackstone's core indexing because it's simple and it works.

What are some of the pitfalls of building long-term wealth?

The biggest single pitfall is our tendency to interfere with the markets' compounding.

When I ask people, what is a thousand dollars invested a century ago worth today? They say, oh, a million dollars, $2 million. When you tell them it's $32 million, their heads explode. It's shocking to people. But that's the power of compounding.

Please try not to get in the way of your own money compounding. It's the single best thing you can do.

What are other common mistakes investors make?

The more active you are, the more transactions you engage in, and the worse you tend to do because you're just creating more opportunities to be wrong.

And we believe a lot of nonsense. Some of it is just myths that get repeated from generation to generation or ping around trading desks. I always laugh whenever I flip on TV and the market is down 2% and someone says, markets hate uncertainty. Do they really? Because there's got to be a buyer and a seller. That means that there's a disagreement as to the value of that asset.

We are wildly overconfident in our abilities to do things that the professionals can't do. You know, no one would say to themselves, yeah, I could play Michael Jordan one-on-one in basketball. Nobody thinks that way.

But when you step into the marketplace, you imagine that you're going to beat the house, that you're going to beat Michael Jordan. But trust me, you're not. Something like half of all the trades are done by institutions — highly qualified, deeply motivated with the latest, greatest, fastest tools. To imagine that you're going to step in and beat them on their home fields is just another mistake.

It's also a mistake to not be selective when you dip into the fire hose of media that comes out about investing. You have to be a little discerning and discriminating. Curate viciously. You have to create your own team of people who you either watch or listen to or read. I don't mean you literally have to hire them, but hey, these are the people who have a defendable process. They've lived through a few cycles. They have a good track record. And it's not just dumb luck.

On my all-star team are Morgan Housel, Jason Zweig, and Sam Ro. They have just consistently added value and been more right than wrong. They don't run around with their hair on fire when we're in the midst of a huge volatility spike.

What are some questions we can ask to avoid a lot of investment mistakes?

Always ask yourself, what are the risks of this trade? Is this tailored to me, or is this for a general audience? What's this going to cost — not just the outright costs, but fees, taxes, and, of course, lost opportunities. And who is giving me this advice?

What's their track record and do they have a conflict of interest? Do they have a fiduciary interest to zealously represent you and to perform their duties with diligence?

They can't guarantee you what the market or the economy's going to do in the future, but can they say to you, this is a reasonable portfolio that is defendable and rational and increases the odds that you'll have a successful outcome down the road?

You quote John Bogle, founder of Vanguard, as saying, “just buy the haystack.” In other words, stick with index funds. Why is that still a great philosophy?

In any given year, a majority of active fund managers underperform their benchmark, say, the S&P 500. Go 10 years and you're in the single digits of managers who earn their keep and outperform the benchmark. Take it to 20 years, and it's virtually nobody. You end up with a handful of outlier names and they become household names because they're unicorns — Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, Bill Miller.

With the indexes, you get diversification especially if you invest in a bunch of different indexes. You are guaranteed to find the Nvidias, the Apples, the Amazons, whatever are the biggest winners. And you get them in increasing stakes as they do better and better.

You say this is the golden age for investors. What do you mean by that?

You can move money around effortlessly. You can trade for free. You can buy anything. Back in the old days, if you wanted to own international stocks, it was expensive.

To say nothing of the power of walking around with this stuff in your phone, it's really amazing. Software and technology give investors tools that are just so simple and so inexpensive and so effective. That's why I call this the golden age of investing. We can do things people dreamed about 25 years ago.

Everybody gets second-by-second, tick-by-tick updates. You want to see how you're doing today, this week, month, year to date, the past 12 months — it's all right there. It's instantaneous.

But please don't look at your portfolio tick by tick. It'll make you crazy.

What is the importance of having a financial plan and working with an adviser?

There are ways to improve your life satisfaction with money. But a lot of people don't go about it that way. One of the ways that helps to get away from the money chase is that when you put a financial plan together, one of the things that ends up coming out of that process is the answer to: What is this money going to? Why do you want to put money in the market?

Maybe you're saving for your kids' college, buying a house, or retirement. Now we know how much risk to take in order to achieve your goals. That draws down stress.

When you put a financial plan together, you take as much risk as necessary, but not more, to achieve your goals. You're working with intentionality, you're working toward a purpose. If you're not saving toward a goal, you end up taking on too much risk. That's how people lose sleep at night.

Having someone to talk you off the ledge and keep you focused on your plan is worth about 2% to 3% a year. That's a huge amount of returns that simply comes about because someone is preventing you from shooting yourself in the foot. And we, as investors, are our own worst enemies. If we can stop our bad behaviors, we're all so much better off.

Oops, something went wrong

The Federal Reserve continued to signal it will cut interest rates two more times this year, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell adopting a perceived dovish stance, a pleasant surprise for investors who came into Wednesday's policy decision with heightened fears over "stagflation" and the possibility of a US recession.

"It's a clearing event," Dennis DeBusschere, president of 22V Research, told Yahoo Finance following the decision. "You didn't get a Fed that was going to accelerate the downside in markets."

One big reason stemmed from the Fed's "base case" that tariff-induced inflation will be "transitory" and have a short-term "one-off" effect on price growth. This was reflected in the central bank's projections, which forecast year-end PCE inflation rising to 2.7% before reaching its 2% target by 2027 — "a relief to investors" who had been bracing for stickier prices, according to DeBusschere.

But some experts warn that "transitory" inflation remains an unrealistic expectation — and that the projections for two rate cuts this year could unravel as the Trump administration continues to flip-flop on trade policy. Powell himself said "there is a level of inertia" to stay consistent with prior forecasts until greater clarity emerges.

"Uncertainty was a highlight of the statement," Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, wrote in response to Wednesday's decision. "Like market participants, the Fed is at a highly uncertain point, and it is in need of time and data to determine the next course of action."

Both consumer and producer inflation showed a deceleration in price growth over the month of February. But details under the surface pointed to a potential stalling out in reaching the Fed's 2% target, with tariffs serving as the greatest threat to Powell's "transitionary" base case.

There are also concerns the Fed may cut rates because of a weakening labor market and slowing economic growth — a move that wouldn't be cheered by investors.

"Everybody wants two cuts, three cuts, four cuts. You don't want any cuts. You want earnings growth. You want a strong economy," Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, told Yahoo Finance on Thursday. "Be careful what you wish for."

Despite a slightly more hawkish tilt from the central bank, with more FOMC members forecasting interest rates to either hold steady or come down by just 0.25% instead of the consensus 0.50%, traders still boosted their own expectations of where interest rates could end the year.

According to the latest data from Bloomberg, markets are now pricing in three cuts instead of two. But Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird, pushed back on reading too far into the projections.

"The 'dot plot' and [the Fed's] projections have not been super reliable over the last five years," Mayfield said, stressing that the uncertainties within the current economic and political environment add another layer of confusion when it comes to future policy.

"When the path forward is so unclear, you just take it with a grain of salt, go back to basics, and focus on the drivers of either the individual equities or the sectors in the market that you own," he said. "In this case, thinking about things like earnings and long rates, rather than what the Fed is doing at the short end of the curve."

Following the Fed's decision on Wednesday, markets experienced what Mayfield described as a "relief rally," citing the lack of downside surprises in the forecasts. But the move higher was short-lived, with all three major indexes slipping into the red the following trading session.

Still, the S&P 500 and Dow were able to eke out gains over the five-day period, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which has struggled as its "Magnificent Seven" leaders fail to deliver outsized returns, ultimately fell short.

"If you're going to really climb your way out of this hole, you need either clarity on the tariffs, which, who knows? Or you need some other sort of nice catalyst," Mayfield said. "That could come in the form of next earnings season, or maybe it's a really strong jobs report that comes out of nowhere."

"For now, we're kind of bouncing around and Powell's presser just wasn't enough to give the market the juice it needed to really get over the hump."

Oops, something went wrong

A fraught word resurfaced in the Federal Reserve's lexicon again this week: "transitory."

It came from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who told reporters Wednesday his "base case" is that higher inflation stemming from President Trump's tariffs will be "transitory" — reviving memories of how central bank policymakers talked about inflation during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Because Fed officials expected pandemic-era inflation to be transitory, they argued there was no reason to raise rates aggressively — an expectation that turned out to be misguided as inflation rose to a four-decade high in 2022. The Fed eventually mounted the most aggressive campaign to bring inflation down since the 1970s.

The new admission from Powell this week sparked questions about whether the central bank will make the same mistake again.

"I would have thought that, particularly after the big policy mistake of earlier this decade and given all the current uncertainties, some Fed officials would show greater humility," Mohamed El-Erian, president of Queens' College and chief economic adviser at Allianz, said on social media.

"It's simply too early to say with any regress of confidence that the inflationary effects will be transitory, especially given that companies and households still have fresh in their minds the recent history of high unanticipated inflation."

To be fair, Powell did qualify his statement. When asked during a press conference following the Fed's interest rate meeting whether he views the impact of tariffs on inflation as transitory, Powell said, "I think that's kind of the base case. But as I said, we really can't know that. We're going to have to see how things actually work out."

Other Fed watchers were more sympathetic, noting that Powell's overall commentary on the topic did, in fact, show some humility about past mistakes.

"I agree the word transitory is probably not ideal given they used it last time," 22V Research president Dennis DeBusschere told Yahoo Finance, but Powell also made it quite clear that Fed officials "weren't sure what was going to happen."

The modern US economy, DeBusschere said, has not been through such an aggressive slate of tariffs before, and therefore stating that inflation could be transitory because of the tariffs "seems like a fair way to think about it."

Powell does have a Trump administration ally in the transitory base-case view: Scott Bessent. In a speech earlier this month, the US Treasury secretary urged the Fed to look at any tariff-related price hikes that way — while also digging the Fed for its handling of inflation during the pandemic.

"I would hope that the failed 'team transitory' could get back together and think that nothing is more transitory than tariffs," Bessent said at the Economic Club of New York on March 6.

On Wednesday, Powell did acknowledge the Fed's past "transitory" faux pas, noting that "we're well aware of what happened, obviously, with the pandemic inflation. In real time, as we know, it's hard to make that judgment."

He also pointed out that the last time the US had tariffs imposed, during Trump's first term last decade, the effects did indeed prove to be temporary.

Back then, he said, "the inflation was transitory."

Powell noted the Fed has to look at the present environment as a "different situation," underscoring that the central bank hasn't gotten back to its 2% inflation goal and consumers aren't in a position to swallow higher prices, as businesses intend to pass on higher prices from tariffs.

Wilmington Trust chief economist Luke Tilley said he is encouraged that the Fed is talking about tariffs as being transitory in terms of inflation.

"They are a one-time increase in the price level of imported goods," Tilley said.

Tilley, however, believes the tariffs could ultimately hurt growth. "Once fully implemented, they amount to a significant tax hike and more likely to weaken consumer spending on all other goods and services."

Matt Luzzetti, chief US economist for Deutsche Bank Securities, noted that even though the central bank textbook suggests the Fed should look through one-time price level shocks such as those driven by tariffs, the reality is more complicated for at least two reasons.

The first, Luzzetti said, is it will be impossible to identify inflation driven by tariffs versus organic price pressures in real time.

If inflation rates for auto repairs and car insurance rise in the coming months, he asked, is that because of ripple effects from duties on steel and aluminum or autos? Or would that represent something more fundamental?

The second reason, he said, is that inflation expectations are not clearly firmly anchored. Most other measures of inflation expectations show heightened uncertainty — something Luzzetti said could be a precursor to higher expectations if inflation stays elevated.

"In short, it is too early to brush aside elevated inflation this year as transitory," Luzzetti said.

Oops, something went wrong

Capping credit card interest rates is starting to look like the hot policy idea of the season for populist lawmakers on both the left and right.

This month, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive star from New York, and Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a MAGA favorite from Florida, teamed up to introduce a bill to limit credit card APRs at 10%. It follows similar legislation from Sens. Bernie Sanders, the independent of Vermont, and Republican Josh Hawley of Missouri, which would put in place the same 10% rate ceiling for five years.

The cost of credit has become a more pressing issue in recent years thanks to rising interest rates, which have helped fuel increasing delinquencies: The average APR was about 21.5% at the end of last year, up from 14.7% in 2020, according to the Federal Reserve.

For now, these bills mostly seem to be political signaling exercises that are unlikely to go anywhere soon. Democrats may also see them as a way of challenging President Trump to make good on his campaign-season promise to pass a credit card cap, an idea mostly embraced by progressives in the past. (In 2019, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez unveiled the Loan Shark Prevention Act, which would have imposed a 15% limit on all interest rates.)

But the bipartisan enthusiasm suggests that limiting what card issuers can charge their customers may have legs down the line. For many voters, it's a pressing pocketbook concern: About half of credit card accounts revolve a balance from month to month, while 13% of cardholders make only the minimum payment due, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

As they've hiked interest rates, credit card companies' margins have hit all-time highs. To some, that's a sign that companies could continue lending profitably to most of their customers even with a rate cap cutting a bit into their profits.

The challenge, as almost any economist will note, is that limiting rates will likely mean less access to credit for Americans with weaker credit scores since lending to them won't be as profitable.

That might be for the best for some households if it saves them from overborrowing. But many could be forced to resort to other, even less affordable types of debt to cover emergency expenses. And even without the aid of a high-APR credit card, some still find ways to make unaffordable purchases on credit, such as through buy now, pay later plans.

The question is how low is too low before restrictions do more harm than good. A 10% rate might be overly strict. But what about a 25% cap? Or 35%?

“At the end of the day, it's a trade-off,” said Breno Braga, an Urban Institute senior fellow who has studied the impact of interest caps. “You want to maximize the number of people that benefit from it and minimize the number of people that suffer from it.”

Usury laws are nothing new. At least 76 countries impose limits on lending rates, according to World Bank researchers, and at least 26 have chosen to place caps on all types of credit. In the US, dozens of states place restrictions on payday lenders, or try to ban them outright.

Studies on the impact of payday loan limits have yielded conflicting results. Some have found that the rules backfire by pushing customers to rely on other, expensive and less regulated types of credit, like bank overdrafts, without improving their overall finances. Others suggest the laws cut back on payday loan use without those drawbacks.

What would happen if the government tried to limit what Visa or Mastercard can charge? In the US, there's at least one recent real-world example we can draw conclusions from: The Military Lending Act, which originally capped the interest rates on payday and other loans for active-duty service members at 36%. In 2015, the law was expanded to cover revolving products like credit cards.

The change had a fairly limited impact on troops' wallets, according to a paper by Braga and his colleagues at Urban. The 36% cap didn't seem to affect credit access for people in the military community who had subprime credit scores, but didn't improve their finances much either, measured by factors like delinquency rates or debts going into collections.

The absolute riskiest borrowers appear to have felt the change more. After the reform passed, people with Vantage credit scores under 500 were less likely to have a credit card and saw their borrowing limits lowered. At the same time, their credit ratings and delinquency rates didn't improve, suggesting the group lost access to credit without much benefit.

One reason the 36% cap might not have had much effect overall is that, during the time period studied, relatively few people had credit cards with an APR above 36%. Today, with rates higher, the impact might be wider.

The cap Ocasio-Cortez and Luna have proposed would certainly bite much harder, and likely cut off access to credit for many millions more. Even among superprime borrowers with credit ratings above 720, average APRs are typically higher than 10%. There's also concern that companies might try to skirt a severe limit by charging new fees, though the bill tries to prohibit that.

Still, it's possible to imagine looser limits making some headway in Washington.

In 2019, for instance, a bipartisan bill that would have extended the Military Lending Act's 36% rate cap to all Americans was nearly reported out of committee but derailed by the pandemic. Politically, a bill like that could one day be ready for a comeback.

Howard Lutnick, the billionaire Secretary of Commerce, is being pummeled online over his comments on Thursday that his 94-year-old mother-in-law would not complain about a missed Social Security check and that someone who would is a "fraudster."

"Let's say Social Security didn't send out their checks this month — my mother-in-law, who's 94, she wouldn't call and complain," Lutnick told All-In Podcast host Chamath Palihapitiya. "A fraudster always makes the loudest noise, screaming, yelling, and complaining."

Based on a fact sheet published by the Social Security Administration, more than 7 million Americans 65 and older receive at least 90% of their income from benefits checks.

Social Security employees have been warning that the Trump administration's plan to cut 7,000 SSA staff will result in delayed benefit checks and could extend the wait time by two to three times.

According to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index, Lutnick's net worth was at least $2.2 billion as of February 2025.

Below are reactions to Lutnick's comments from prominent business leaders, commentators, and political leaders. Howard Lutnick and the Department of Commerce did not respond to requests for comments.

In a post on Bluesky, Cuban reposted a screenshot of a news article about Lutnick's comments on missed Social Security checks and asked, "Has Howard Lutnick done anything of value as Commerce Secretary?"

The reality show billionaire, who identifies as an independent in politics, congratulated Trump for winning the election in November and, in a 2016 interview with Rolling Stone, called his association with the President a "love-hate relationship."

"Social Security is a lifeline to millions of Americans," O'Malley said Friday night on The Rachel Maddow Show. "40% of seniors living alone depend entirely on Social Security to keep themselves out of poverty."

"The cavalier disregard, utter ignorance of how so many Americans live on a day-to-day basis, is stunning, is appalling, and is a cruel-heartedness at the center of our government that we've never seen before," he added.

At the Hands Off Social Security rally in White Plains, New York, where the Trump administration is set to shutter a Social Security office, Weingarten, president of the second largest teacher's labor union, began her speech by vowing that "the people will win" over Elon Musk and Lutnick.

"We didn't vote for Elon Musk to call Social Security a Ponzi scheme," she said. "We didn't vote for Howard Lutnick to say, 'Oh don't worry, no elderly people, including my mother, would care if they don't get their checks from Social Security.'"

In a post on X, Clyburn, representative of South Carolina's 6th congressional district, wrote that "the billionaires in the Trump administration have no idea what it's like to rely on Social Security earned through a lifetime of hard, honest work."

The post also features a now-viral clip of Lutnick's comments on the All-In Podcast, where show hosts Chamath Palihapitiya and David Friedberg did not directly dispute him on the spot.

The longtime MSNBC host played a video of Lutnick's Social Security comments on the All-In Podcast, and said it "is such a political disaster" she almost had to close her eyes because she "can't bear to watch it."

"How does that comport with what you understand of the reality of getting a Social Security check, and who in your life you know gets a Social Security check?" she asked before playing Lutnick's clip for the second time.

According to TV Insider, The Rachel Maddow Show averaged more than 1.7 million total viewers in primetime in January and has remained one of the most popular shows on MSNBC for years.

Schumer reposted Lutnick's now infamous clip from the All-In Podcast on X and called the Secretary of Commerce "an out-of-touch billionaire" who is "clueless or heartless."

"Howard Lutnick does not understand what a missed Social Security check means to a senior on a fixed income," he added.

Schumer has recently faced criticism from Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that he isn't doing enough to fight Republican policies over his decision to vote for the House GOP funding bill to avert a government shutdown.

Collins, the CEO of the satirical news website, posted on Bluesky a hypothetical response from Lutnick to a person in need, in contrast to how he hypothetically would react to an AI defense contractor asking $10 billion.

"80-year-old, starving to death: money? for food please?

lutnick: avast, grifter!

defense contractor who met Peter Thiel once and makes AI bazookas that shoot stray dogs on sight: I need $10 billion... for reasons

lutnick: say less sir, yes sir, right this way sir"

Changes are coming to the student loan system as the Trump administration works to do away with the Department of Education, a move that cannot fully happen without Congress.

However, the White House said on Friday that it is making the move to shift student loans to the Small Business Administration.

"I've decided that the SBA, the Small Business Administration, headed by Kelly Loeffler, a terrific person, will handle all of the student loan portfolio," President Donald Trump said on Friday.

As Trump tries to dismantle the Department of Education, he said he'll shift oversight of $1.7 trillion in federal student loans to the Small Business Administration, which has also just announced it is slashing staff as part of federal workforce reduction efforts.

Approximately 44 million people across the U.S. have some kind of federal student loan.

On Friday, NewsCenter 5 got insight and advice from Betsy Mayotte, the founder of the Institute of Student Loan Advisors, whose life work is to help students and families navigate the system.

Mayotte said her staff is now being bombarded with borrowers seeking help.

"Borrowers need more help, not less," Mayotte said. "The word 'overwhelmed' comes up [from them] all the time."

Mayotte said the staff layoffs at the Department of Education are the biggest hardship for borrowers for now.

She said regardless of the agency overseeing federal loans, the terms of those loans are set by federal statute and will not change. 

Federal loans are largely administered by contracted services and vendors, and those databases won't change either.

"Nobody should be making any panicked decisions about their student loans based on a headline," Mayotte said. "Take a deep breath, see how things play out and you will have time to make decisions because there are no deadlines out there for anything."

However, Mayotte is closely watching how Congress might change the terms for federal borrowing in the future.

"You know, one of the things is reducing the federal student loan funding that's available to families," Mayotte said. "They could cut off parent plus loans altogether, which would mean that lower and middle-class families that need those loans to cover the gap are going to have to look at private loans."

Mayotte said it is smart to stay engaged with what is happening and not to hesitate to reach out to local representatives on Capitol Hill and let them know that loan programs that help families afford college are important.

For more information on student loan advice, Mayotte recommends visiting freestudentloanadvice.org or studentaid.gov.

Guests at Walt Disney World in Florida were caught by surprise on Saturday evening when a fire broke out at the EPCOT park.

Videos shared across social media on Saturday show different angles of black smoke billowing across the sky.

DISNEY SHAREHOLDERS WIDELY REJECT ANTI-DEI PROPOSAL

The blaze started when a walk-in cooler caught fire in a backstage area of the French Pavilion, FOX Business learned. No buildings were damaged due to the fire.

The same official also confirmed that there were evacuations on the Remy's Ratatouille Adventure ride, which is part of EPCOT's World Showcase in its France area.

DISNEY REVEALS DETAILS FOR NEW THEME PARK RIDES BASED ON BELOVED FRANCHISES

Disney World describes Remy's Ratatouille Adventure as a "4D ride experience," where guests can "join Chef Remy on a daring culinary caper that will captivate all your senses as you zip, dash and scurry through the bustling kitchen, dining room and walls of Gusteau's famous Paris restaurant."
