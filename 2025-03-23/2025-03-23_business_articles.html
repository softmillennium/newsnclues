                <p>The UK government is exploring potential adjustments to its digital services tax (DST) to avert further tariffs from the US, Rachel Reeves confirmed.

The DST has raised around £800m a year since its introduction in 2020, targeting global tech heavyweights like Meta, Google and Amazon.

Addressing the situation, Reeves said: “We need to get the balance right. We don’t want British exporters facing higher tariffs.”

She also said that the UK would continue to make sure tech firms pay taxes where they operate, while aiming to maintain fair trade relations with the US.

Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey condemned the idea of hanging UK tax policy to placate Trump.

He warned: “Changing the UK’s tax policy to appease Donald Trump and Elon Musk is a dangerous path.”

Business secretary Jonathan Reynolds has been in Washington this week discussing trade issues, while tech secretary Peter Kyle has also been in the US.</p></b>

                <p>Pete Petersen, 58, has difficulty finding work after being released in a company. Petersen said that his age and salary ideas could make his job search in the employee sector more difficult. Despite savings and severance payments, he cannot yet rest, said Petersen.

This essay is based on a conversation with Pete Petersen, 58, who has been looking for a job since February 2024 after being released from his company. 

I live in Hingham, Massachusetts. I was raised by two parents who grew up in more difficult conditions. I grew up in a lifestyle, which one would probably call a high middle class in a city of the upscale middle class.

I visited the University of Massachusetts and made my bachelor's degree in communication because I wanted to go to the film and television industry. For a long time I worked with people from the industry who lived in tiny apartments in New York City at the age of 35 and hardly got a penny. 

A long career

I started sales at GSK, went from business to shop, spoke to the people in the corridors, spoke to the managers about the design of the expenses and made sure that our products were in stock.

In the early 2000s it was more about data analysis. My boss encouraged me to take a very analytical job. I switched to the care of national customers, in my case to the US pharmacy chain CVS. 

After all, I ended up in a brokerage sales that had worked for regional food chains. That was then dissolved. I switched to a company that produced a cannabis sleeping agent.

Although I was successful in building the company, I talked to an old colleague who was similar who then ended up with a management consultancy and got along well, but he was never as successful as with GSK.

At this stage of my career, I have the feeling that the puzzle part has to be right if you want to hire someone my age. If you set me at the age of 40, it would be like a puzzle with which you take a part and it looks like it would fit and it is close enough.

I am not afraid of technological changes because I grew up at a time when they quickly accomplished. But I have the feeling that after a year I lost the connection without work. Will I go to work and not even recognize what people do? Did it develop so quickly?

The best scenario I have seen is perhaps ten to 15 percent below my previous basic content, but there are places that are 25 to 40 percent below my previous basic content, even more if you look at the overall package.

Age discrimination is real, but it is not about a bunch of people sitting around and saying, 'We don't hire the older ones'. You would like to bring experience to the company, but you weigh all the factors. I think they perceive me as someone who is at the end of his career.

I was very good at dealing with personal finances and saved a good sum of money so that I could survive this special storm. GSK paid me a very good severance payment, so I don't have to worry about things like health care. 

In theory, I could retire in November, but I would live with half of the budget that I hoped for, which would change my lifestyle significantly.</p></b>

                <p>Winner on and off the slopes. So much earnings biathlon world champion Franziska Preuß.

Franziska Preuss won the overall World Cup in the biathlon in a dramatic final on Sunday. It is her greatest triumph to date. Biathlon is the most popular winter sport on TV. Preuss is one of the largest biathlon stars. This also pays off really well for the 31-year-old.


Preuss can easily afford the cover baggage for the trophy cases on the return trip from Oslo. In the best winter of her career, the German biathlete earned around 350,000 euros in prize money alone. There are also income from sponsors and advertising partners. On Sunday exactly you on the legendary stalks in Oslo for the first time the overall World Cup in biathlon.


It was a dramatic final. Before the weekend, Preuss only led 20 points in front of the French Lou JeanMonnot. Preuss won the sprint race on Friday with the wafer-thin lead of 0.2 lowering in front of JeanMonnot. The French woman won the persecution on Saturday and passed Preuss by five points.


Preuss had won 250,000 euros in prize money before Oslo. The overall victory in the World Cup brought her 40,000 euros. In addition, she received 15,000 euros for her two victories in the individual races. The small crystal balls for the World Cups in the disciplines sprint and mass start also won Preus and each received 12,000 euros.


Around 350,000 prize money in one season alone


Preuss also cleared the World Cup in February. She collected four World Cup medals and received 55,000 euros in premiums alone. The highlight was gold in the persecution thanks to a perfect race without shot errors. In general, she is the best in the field with the weapon: 92 percent hit rate is outstanding.


Paired with strong mileage, Preuss can be at the forefront at the end of the long season. It is her big goal. Franziska Preuss earns more than ski jumper


Preuss is currently the top German earner in winter sports and has even received more prize money this year than the best German ski jumper. According to official statistics, Andreas Wellinger is the most financially successful German with a good 155,000 euros this winter, for women it is Selina Friday with just over 80,000 euros.


In the alpine area, Emma Aicher is the only German in the prize money tops with a good 160,000 euros. Overall, alpine stars earn significantly more than biathletes. At the Alpin World Cup in Saalbach there was 61,000 euros for gold, Preuss received 25,000 euros for her World Cup victory and can now be the sixth German overall World Cup winner.


This was last achieved Laura Dahlmeier in 2017. The time of the many diseases is over


A year ago it would have been almost absurd for Preuss to think of this success. She had to end one season early because she was plagued by infections and illnesses. During a winter, she had to expose them several times, foregoing important races at World Championships.


Only an operation of the sinuses finally brought improvement in the spring. "I just realize that there is no stove in the body that limits me," says Preuss: "So I was able to train better overall, with significantly higher sizes, and I feel more resilient."</p></b>

                <p>The DISC model is a personality test for the workplace in which the behavior is divided into four areas.

According to a leading personality test, AI models can have different personalities, including ChatGPT and Gemini, which were tested by a DISC provider.

ChatGPT from Openai is confident and positive, but can also be manipulative if driven to extremes. Google's Gemini is a good listener, but may need encouragement to share its thoughts.

The test was developed by American psychologist William Moulton Marston in the 1920s. He examined human behavior in good intellectual condition with others and their surroundings.

Marston came to the conclusion that human behavior can be divided into four categories: dominance, influence, steadiness, and conscientiousness. The DISC model is attributed to his invention of an early version of the lie detector.

The test has been formalized in assessments used by Fortune 500 companies, government agencies, and universities. Participants answer questions based on statements, such as "I am motivated by performance and authority" or "I am mostly right".

Ultimately, participants are assigned to one of 12 types based on their most dominant properties. Someone who receives a D for dominance could be described as direct and strong-willed.

Someone who receives a DC for Dominance Conscientation may be more meticulous and characterized by critical thinking.

Online Disc Profile conducted reviews of the most popular AI chatbots, including ChatGPT from Openai and Copilot from Microsoft. These models are both classified as Di types (dominance influence).

They are known to be enforceable and result-oriented with a sense of urgency, but can also be manipulative in the worst case.

Google Gemini and China's Deepseek were tested as well and are a combination of S, C, and I, which classify them as "steadiness" types. These types tend to be more stable, stable, and good listeners.

They give others the feeling of being supported but also tend to avoid conflicts.

Some companies may need to consider how the dynamics in the workplace change when employees communicate with AI chatbots alongside their teammates.

Teams may become like managing characters from Star Wars, requiring coordination between different personalities.</p></b>

                <p>James White, a doctor at Duke University in North Carolina, researches how reduced calorie intake can extend life.

He himself reduces calories in his diet in a safe and sustainable way.

In an interview with Business Insider, White explains his routine.

How many calories do I have to take for a long life - and how much sport should I do? James White deals with these questions as a doctor at Duke University in the US state of North Carolina.

If we reduce our calorie intake, this triggers low stress in the body. As a result, some processes are going to remove the markers of aging from our DNA, explains White in an interview with Business Insider.

Research assumes that our cells in old age will work efficiently.

In a study, White and his team found that mice that consumed comparatively 30 to 40 percent fewer calories lived 40 percent longer. This corresponds to a person's life expectancy by another 30 years, says White.

However, such studies are more likely to provide proof of concept for further research than that their results can be transferred to us.

In a separate two-year study, where White also worked, 220 healthy participants who did not suffer from obesity took about 100 to 200 calories a day than they would normally do. Her cardiometabolic health improved - as did the pace of her biological aging. This was measured using markers in the blood, such as the proportion of white blood cells and the change in genes.

However, there is no sufficient evidence that a calorie restriction contributes to the fact that we live longer.

Instead of thinking about how many calories he consumes, White addresses his research results to his life by eating nutritious foods that tend to contain fewer calories. He also tries to keep his sporting routine because he tends to eat healthier when he feels "eating for one purpose".

White told about other lifestyle decisions that he made in the hope of a longer life.

Eat enough calories to keep a "healthy" weight

White does not believe that people have to greatly reduce their calorie intake in order to use the potentially life-prolonging advantages, especially older people who should focus on maintaining muscle mass. Instead, he tries to keep an "healthy" weight in his opinion, in which he has an optimal body composition by not eating too much.

You have to find a secure basic value for your body for calorie consumption, in which you do not increase. If you want to save a few hundred calories every now and then, it is okay," he said, quoting a study published in the magazine Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology in 2019.

It stated that healthy, non-obese participants aged 21 to 50, who restricted their calorie intake by an average of 11.9 percent for two years, rarely had cardiometabolic diseases and better blood pressure values and higher insulin sensitivity.

But you don't have to constantly restrict the calorie intake for years," he said. "Even if you only restrict calorie consumption by a small percentage on a few days a week, health benefits will be shown in our investigations".

It is important to know that calorie-reduced diets are not suitable for people under the age of 18, pregnant women, breastfeeding or people with eating disorders, Katherine Gomez, a registered nutritionist, told BI.

Cardio and strength training

Even a slight increase in physical activity can have "enormous advantages for health and durability", says White.

He trains five or six days a week and does both cardiovascular and strength exercises to maintain the muscles, muscle function and endurance. He lifts weights and goes for 45 minutes for an hour to walk, jog or ride bike.

But there is a lot of literature that says that three times a week is very effective," he says. A meta-analysis of over 30 million people without previous illnesses published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine showed the risk of participants to die from chronic diseases such as cancer and heart diseases.

Eat lean protein and lots of vegetables

White usually focuses on the number of calories he consumes by using calorie measuring apps on his cell phone, and not on what he eats, but he prefers to prefer lean proteins, vegetables and healthy fats.

He also tries to restrict carbohydrates, especially processed, since it is easier to overeat from them.

Stress reduction through more sleep

It is very easy to squeeze into a schedule of working, in which you work constantly, sleep little and feel stressed as a whole," says White.

So he tries to get eight hours of sleep, which helps him to reduce stress, he says.

Sleep and stress are a constant process that you have to listen to your body.</p></b>

                <p>Jigyasa Grover attributes her professional success in AI and technology to Rhonda Byrne's self-help bestseller "The Secret". She read the book in 10th grade.

Grover said that "The Secret" had a "profound influence" on her approach to determining professional goals and overcoming self-doubt. It is not about manifesting things in a magical way, but about developing a strong way of thinking that stimulates action, she said.


Here are three strategies that Grover used from "The Secret" to improve their attitude and achieve great goals on their big tech career.

1. Focus on dreams that are taken far, not just on what seems realistic

Before she read "The Secret", Grover only concentrated on the objective of what appeared to be "realistic". Byrne's book encouraged her to have larger dreams and set goals based on their true wishes, even if they initially appeared far.


In addition to her interest in working with artificial intelligence and machine learning, Grover had another goal of which she believed that she could not achieve it so soon: to write a book.

She began to be a published author with the help of techniques that she had learned from "The Secret" to "really concentrate on her vision". During her daily walks, she often thought about it.


2. Imagine that you have already achieved your goals

Grover explained that an important part of "The Secret" is to imagine that the desired result has already been achieved. "Before every project, I make sure that I firmly believe in my ability to realize the project," she said.

Whenever she offers an opportunity, be it in a fast-moving start-up environment or in a demanding technical environment at Big Tech, she imagines how she does well in this role.


Grover used this method inspired by Secret during the post-acquisition chaos at X, where it worked from 2019 to 2023.

"That was a big challenge: massive layoffs, uncertainty about the future, and important stakeholders were gone, which threatened the entire product roadmap," said Grover. "It was hard to see my talented teammates, so I started to imagine how I would emerge strengthened from this situation."


Grover stayed with X for a few more months after the takeover and experienced most of the layoffs.

"I saw it as an opportunity to lead through changes, to support my team in an incredibly difficult time and to prove my resistance," she said.


3. Go beyond the mere visualization to inspire you

Grover said that the secret to maximize these methods should go beyond the visualization of the desired result.

She recommends believing that you can achieve something and use the visualization as a springboard to work hard, work well with others and maintain a strong vision.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has defended the government’s recent budget decisions, claiming they were necessary for economic stability amid uncertain global conditions.

In an interview with BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday, Reeves emphasised the importance of making difficult choices to ensure long term fiscal responsibility.


“There are always going to be costs for every choice you make, but there are also costs for irresponsibility”, Reeves said, ahead of Wednesday’s Spring statement.


Reeves outlined several achievements stemming from the government’s policies, which she claimed have helped restore confidence in the markets.

These include maintaining non-negotiable fiscal rules, reducing debt as a share of GDP from record levels inherited from the previous government, and the Bank of England’s recent decision to lower interest rates.

The Chancellor also highlighted that wages have risen almost twice the rate of inflation in recent months, benefiting workers across the country.


A major component of Reeves’ plan to reduce government spending is a commitment to cutting civil service costs by 15 per cent by the end of this parliamentary term.</p></b>

Nvidia chips have the names of important mathematicians and scientists. The company has a story in naming products after pioneers from MINT subjects.

Hopper. Blackwell. Ruby. Nvidia is inspired by history when naming his AI chips.

Although other characteristics, such as their computing power or speed, may overshadow the names, their names are a tribute to scientific pioneers.

These are the historical personalities who inspired Nvidia's product names

Grace Hopper was one of the first programmers and developed the first compiler. She also made significant contributions to computer science and mathematics.


David Blackwell was an American mathematician who contributed significantly to the field of probability theory and statistics. He is considered one of the founders of game theory.


Ada Lovelace, often called the world's first programmer, wrote a method for Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, which he called the Analytical Engine. She has been recognized for her work in mathematics and science.


Vera Ruby was an American mathematician who made significant contributions to number theory and algebra. She is also known for being one of the first women to graduate from a doctoral program in mathematics at Harvard University.


Richard Feynman was an American physicist, mathematician, and computer scientist. He made significant contributions to quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and computational complexity theory.</p></b>

                <p>Airbus has a strong aircraft portfolio, but one of its planes has proven to be a commercial flop: the A330-800NEO.

The plane continues to fly, but it has a higher fuel consumption per seat and bears fewer passengers than its sister, the A330-900NEO, which reduces potential profits.

Only three airlines operate the aircraft: Air Greenland, Kuwait Airways, and Uganda Airlines. This year, it will fly to a new city.

From May 18, Uganda Airlines will start A330-800Neo flights between Entebbe and London Gatwick Airport four times a week. The two countries will connect non-stop for the first time since 2015.

This is the first time that London has welcomed the plane since September 2023. People who want to experience the Ultra-Set Airplane can climb it this year in about three dozen cities worldwide.

Data from the aviation analytics company Cirium show that only about 4600 A330-800NEO flights are planned for 2025, around 450 more than 2024.

Kuwait is the largest operator of the aircraft. External content not available.

From November 2024, Nuuk will be a new city for the A330-800NEO. Air Greenland - the smaller operator of the aircraft - started long-haul flights from the country's capital after the airport built a larger runway.

The airline's A330-800NEO route to Reykjavik is also new in 2025, but will only carry out two return flights, one in June and one in August.

The reduced size and supplementary efficiency of the A330-800neo could appear attractive on routes with less demand and a great deal. But the costs per seat are higher because the plane promotes fewer people, while it still bears the same structural components and engines as the A330-900NEO.

The capacity of the A330-900NEO enables more sales potential, especially since the larger cabin can absorb more high-priced business or first class seats.

In addition, the range of the A330-900NEO of 8,300 miles (13,357 kilometers) is already suitable for the needs of the airlines.

                <p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ 5G is currently available from Aldi.

The Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ 5G, which was still available at Aldi until recently, is now sold out at the discounter.


Another dealer now sells it even cheaper-instead of 189 euros as in the Aldi deal, it is already available from 160 euros. The tablet offers 5G, an eleven-inch display, 64 gigabytes of expandable storage space and a persistent 7040 millia amper-hour battery.


In this article we show you the best offers for the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ 5G is currently on offer and introduce you to the tablet.

Are you looking for a affordable tablet with mobile phone? Then you could be interested in Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ 5G, until recently available from Aldi - it is now sold out for the discounter, but it is now even cheaper elsewhere.


We will show you the best offers for the tablet and introduce you to the device.

Also read at Aldi: Here you get the Samsung Galaxy S24 even cheaper

The cheapest provider sells it just from 160 euros, which corresponds to a saving of almost 30 euros compared to the discounter offer.

What does the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ 5G offer?

The tablet can also be worthwhile from a technical point of view. This is primarily due to his 5G mobile phone reception, which enables him to be used without any restrictions even on the go without any restrictions.


A separate SIM card with a mobile phone tariff is required for this, but the option on mobile data alone is a real advantage. This applies in particular to tablets of this price range, which can usually not establish a mobile data connection.

Another advantage of the Samsung Galaxy tablet from the offer is its large eleven-inch display. It offers a resolution of 1920 by 1200 pixels and the good refresh rate 90 Hertz.


The Octa Core processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 695, which is in midfield, ensures the necessary power (which is also fair given the RRP for the A9+ 5G).

One disadvantage is the manageable memory. The tablet comes with only 64 gigabytes of memory. Users who want to save many photos, videos, films, series sequences, songs or podcasts could quickly reach their limits.


Fortunately, the memory can be expanded to up to a terabyte via microSD card.

The Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ 5G does not fall into this category. It is also not a premium tablet like the iPad Pro or the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra, but it is a solid mid-range model with some practical functions.


Above all, this includes 5G connectivity, which enables maximum flexibility. Otherwise, the tablet scores with equipment that should be more than sufficient for most users in everyday life.

As always: only if you want to use the tablet for detailed mobile games, professional image processing and Co. With the A9+ 5G, everyone else makes an excellent choice at a very fair price.</p></b>

                <p>Lane Bess looks back on his two space travels with Blue Origin.

The technologist Lane Bess has been in space twice in the past three years, every time returning with a new awareness of the essentials in life. His first flight took place in December 2021 and his second last February. Every flight only lasted 10 minutes but he says the earth looks completely different when you start and when you land.

He said that every trip has renewed its meaning for the essentials in life. He called for more visionary investments in space technology and research. 

This is a conversation with the veteran of the technology sector Lane Bess. He founded Bess Ventures and is CEO of Deep Instinct, a cyber security company based on Deep Learning.

I have been in space twice in the past three years. Every time I returned with a new awareness of the essentials in life. My first flight took place in December 2021, my second last February. 

Every flight only lasted 10 minutes, but the earth looks completely different when you start and when you land.

This time I came back with some questions about the condition of our world. The war has escalated since my first trip. At that time I thought - and still thinking today - that the only limit for what humanity can achieve is our ability to get along.

What I see instead is a hunger for power, a changed perspective of people on politics and people who jeopardize the founding ideas of our constitutional forefathers for things that only favor one country to another.

US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese head of state Xi Jinping should not be the only three people in the world who have a say in how the rest of humanity lives his life. 

All of this could think that we should look for a different place, because we will screw it up. We won't colonize Mars so soon, but maybe we have to start with it now.

A lifelong curiosity

I have been fascinated by rockets since childhood. Before I was a teenager, I went to the local craft shop -where I had to lie over my age -to buy these model missile engines (which of course were flammable). 

I then shared this passion with my son Cameron, who also accompanied me on my first space.

Years later it was also possible for civilians to fly into space. Fortunately, I had left my former cybersecurity companies Palo Alto Networks and Zscaler with great success at this point, so I could afford to offer an auction for a seat at Blue Origin.

I also dealt with my family office, Bess Ventures, with investments in space technology.

In 2021, shortly before Thanksgiving, the director for the company and civilian sales of Blue Origin contacted me to attend the third flight. In January of this year I was contacted again when a place for the tenth flight was released.

I can't say exactly how much my last trip cost, but it was a millions. It is clear that my five fellow travelers also achieved a good financial result in life.

Richard Scott is a reproduction endocrinologist who sold his company for reproductive medicine, Ivirma, to which private equity company KKR. Elaine Chia Hyde, a physicist, pilot and founder of the media company Chicago Star and the only woman on the trip, had saved it for years to do this.

Before departure, we spent about two and a half days in the classroom. Unlike astronauts who prepare for longer orbital trips, we did not spent time to train in a centrifuge or swim in a tank to understand the weightlessness.

This was more about getting to know the technology behind the rocket so that you know how safe it is. However, you can get out of up to two and a half minutes before pulling the landing bridges.

Before the start, we climb into the capsule of the rocket provided for the crew. You don't feel much in the first five to seven seconds because the engine lights. 

You have earplugs to dampen the sound of the engine, but you still hear a loud knock. Then the capsule is thrown into the air.

In two and a half minutes you cross the Kármán line and realize how thin and fragile the earth's atmosphere is. At that time you are also weightless. I used my GoPro to take the view.

The climb is gentle, but the descent can be bumpy. With such a high gravity acceleration, you are pulled into the seat that you can no longer move - let alone inhale deeply.

After landing, we were received by our families. We won't colonize Mars so soon, but maybe we have to start with it now.

                <p>A Californian law firm sues Apple, claiming the company deceived buyers with promised but not yet delivered AI features.

On Wednesday, the law firm Clarkson submitted to the US district court in San Jose for unfair competition.

According to the collective suit of numerous iPhone 16-owners, customers are disappointed and feel that Apple "exploited consumers' desire for the latest software and functions for artificial intelligence on their telephones" and not delivered all Apple Intelligence tools announced before the iPhone 16 was released.

Apple had advertised its iPhone 16 as the first of its kind that is “built for artificial intelligence” and has been promoting the device with the technology, known as Apple Intelligence.

The company announced at the beginning of the month that Siri's planned AI upgrade should only be there later than expected.

In a commercial from September, the actress Bella Ramsey uses a more personalized Siri version.

The plaintiffs refer to this commercial and say that Apple has "exaggerated the AI ​​skills" and left consumers in the belief that they would buy a device with functions that did not exist or were essentially presented.

Apple demonstrated its Apple Intelligence months before the latest iPhone was published at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June.

At that time, Apple presented an AI-controlled iPhone with tools for writing and editing photos, among other Genai functions that were supposed to appear in autumn.

The company is aiming to equate Google, Meta, and Microsoft with the AI ​​competition and boost iPhone sales.

However, criticism of previous results and questions about future developments are not new.

The analyst Benedict Evans states in a blog post that Apple was always reliable when it came to the launch of upcoming functions.

According to "Bloomberg", there has been a change in staff in the Apple AI department, with Mike Rockwell replacing John Giannandrea as director of Siri development.</p></b>

John Krafcik, der ehemalige CEO von Waymo, erklärte gegenüber Business Insider, dass Waymo im Bereich der Robotertaxis keine Konkurrenten hat.

Der ehemalige Waymo-CEO John Krafcik kritisierte erneut Teslas Kamera-Ansatz für autonomes Fahren und sagte, dass andere Unternehmen in den USA und China noch hinter Waymo zurückliegen.

Im Jahr 2021 bezeichnete John Krafcik Tesla als ernsthaften Konkurrenten im Robotaxi-Wettbewerb.

Vier Jahre später bleibt seine Haltung unverändert.

„Tesla strebt seit fast zehn Jahren an, mit Waymo zu konkurrieren, aber sie tun es immer noch nicht“, sagte Krafcik in einer E-Mail-Korrespondenz mit Business Insider (BI).

Wenn ein Unternehmen ernsthaft ein sicheres und zugängliches Robotaxi-Geschäft aufbauen wollte, dann würde es mit Teslas Kamera-Ansatz scheitern.

Krafcik kritisierte auch die chinesischen Konkurrenten von Waymo.

Trotzdem ist Krafciks positive Perspektive für Waymo positiv.

Der Nordstern für Waymo wird nicht nur ein eigenständiger Fahrdienst sein, sagte Krafcik.

Der Ex-Waymo-CEO fügte hinzu, dass er sich vorstellt, dass das Unternehmen einen Abonnementdienst für einen „garantierten Zugang zum Waymo-Fahrer“ und autonome Fahrsoftware anbieten wird.</p></b>

                <p>M&A is considered the supreme discipline in the financial sector, requiring analytical skills, strategic thinking, and negotiation skills.

Christian Saxenhammer, founder and managing director of M&A-Boutique Saxenhammer, has successfully advised more than 400 transactions.

Success in M&A depends less on numbers alone, but also on soft skills such as empathy and communication skills to successfully complete deals.

"Mergers & Acquisitions" (M&A) is considered the royal discipline in the financial sector due to high-stakes deals, complex negotiations, and direct influence on corporate strategies.

The industry is not a 9-to-5 job; it requires high energy, resilience, and a tireless drive.

To be successful in M&A, one must analyze numbers, convince investors and entrepreneurs, and have strategic thinking, negotiation skills, and entrepreneurship.

In M&A, there are no classic school books that prepare for every situation; theoretical knowledge is important, but the true learning curve begins when dealing with complex transactions.

Finding a mentor or sparring partner early on is crucial to learn from experienced dealmakers and gain technical skills and negotiating expertise.

The best M&A consultants admit mistakes, learn from them, and continuously improve; working with the right people from the start gives a decisive advantage in the long term.

Leading M&A consultancies often recruit students from renowned economic universities such as WHU, Mannheim, HSG, or LSE for coveted internships at investment banks, private equity companies, or M&A boutiques.</p></b>

                <p>Two entrepreneurs from Germany and Great Britain wanted to produce the largest reality TV show ever.

24 candidates from all over the world should compete against each other in global competitions, which winners are shot into space with a rocket.

Also present: prominent partners such as NASA, SpaceX, CBS and Hollywood producers.


But the show was never broadcast. Hundreds of internal documents, exclusive contracts and conversations with insiders show why the project failed and how investors were apparently brought by millions with a network of empty promises.


A British and a German wanted to create a global reality TV show, in which the winner flies into space with a SpaceX rocket.


The seasons should play on all continents and inspire millions of people. To finance this, they collected money from private investors from all over the world.

Including Hollywood sizes and astronauts. They promoted NASA and SpaceX, although they were not allowed in part.

And they caused exclusive TV contracts.


That was the vision of a German entrepreneur and his British business partner. Both planned the most complex TV show for years that should ever be produced.

Also present: prominent partners such as SpaceX, the NASA, CBS, Hollywood producers and space companies from all over the world.

More than two million euros invested private individuals and venture capital providers in the project.

At least seven seasons were planned, the first should start in 2022.


But exclusive research by Business Insider show why the ambitious project failed. It is about empty promises, powerless investors and the disappearance of money in the millions.


We have evaluated hundreds of internal documents, viewed exclusive contracts and spoke to insiders that were deeply involved in the project.

The research draws a picture of two entrepreneurs who wanted to change the TV world, but failed due to their overambitious ideas.</p></b>

                <p>Paul Schockemöhle, a successful German entrepreneur, celebrates his 80th birthday on March 22nd.

He was born in Steinfeld, Lower Saxony, where he grew up at an agricultural business, showing entrepreneurial skills from an early age as a teenager when he began acting with eggs.

Although he started studying business administration, he broke it off after four semesters and founded his own logistics company in 1966, which is now one of the largest freight forwarders in Germany.


His career as a show jumper began in the 1960s, where Shockemöhle developed a place at the top of the international equestrian world and was considered a strategic thinker in the saddle.

He was particularly well-known with his parade horse Deister and dominated international equestrian sports over a decade.


Three European champions in jumping riding (1981, 1983, 1985), Olympic silver 1976 (Montreal), Bronze 1984 (Los Angeles), Six German championship titles, Triple winner of the Aachen Grand Prize are some of his achievements.

After his active riding career, Schockemöhle also became known as a horse dealer and founded several stems in Mühlen (Lower Saxony) and Lewitz (Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania).


Around 7,000 horses are said to be there today. In 2010 he caused a stir internationally: the dressage miracle horse Totilas bought shockemöhle-according to estimates for around 10 million euros.


The breeding licenses were a lucrative business: the top tax was initially 8,,000 euros. The cover tax is the remuneration that the owner of the female horse (mare) pays for the ceiling to the owner of the male horse (stallion).


Shockemöhle was not limited to horses alone. He built up a wide-ranging company portfolio early on, which includes freight forwarders, logistics, feed production, real estate and renewable energies.


The 45th auction in 2024 achieved a total proceeds of almost 20 million euros. Individual horses are said to have reached prices of up to 1.6 million euros.</p></b>

                <p>**The economy is expected to see a growth impulse from infrastructure investments**

Federal states will fully exploit the additional scope for debts of 0.35 percent of GDP from 2026, using a part to increase personnel in education, social affairs or justice.

Infrastructure investments by federal and state governments are assumed to reach around 30 billion euros in 2026 before jumping to 60 billion euros in 2027.

Defense expenditure could climb from the current level of around 1.8 percent of GDP to 3 to 3.5 percent.

The capacity utilization is around 75 percent in industry and even below 70 percent in construction - the lowest level since the financial crisis.

Workers are available, with around 100,000 jobs lost in the processing trade alone and around 30,000 in the construction industry in 2024.

**Growth effect of defense expenditure**

The growth effect of defense expenditure is more difficult to estimate, but most recently around 70 percent of expenditure for weapon systems flowed abroad.

In the future, domestic value creation will increase, with signs that upgrading is more focused on European equipment and forward-looking technologies such as drones, cyber and space security.

**Impact on industry**

The armaments sector can fall back on free capacities of the car industry to expand its production, leading to a chance in the crisis.

In addition to direct demand, defense spending could increase productivity in the civilian private sector through government investments in defense-relevant research and development.

**Need for reforms**

Without offer-side reforms, it is difficult for potential growth to increase well over 1 % in the coming years.

Deep reforms are necessary to bring potential growth back towards two percent, but so far there have been no convincing signals for a "big bang" reform agenda.</p></b>

                <p>Holger Loclair is the long-time managing director and sole owner of the Orafol Group, which has built up the largest family group in East Germany.

The 74-year-old started his career in the GDR as a doctorate in chemists, took over a "state-owned company" (VEB) after the turn.

Orafol today produces adhesive tapes and special foils for traffic signs, the car and aircraft industry, with around 3,000 employees at 30 locations worldwide.


Holger Loclair is the richest East German with an estimated property of 700 million euros.

He comes from Penzin in the Rostock district. In his youth he was a gymnast. He later received his doctorate from the Faculty of Chemical Technology and Process Technology at the Technical University in Szczecin, Poland.


His success story finally began in Oranienburg: In the 1970s, as a chemist, he joined the "VEB special colors Oranienburg" at the time-a so-called "state-owned company" (VEB) in the GDR, which specialized in the production of special colors and self-adhesive reflex films.

Later he became operational director there. After the turn, he ventured the step to the entrepreneur and took over the company. Under the new name "Orafol" he expanded it into an international group.


In 1991 the company was privatized by the trust. Loclair led the privatization of the family business.

Orafol still has its headquarters in Oranienburg. The company produces products that you have all ever seen or even used yourself: namely, among other things, self -adhesive foils that are used for vehicle clees, advertising signs or window decorations.


Many reflective materials for traffic signs, markings on emergency vehicles or safety clothing also come from Orafol.

In addition, the company is developing special adhesive tapes that are used in industry, for example in the automotive or aviation industry.


Loclair's Orafol's turnover in 2024 was 883 million euros - a record year despite the economic crisis.</p></b>

                <p>This question in the interview is a warning signal, says Kristine Capek.

According to the personnel consultant Kristine Capek, the key to a successful job interview in competence-based questions, which enable a precise assessment.

The application process is no longer just about a one-sided assessment - rather about getting to know each other at eye level.

Instead of pushing the applicants into a sales situation, companies should specifically ask about their motivation - for example: "Why did you apply for this position?"

An interview can decide on the professional future - but often these conversations are anything but ideal.

Companies present themselves in detail, applicants lose themselves in irrelevant details, and some questions have a daunting than effective.

As the founder and managing director of the personnel consultancy "Ivies", she has been teaching specialists in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry for over 15 years.

She gives career tips on Tikkok as a "dieheadhunter".

In an interview with Business Insider, she explains what really matters in a successful interview - and what questions should be deterrent.

How does an ideal interview work?

According to Kristine Capek, an ideal interview always starts with small talk.

This creates a pleasant atmosphere and relaxes the situation.

This is followed by a brief introduction to the company and Hiring management.

"But short and concise, because the focus is on the applicant, not the management or the team," emphasizes Capek.

When managers only present themselves for minutes, it is a clear red flag and says a lot about corporate culture.

Instead, the conversation should quickly pass to the applicants - this signal real interest on the part of the company.

The perfect self-presentation in the interview: neither too long nor too short

As an applicant, your self-presentation should take between five and ten minutes.

No less, nothing more.

You should leave out irrelevant details and concentrate on what is really important for the position, the personnel consultant advises.

From the beginning, this creates a targeted connection between your own experience and the new position.

However, reality often looks different.

Capek knows: "Many start with their Abitur - and lose their focus."

Reading I also had over 1000 interviews - this one question should always ask applicants

However, this is not surprising that many companies vote for the first question to applicants very openly.

You would say, for example: "Tell something about yourself."

Instead, companies should target the interview and ask more specific questions.

For example: "Why did you apply for this position? What competencies do you bring with you that enable you for the job?"

The key to a successful interview? Competence-based questions.

Why competence-based questions are the key

For a successful interview, it is crucial that companies define in advance exactly which skills are required for the open position.

"For example, if negotiation skills are required, one could specifically ask for experience with difficult negotiations," explains Capek.

Applicants could specifically explain how they have already used this competence.

As an applicant, on the other hand, you should not only worship past positions.

Focus on the skills and strengths you have developed in previous roles and what added value you could offer in your potentially new role.

This question is a red flag in an interview: "Why should we hire you?"

Not every question in the interview makes sense - some could (and should) even put off applicants according to the expert.

One of them: "Why should we hire them?"

This question is often asked from above, with the unspoken message: convince us first.</p></b>

                <p>Cricket’s biggest show returned this weekend with the 18th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL) getting underway in Kolkata.

And while online betting is restricted in India – to such categories as the lottery and horse racing – there’s a growing international gambling market interested in the Twenty20 league.

Ironically the Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals were once suspended from the competition – in 2016 and 2017 – following a spot-fixing and controversy.

Global betting giant Entain tells City AM that 90 per cent of IPL bets placed in their international markets are in-play, with just 10 per cent wagered pre-match.

Last year’s competition saw the highest average first innings score, 191, with punters often betting at the half-way point.

Andrew Harriott, group head of cricket betting, says: “Generally, the two biggest factors for those looking to bet on cricket are: high run-scoring feats and record-breaking chases.

The betting breakdown

Entain’s Global Sportsbook reveals that 40 per cent of Indian Premier League bets in 2024 went on match betting while nearly 15 per cent went on next over runs, 12 per cent on team runs and eight per cent on player runs. In total 90 per cent of bets happen after the first innings.

The IPL has, too, had three different winners in three years, with the Kolkata Knight Riders, Chennai Super Kings and Gujarat Titans all lifting the trophy.

Their owners were private equity giants CVC Capital Partners but they’ve sold a majority stake to Torrent Group for an estimated $575m, valuing the franchise at over $850m.</p></b>

                <p>The CNBC Magnificent 7 Index, consisting of Apple, Alphabet, Nvidia, Microsoft, Tesla, Meta, and Amazon, is up 43.4% since the beginning of 2024.

Berkshire Hathaway has handily beaten the tech group by three percentage points, climbing a 46.3% gain during the same period. "Believe it or not, you would have been better off buying BRK/B than the Mag 7 to start '24," Chris Verrone said in a note to clients.

That's largely due to Mag 7's dramatic pullback in the new year, falling 13%. The seven stocks are lower in 2025. Berkshire, meanwhile, has rallied more than 15% in 2025, hitting several record highs along the way.

The underperformance of the Mag 7 indicates a shift in market leadership, at least for now, as the questionable macroeconomic environment dents risk appetite. Berkshire fits the bill given its defensive nature and unmatched balance sheet boasting hundreds of billions in cash.

Tesla is the biggest loser in the Mag 7, tumbling nearly 50% just since its record high in December. Even Microsoft, the outperformer in the group, is down 13% from its recent peak. Apple has sold off 14% this year.</p></b>

                <p>A Turkish Court on Sunday Jailed President Tayyip Erdogan's Main Political Rival, Istanbul Major Ekrem Imamoglu, Pending Trial on Graft Charges.

The decision to send imamoglu to jail comes after the main opposition party, European leaders and tens of thousands of protests criticized the actions against him as politicized and undemocratic. 

Imamoglu has denied the charges, calling them "unimaginable accusations and slanders". "I am standing tall, I will never bow down," Imamoglu said on x, calling on supporters not to lose hope. "We will rip away this coup, this dark stain on our democracy all together."

The government denies that investigations are politically motivated and says courts are independent. It has warned against protests, especially given a nationwide ban on street gatherings that was extended on Saturday for four more days.

As the Courtroom Developments Unfolded Early on Sunday, Members of Imamoglu's Republican People's Party (CHP), The Main Opposition Against Erdogan's Ruling Alliance, were preparing to anoint him as its Candidate for the Next Election.

He is the only nominee and Hundreds of People Had Flocked to Poll Stations for the Election to Show Support After the Court Ruling. 

The Court Said Imamoglu, 54, and at Least 20 others were jailed as part of a corruption investigation, one of two that were opened against him last week. In a statement, the court said imamoglu was arrested for "Establishing and Leading a Criminal Organization, Accepting Bribes, Embezzlement, Unlawfully Recording Personal Data, and Rigging Public Tenders in Connection with a Financial Investigation".

Imamoglu is also facing Terrorism Charges, but not formally arrested on those at the same time. A Future Court Ruling to Jail Him Pending Trial on Terrorism-related Charges Could Pave The Way for the Government to Appoint a Trustee to Run the Country's Largest City.

The CHP Said It would file an appeal against the ruling and elect someone to work as acting major. Shortly After the Court Ruling, the Defiant Major Said he would not give up and vowed to Defeat Erdogan, While Saying Those Who Ran the Investigation would be held accountable eventually.</p></b>

Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said he doesn't recall Musk bringing up Social Security with senators during their closed-door meeting last month.

A senior Senate GOP aide echoed Cramer, saying Musk hasn't really addressed Social Security much with senators at all.

Social Security employees who spoke with NBC News expressed concern that the administration will move to privatize Social Security.

One employee said Musk's entitlement rhetoric and the administration's recent moves have them increasingly concerned about privatization or downsizing the workforce.

Another employee noted that wait times are increasing for services, and employees are telling people to try and get any bank information changes in as soon as possible.

This person said elderly Social Security recipients who might not be tech-savvy and live far from a Social Security office will be most affected by the changes.

Nancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, argued that the Trump-Musk moves to slash and overhaul the Social Security Administration can do grave harm to benefits even if Congress doesn't act to change the program.

Altman said giving Musk's "DOGE teenagers and 20-year-olds in control of the Social Security Administration" access to seniors' personal data creates data safety concerns that leave the program vulnerable to hackers and scammers.

She argued that new rules requiring in-person office visits to register could mean that seniors who are disabled or immobile don't end up getting benefits.

At a time of division for Democrats, the battle to prevent Trump and Musk from shrinking the Social Security Administration is a unifying force.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said they're united on protecting Social Security at a press conference Tuesday in Brooklyn.

First-term Rep. Janelle Bynum, D-Ore., who flipped a competitive district last fall, said she's hearing from constituents who are anxious about Social Security changes, office closures and potential impacts to their benefits due to Musk's actions.

Bynum said "it isn't good for my constituents" and that they have an "unelected billionaire trying to cut what we know is an essential program for millions of Americans."</p></b>

                <p>Investors looking for stable income in this shaky backdrop can consider adding stocks of dividend-paying companies to their portfolios.

To that end, the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can inform investors who are on the hunt for the right names.

Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros on TipRanks.


Vitesse Energy

This week's first dividend pick is Vitesse Energy (VTS), a unique energy company that owns financial interests, mainly as a non-operator, in oil and gas wells drilled by leading U.S. operators.

Earlier this month, Vitesse completed the acquisition of Lucero Energy.

The company expects this deal to increase dividends and provide additional liquidity to bolster its ability to make accretive acquisitions.

Recently, Vitesse announced its fourth-quarter results and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.5625 per share, payable on March 31.

This payment marks a 7% rise from the prior quarter.

VTS stock offers a dividend yield of 9.3%.

Following the Q4 print, Jefferies analyst Lloyd Byrne reiterated a buy rating on VTS stock with a price target of $33.


Viper Energy

We move to Viper Energy (VNOM), an oil and gas company that is a subsidiary of Diamondback Energy.

Viper was formed by Diamondback to own, acquire, and exploit oil and natural gas properties in North America.

It is focused on owning and acquiring mineral and royalty interests in oil-weighted basins, mainly the Permian Basin.


ConocoPhillips

Jayaram is also bullish on ConocoPhillips (COP) and reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock but lowered the price target to $115 from $127.</p></b>

                <p>U.S. Republican Senator Steve Daines met Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing with a group of seven American executives on Sunday, following an annual business summit.

Daines was accompanied by Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, Cargill CEO Brian Sikes, Boeing Global Senior Vice President Brendan Nelson, and other executives at Beijing's Great Hall of the People, according to a foreign media pool report.

He lived in Guangzhou and Hong Kong in the 1990s while working as an executive for Proctor & Gamble , which he referenced in his opening speech.

"Collectively, these seven companies have over 275 years of experience of doing business in China," Daines said as he introduced the American CEOs, according to a pool transcript.

"These companies have each been here decades, growing the businesses, contributing significantly to growing the businesses and creating success."

Beijing has been trying to attract foreign investment to offset U.S. tariff pressure and its slowing domestic economy.

The U.S. executives were granted an audience with Li Qiang, who will not meet separately with other foreign CEOs at the China Development Forum for the second year in a row.</p></b>

                <p>The S&P 500 eked out a gain last week after four straight weeks of losses for stocks, but the market correction has sent many investors running for cover in bonds.

The move into bonds is no surprise given the ongoing market volatility and uncertainty over the impact of President Trump's policies on the U.S. and global economy this year. Bond fund inflows of $90 billion in the past month are not far off the $126 billion taken in by equity funds, a "very rare" trend in the ETF world.

Two fixed-income categories that have been big beneficiaries of the flight to safety are actively managed core bond funds and short-duration bond funds, including the shortest of U.S. treasuries, "ultra-shorts." Ultra-short bond ETFs have gained over 40% of all flows into fixed-income ETFs this year.

Actively managed enhanced core bond funds, meanwhile — which seek to outperform the broad corporate bond index, "the AGG" — have taken the lion's share of the new money from investors in their asset class, five times as much as passively managed enhanced core bond index ETF counterparts. Jeffrey Katz, TCW managing director, says the classic diversified stock and bond portfolio was dead for years of the bull market.

But now it seems to be doing its part again, despite all the narrative about yields. During a time of high stock market volatility, "it's performing as it should," Katz said on CNBC.

However, his bet is that investors will do better by not only investing in bonds, but ditching the AGG and allowing an active manager like TCW to find better than index-matching opportunities to generate excess returns. One place the TCW Flexible Income ETF has been attempting to do that is aligned with the AI boom.

The TCW Flexible Income ETF has made bigger bets on residential single family housing market bonds, a market which in undersupplied and where the level of equity built up in the housing stock limits the risk of default. The TCW ETF has also prioritized commercial real estate in what's called the Class A market, with the call of workers back to offices leading the "Park Avenue type" to see a strong rebound.

Katz said the TCW Flexible Income ETF has outperformed the AGG since inception in 2018 by nearly 500 basis points. Alex Morris, chief investment officers at F/m Investments, says bond indices get bloated with tens of thousands of issuances and are un-investable.

The risk that investors take with bond duration increases during times of uncertainty, Morris said. His firm has a focus on shorter duration bonds, such as treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS), which have been "a dirty term for a lot of folks."

However, ultra-short duration TIPS can limit some of the risks that hurt investors in recent inflation history. The new F/m ETF holds TIPS with 13 months or less to maturity and an average duration "well under one year."</p></b>

                <p>Chick-fil-A, known for its straightforward menu of fried chicken and waffle fries, is selling seasonal Pineapple Dragonfruit drinks.

Yum Brands' Taco Bell installed a beverage concept called Live Mas Café inside one of its California locations. McDonald's is in its second year of testing its drinks-focused spinoff, CosMc's.

Fast-food chains are increasingly adding beverage options and widening the number of items within that segment. Refreshers and agua frescas are increasingly showing up on menus, while fast-food chains expand their specialty iced coffee, hot chocolate and energy drink options.


The trend also follows the decadeslong decline in soda consumption since its peak in 2000. "As the consumer moves away from the traditional soda, there's an opportunity for operators and different brands to bring something signature to the table that is more in line with their brand in certain instances, but also an opportunity to potentially charge a little more," said Michael Parlapiano.


Restaurants are hoping hot chocolate and flavored lemonades can help build loyalty with Gen Z consumers. Compared to previous generations, Gen Z is the most open to new flavors and comes from the most diverse backgrounds.

Attracting Gen Z

Monin, a French company best known for its flavored syrups, tapped yuzu, an East Asian citrus fruit, as its flavor of the year for 2025. Traditionally, large fast-food chains are less likely to experiment with such audacious flavors.

Wendy's current lemonade lineup includes blueberry pomegranate and pineapple mango — two choices that have paid off for the burger giant. "Our premium craft lemonades are also incredibly loved by our customers, and this product over-indexes with Hispanic consumers and Gen Z," Wendy's U.S. Chief Marketing Officer Lindsay Radkoski said.

Restaurants have also been inspired to mix different drink trends favored by Gen Z, hoping that the unique mashups will attract adventurous consumers.


The soaring popularity of bubble tea, with its chewy tapioca balls, has inspired restaurant chains to add their own boba-inspired touches to drinks beyond tea. CosMc's, the McDonald's spinoff, offers dried blueberries and fruity popping boba as customizations for some of its drinks.

Shake Shack's tropical kiwi lemonade includes tiny pieces of kiwi inside the drink, adding a new texture and evoking the chewiness of boba pearls, Parlapiano said. While different than a traditional soda, restaurants' foray into drink innovation often means just as much sugar, if not more, depending on the syrups and add-ons.


But that doesn't change Gen Z's appetite for them. "We think of it as 'little treat' culture. What I can spend is in the grand scheme of things, not a huge sum of money, and yes, I can splurge," Taylor Montgomery said.

The CEO of El Pollo Loco stated their desire to innovate their beverages by adding new flavors, such as horchata coffee.


Wendy's also wants more of its customers to order drinks. Roughly 30% of Wendy's customers do not add a beverage to their order, according to a recent investor presentation.

In many cases, beverages generate higher profits and are easier to add to menus than a new food item. While a customer sees a new flavor, for the workers making the drinks, it's just swapping out a syrup flavor or adding a new drizzle on top.</p></b>

                <p>US President Donald Trump, alongside Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent (L) and Secretary of Commerce nominee Howard Lutnick (R), signs an executive order to create a US sovereign wealth fund, in the Oval Office of the White House on February 3, 2025, in Washington, DC.

Donald Trump's re-election in 2024 led many on Wall Street to believe that tax cuts and deregulation would unleash another round of "animal spirits." The prevailing belief was that Trump's aggressive rhetoric on tariffs was primarily a negotiating tactic. However, those who fought through the first Trump trade war knew better - that his tariffs were central to his worldview, aimed at regaining control over the global trading system.

A key moment is approaching: April 2, which Trump has called "the big one" and declared as "Liberation Day in America!!!". On that day, the centerpiece of his America First Trade Policy may begin to take effect. The policy would implement sweeping across-the-board tariffs, expand retaliatory authority, and grant the administration wide latitude to impose punitive trade actions.

The signs suggest that Trump's plan will not be moderated or softened through private conversations or early market signaling. Many continue to hope that figures like Bessent and Lutnick will wake up and moderate the administration's economic approach. However, both have emerged as prominent advocates for Trump's aggressive trade agenda.

In recent appearances on "Meet the Press" and other outlets, Bessent has dismissed concerns about market correction, calling recent pullbacks "healthy". Lutnick has been no less emphatic in his support of the administration's trade policy.</p></b>

                <p>Marriage is one of the most rewarding yet challenging journeys in life.

Many couples believe that as long as they love each other, everything else will fall into place. But love doesn’t automatically solve differences in communication styles, personal values or long-term goals. What truly sustains a marriage is commitment, effort and the willingness to adapt. Love can help keep the spark going, but it's the daily choices that really make a difference.

One of the biggest misconceptions about marriage is that truly compatible people don't argue. But not only is conflict inevitable, it’s also essential. The absence of conflict likely means that important issues are being swept under the rug. And it's not the fighting that damages relationships — it's how couples choose to handle their disagreements.

Many people enter a marriage thinking that their spouse will be their "everything" — their best friend, emotional support system, cheerleader and problem-solver. While it’s natural to lean on each other for support, expecting one person to fulfill your every need is unrealistic. Healthy spouses recognize the importance of individuality.

The honeymoon phase may feel effortless, but over time, life's responsibilities often puts the relationship lower on the priority list. You need to have regular check-ins and planned quality time together. Just as you wouldn’t expect a car to run forever without maintenance, you can’t expect a marriage to thrive without consistent care.

You are both going to change individually.</p></b>

                <p>Xpeng, listed in the U.S. and Hong Kong, has delivered more than 30,000 cars a month since November.

The company last week said it expects that pace to continue for a doubling in sales versus 2024 — and that it will achieve profitability in the fourth quarter.

What's selling is the company's lower-priced Mona M03 and its Xpeng-branded P7+ car, which includes advanced driver-assist software at no extra cost.

With the automaker's plans to upgrade the P7 and release other new cars this year, Bank of America analysts on March 18 said they "expect the strong model pipeline to support Xpeng's strong volume growth in 2025-26."

The analysts raised their price target on the stock to $27, up from $18.60 previously.

That's upside of more than 20% from Thursday's close.

Bank of America rates Xpeng a buy.

Xpeng has "turned around its sales momentum" in the last 12 months thanks to its lower-priced Mona-branded M03 and Xpeng-branded P7+ launches, Barclays analysts said in a Thursday report.

"While the product pipeline looks impressive, needless to say the ultimate customer acceptance of these new models depends on many factors in the highly competitive Chinese EV market," the analysts said.

They raised their price target to $20, from $7 previously, while maintaining an underweight rating.</p></b>

                <p>Oppenheimer's research group has identified top stock ideas expected to outperform over the coming year.

The S&P 500 edged up 0.4% last week, snapping a four-week decline, while the Nasdaq Composite managed a 0.2% advance.

Oppenheimer asked its analysts to choose one stock from within their fields of expertise that they expect to do well.

Each stock was rated "outperform" by the firm, and is described as "a menu, not a portfolio."

Costco has tumbled about 13.3% this month after posting fiscal second-quarter results whose earnings missed analyst estimates.

The weakness hasn't shaken Oppenheimer, which has a price target on the stock that implies 24% potential upside from Friday's close.

Analyst Rupesh Parikh highlighted Costco's "unique and improving consumer value proposition" as a reason to be optimistic.

Shake Shack is another stock that has recently been hit hard, down 17% in March, but remains an Oppenheimer favorite.

The research firm reiterated the burger chain as a "top pick" for this year, staying bullish on Shake Shack's earnings and same store sales growth.

Oppenheimer also recommends AppLovin, whose shares have soared by 337% over the past year but struggled lately.

Analyst Martin Yang wrote that "AppLovin's growing scale and broadening customer base continue to improve its core product performance."

Monolithic Power Systems is set up to outperform its peers with an improving margin profile and accelerating top-line outlook.</p></b>

                <p>Romance novelist Jasmine Guillory always intended to be a lawyer.

After graduating from Wellesley College with a degree in history, she attended Stanford Law School and ultimately worked on securities law and intellectual property.

But when she hit her 30s, Guillory realized she needed a creative outlet.

She decided to try writing a novel because "I have always been a person who loved reading books and loved fiction," she says.

Her first book was written as a hobby, but it took time for her to trust herself enough to submit it for publication.

Guillory tried to get that first book published but couldn't find an agent to take her on.

However, her second book, "The Wedding Date," landed her an agent and got published in 2018.

"Flirting Lessons," out April 8, will be her ninth published work and four of her books have become New York Times bestsellers.

Guillory quit her job as a lawyer in January 2019 to dive into writing full-time.


CNBC Make It: You started writing as a hobby. When did you decide you wanted to try to get that first book published?

I think it just came gradually, I worked on it for so long and I could feel it getting better.

What drew you to romance as a genre?

I went through kind of a difficult period in my life and was reading a lot of books. 

When did you feel like you could leave your career as a lawyer?

I wrote my first three published books while I was working full-time as a lawyer.

My first book deal was a two-book deal, and then my second deal was another two-book deal.

And then I got an offer for another deal that was significantly more than my first two had been.

That was when I knew at least I could afford to stop working full time.


Do you feel like you've made it?

Oh my gosh, no, never. [Laughs]

If you had asked me seven or eight years ago at what point will you have thought you made it, I think I probably would have thought being a full-time writer would have been making it or hitting the New York Times bestseller list would have been making it.

One of the problems with this career — but I think any other — is you're always raising the bar for yourself.


What do you wish more people knew about being a full-time writer?

How up and down the career may be.</p></b>

                <p>Robert Biswas-Diener, a psychologist, is writing a book on listening despite being naturally a huge talker.

Biswas-Diener's upcoming book "Radical Listening: The Art of True Connection" teaches readers to cultivate learnable skills for effective listening.

If you want to sharpen your listening skills, Biswas-Diener provides a three-step guide.

1. Set an intention
A good conversationalist listens to validate the other person's feelings by paying attention to their emotion words and tone of voice.
Knowing and naming the purpose of your conversation beforehand will help you focus on what's important.

2. Observe and notice
Notice what seems important to the other person, such as if they keep circling back to the same point again and again.
This might indicate they don't feel heard.

3. Ask questions</p></b>

                <p>Jason Stevens is used to dealing with travel headaches as the CEO of Wayfairer Travel, which plans luxury vacations for Fortune 500 CEOs and ultra-wealthy clients.

He's helped customers solve problems like finding last-minute access to deluxe ski locales and getting travelers to their African safari after they accidentally boarded the wrong flight. Stevens himself is a seasoned traveler, having been to all seven continents and "most major cities." His experience helps him and his team make sure their clients have the best trip money can buy.

The average cost of a Wayfairer Travel vacation is more than $30,000 — with some vacation packages clocking in at more than $200,000. Stevens says you don't need to be a high-powered CEO to have a great vacation. Instead, he says there are three "common sense" things anyone can do to make sure their next vacation is as good as it can be.

1. Look after your luggage

Packing an extra day or two's worth of clothing in your carry-on can save you a lot of hassle when dealing with lost luggage. Stevens tosses a tracker, like an Apple AirTag, into his checked bag before embarking on a trip. "I often transfer on long-haul flights," he tells CNBC Make It. "I like to know that [my bag] made the first leg and then I can see it being loaded onto the aircraft for the second leg."

In the event that your bag gets lost in the shuffle, having a locator in it can help airline employees track it down. Stevens gave the example of a friend of his whose bag never made it from his connection in Istanbul to his flight to Bangkok. By telling airline workers where to look, he was able to get his belongings faster.

2. Be smart about how you spend

Before going on an international trip, do your homework about whether or not your destination takes U.S. dollars. "You'd be amazed at how many countries still accept U.S. dollars with a big smile on their face," he says. But keep in mind that just because a country accepts your dollars doesn't mean they can provide change.

Don't expect a cabbie in Bangkok to be able to give you change for a $50 or $100 bill on an $8 ride from the airport. If you plan on not using local currency, bring small denominations to make your life easier. Even better, he says, set up a multi-currency card before you leave so that you can pay for everything without worrying about exchange rates or transaction fees.

                <p>Binance CEO Richard Teng was at an event hosted by the Foreign Correspondents Association in Singapore.

Richard Teng says the Trump administration has been a "fantastic" reset for the cryptocurrency industry.

"It's an extremely different environment that we're operating in," Teng told CNBC on Tuesday.

In the span of 16 months, Binance has gone from a political outcast to a possible power broker in Washington.


Binance was slapped with a record $4.3 billion settlement with regulators and forced to oust billionaire founder Changpeng "CZ" Zhao.

Teng's comments come as the crypto exchange is in talks to have the Trump family take a financial stake in the company, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal earlier this month.


Teng was careful with his words when addressing the reports: "I believe both World Liberty Financial as well as CZ himself have tweeted and denied the reports."


He also demurred on the rumors about a Trump stake in Binance.US: ".US and .com are quite different animals, right?"


Binance structured the two exchanges as independent entities in response to regulatory scrutiny, aiming to ring-fence its U.S. operations from the broader international business.


Teng is bullish on what the new political environment means for crypto.

"We went from four years of Operation Choke Point 2.0 to now – you have a very pro-crypto, pro-AI president," he said.

While Binance.com doesn't operate in the U.S., he said, "We have benefited from all these pro-crypto policies."


Teng described a rapid global expansion that brought Binance from 170 million to 265 million users in just one year.


Binance is now licensed in 21 jurisdictions.</p></b>

                <p>The Covid-19 pandemic ushered in a new way of working remotely, but companies are changing their tune.

Staffers across corporate America, from Amazon to Dell to Walmart, as well as federal government workers, have been told that their days of working remotely are over — at least, with that employer. Instead, select employees have been called back into offices five days a week. Those who've come to appreciate the newfound flexibility aren't giving it up easily.

Remote job opportunities are down, but the competition to land one is fierce: Just 20% of LinkedIn postings are for remote or hybrid jobs, but they're getting 60% of applications on the platform. Nearly half of employees who work remotely at least some of the time say they'd be unlikely to stay at their job if they were called back to their offices full time.

Bosses have a few reasons why they'd like to get employees back into offices. One is to make use of expensive corporate real estate, says Kory Kantenga, LinkedIn's head of Americas economist. Some leaders may choose to default to how work has been done in the past and "think that workers are possibly more productive in the office," Kantenga adds.

A 2024 study of S&P 500 firms found businesses were more likely to mandate RTO after their stock prices dipped, hoping that in-office time would spur productivity and therefore boost the bottom line. Certain types of leaders are more likely to want people back in offices, says Mark Ma, an associate business professor at the University of Pittsburgh who led the research.

"We found return-to-office mandates are more likely in firms with male and powerful CEOs," Ma says. "They are used to working in the office for five days a week. And they feel that they are losing control over their employees who are working from home."

It's basic economics: With new job creation and hiring down, employers have more job-seekers than they have open roles, and therefore less incentive to offer perks like flexible work.

Some experts say companies are issuing RTO mandates as a so-called "back channel layoff," where they hope the policy will drive people to quit. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in an employee town hall that this was not the goal of the tech giant's five-day RTO policy after its cloud boss Matt Garman said staffers who don't agree with the rule could leave.

But are in-office workers more engaged and productive? The results are inconclusive. There isn't much firm research as to whether companies with a five-day in-office policy perform better as a business or on the stock market.

"We do find significant evidence that return-to-office mandates hurt employee job satisfaction," Ma says. His research analyzed millions of Glassdoor job reviews among companies that issued RTO mandates. Job satisfaction ratings dropped "significantly." And RTO led to higher turnover among certain staff including women, highly skilled and senior tenured employees — "not the people you want to lose."

Companies with fresh RTO policies also took longer to hire new employees.

Some workers welcome more in-office time, like Clinton Stamper, 29, an Amazon software engineer in Austin, Texas. Like many with desk jobs, he worked entirely remotely for three years during the pandemic, but felt disconnected from his colleagues.

Office workers can also boost local businesses, such as food trucks and laundry services, near corporate buildings.

Professionals may be spending more time in offices today than they did in the last five years, but the spread of remote flexibility has left a permanent mark on the way work gets done.

More than 1 in 4 paid workdays in the U.S. were done from home in 2024, up from just 1 in 14 from pre-pandemic days, according to data from WFH Research.

Most companies with remote and hybrid policies don't intend to change them in the next 12 months, according to new survey findings from Stanford and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.</p></b>

                <p>Pope Francis returned to the Vatican on Sunday after surviving a five-week battle in hospital against double pneumonia.

 
The 88-year-old pope left Rome's Gemelli hospital shortly after noon, accompanied by police vehicles through the city.

 
A car carrying the pontiff made a short detour to take flowers to the Basilica of Saint Mary Major.

 
Pope Francis has been prescribed two months of rest at the Vatican and told to avoid large or stressful meetings.

 
Just before leaving the hospital, Francis smiled and waved at a group of well-wishers gathered outside, using a wheelchair as he has for several years.

 
He spoke briefly with a feeble voice to thank 79-year-old Carmela Vittoria Mancuso in the crowd below.

 
Francis had only been seen by the public once before during his hospital stay, in a photo released last week showing him at prayer in a hospital chapel.

 
The pope was breathing on his own during the public appearance, but used a small hose under his nose for oxygen while traveling.

 
In the moments before the pontiff's appearance, hundreds of well-wishers called out for him, chanting "Francis, Francis, Francis".</p></b>

                <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, speaks at a press event at the site of the first January 6, 2021 break in during the certification of the 2020 election at the Capitol in Washington, DC, on Jan. 6, 2024.

WASHINGTON — A defiant Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer vowed that he won't step aside as the chamber's top Democrat, rejecting calls from some House colleagues and liberal advocates critical of his move to help pass a Republican funding bill.


Schumer told moderator Kristen Welker he knew there "would be a lot of controversy" when he cast his vote to prevent a shutdown. But he maintains that while the GOP's six-month bill was "certainly bad," a shutdown "would be 15 or 20 times worse."


"Under a shutdown, the executive branch has sole power to determine what is 'essential.' And they can determine without any court supervision. The courts have ruled it's solely up to the executive what to shut down," he said, warning that the Trump administration "would eviscerate the federal government."


"On Day 2, they could say, 'Oh, SNAP? Feeding hungry children? Not essential.' On Day 4, 'Mass transit? All transit? Aid to the states? Not essential. We're cutting it.' On Day 6, 'Medicaid? We'll cut that by 20%, 30%, 50%, 80%. We'll go after Social Security. We'll go after the veterans,'" he said.


"Sometimes when you're a leader, you have to do things to avoid a real danger that might come down the curve. And I did it out of pure conviction as to what a leader should do and what the right thing for America and my party was. People disagree."


It's up to Democratic senators to choose their leader, and none of them have called on Schumer to quit a post that he has held for more than eight years. But some have entertained questions about whether it's time for a re-examination.


Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., told a constituent at a town hall last week that "we're going to have future conversations about all the Democratic leadership."


Schumer also rejected comparisons to then-President Joe Biden's refusal to step down as the 2024 nominee, in response to a question about whether he's making the same mistake.


"No, absolutely not. I did this out of conviction. And, look, in my caucus, we have a disagreement as to, you know, some people voted one way, some people voted the other. But we've all agreed to respect each other because each side saw why the other side felt so strongly about it."


He responded to a suggestion from former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., that the Senate Democrats who voted to break a filibuster gave their votes without getting anything.


"What we got, at the end of the day, is avoiding the horror of a shutdown," Schumer said.

Schumer said President Donald Trump has put the U.S. in a constitutional crisis as he escalates attacks on the judiciary and faces allegations from judges that he defied court orders.


"Look, this is an extraordinary moment. It does require extraordinary action. If he defies the Supreme Court, then we are in uncharted territory that we haven't been in for a very long time, and our entire democracy, this whole beautiful enterprise of democracy that we've had for over 240 years, is at risk."


"And look, I believe that if Donald Trump should defy the courts, the public will rise up. Democrats will fight it in every single way," he said.

Schumer also discussed his new book "Antisemitism in America: A Warning" during the interview, saying he wrote it because he's concerned that antisemitism is on the rise again.


"I aimed it at both the hard right, and we've seen how viciously antisemitic they could be, but also at the hard left. I felt, as a progressive, I could talk to them about how some of their anti-Israel activity — I might disagree with it, but they're certainly entitled to do it, and it is not antisemitic."


He said it's "possible" there will be a Jewish president in his lifetime, because "glass ceilings are broken every day."</p></b>
