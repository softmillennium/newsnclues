The UK government is exploring potential adjustments to its digital services tax (DST) to avert further tariffs from the US, Rachel Reeves confirmed. The DST, which targets global tech heavyweights like Meta, Google and Amazon, has raised around £800m a year since its introduction in 2020. We don’t want British exporters facing higher tariffs.” She also said that the UK would continue to make sure tech firms pay taxes where they operate, while aiming to maintain fair trade relations with the US. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey condemned the idea of hanging UK tax policy to placate Trump. Speaking at his party’s spring conference in Harrogate, Davey warned: “Changing the UK’s tax policy to appease Donald Trump and Elon Musk is a dangerous path. Look at what he’s already done with British steel tariffs”. His comments reflect growing concern that Labour’s approach to Trump could undermine the UK’s ability to assert its financial independence. While Labour officials, including Reeves, have not ruled out changing the DST to secure favourable trade terms, the opposition argues that such concessions could lead to long term harm. Business secretary Jonathan Reynolds has been in Washington this week discussing trade issues, while tech secretary Peter Kyle has also been in the US, promoting the UK as a hub for AI investment.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Pete Petersen, 58, has difficulty finding work after being released in a company. Despite savings and severance payments, he cannot yet rest, said Petersen. This essay is based on a conversation with Pete Petersen, 58, who has been looking for a job since February 2024 after being released from his company. Petersen spent a large part of his professional career in the department for consumer goods and health of a pharmaceutical company. He suspects that his age and salary ideas have affected his chances of a job in the area of ​​employees. His statements were revised for reasons of length and clarity. I was raised by two parents who grew up in more difficult conditions. I visited the University of Massachusetts and made my bachelor's degree in communication because I wanted to go to the film and television industry. For a long time I worked with people from the industry who lived in tiny apartments in New York City at the age of 35 and hardly got a penny. I saw all my friends were doing well and how they enjoyed themselves, so I finally moved back to Boston and started a career in sales. I joined the then Smithklin Beecham company, a manufacturer of health products. I came up with the idea that it would take three years, and then I would look for another place to earn my millions. Thirty years later, in 2019, when GSK merged with Pfizer, my career was over there.

In this case, your consent also includes the transmission of certain personal data into third countries, including the USA in accordance with Art 49 Para. Then I headed a team that looked after regional supermarket chains. In the early 2000s it was more about data analysis. My boss encouraged me to take a very analytical job. I went there and fell in love with the work. I was able to lock myself up in the basement for three days and delve into the data to find out how our business developed and where we failed with customers. I was right, and the job cuts came in December 2019. After all, I ended up in a brokerage sales that had worked for regional food chains. I talked to an old colleague who was similar who then ended up with a management consultancy and got along well, but he was never as successful as with GSK. You have to start asking yourself which jobs I can do that correspond to my skills that motivate me to get up in the morning that get my brain going and cover my costs. At this stage of my career, I have the feeling that the puzzle part has to be right if you want to hire someone my age. Will I go to work and not even recognize what people do? The best scenario I have seen is perhaps ten to 15 percent below my previous basic content, but there are places that are 25 to 40 percent below my previous basic content, even more if you look at the overall package. Nevertheless, I applied to some CEOs and companies, but in the end they rejected them. But if you look at someone at my age, you wonder if he will go back to the moment when he builds up a solid network in the area in which he has not yet worked. Age discrimination is real, but it is not about a bunch of people sitting around and saying, 'We don't hire the older ones'. I think they perceive me as someone who is at the end of his career. I was very good at dealing with personal finances and saved a good sum of money so that I could survive this special storm. GSK paid me a very good severance payment, so I don't have to worry about things like health care. But I know that it could be devastating for someone who earns a third or half of what I earn in such a situation. I have made plans all my life and I did the right thing by saving me, and that really thrown me back from this plan.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

So much earnings biathlon world champion Franziska Preuß. It is her greatest triumph to date. Biathlon is the most popular winter sport on TV. Preuss is one of the largest biathlon stars. This also pays off really well for the 31-year-old. Preuss is one of the top earners in winter sports. In the best winter of her career, the German biathlete earned around 350,000 euros in prize money alone. There are also income from sponsors and advertising partners. Even if the 31-year-old from Bavaria is not primarily about money: success in the most popular TV winter sport for Germans has long been worthwhile. Preuss won the sprint race on Friday with the wafer-thin lead of 0.2 lowering in front of JeanMonnot. Preuss had won 250,000 euros in prize money before Oslo. Almost 350,000 euros came together in the season. Preuss also cleared the World Cup in February. She collected four World Cup medals and received 55,000 euros in premiums alone. Preuss is currently the top German earner in winter sports and has even received more prize money this year than the best German ski jumper. According to official statistics, Andreas Wellinger is the most financially successful German with a good 155,000 euros this winter, for women it is Selina Friday with just over 80,000 euros. Overall, alpine stars earn significantly more than biathletes. At the Alpin World Cup in Saalbach there was 61,000 euros for gold, Preuss received 25,000 euros for her World Cup victory and can now be the sixth German overall World Cup winner. A year ago it would have been almost absurd for Preuss to think of this success. During a winter, she had to expose them several times, foregoing important races at World Championships. "I just realize that there is no stove in the body that limits me," says Preuss: "So I was able to train better overall, with significantly higher sizes, and I feel more resilient." She seems inviolable, "JeanMonnot said before the World Cup. Already last year she became behind the Italian Lisa Vittozzi overall second. JeanMonnot won seven times in this World Cup season, Prussia only twice. "We both make a super good season," said Preuss. Now it went out particularly well for Preuss.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.businessinsider.de/wirtschaft/ki-im-persoenlichkeitstest-so-verschieden-ticken-chatgpt-und-gemini/'>AI in the personality test: so differently tick chatt and gemini</a></h2><b>Source:</b> businessinsider&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-23 15:07:11 <p>
According to a leading personality test, AI models can have different personalities. A DISC provider tested the most popular chatbots, including Chatgpt and Gemini. Chatgpt from Openai is confident and positive, but, if you drive it to the top, can also be manipulative. This emerges from the disc, a popular personality test for the workplace that some companies now use to integrate AI models into their workforce. In contrast to his contemporaries Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, who examined people with mental disorders, Marston examined how people interacted in good intellectual condition with others and their surroundings. Marston finally came to the conclusion that human behavior can be divided into four categories and presented the discperteness model in a book in 1928. Disc stands for the English equivalents of dominance, influence, steadiness and conscientiousness. And Marston viewed her as the four "primary emotions" that control human behavior. Since then, Marston's model has been formalized in assessments that are now used by Fortune 500 companies, government agencies and universities. The questions that are often asked in the form of statements are, for example, "I am motivated by performance and authority" or "I am mostly right", and the participants answer, depending on how much they agree. Ultimately, the test participants are assigned to one of 12 types based on their most dominant properties. Someone who receives a D for "dominance" could be described as direct and strong -willed. Someone who receives a DC for "Dominance Conscientation" (dominance and conscientiousness) may be more meticulous and is characterized by critical thinking. You could see chatbots like Chatgpt as a competent but neutral interlocutor for your thoughts. In the worst case, they can also be manipulative. Some companies should consider how the dynamics in the workplace change when employees communicate several hours a week with a supportive but conflict -shy chat bot alongside their teammates. "You have Princess Leia, who leads the rebel command, and she has to do Luke Skywalker together with R2-D2, the robot, along with Han Solo, together with Chewbacca, and then you have C-3PO, another robot, and you all have to coordinate," she said business insider. "This is exactly what we are doing at the moment. Lattice relies on disc as an internal assessment to "reduce conflicts and improve work" Some employees have already trained chatbots on their disc style, says Mollie West Duffy, director of learning and development at Lattice, to BI by email. Managers could possibly receive tailor-made feedback tips based on the disc profiles of their direct employees.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.businessinsider.de/wissenschaft/gesundheit/er-forscht-ob-kalorienreduktion-langlebigkeit-verbessert-seine-diaet/'>He researches whether fewer calories improves longevity - his diet</a></h2><b>Source:</b> businessinsider&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-23 14:29:46 <p>
The doctor James White researches to what extent a reduced calorie intake can extend life. In an interview with Business Insider, White explains his routine. James White deals with these questions as a doctor at Duke University in the US state of North Carolina. If we reduce our calorie intake, this triggers low stress in the body. As a result, some processes are going to remove the markers of aging from our DNA, explains White in an interview with Business Insider. Research assumes that our cells in old age will work efficiently. This corresponds to a person's life expectancy by another 30 years, says White. In a separate two -year study, where White also worked, 220 healthy participants who did not suffer from obesity took about 100 to 200 calories a day than they would normally do. Instead of thinking about how many calories he consumes, White addresses his research results to his life by eating nutritious foods that tend to contain fewer calories. White told about other lifestyle decisions that he made in the hope of a longer life. White does not believe that people have to greatly reduce their calorie intake in order to use the potentially life -prolonging advantages, especially older people who should focus on maintaining muscle mass. Instead, he tries to keep an "healthy" weight in his opinion, in which he has an optimal body composition by not eating too much. If you want to save a few hundred calories every now and then, it is okay," he said, quoting a study published in the magazine Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology in 2019. It stated that healthy, non -obese participants aged 21 to 50, who restricted their calorie intake by an average of 11.9 percent for two years, rarely had cardiometabolic diseases and better blood pressure values ​​and higher insulin sensitivity. "But you don't have to constantly restrict the calorie intake for years," he said. It is important to know that calorie -reduced diets are not suitable for people under the age of 18, pregnant women, breastfeeding or people with eating disorders, Katherine Gomez, a registered nutritionist, told BI. Even a slight increase in physical activity can have "enormous advantages for health and durability", says White. White usually focuses on the number of calories he consumes by using calorie measuring apps on his cell phone, and not on what he eats, but he prefers to prefer lean proteins, vegetables and healthy fats. "It is very easy to squeeze into a schedule of working, in which you work constantly, sleep little and feel stressed as a whole," says White. BI has already reported how a doctor who specializes in anti-aging reduces his stress level every morning.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Grover emphasizes that the combination of visualization with hard work and cooperation leads to success. The 29-year-old Jigyasa Grover completed an internship at Meta and worked for over four years at X as a senior machine learning engineer. She was discontinued as a senior data scientist at the startup Faire in San Francisco before she started her current full -time position as head of AI and research on Bordo Ai. She is also a member of the Developer Advisory Board from Google and AI consultant at Diem. She said that "The Secret" had a "profound influence" on her approach to determining professional goals and overcoming self -doubt. "It is not about manifesting things in a magical way, but about developing a strong way of thinking that stimulates action," said Grover. “The book was particularly helpful because it taught me to set concrete, realistic goals and then implement them Here are three strategies that Grover used from "The Secret" to improve their attitude and achieve great goals on their big tech career. Byrne's book encouraged her to have larger dreams and set goals based on their true wishes, even if they initially appeared far. In addition to her interest in working with artificial intelligence and machine learning, Grover had another goal of which she believed that she could not achieve it so soon: to write a book. In 2019 she began to be a published author with the help of techniques that she had learned from "The Secret" to "really concentrate on her vision". During her daily walks, she often thought about it. "I imagined not only to hold the finished book in my hand, but also to explain complex concepts of machine learning in a clear and understandable way," said Grover. She used this method inspired by Secret during the post-acquisition chaos at X, where it worked from 2019 to 2023. "That was a big challenge: massive layoffs, uncertainty about the future, and important stakeholders were gone, which threatened the entire product roadmap," said Grover. Every evening before going to bed, she takes 15 minutes to distract herself from the work of the day and concentrate on a certain challenge, trying to see the overall picture and imagine what she can do. She writes down three specific technical or creative challenges that she wants to tackle and dismantles the big chunk of work into bite -sized pieces. Then she introduces herself to how it solves every single task, concentrating on the positive effects and celebrating the achievement of every milestone. When doubts sneak in with tricky areas, Grover plans to cope with them the next day and encourages their belief in their focused vision. She recommends believing that you can achieve something and use the visualization as a springboard to work hard, work well with others and maintain a strong vision. "I really believe that the combination of technical expertise and attitude to implement these skills has only made my success possible," said Gover. She believes that "The Secret" has also indirectly contributed to getting her current job. When she applied to Bordo Ai, the company was still in a very early stage of developing a new kind of AI solution. "It helped me to cultivate a way of thinking that made it possible for me to see opportunities where others may see risks," said Grover.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Chancellor defends budget choices and civil service spending cut Chancellor Rachel Reeves has defended the government’s recent budget decisions, claiming they were necessary for economic stability amid uncertain global conditions. In an interview with BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday, Reeves emphasised the importance of making difficult choices to ensure long term fiscal responsibility. “There are always going to be costs for every choice you make, but there are also costs for irresponsibility”, Reeves said, ahead of Wednesday’s Spring statement. These include maintaining non-negotiable fiscal rules, reducing debt as a share of GDP from record levels inherited from the previous government, and the Bank of England’s recent decision to lower interest rates. While acknowledging the need for further action, Reeves said that the government’s focus on stability and reform would bring about growth, without relying on tax hikes. Read more Reeves is gearing up for a blame game A major component of Reeves’ plan to reduce government spending is a commitment to cutting civil service costs by 15 per cent by the end of this parliamentary term, she told the BBC. She outlined how government had increased its administrative and back office functions during the pandemic, but argued that the size of civil service hasn’t been scaled back since. “We want to put more money into things that are important for citizens, and less on things that are just not necessary”.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Only three global airlines will use the 2025 aircraft on a few dozen routes. Airbus has a strong aircraft portfolio and its deliveries regularly exceed Boeing. But one of his planes has proven to be a commercial flop: the Airbus A330-800neo. The plane continues to fly than its sister, the A330-900NEO, but it has a higher fuel consumption per seat and bears fewer passengers-which reduces potential profits. This year it will fly to a new city. From May 18, Uganda Airlines will start A330-800Neo flights between Enebbe and London Gatwick Airport four times a week. People who want to experience the Ultra-Set Airplane can climb it this year in about three dozen cities worldwide.

Kuala Lumpur is a recurring route for Kuwait, which last flew into the city in October 2023.

Kennedy International Airport in New York in October 2023, but has since exchanged the plane for Boeing 777-300. But it was not enough to compensate for the less favorable size and costs. Both will be powered by the next generations of the Rolls Royce Trent 7000 engines, which consume 25 percent less fuel than older A330. However, Garuda Indonesia canceled its purchase agreement for four A330-800NEOS in October and reduced the aircraft's net betting to just eight over eleven years. The A330-900NEO received almost 400 orders in the same period and showed Cirium data that it will carry out around 82,000 planned flights in 2025.

This time I came back with some questions about the condition of our world. The war has escalated since my first trip. At that time I thought - and still thinking today - that the only limit for what humanity can achieve is our ability to get along. What I see instead is a hunger for power, a changed perspective of people on politics and people who jeopardize the founding ideas of our constitutional forefathers for things that only favor one country to another.

Fortunately, I had left my former cybersecurity companies Palo Alto Networks and Zscaler with great success at this point, so I could afford to offer an auction for a seat at Blue Origin.

Before departure, we spent about two and a half days in the classroom. Unlike astronauts who prepare for longer orbital trips, we did not spent time to train in a centrifuge or swim in a tank to understand the weightlessness. This was more about getting to know the technology behind the rocket so that you know how safe it is. However, you can get out of up to two and a half minutes before pulling the landing bridges. With such a high gravity acceleration, you are pulled into the seat that you can no longer move - let alone inhale deeply. After landing, we were received by our families.

In September last year, Apple had advertised his iPhone 16 with a new Siri update. In March, the company admitted delays in the delivery of artificial intelligence (AI) - and is now exposed to a lawsuit. The accusation: Apple made false promises and deceived customers. Unfortunately, this meant that Big Tech promised too much and delivered too little," said Timothy Giordano, partner of the law firm Clarkson, in a statement for business insider (BI). According to the collective suit of numerous iPhone 16-owners, customers are disappointed. Apple "exploited consumers' desire for the latest software and functions for artificial intelligence on their telephones" and not delivered all Apple Intelligence tools that it had announced before the iPhone 16 was released. " Apple advertises with the first AI-iPhone-and remains behind expectations The iPhone 16 product series begins in Germany at 949 euros. In a rare step, however, Apple announced at the beginning of the month that Siri's planned AI upgrade should only be there later than expected. The plaintiffs refer to a commercial from September. In it, the actress Bella Ramsey uses a more personalized Siri version. In addition, it has left consumers in the belief that they would buy a device with functions that did not exist or were essentially presented," says the application. At that time, Apple presented a AI-controlled iPhone with tools for writing and editing photos, among other Genai functions that were supposed to appear in autumn. However, criticism of the previous results and questions about future developments are not new. The analyst Benedict Evans, for example, states in a blog post. In it he writes that Apple was always reliable when it came to the launch of upcoming functions. The company will only present new products if they are also delivered. If Apple had now acted according to this pattern, it would have met its goals and the user could already use the AI ​​today. Apple did not react immediately to our request. Apple could no longer hide because the GEMAI chatbots of the competitors are already in use, he said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Der ehemalige Waymo-CEO John Krafcik sagte Business Insider, dass Waymo derzeit keine Konkurrenten habe. Krafcik sagte auch, dass andere Unternehmen in den USA und China noch hinter Waymo zurückliegen. Er bezeichnete Elon Musks Elektrofahrzeugunternehmen als einen Automobilhersteller mit einem „wirklich guten Fahrerassistenzsystem“. Sie haben noch keine einzige vollständig autonome, umsatzgenerierende Fahrt geliefert, etwas, das Waymo bereits eine Million Mal im Monat tut.“ „Wenn ein Unternehmen ernsthaft ein sicheres und zugängliches Robotaxi-Geschäft aufbauen wollte, würde es nichts wie das Gezeigte aussehen“, sagte Krafcik im BI-Interview nach der Enthüllung des Cybercab im Oktober. „Die Kosten für ein robustes Sensorset, einschließlich Lidar, sind auf einer Pro-Meile-Basis trivial. Ein Sprecher von Tesla antwortete nicht auf eine Anfrage zur Stellungnahme. Er glaubt, dass Waymo im Bereich autonomer Fahrdienste weit voraus ist, auch wenn Unternehmen in den USA und China ihre eigenen Robotaxis einsetzen. Baidus Apollo Go sagte, das Unternehmen habe im vierten Quartal 2024 etwa 1,1 Millionen Fahrten in China gemacht. Zoox, eine Tochtergesellschaft von Amazon, testet weiterhin in San Francisco und Las Vegas. Musk hat ebenfalls versprochen, bis Juni vollständig autonome Fahrten in Austin anzubieten. Waymo sagte, es biete mehr als 200.000 Fahrten pro Woche in seinen Betriebsstädten Los Angeles, Phoenix und San Francisco an. Lest auch Wegen drohender Zölle: Hyundai investiert mehr als 16 Milliarden Euro in Heimatmarkt „Im Moment hat Waymo keine Konkurrenz“, sagte Krafcik, der zuvor auch Hyundai Motor America als CEO leitete. Krafcik sagte, er sei am meisten beeindruckt von Waymos Fortschritten in Bezug auf Skalierung, Sicherheit und Leistung. Deshalb glaubt er, dass Waymo für mindestens die nächsten drei bis fünf Jahre vorne bleiben wird. „Sie sind das einzige Unternehmen weltweit, das erfolgreich einen verkörperten KI-Ersatz für einen lizenzierten menschlichen Fahrer einsetzt, der in jedes Fahrzeug integriert werden kann – und dies in großem Maßstab mit Drittanbieterdaten, die signifikante Leistungs- und Sicherheitsvorteile gegenüber menschlichen Fahrern bestätigen“, sagte Krafcik. Ein Sprecher von Waymo antwortete nicht auf eine Anfrage zur Stellungnahme. Trotzdem, sagte er BI, sei er skeptisch, dass ihre autonomen Fahrer so gut wie die von Waymo seien, da sie es nicht geschafft hätten, einen Robotaxi-Dienst in den USA zu starten. Zum Beispiel wurde Pony.ai, einem chinesischen Startup, im Mai 2022 wegen mehreren Fahrverstößen die Kalifornien-Genehmigung von der Abteilung für Kraftfahrzeuge entzogen. Der Nordstern für Waymo wird nicht nur ein eigenständiger Fahrdienst sein, sagte Krafcik. Der Ex-Waymo-CEO fügte hinzu, dass er sich vorstellt, dass das Unternehmen einen Abonnementdienst für einen „garantierten Zugang zum Waymo-Fahrer“ und autonome Fahrsoftware anbieten wird, die in großen Lastwagen und privaten Fahrzeugen eingesetzt werden kann. Einige Analysten erwarten einen Waymo-Börsengang und eine Abspaltung von Alphabet, da das Geschäft voranschreitet. Krafcik, der Waymos Abspaltung in eine unabhängige Tochtergesellschaft von Alphabet im Jahr 2016 überwachte, sagte: „Es gibt keinen Grund zur Eile.“</p></b><br/><br/></div>

But what does it take to be successful in this demanding industry? In this text, M&A consultant Christian Saxenhammer shares his experiences and gives valuable insights into how you can get started with M&A, which skills really count and how you can secure a place in the leading consulting houses in the long term. M&A is considered the most demanding discipline in the financial sector that not only requires analytical skills, but also strategic thinking and negotiation skills, says Christian Saxenhammer. Success in M&A depends less on numbers alone, but also on soft skills such as empathy and communication skills in order to successfully complete deals. No job for everyone - my entry into M&A At the age of 21 I sold our family business - an experience that not only changed my life, but also revealed my calling. I was confronted early with complex negotiations, strategic decisions and the dynamics of deal making. Success in this area requires much more than analytical excellence. In M&A there are no classic school books that prepare for every situation. It is therefore crucial to find a mentor or sparring partner early, which reports from his own experience. In my career, I benefited enormously from working with experienced dealmakers that not only gave me technical skills, but also the art of negotiating. The best M&A consultants are those who are willing to admit mistakes, learn from them and to continuously improve. The leading M&A consultations often get started through renowned economic universities. WHU, Mannheim, HSG or LSE students have a clear advantage when it comes to securing coveted internships at investment banks, private equity companies or M&A boutiques.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

As a consequence, Deutsche Bank raises its forecast for the German economy from 2026. With additional reforms for competitiveness, Germany can now reach more growth in the long term. Deutsche Bank therefore reduces its growth forecast for 2025 from 0.5 to 0.3 percent. The economy was a little worse through winter than expected.

Union and SPD have agreed in their coalition paper "Our goal is to increase potential growth in Germany to well over one percent." U m The "potential growth noticeably over 1 %" are also necessary in profound structural reforms, The "fiscal stimulus" initially meets a low utilization in industry and construction as well as on the labor market.

This is likely to press the unemployment rate below 6 percent by 2026. The unemployment rate could decrease to 5.5 percent by 2029. Deutsche Bank assumes that the federal states fully exploit the additional scope for debts of 0.35 percent of GDP from 2026. "The federal states will probably use a part to increase personnel in education, social affairs or justice." It will take time for public projects to get into the construction phase.

Here, too, the bank accepts a ketchy plant effect. In the German economy there is scope to accept this demand. In the construction sector, the increasing demand for workers and material in combination with higher interest rates could dampen relaxation. The growth effect of defense expenditure is more difficult to estimate. Most recently, around 70 percent of the expenditure for weapon systems flowed abroad. In the future, domestic value creation will increase.

Today, the armaments sector can fall back on free capacities of the car industry to expand its production. The switch to defense production is also likely to be accompanied by higher orders for the machine and electrical sector. Under the right conditions, they could be crucial for a flourishing technology ecosystem ”. It is difficult to predict whether this will succeed in Germany. Where is the "big bang agenda" for companies? Sustainable turn to more growth is not yet. "Without a offer -side reforms, we think it is difficult that potential growth can increase well over 1 % in the coming years." In order to bring potential growth back towards two percent, deep reforms are necessary.

After his election, Donald Trump told NBC News that "we're not touching Social Security," other than to make it more efficient. But Elon Musk, who now wields enormous power in his role cutting government spending, has recently made comments critical of the program that are coming into conflict with Trump's promise and worrying members of the president's own party. Those concerns have prompted some Trump allies to question whether the billionaire should continue to do so many media interviews, four people familiar with the matter told NBC News. A particularly problematic remark came during Musk's conversation with media personality Joe Rogan in late February, in which he described Social Security as "the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time." A couple of weeks later, the billionaire once again went after Social Security, this time in an interview with Fox Business host Larry Kudlow. Musk pointed to a 2024 report from the Government Accountability Office that estimated the entire federal government could lose between "$233 billion and $521 billion annually to fraud." A Trump adviser acknowledged that they were aware of "outside concern" around Musk's comments. A White House official who, like others in this article, requested anonymity to speak candidly, said they were sympathetic to the views of some Republicans who see Musk's comments on Social Security as potentially problematic and worrying to some senior citizens. "Of course they don't want their Social Security cut," the person said. "So if they hear something on the news that Elon Musk is saying, that we should do something with Social Security — of course there might be some concerns. The White House official said Musk's personal opinions about Social Security have no impact on Trump's policies. "Any American receiving Social Security benefits will continue to receive them," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. "The sole mission of DOGE is to identify waste, fraud, and abuse only … DOGE has already identified billions of dollars in savings for American taxpayers, and President Trump will continue to direct this effort until our government is truly for the people, and by the people." Long known as the "third rail" of American politics, the popular retirement and disability program has now been hit by Musk's downsizing effort as DOGE closes some Social Security offices and curtails telephone services — moves that even Republicans are beginning to push back on. Meanwhile, Democrats are salivating as Musk opens a new political front that pops in their own polling. "It's an earned benefit that people paid into over their entire lives. If Elon and Trump go after it, I promise you this will be their undoing." The Democratic firm Blueprint tested 20 different political messages about Musk, and the four that were most "concerning" to registered voters were all about Social Security. The top two were about Musk's proposals to fire Social Security Administration employees and dismantle phone services. By contrast, voters said the messages least concerning to them were about his personal life, such as Musk fathering children with five different women. He's been so unequivocal about maintaining benefits that even administration officials who would like to retool or cut the program are not challenging his edict. "Even beyond the president, the White House itself has made crystal clear that they're not touching Social Security," one former Trump White House official said. But the former official said Trump may be more amenable to tweaks that can be sold as eliminating waste, fraud and abuse — a sentiment the president hinted at in falsely asserting to a joint session of Congress that millions of dead people are receiving Social Security checks. The billionaire White House adviser has also claimed hundreds of billions of dollars in Social Security payments are being funneled to undocumented immigrants — framing that could appeal to Trump. The Social Security inspector general found that improper payments from fiscal year 2015 to 2022 totaled less than 1% of benefits paid over that time — and most of those were overpayments. The rhetoric has been matched with policy shifts at the agency — even though Trump's pick to serve as commissioner has yet to be confirmed. Leland Dudek, the acting commissioner, recently outlined his vision in a lengthy memo to staff members, talking up exploratory efforts to incorporate artificial intelligence into its phone services and enhance its anti-fraud efforts. The agency is also moving forward with a plan to no longer allow beneficiaries to change their bank information over the phone, necessitating a visit to the office or the creation of an online account — which Social Security employees told NBC News would make it more difficult for some elderly recipients to maintain their benefits. Already, Dudek and the Social Security Administration have had to backtrack on a couple of unpopular decisions after public outcry. Dudek also rescinded and apologized for an order that would have no longer allowed parents in Maine to sign up for their newborns' Social Security numbers at hospitals, instead having them register at federal offices. On Thursday, Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., described the choice to close a Social Security hearing office in his district as "a slap in the face to thousands of my constituents who rely on these services." Other Republicans are publicly warning Musk and DOGE to tread lightly when slashing Social Security employees, as that carries negative impacts for seniors. "First, we are not going to cut Social Security benefits. Yet amid those concerns, Republicans said they did not remember Social Security being a subject of conversation in private meetings with Musk. A senior Senate GOP aide echoed Cramer, saying he did not think Musk "has really addressed Social Security much with senators at all." Social Security employees who spoke with NBC News, meanwhile, said Musk's entitlement rhetoric and the administration's recent moves have them increasingly concerned the administration will move to privatize Social Security. "The stuff that [Musk is] saying is untrue, and he must know that what he's saying is untrue, but he's saying it to move the needle and turn public sentiment against Social Security so that privatization or vastly downsizing the workforce will seem like a good idea," said one employee at the agency, who requested anonymity out of fear of reprisal. A second Social Security employee said wait times are increasing for services, and employees are telling people to try and get any bank information changes in as soon as possible. This person noted that elderly Social Security recipients who might not be tech-savvy and live far from a Social Security office are going to be most affected by the changes. "It's going to prevent people from getting their benefits," this person said, adding that the effort amounts to "a very stealthy, very covert hostile takeover." "What I see happening is that Donald Trump gets the politics, which is why he flooded the swing states with flyers saying he wouldn't cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid," Altman said. Altman said giving Musk's "DOGE teenagers and 20-year-olds in control of the Social Security Administration" access to seniors' personal data creates data safety concerns that leave the program vulnerable to hackers and scammers — "a con artist's dream," she said. She argued that new rules requiring in-person office visits to register could mean that seniors who are disabled or immobile don't end up getting benefits. At a press conference Tuesday in Brooklyn, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., faced questions about his disagreements with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on the GOP funding bill, but he said they're united on protecting Social Security. First-term Rep. Janelle Bynum, D-Ore., who flipped a competitive district last fall, said she's hearing from constituents who are anxious about Social Security changes, office closures and potential impacts to their benefits due to Musk's actions.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Uncertainty over the economy and tariff wars have been fueling volatility in the stock market, but dividend-paying stocks can offer investors some stability. Investors looking for stable income in this shaky backdrop can consider adding stocks of dividend-paying companies to their portfolios. Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros on TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first dividend pick is Vitesse Energy (VTS), a unique energy company that owns financial interests, mainly as a non-operator, in oil and gas wells drilled by leading U.S. operators. Earlier this month, Vitesse completed the acquisition of Lucero Energy. Recently, Vitesse announced its fourth-quarter results and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.5625 per share, payable on March 31. This payment marks a 7% rise from the prior quarter. Following the Q4 print, Jefferies analyst Lloyd Byrne reiterated a buy rating on VTS stock with a price target of $33. He added that management aims to keep the dividend coverage ratio at about 1.0x. Byrne views the Lucero deal positively, as it is accretive to Vitesse's earnings, dividend, free cash flow, and net asset value. "While the deal is a departure from VTS's non-op strategy, adding an operated leg gives VTS incremental control over its capital and potential additional deal flow," said Byrne. We move to Viper Energy (VNOM), an oil and gas company that is a subsidiary of Diamondback Energy (FANG). Recently, JPMorgan analyst Arun Jayaram reiterated a buy rating on VNOM stock but lowered the price target to $51 from $56 as part of an update to his firm's exploration and production models. The update reflected natural gas supply-demand analysis, stronger than expected LNG (liquified natural gas) demand-pull and the possibility of further decline in oil prices. Explaining his bullish stance on VNOM stock, Jayaram said that mineral companies like Viper own the perpetual royalty interests under oil and gas leasehold, which gives them exposure to growth with no capital or operating expenses. The analyst highlighted Viper's policy of returning about 75% of all distributable cash flow to shareholders through base and variable dividends and share buybacks. Jayaram thinks that Viper is unique due to its relationship with Diamondback Energy. Notably, Diamondback operates a major portion of Viper's acreage, which gives visibility and reduces a key uncertainty that is usually associated with companies in the minerals space. "In Viper's case, between EBITDA growth and FCF yield, we see an attractive total return proposition," the analyst said. Jayaram is also bullish on ConocoPhillips (COP) and reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock but lowered the price target to $115 from $127 as part of his update to his firm's exploration and production models. Jayaram noted multiple counter-cyclical transactions executed by COP that have lowered its cost of supply and significantly enhanced the durability of the company's "Lower 48" inventory, bolstering its balance sheet and portfolio optionality to LNG. Jayaram added that on a normalized basis, ConocoPhillips' corporate break-even would be at the low-end of the peer group, given that it has much lower sustaining capital requirements than its peers. He expects ConocoPhillips to be one the few exploration and production companies in JPMorgan's coverage that could increase their cash return in 2025, including stock buybacks of $6 billion. "We view COP as a core E&P holding given its portfolio strength, inventory durability, and shareholder friendly cash return framework," said Jayaram.

Chinese Premier Li Qiang (R) greets Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla from a delegation led by US Senator Steve Daines before a meeting held in the Fujian Room at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 23, 2025. U.S. Republican Senator Steve Daines met Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing with a group of seven American executives on Sunday, following an annual business summit in the Chinese capital attended by top foreign CEOs. Daines was accompanied by Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, Cargill CEO Brian Sikes, Boeing Global Senior Vice President Brendan Nelson, and other executives at Beijing's Great Hall of the People, according to a foreign media pool report. Daines' trip marks the first time a U.S. politician has visited China since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January. Beijing is seeking high-level dialogue with the new administration, with hopes of reaching a deal to avert further tariff pressure from Washington. Daines, a staunch supporter of Trump and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was heavily involved in negotiations over U.S.-China trade during Trump's first term, and has made multiple trips to China as a senator. "Collectively, these seven companies have over 275 years of experience of doing business in China," Daines said as he introduced the American CEOs, according to a pool transcript. "These companies have each been here decades, growing the businesses, contributing significantly to growing the businesses and creating success." The U.S. executives were granted an audience with Li Qiang, who will not meet separately with other foreign CEOs at the China Development Forum for the second year in a row. The annual closed-door meeting with the premier was traditionally viewed as a summit highlight by foreign CEOs, who saw it as an opportunity to air their concerns.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The S&P 500 eked out a gain last week after four straight weeks of losses for stocks, but the market correction has sent many investors running for cover in bonds. Two fixed-income categories that have been big beneficiaries of the flight to safety are actively managed core bond funds and short-duration bond funds, including the shortest of U.S. treasuries, "ultra-shorts." Actively managed enhanced core bond funds, meanwhile — which seek to outperform the broad corporate bond index, "the AGG " — have taken the lion's share of the new money from investors in their asset class, five times as much as passively managed enhanced core bond index ETF counterparts, according to ETFaction. But Jeffrey Katz, TCW managing director, says the "60-40 portfolio" — 60% stocks and 40% bonds — "is doing its part" again, and that's despite all the narrative about yields. But his bet is that investors will do better by not only investing in bonds, but ditching the AGG and allowing an active manager like TCW to find better than index-matching opportunities to generate excess returns. One place the TCW Flexible Income ETF has been attempting to do that is aligned with the AI boom, where $35 billion in bonds have been issued to fund the construction of AI data centers. "We have a pretty strong secular tailwind from the AI boom, in addition to some of the cloud storage demand," Katz said. "Data centers are a new phenomenon, two years of issuance related to AI and the big demand for cloud computing and computing power," he said. But Katz said the active approach has been paying off for investors in bonds as active managers can deviate from an outdated AGG approach to bond market representation, with as much as $26 trillion in bond market opportunities that the AGG never touches. "The indices are old and they don't represent how we trade today," said Alex Morris, chief investment officers at F/m Investments. "It's been three decades," he said on "ETF Edge." Investors are skittish on stocks but have too much sitting in cash, Morris said, with over $7 trillion in money market funds and over $18 trillion sitting in bank deposits, "not even CDs, just deposit accounts," he said. F/m Investments offer access to short-duration treasury bonds, such as its TBIL ETF , and recently launched an ultra-short ETF, the Ultrashort Treasury Inflation-Protected Security ETF, focused on treasury-inflation protected securities, otherwise known as "TIPS." The risk that investors take with bond duration increases during times of uncertainty, Morris said, and may not deliver the safety that investors are seeking from fixed-income, one reason his firm has a focus on shorter duration bonds. Policies such as tariffs are inherently inflationary, Morris said, "until they become depressionary." "They can just destroy growth in a way we don't want to think about," he added. As investors become more concerned about inflation — inflation expectations have been rising again, though the Fed said last week it expects any tariffs impact to be "transitory" — "we like staying short and liquid," Morris said. That means treasury issues no longer in duration than two-year and five-year bonds, where "you don't have to worry about aging out and not trading well." TIPS, he says, became "a dirty term for a lot of folks," but ultra-short duration TIPS are not an area of the bond market that has been represented in the bond fund space and can limit some of the risks that hurt investors in recent inflation history, Morris said. The new F/m ETF holds TIPS with 13 months or less to maturity, and an average duration "well under one year," according to the firm.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/23/fast-food-chains-fun-flavored-drinks.html'>Why it suddenly feels like every fast-food restaurant has fun, flavored drinks</a></h2><b>Source:</b> cnbc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-23 00:00:00 <p>
Fast-food chains are going all in on fun beverages to attract younger consumers. Chick-fil-A, known for its straightforward menu of fried chicken and waffle fries, is selling seasonal Pineapple Dragonfruit drinks. Yum Brands' Taco Bell installed a beverage concept called Live Mas Café inside one of its California locations. Fast-food chains are increasingly adding beverage options and widening the number of items within that segment. Refreshers and agua frescas are increasingly showing up on menus, while fast-food chains expand their specialty iced coffee, hot chocolate and energy drink options, according to market research firm Datassential. Plus, consumers have embraced buying drinks beyond coffee, such as bubble tea and "dirty soda," the Utah trend of adding syrups, creamers and juice to soda that has spread nationwide. Beverage chains Swig, 7 Brew Drive Thru Coffee and Gong Cha are among the 10 fastest-growing quick-service restaurant chains by sales, according to restaurant market research firm Technomic. "As the consumer moves away from the traditional soda, there's an opportunity for operators and different brands to bring something signature to the table that is more in line with their brand in certain instances, but also an opportunity to potentially charge a little more," said Michael Parlapiano, managing director of the Culinary Edge, a consulting firm that has helped Noodles & Company , McDonald's and First Watch on menu offerings. Restaurants are hoping hot chocolate and flavored lemonades can help build loyalty with Gen Z consumers. Traditionally, large fast-food chains are less likely to experiment with such audacious flavors, but even they have stepped outside of their comfort zones. "Our premium craft lemonades are also incredibly loved by our customers, and this product over-indexes with Hispanic consumers and Gen Z," Wendy's U.S. Chief Marketing Officer Lindsay Radkoski said at a recent investor event. An exterior view of a Wendy's fast-food restaurant in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, on May 19, 2024. Restaurants have also been inspired to mix different drink trends favored by Gen Z, hoping that the unique mashups will attract adventurous consumers. For example, the soaring popularity of bubble tea, with its chewy tapioca balls, has inspired restaurant chains to add their own boba-inspired touches to drinks beyond tea. CosMc's, the McDonald's spinoff, offers dried blueberries and fruity popping boba as customizations for some of its drinks. Shake Shack's tropical kiwi lemonade includes tiny pieces of kiwi inside the drink, adding a new texture and evoking the chewiness of boba pearls, Parlapiano said. While different than a traditional soda, restaurants' foray into drink innovation often means just as much sugar, if not more, depending on the syrups and add-ons. What I can spend is in the grand scheme of things, not a huge sum of money, and yes, I can splurge on this big sugary drink," said Claire Conaghan, trendologist and associate director for Datassential. The Sour Cherry Energy Burst drink at CosMc's has fruity boba. "We recognize that it's not just about carbonated sodas anymore," El Pollo Loco CEO Liz Williams told CNBC. "So we did a deep dive in beverage innovation this year." El Pollo Loco's expanded drink offerings now include more flavors of its Aguas Frescas, which are fruit-infused waters. Future drink innovation could mean following the mashup trend, such as selling horchata coffee, Williams said. "This is an opportunity for growth when these are highly profitable," Wendy's U.S. President Abigail Pringle told analysts. "Our next horizon of growth at breakfast is in beverages," Radkoski said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Nowhere has this been more evident than in the weeks following Donald Trump's 2024 re-election, when many on Wall Street embraced the idea that tax cuts, deregulation, and Trump's focus on stock market performance would unleash another round of so-called "animal spirits." At that time, the mood was exuberant and very few voices urged caution. Instead, the prevailing belief was that Trump's aggressive rhetoric on tariffs and his promise to upend the global trading system were primarily negotiating tactics — a maximalist stance aimed at securing "better deals" for the U.S., although few could articulate anything specific about those deals while still insisting that this was Trump's approach. Those of us in Washington who fought through the bruising first Trump trade war knew better. They are, and have always been, central to his worldview, in which tariffs are instruments to regain control over a global trading system that he feels have disadvantaged America. This time around, as early evidence has shown, he intends to go much further than in 2018. One key moment is fast approaching: April 2, a date Trump himself has called "the big one" and in a Truth Social post on Wednesday declared as "Liberation Day in America!!!" On that day, there is a strong likelihood that the centerpiece of his America First Trade Policy, outlined in an executive order signed on his first day back in office, will begin to take effect. It's a serious escalation, and yet, there remains a sense among many market participants that this, too, will be moderated or softened through private conversations or early market signaling. Instead, both Bessent and Lutnick have emerged as prominent advocates for Trump's aggressive trade agenda, unapologetically supporting all of the early tariff actions. They are surely likely to support the April 2 tariff rollout, and explain away the likely fiscal contraction and broader economic realignment, even as markets continue to wobble. In recent appearances on "Meet the Press" and other outlets, Bessent has dismissed concerns about market correction, calling recent pullbacks "healthy" and reiterating the administration's commitment to its course.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Marriage is one of the most rewarding yet challenging journeys in life. While we often enter it with high expectations, the reality is that marriage is a lifelong learning process. As a psychologist who studies couples every day, I’ve worked with many people who only come to understand the toughest marriage lessons after they’ve experienced conflict, disappointment or a even divorce. If you can accept these five hard truths about marriage now, you're more likely to have a happy and successful relationship: Love alone isn't enough to hold a marriage together. But love doesn’t automatically solve differences in communication styles, personal values or long-term goals. What truly sustains a marriage is commitment, effort and the willingness to adapt. How do you show up for each other? These are the questions that determine how strong your marriage really is. One of the biggest misconceptions about marriage is that truly compatible people don't argue. But not only is conflict inevitable, it’s also essential. Healthy conflict can bring partners closer by opening the door to deep, meaningful conversations about wants and needs, which can then lead to problem-solving. Create a safe space where you can both be honest and open without judgment. While it’s natural to lean on each other for support, expecting one person to fulfill your every need is unrealistic. That means maintaining individual interests, friendships and goals. Nurturing a strong sense of self outside of the marriage helps prevent resentment and keeps the relationship from feeling suffocating. Always remember that a thriving relationship is built on two whole, complementary individuals — not two halves trying to complete each other. Many couples underestimate how much work it takes to have a healthy marriage. You need to have regular check-ins and planned quality time together. Just as you wouldn’t expect a car to run forever without maintenance, you can’t expect a marriage to thrive without consistent care.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Xpeng , listed in the U.S. and Hong Kong, has delivered more than 30,000 cars a month since November. The company last week said it expects that pace to continue for a doubling in sales versus 2024 — and that it will achieve profitability in the fourth quarter. What's selling is the company's lower-priced Mona M03 and its Xpeng-branded P7+ car, which includes advanced driver-assist software at no extra cost. The electric car company's shares have pulled back slightly after briefly doubling in price on a year-to-date basis earlier this month. Xpeng has "turned around its sales momentum" in the last 12 months thanks to its lower-priced Mona-branded M03 and Xpeng-branded P7+ launches, Barclays analysts said in a Thursday report. They raised their price target to $20, from $7 previously, while maintaining an underweight rating. The price target increases come as industry giant BYD last week announced ultra-fast charging technology, on top of its launch in February of driver-assist systems for a range of its cars — signaling the once niche feature is going mainstream. The "Chinese market is [at] an autonomous driving turning point," said Shay Natarajan, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity fund that invests in transportation. She pointed out that electric car companies in China are offering not only basic driver-assist known as L2, but moving on to more autonomous features known as L3. "What this means for automakers who don't offer free L2 autonomy in China today (like Tesla), is that they will most likely start to offer L2 autonomy for free and start to release and charge fees for L3 autonomy features in the [near] future," she said. A version of Xpeng's more advanced driver-assist system for navigating city streets is also coming for the Mona brand as a higher-end "Max" version of the M03 is due for release in May, Xpeng management said in an earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript. "Consensus 2025 earnings for Xpeng have been raised by 10% in the past one month and our forecasts remain above the street," J.P. Morgan Asia Pacific autos analysts said in a report Wednesday. "We revise our forecasts to reflect stronger sales volume but higher R & D expense as well as more conservative pricing," the analysts said.

Oppenheimer's research group has a fresh list of top stock ideas that it expects to outperform over the coming year based on each company's fundamentals and "in the context of current market conditions." It's getting harder for investors to find upward momentum as stocks pull back amid trade and tariff tensions, recession fears and a shrinking market for technology shares. The S & P 500 edged up 0.4% last week, snapping a four-week decline. Against this backdrop, Oppenheimer asked its analysts to choose one stock from within their fields of expertise that they expect to do well, with each one rated outperform by the firm. Take a look at some of the names below: Costco has tumbled about 13.3% this month after the wholesale retailer posted fiscal second-quarter results whose earnings missed analyst estimates while revenue topped expectations thanks to rising same-store sales. "We look very favorably upon COST's [long-term] prospects," analyst Rupesh Parikh said about the wholesale club. The research firm reiterated the burger chain as a "top pick" for this year, staying bullish on Shake Shack's earnings and same store sales growth. "We believe new management's strategy remains a key catalyst for a brand with unused sales/margin levers," analysts Mike Tamas and Brian Bittner said of Shake Shack, whose shares have tumbled 30% in 2025. The latest retreat could serve as an opportunity to buy the shares, with analyst Martin Yang writing that "AppLovin's growing scale and broadening customer base continue to improve its core product performance, which will accelerate its market penetration and [market] share gain." Monolithic, one of the company's semiconductor favorites, is set up to outperform its peers with "both an improving margin profile and an accelerating top-line outlook," according to the Wall Street investment bank.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Romance novelist Jasmine Guillory always intended to be a lawyer. After graduating from Wellesley College with a degree in history, she attended Stanford Law School and ultimately worked on securities law and intellectual property. "I have always been a person who loved reading books and loved fiction," she says, so she decided to try writing a novel. "Flirting Lessons," out April 8, will be her ninth published work and four of her books have become New York Times bestsellers. Guillory quit her job as a lawyer in January 2019 to dive into writing full-time. Here's how she built her career as an author. CNBC Make It: You started writing as a hobby. I knew it wasn't good at the beginning. I think that was the biggest step was trusting myself when I read it and when I compared it to other books and feeling like this could be good enough. What drew you to romance as a genre? I went through kind of a difficult period in my life and was reading a lot of books. I discovered that romance novels are really great during hard times because going in, no matter what happens in this book, it's going to be a happy ending. And I sort of thought, this seems like it would be fun to write. And then I got an offer for another deal that was significantly more than my first two had been. I am, as many lawyers are, conservative at heart. So, I'm never sure that this is forever. But at least for now, I can afford to keep doing this. [Laughs] If you had asked me seven or eight years ago at what point will you have thought you made it, I think I probably would have thought being a full-time writer would have been making it or hitting the New York Times bestseller list would have been making it. One of the problems with this career — but I think any other — is you're always raising the bar for yourself. What do you wish more people knew about being a full-time writer? How up and down the career may be. There are years where it feels like everything's going great, and then there are years where it doesn't feel like that. So many people who are full-time writers, other people see us as having made it, and we see ourselves as still clawing our way up. What would you like to achieve down the line? That's the thing that I have to always hold onto is the rest of this is nothing I can control, but the writing is something that I can. I never started doing this in order to make a career out of it.

When psychologist Robert Biswas-Diener told his friends he was writing a book on listening, they were confused. In Biswas-Diener's upcoming book "Radical Listening: The Art of True Connection," which he co-authored with positive psychology professor Christian van Nieuwerburgh, he wants to teach readers that just because a skill isn't second-nature, doesn't mean you can't cultivate it. "Listening is just full of really learnable skills," he says. After all, listening is a great tool for influencing people, navigating conflict, and soothing relationship skirmishes. If you want to sharpen your listening skills, here is a three-step guide to get you started. A good conversationalist doesn't listen to one-up the other person, compare experiences, or give advice. Instead, they listen to validate the other person's feelings. If they keep circling back to the same point again and again that might tell you they don't feel heard. "They need to keep bringing it up or they need to keep processing it," Biswas-Diener says. The good news is most people are pretty good at observing their surroundings, he says: "Humans are naturally geared towards noticing, whether you think you're a good listener or not."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The S & P 500 and Nasdaq each head into Monday's trading session with their first positive week in five under their belts — thanks to a late push higher Friday. It's no wonder March has been such a terrible month, with consumer confidence in the economy dwindling on uncertainty related to President Donald Trump 's tariffs and aggressive federal government downsizing. The Dow has not ventured into correction territory yet, finishing Friday down almost 7% from its all-time high close on Dec. 4 . The big market event last week came Wednesday when the Federal Reserve opted to hold interest rates steady, preferring to wait and see how Trump's policies would affect economic growth and inflation. The dot plots, however, showed an increasing number of members expect zero to one cut this year. That's the deadline Trump set for imposing reciprocal levies on a wider range of U.S. trading partners and ending tariff exemptions on select Canadian and Mexican imports. Last week also featured Nvidia 's highly anticipated annual product showcase event, GTC, and what CEO Jensen Huang told Jim Cramer about the stock. He also threw in some unexpected good news — announcing Nvidia Dynamo software; picking a name, Feynman, for the next big thing after Vera Rubin; and unveiling a slew of partnerships, including one with General Motors on self-driving cars. In a CNBC interview Wednesday, Jensen told Jim that he does not expect tariffs to hurt business and investors should stop worrying about that. The back-and-forth stock market this week, with no help from a fairly neutral S & P Short Range Oscillator , yielded only one trade this week following the prior week's buying spree when the market was oversold. On Wednesday, we added to our Goldman Sachs position. We took the other side of an Oppenheimer downgrade to hold. We think Goldman's stock decline since its February highs reflects that disappointment, which is starting to thaw. Jim added Dell is "exceptional" and said he would be a buyer if not for how poorly tech names are trading in the current market environment. February's personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index is expected to show a 0.3% month-over-month gain and a 2.5% year-over-year gain, according to FactSet. Lately, the concern that Trump's tariffs could be inflationary has added another wrinkle, though Fed Chair Powell said this past Wednesday that their impact could be transitory. The week also is set to bring two more looks at consumer sentiment, which has shown more pessimism in recent surveys and contributed to Wall Street's worries about a slowdown in the economy. On Tuesday morning, the Conference Board is slated to release its March consumer confidence index. The other closely followed survey of consumer attitudes is conducted by the University of Michigan, which on Friday posts its final March survey. The preliminary data out on March 14 showed sentiment at its lowest since November 2022 and inflation expectations at their highest since November 2022. Earnings : It's a pretty light week on the corporate calendar, with no Club holdings set to report, attend industry conferences, or hold annual meetings. The first of these reports is KB Home on Monday night. There are a few housing releases next week — new and pending home sales on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively — but as Jim often preaches, the ability of companies to provide real-time insights can in certain instances be more helpful than backward-looking reports. Housing is fast-moving, so we're looking forward to the latest thoughts from KB Home executives.

Jason Stevens is used to dealing with travel headaches. As the CEO of Wayfairer Travel, which plans six-figure luxury vacations and trips for Fortune 500 CEOs and ultra-wealthy clients, he's helped customers solve problems — from finding last-minute access to deluxe ski locales to getting travelers to their African safari after they accidentally boarded the wrong flight. Stevens himself is a seasoned traveler, having been to all seven continents and "most major cities." And while the average cost of a Wayfairer Travel vacation is more than $30,000 — with some vacation packages clocking in at more than $200,000 — Stevens says you don't need to be a high-powered CEO to have a great vacation. Instead, he says there are three "common sense" things anyone can do to make sure their next vacation is as good as it can be. Packing an extra day or two's worth of clothing in your carry-on can save you a lot of hassle when dealing with lost luggage. "I often transfer on long-haul flights," he tells CNBC Make It. "If you don't have that level of visibility, they'll just go into the standard process," he says. "But if you've got the visibility, they use a different process. And no matter what, Stevens recommends packing a day or two's worth of clothing into your carry-on bag. "Travel with some basic amenities and a change of clothes." "You'd be amazed at how many countries still accept U.S. dollars with a big smile on their face," he says. But keep in mind that just because a country accepts your dollars doesn't mean they can provide change. Don't expect a cabbie in Bangkok to be able to give you change for a $50 or $100 bill on an $8 ride from the airport. If you plan on not using local currency, bring small denominations to make your life easier. Even better, he says, set up a multi-currency card, such as Wise, before you leave so that you can pay for everything without worrying about exchange rates or transaction fees.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Richard Teng, chief executive officer of Binance Holdings Ltd., at an event hosted by the Foreign Correspondents Association in Singapore, on Tuesday, Sept. 17, 2024. "It's an extremely different environment that we're operating in," Teng told CNBC on Tuesday. Once the poster child for regulatory defiance – Binance was slapped with a record $4.3 billion settlement with regulators and forced to oust billionaire founder Changpeng "CZ" Zhao – the crypto exchange is now navigating a dramatically friendlier political landscape under President Donald Trump's second administration, Teng said. "We've benefited from this shift," said Teng, who was appointed Binance's CEO in November 2023. Teng, a soft-spoken former regulator, was careful with his words when addressing the reports. As for the rumors about a Trump stake in Binance.US, Teng demurred. Still, Teng is bullish on what the new political environment means for crypto. "We went from four years of Operation Choke Point 2.0 to now – you have a very pro-crypto, pro-AI president," he said. While Binance.com doesn't operate in the U.S., he said, "We have benefited from all these pro-crypto policies." Choke Point 2.0 is how industry insiders refer to an alleged crackdown by legacy banks on digital asset firms during the Biden administration. "We have received a lot of approaches from different governments around the world," Teng said, citing regulatory progress in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Brazil, Argentina and the United Arab Emirates. Binance is now licensed in 21 jurisdictions, and its influence extends well beyond the reach of any one country.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In recent months, staffers across corporate America, from Amazon to Dell to Walmart, as well as federal government workers, have been told that their days of working remotely are over — at least, with that employer. Instead, select employees have been called back into offices five days a week, a reversal of conversations in 2020 that touted remote and hybrid options as the future of work. But those who've come to appreciate the newfound flexibility aren't giving it up easily. While remote job opportunities are down, the competition to land one is fierce: Just 20% of LinkedIn postings are for remote or hybrid jobs, but they're getting 60% of applications on the platform. Or they may stay but be less engaged in their work, which translates to lower productivity and performance. In the now five-year debate between remote work and returning to offices, what can people expect next? Bosses have a few reasons why they'd like to get employees back into offices. Some leaders may choose to default to how work has been done in the past and "think that workers are possibly more productive in the office," Kantenga adds. Indeed, a 2024 study of S&P 500 firms found businesses were more likely to mandate RTO after their stock prices dipped, hoping that in-office time would spur productivity and therefore boost the bottom line. Certain types of leaders are more likely to want people back in offices, says Mark Ma, an associate business professor at the University of Pittsburgh who led the research. "We found return-to-office mandates are more likely in firms with male and powerful CEOs," Ma says. "They are used to working in the office for five days a week. It's not surprising to see more RTO mandates take shape as power has shifted in the labor market, from employees during the Great Resignation back to employers in a new layoff environment. We do find significant evidence that return-to-office mandates hurt employee job satisfaction. It's basic economics: With new job creation and hiring down, employers have more job-seekers than they have open roles, and therefore less incentive to offer perks like flexible work. Meanwhile, some experts say companies are issuing RTO mandates as a so-called "back channel layoff," where they hope the policy will drive people to quit. "But we do find significant evidence that return-to-office mandates hurt employee job satisfaction," Ma says. His research analyzed millions of Glassdoor job reviews among companies that issued RTO mandates. Companies with fresh RTO policies also took longer to hire new employees. Still, some workers welcome more in-office time, like Clinton Stamper, 29, an Amazon software engineer in Austin, Texas. Like many with desk jobs, he worked entirely remotely for three years during the pandemic, but felt disconnected from his colleagues. You can randomly run into leadership and do an elevator pitch of your idea," he says. Stamper says working from an office helps him stay focused and collaborate with his colleagues better. Office workers can also boost the local economy and support small businesses located near corporate buildings. "Food trucks, laundry services — there are a lot of businesses that depend on workers in the office," Kantenga says. Most companies with remote and hybrid policies don't intend to change them in the next 12 months, according to new survey findings from Stanford and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Pope Francis waves during his first public appearance in five weeks, on the day he is set to be discharged from Gemelli Hospital, in Rome, Italy, on March 23, 2025. Pope Francis returned to the Vatican on Sunday after surviving a five-week battle in hospital against double pneumonia that became the most serious health crisis of his 12-year papacy. The 88-year-old pope, who also made his first public appearance since February 14 before being discharged from Rome's Gemelli hospital, left the facility shortly after noon. Though the pope has returned from hospital, his doctors have said it would still take "a lot of time" for his ageing body to heal fully. They have prescribed a further two months of rest at the Vatican and told him to avoid large or stressful meetings, leaving unclear how much activity Francis will undertake in the coming months. Just before leaving the hospital on Sunday, Francis smiled and waved at a group of well-wishers gathered outside. His face looked swollen, and bandages were visible on both arms underneath his white cassock during the appearance, which lasted only a few moments. He spoke briefly, with a feeble voice, to thank 79-year-old Carmela Vittoria Mancuso in the crowd below. Francis had only been seen by the public once before during his hospital stay, in a photo the Vatican released last week, showing the pontiff at prayer in a hospital chapel. The pope, who has been receiving oxygen to help him breathe throughout his hospital stay, was breathing on his own during the public appearance.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/23/chuck-schumer-rejects-calls-to-step-down-as-senate-democratic-leader.html'>Chuck Schumer rejects calls to step down as Senate Democratic leader</a></h2><b>Source:</b> cnbc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-23 00:00:00 <p>
WASHINGTON — A defiant Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer vowed that he won't step aside as the chamber's top Democrat, rejecting calls from some House colleagues and liberal advocates critical of his move to help pass a Republican funding bill. "Look, I'm not stepping down," Schumer said in a pretaped interview that aired Sunday on NBC News' "Meet the Press." Schumer told moderator Kristen Welker he knew there "would be a lot of controversy" when he cast his vote to prevent a shutdown. But he maintains that while the GOP's six-month bill was "certainly bad," a shutdown "would be 15 or 20 times worse." "Under a shutdown, the executive branch has sole power to determine what is 'essential.' And they can determine without any court supervision. "Sometimes when you're a leader, you have to do things to avoid a real danger that might come down the curve. But some have entertained questions about whether it's time for a re-examination. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., told a constituent at a town hall last week that "we're going to have future conversations about all the Democratic leadership." And, look, in my caucus, we have a disagreement as to, you know, some people voted one way, some people voted the other. But we've all agreed to respect each other because each side saw why the other side felt so strongly about it. And our caucus is united in fighting Donald Trump every step of the way," Schumer said. He responded to a suggestion from former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., that the Senate Democrats who voted to break a filibuster gave their votes without getting anything. Schumer said President Donald Trump has put the U.S. in a constitutional crisis as he escalates attacks on the judiciary and faces allegations from judges that he defied court orders. If he defies the Supreme Court, then we are in uncharted territory that we haven't been in for a very long time, and our entire democracy, this whole beautiful enterprise of democracy that we've had for over 240 years, is at risk. And look, I believe that if Donald Trump should defy the courts, the public will rise up," he said. "Democrats will fight it in every single way." Schumer also discussed his new book "Antisemitism in America: A Warning" during the interview, saying he wrote it because he's concerned that antisemitism is on the rise again. "I aimed it at both the hard right, and we've seen how viciously antisemitic they could be, but also at the hard left. I felt, as a progressive, I could talk to them about how some of their anti-Israel activity — I might disagree with it, but they're certainly entitled to do it, and it is not antisemitic — has been sliding over into direct antisemitism," Schumer said. "I would like all of America to read this. So I hope it will be reading in colleges and in high schools to learn, teach people the history. I believe the best antidote to antisemitism is education." Schumer, who is the highest-ranking Jewish elected official in the United States, said it's "possible" there will be a Jewish president in his lifetime, because "glass ceilings are broken every day."</p></b><br/><br/></div>
