SECTOR LEADER: TSMC can increase capacity by as much as 20 percent or more in the advanced node part of the foundry market by 2030, an analyst said Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, 台積電) is expected to lead its peers in the advanced 2-nanometer process technology, despite competition from Samsung Electronics Co and Intel Corp, TrendForce Corp analyst Joanne Chiao (喬安) said. TSMC’s sophisticated products and its large production scale are expected to allow the company to continue dominating the global 2-nanometer process market this year, Chiao said. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co’s logo is pictured at a company site in Tainan on Dec. 29, 2022. TSMC, which has grasped almost all global businesses in chips used in artificial intelligence applications by using its 3-nanometer process technology, expects its 2-nanometer process to attract even more orders, as more clients have expressed interest in using the new technology. A recent report from South Korea’s The Bell said that Samsung has introduced a gate-all-around architecture, which reduces undesirable variability and mobility loss, to the 2-nanometer process, as TSMC has done, but TSMC’s yield rates are more than double Samsung’s. Meanwhile, Intel lags behind TSMC in the number of production methods, making it less flexible in meeting its clients’ demands, Chiao said. However, Intel’s cooperation with United Microelectronics Corp (聯電) is expected to help it generate more sales in the foundry business, she added. Even though investors might be concerned about TSMC’s expansion in the US amid geopolitical tensions, the company is expected to keep its top spot in the market, financial Web site Seeking Alpha reported on Saturday, citing Citigroup Inc analyst Laura Chen (陳佳儀). “We believe TSMC’s near-term outlook and long-term prospects are on track, and don’t expect any potential [joint venture] to change the advanced semiconductor industry landscape,” Chen wrote in a note to clients, referencing a potential joint venture for Intel’s operations.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Nature is full of surprises - and one of the largest may be flying around, discreetly, with a branch in the beak. Using branches, leaves and even vegetable fibers, it shapes hook -shaped objects to reach hidden insects in narrow holes or cracks. This ability to transform the environment and using available features to facilitate tasks is already a milestone of intelligence - but this crow is even further. "It's like playing chess on their heads," says the scientist. Most impressive it is that crows not only use tools - they also change them to improve their efficiency. In observational experiments, scientists have realized that these birds adjust the shape and size of their utensils according to the kind of challenge they face. This demonstrates not only creativity but also a sophisticated understanding of cause and effect. In addition, they often carry their tools with them, which indicates an awareness of the environment and future challenges. At the age of eight, a child can already plan, predict consequences and solve problems based on previous experiences - exactly what scientists have observed in these crows. In laboratory tests, birds have shown to understand complex logical relationships, manipulate objects strategically, and even expect the best opportunity to act. According to the researchers, all this requires not only memory, but also abstract reasoning. Your ability to think, plan and adapt strategies put this species on top of the list of animals with remarkable intelligence - rivaling even with some primates.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Based on thousands of images, geographical data and cultural factors, AI has revealed which are the most beautiful Latin American countries. Artificial intelligence is increasingly present in areas that once seemed exclusively human - such as art, aesthetics and tourism. Recently, an AI system has been trained to identify the most beautiful countries in Latin America. The top 3 reveals destinations that combine lush nature, contrasting landscapes and cities full of history. Argentina appears in second place for its impressive geographical variety. Each region contributes a unique and imposing type of beauty. AI highlighted neighborhoods such as San Telmo, with its historical atmosphere, and Puerto Madero, example of urban renewal. In third position is Chile, whose singular geography caught the IA's attention. This extension allows a contrast of rare scenarios in the world. The city of Santiago was also mentioned by its modern architecture, while the colorful and artistic coast of Valparaiso yielded praise for its authenticity. The system used advanced image analysis techniques and visual geography, considering criteria such as variety of landscapes, environmental conservation, urbanism, accessibility and public perception. For this, thousands of photos, tourist publications, geographical data and comments on digital platforms were analyzed. In addition to aesthetic analysis, AI took into account how the inhabitants interact with the environment, which includes sustainable practices, cultural appreciation and accessibility to tourist spots. Countries with greater visual contrast and natural wealth were favored.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

It is a conference organized by an association of communities that pushes digital boundaries in the territorial public service. At conference, she also took a place larger than the one reserved for her. These passionate debates have highlighted two extreme attitudes: the radical rejection of certain AI applications, and a marked attraction of public officials for an accelerated modernization. The administration discovered teleworking, videoconferences there, revised its operating methods, and adapted very quickly. Seeing the glass half full is to say that initial mistrust can become a lever for transformation. Decision motivated by political, ethical considerations linked to data protection and digital sovereignty. This prohibition paradoxically triggered a virtuous dynamic by accelerating reflection around AI (which was there long before Chatgpt). Montpellier has thus set up a territorial committee dedicated to AI bringing together public, private, universities and businesses. The Occitanie region has highlighted a high demand for modernization among its agents. An internal survey revealed a great motivation of employees to become actors in change by adopting roles of "volunteer IA referents". The regional IA strategy, adopted unanimously in assembly, is built around strict principles: This framework allows agents to commit to serenely in the experimentation and integration of new technologies while having a clear political line in mind. These two examples presented at the interconnected forum shows us that change is therefore engaged in territorial function. What are the business impacts of generative AI in local authorities? Basically, there is not much difference with what Greensi has described for two years in private companies. In terms of agents who adopt new tools doped at AI. In terms of processes that hybridize and reveal treatments made by IA algorithms. And at the global level with the vision of a more autonomous AI, perhaps of a future IA agent who will not appeal to unions ... This diagnosis, based on a precise methodology developed by the Inet, revealed that 62 % of professions could experience significant transformations with the arrival of AI. Faced with these observations, it has become imperative to quickly organize a proactive preparation of agents through targeted and in -depth training. These programs include modules devoted to the analysis and advanced interpretation of data, mastery of AI tools adapted to public issues. But in the long term, it is all current training programs that are impacted by AI and which will have to adapt. The introduction of generative AI into communities therefore appears more as a strategic complement to human capacities rather than a pure and simple substitution. Analysis of use cases by the Haut de France region shows that almost 60 % of the applications identified are used to amplify human skills, thus facilitating more efficient and informed decision -making. These functions will have to integrate new working practices based on constant interaction with sophisticated technological tools. The agents concerned will not only have to acquire new technical skills, but also completely rethink their operating modes and their global approach to the service provided. We have seen that the brakes at AI can be on political considerations. So specific to the exercise of power in a community, where we do not want to leave too much room for algorithms (which are however already there). For Greensi it will be the main difficulty, especially at a period when grants to communities drop each year. Not to mention the potential impact of a war economy. A first application of RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) on all the content of public deliberations on a national scale, is already out. It allows agents to question an LLM, to draw inspiration from what can be done elsewhere, while remaining in content validated by the territorial public service. It is therefore a very good initiative that that of the Banque des Territoires, to develop a "National Library of Territorial AI". We have seen that generative AI is an in -depth transformation of organizations. The word replication highlights the reuse of a tool, which will have little chance of operating in a new organization. It oscillates between legitimate reluctance and a deep desire for modernization. The generative IA encourages a questioning of traditional administrative practices while demanding increased vigilance. It wants to preserve digital sovereignty, democratic values ​​and the central role of humans in public service. It is not fundamentally different from what has been observed for two years in companies.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

If your washer has released an unpleasant smell right after each washing cycle, know that this discomfort has explanation - and solution. Dirt, accumulated humidity and lack of proper ventilation are the main responsible for bad odor, which may even transfer to clothes. These waste favor the proliferation of bacteria and fungi, especially when the washer is kept closed after use, preventing air circulation. Over time, this damp and muffled environment favors the appearance of mold and bad smell, which also eventually impregnate clothes. The filter should be taken carefully and cleaned with running water, removing any obstruction. Rubber can be cleaned with a damp cloth and white vinegar or baking soda, which help eliminate mold and neutralize odors. After manual cleaning, make an empty wash cycle, with water at high temperature (between 70 ° C and 90 ° C), adding sodium baking soda in the soap compartment. Bicarbonate acts as a natural cleaning agent, eliminating odors and waste without assaulting the fabric fibers. Another effective option is to add white vinegar during rinse. Its disinfectant properties help remove impurities and neutralize persistent odors. Just avoid exaggeration as overuse can damage long -term clothing. Sunlight helps eliminate moisture and prevent the bad smell from returning. Habits to avoid the return of bad odor Following the manufacturer's instructions on dosage prevents accumulation of waste and internal obstructions. Leaving the washer and soap compartment open after each use is also essential. In addition, it is recommended to do hot water washing cycles periodically, especially if you usually use low temperature programs that do not eliminate residues effectively.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

DC recently published its previews for June, and Bane is introduced in absolute Batman #9. Bruce prevented from uncovering the secrets of ARK M, a facility that is "involved in the creation of evil" in Gotham. Take a look at the Dragotta cover below. With this size and charged with Venom, this is probably one of the most scary versions of the villain, and it looks like he could eat Batman without any problems or simply break the backbone as he often does. (The idea that this bane needs a weapon is also amusing because Venom makes it the size of a building.) In an interview in February with CBR, Snyder said that absolute Bane would have a new origin, but one who deals with the old [background story].

From ultraconnected centers in Asia to sustainable experiences in Europe, ambitious projects spread around the world, mixing innovation, sustainability and intelligent urban planning. And while some are already starting, others still face technical, social and political challenges that put their viability in check. With an estimated investment of US $ 1.5 trillion by 2030, the plan includes cities without cars, 100% renewable energy and advanced technological infrastructure, such as high -speed trains and artificial intelligence applied to urban management. Japan also bets on this future with Toyota Woven City. With its first phase completed, the project should start receiving residents in 2025. In China, Chengdu Future Science and Technology City wants to become the largest applied science center in the country, with fully automated mobility and unused functional areas. Despite futuristic concepts, not all smart cities have a promising trajectory. The case of Masdar City in the United Arab Emirates illustrates the risks: designed to house 50,000 people, today is just a research center with few inhabitants, marked by high costs and low functionality. Another example is Quayside, in Canada, a partnership from Google canceled after data privacy problems and divergences with the government. In addition, complaints about labor violations in major works, such as those linked to the Vision 2030 project of Saudi Arabia, light ethical and humanitarian alerts about the backstage of these megaconstructions. While some cities are built from scratch, others reinvent themselves intelligently. There, sensors monitor seniors at home, drones fight dengue outbreaks and self -employed buses already circulate in specific areas. Although still far from the sophistication of Asia and Europe, Brazil has good examples in its territory. However, the country still faces barriers such as lack of integration between sectors, internal resistance in public agencies and difficulties in adapting urban legislation to new technologies. But for this to happen in an ethical, functional and inclusive way, planning, transparency and involvement of society is required. More than technology, the future of cities depends on human vision and collective responsibility.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Artificial intelligence has become an almost indispensable tool that accompanies us from simple tasks to complex processes. But has she ever answered with an error message or blocked her request? Don't fall in love: the AI ​​is not your confidant Although your answers appear human and empathetic, you should never forget that artificial intelligence has no emotions or loyalities. Share personal data with her can bring you into a vulnerable position. Not only because they could be saved depending on the platform, but also because you could unintentionally leave a trace that is difficult to delete. And although it may feel like a harmless "conversation", the data you share could be used for training future models or stored without your knowledge. Therefore, no matter how friendly the conversation sounds, you should always have in mind that you don't talk to a person. But that doesn't make her an expert in medical diagnoses or legal disputes. Searching for advice on physical symptoms, health diagnoses or treatments is risky, no matter how convincing the answer sounds. Only an experienced specialist can offer you the right orientation. The laws change depending on the country, region and even context, and a general answer could confuse you more than you think. Sometimes the AI ​​can make mistakes or simply cannot be up to date, which adds another risk level. It is one thing that artificial intelligence is powerful, and something completely different that it can (or should) do everything you ask. If your intention is to search for illegal content, such as pirate links, hacking methods, weapon production or how to access non-authorized services ... simply stop. AI is trained to reject all inquiries that are considered dangerous, illegal or inappropriate. Regardless of whether it is content for adults that violate community guidelines, the production of malware or instructions for the damage of others or yourself - the platforms have made it clear: they will not allow this. In addition, such inquiries can trigger internal warnings and even automatic reports. Although it may seem like a joke, there are certain things that the visual AI simply cannot do. This is because the models tend to reproduce images that they often saw during their training, and clocks at this time are most common in reference material. This type of mistake shows that the AI ​​is still far from being perfect, and that even the simplest inquiries can uncover surprising restrictions. But although she can give you probabilities or analyze statistics, the AI ​​is not a fortune teller. This means that their answers could sound ambivalent, impersonal or even unintentionally insulting. Talks about sensitive topics can quickly lead to misunderstandings, especially if you expect a clear or emotional opinion. Therefore, it is best to use the AI ​​to search for information, but not to look for approval or support in personal debates. Many use the AI ​​as a source of inspiration for writing books, songs, scripts or articles. Although she can be a great creative tool, it is important to understand her limits. The problem here is not only ethical nature, but also more legal. Contents generated by a AI without checking them can have serious consequences, especially if you plan to publish or monetize it. The AI ​​is ideal for learning, researching, exploring ideas, solving technical doubts or helping you with better expression.

For years, the US Internal Revenue Service has assured undocumented workers that they could file taxes without fear of their information leading to their deportation. It appears the agency will no longer be able to make that promise. The IRS would then cross-reference those names across its confidential taxpayer databases to confirm their information. The agreement would reportedly only cover immigrants who have already been ordered to leave the country and requests—a narrower agreement than Trump’s Department of Homeland Security has asked for in the past, but one that still goes farther than ever before. With rare exceptions that typically require a court order beforehand, the IRS does not share any person’s tax information, including information as basic as the name and address filed on a person’s tax documents. The IRS has long promised undocumented workers that it is safe for them to file taxes without fear of their information being shared with law enforcement. And, because most of those undocumented workers file their taxes with an individual taxpayer identification number rather than a social security number, they aren’t able to claim benefits like the earned income tax credit. They also aren’t eligible for Social Security retirement benefits or health insurance through Medicare. Per the Tax Policy Center, an immigrant who comes to the United States at 25 years old will pay $200,000 more in taxes than what they will get in government benefits. While legal challenges have already been filed in an attempt to prevent the IRS from sharing information for immigration enforcement purposes, last week a federal judge (one Trump appointed during his first term) rejected a motion to block such an agreement. Several Democratic Senators have started ringing the alarm bells about this, but thus far have generated little by way of resistance. Meanwhile, DHS just shut down its internal watchdog agencies that advocate for immigrants.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

And in both cases, Apple would like to switch to its own AI models in time, as it does with the hardware components and software that it ships with its devices. "*" indicates required fields Email * Name This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. After all, this is the company that can’t ship conversational Siri features because of its stringent privacy guarantees. Gurman expects to see camera-equipped Apple Watch and AirPods models appear in 2027 at the soonest. Gurman says that this is just part of the shake-up, however. The Vision Pro team is being split into separate hardware and software groups, former AI lead John Giannandrea “isn’t being fired” despite the Siri problems, and a few other execs will move laterally. Separately, smart ring maker Oura hired an Apple veteran away from the company. The next Apple Watch Ultra will apparently include satellite texting support, thanks to a new MediaTek modem.

Decades ago, acid rain was a devastating environmental threat. Today a new danger falls from heaven and their effects could be worse. Air pollution has adopted a different form and is almost invisible this time. The problem with microplastics is not limited to seas and rivers. This contamination is alarming because microplastics cannot be easily dismantled, which means that they can remain in the environment for centuries. In addition, their ability to penetrate into ecosystems and the human body represents serious health risks. Why are microplastics more worrying than acid rain? However, his influence could be reduced by regulations to limit the emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. In contrast, the rain of microplastics represents a greater challenge for various reasons: ✅ They spread worldwide: they not only affect urban or industrial areas, but also achieve remote regions such as the Antarctic or the summit of Everest.

The decrease in corners, essential for communication, guidance and feeding of these animals, is being interpreted as a clear alarm on the growing impact of climate change on the marine ecosystem. In Monterey Bay, scientists at the Monterey Bay Research Institute (Mbari) have noted that, in periods of unfavorable ocean conditions, whales drastically reduce their vocalizations. During this period, food availability - such as krill, sardines and anchovies - has been critically reduced. These factors have altered the migratory behavior of whales and, most importantly, caused a clear drop in the frequency and intensity of their corners. These songs fulfill various vital functions: they serve for communication between individuals, space orientation, social interaction and even to locate food. The analysis showed that as ocean temperature increases and prey availability decreases, whales are forced to migrate to new areas in search of food. The study also concludes that when the water temperature returns to colder levels and food abundance improves, whale corners are frequent again. This direct relationship shows how these mammals respond significantly to environmental changes and how they can be used as "sentries" of the oceans. Biodiversity loss and changes in key species habits such as whales indicate that the impacts of global warming go beyond what is visible. The silence of the whales is not just an absence of sound - it is a crying cry for help. Science has already shown that climate change is transforming the seas and endangering the species that depend on them.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

What effects does this measure have and how will it affect those affected in the country? Discover why this decision causes such a stir. This decision has triggered great controversy because it directly affects the life of thousands of migrants who trusted a temporary legal status to build a future in the country. What happens here and why was this measure taken right now? The CNHV program (Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela) was introduced during the government of Joe Biden to give citizens of these countries legal and safe access to the United States and thus avoid dangerous border crossings. It allowed migrants to apply for entry from abroad and to fly directly into the country with a temporary work permit. However, the Trump government has decided to abolish this legal protection. For many of those affected, this decision means that they are exposed to the fear of deportation to countries in which their lives could be in danger. In addition, those who have managed to gain a foothold, find work and have started building a life in the USA must now endure the uncertainty about their future. The abolition of the temporary status also means a significant loss of workers in sectors in which these migrants are busy, which could affect the local economy in some communities. March 25 will be crucial to determine the effects of this measure. Some states are already considering to contest the decision in court and argue that the abolition of temporary status is arbitrary and harmful. On the other hand, activists and human rights defenders mobilize in order to offer legal support for the persons affected by this decision.

Discover how we play with fire in space without being aware of it. Space has developed into a new battlefield on which great powers measure its strength. In the meantime, recent incidents have shown how close we were at a catastrophic disaster. The commander of the US World Commercial Command, General Stephen Whiting, has expressed an urgent warning: Russia could develop an antisatellitarian nuclear weapon that would endanger the safety of all of humanity. During the conference "Air, Space & Cyber" in Washington, Whiting emphasized that it would be a disaster to allow Russia to develop such a weapon. In the last February, an almost catastrophic collision showed how vulnerable we are compared to a total collapse in space. Pam Melroy, deputy administrator of NASA and former astronautin, admitted that she was "horrified". The situation was so serious that NASA couldn't do anything to prevent it: Both space vehicles had no way to control. The low floating railway is increasingly overloaded: there are currently more than 10,000 active satellites and a forecast of 400,000 more in the coming years. Private companies such as SpaceX start thousands of commercial satellites without corresponding controls, which further strengthens the risk of catastrophic collisions. NASA has started its strategy for sustainable space travel, which focuses on improving surveillance and cleaning orbital garbage. Several companies, such as Airbus, Astroscale and Clearspace, develop technologies to safely grasp outdated satellites and remove them from orbit. If it is not done quickly, the future of space research could be in danger. And the worst thing is that a difficult collision could close the doors to new missions over decades, which would condemn humanity to remain captured on earth. But while governments and private companies continue to send more satellites to space, the question is: How much time does we have before the disaster occurs?

The Pentagon has recognized maneuvers of combat operations in space by Chinese spaceships and surprised the world with movements that are reminiscent of science fiction films. The recent discoveries of Chinese spatial operations have triggered concern in Pentagon because they recognize China's technological progress in the field of orbital warfare. The alarm bells ring in the United States after it has been found that China has carried out combat maneuvers in space. General Michael Guetlein, Vice President for Space Operations of the US DIRECTIONS, confirmed that these movements are similar to “dogfighting” in the air, but take place in space. This discovery has triggered great concern because the United States has been working on its own tactical space mission, known as Victus Haze, but have not yet reached the level that China has already demonstrated. The Chinese satellites involved in these maneuvers include the Shiyan-24c and two Shijian-6 05 (A and B), which were allegedly started for scientific research purposes in 2024. However, the Pentagon sees a clear military goal in these maneuvers: satellites of other powers such as the USA, Russia, India or Japan to record or to go out of operation. The US mission Victus Haze, which is planned for autumn 2025, is trying to simulate space scenarios by working with private companies such as Rocket Lab and True Anomaly. The North American strategy stipulates that the Chacal spaceship is initially started by True Anomaly, followed by a Rocket Lab spaceship that has to pursue and defend simulated attack vectors. China's ability to carry out combat maneuvers in space before the United States does this questions the American military leadership role in orbit. In the meantime, China has developed satellites that are equipped with robots that are able to capture other devices in orbit, which is a direct threat to western space. The beginning of a new race for space weapons General Guetlein's statements reflect the growing concern that international actors such as China and Russia are willing to act without restrictions, violate international norms and to endanger global stability.

There’s one thing everyone knew about DC’s Absolute universe before it launched: its Absolute Batman was big as hell. DC recently released its solicitcs for the month of June, and Absolute Batman #9 will introduce Bane. This version of the character, per the logline, is actually an “old adversary” of Alfred’s recently summoned to Gotham by Joker. Check him out in Dragotta’s cover below. At that size and amped up on Venom, this is probably one of the scarier versions of the villain, and it looks like he could easily eat Batman or just break his spine, as he often does. (The idea that this Bane needs a gun is also hilarious, given Venom makes him the size of a building.) In a February interview with CBR, Snyder teased Absolute Bane would have a new origin, but one that would “speak to the old [backstory]. It’s very much in conversation with who he’s always been, but it just makes him even bigger and more dangerous, in my opinion. So he’s scarier, bigger, tougher, smarter — all of it.” We can’t wait to see what this Bane is all about when Absolute Batman #9 releases on June 11.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A gigantic iceberg broke off in the Antarctic and revealed a hidden world that was in the dark for decades. What does this find mean for science and climate change? Gigantic spider crabs, octopuses and previously seen species appeared from the frozen abyss and challenged everything we knew about life in depths. A future free of employment: what the latest report reveals On January 13, an iceberg of about 30 kilometers of length broke off from the ice layer on the Antarctic coast and exposed a section of the ocean that had not seen any light for decades. Although expectations were low because it was not believed that many life forms could thrive in such an extreme environment, the finds were overwhelming under the iceberg. The find was surprising: an abundance of marine life that is adapted to extreme conditions. Among the discovered creatures were huge spider crabs, octopuses, deep -sea fishing, corals and hundreds of old sponges in the form of vases. The scientists estimate that after a comprehensive analysis they could identify dozens of new species. According to Esquete, biodiversity contradicts conventional theories about marine life in Polar regions. The effects of climate change on these ecosystems are of great interest to researchers, since global warming may lead to a more frequent breakdown of icebergs in the coming years, which exposed zones that have been hidden for centuries. Although discovery is astonishing, it also raises questions about the future of these vulnerable ecosystems. With increasing global temperatures, it is likely that more icebergs replace and reveal new hidden habitats. Canceling the iceberg from the George-Vi ice layer is only an example of what could happen more often if global warming progresses further.

With numbers that confuse and alarming signs, his job market seems to be trapped in a limbo. What happens here and why nobody stops despite promising business forecasts? At a time when many Latin American countries show signs of relaxation and economic expansion, one of them seems to be stopped abruptly. With an alarming low employment expectation, this country is not only faced with internal obstacles, but also moves away from the positive trends of its neighbors. A future free of employment: what the latest report reveals This means that on average, a positive change in the number of jobs offered by companies is not expected during this period. Nevertheless, this economic optimism does not yet find any reverberation in the labor market. The companies that should actually expand mainly decide to maintain their current structures or even reduce them. The report shows that 25 % of employers plan to increase their staff while 23 % provide layoffs. The remaining 44 % do not expect changes in your team. Luis Guastini, President of ManpowerGroup Argentina, said that after months of uncertainty, the corporate environment shows a certain stability, but does not result in a specific willingness to attend. In fact, he found that Argentina has been struggling with employment expectations that are significantly below the regional and global average for more than a decade. These factors create an environment of extreme caution in the private sector, where many decisions are postponed, in the hope of a more tangible and sustainable recovery. The Latin American mirror: How Argentina does compared to neighbors and world leaders Even smaller countries such as Costa Rica and Canada exceed +30 %, which reflects a global tendency to reactivate the labor market. Of the 42 countries evaluated by Manpowergroup, 41 project an increase in their attitudes. This number is not only symbolic, but also represents an alarm sign for the isolation of the country in terms of working dynamics. However, these measures require political willpower, macroeconomic stability and trust from the private sector.

Seven years ago, three classmates at the Technical University of Munich believed their student engineering project might hold some promise in the private sector. At the time, one of the co-founders, Daniel Metzler, led a team of 40 students working on rocket engines and launching sounding rockets. Together with another classmate, Markus Brandl, they crafted rocket parts in a campus workshop before taking the leap and establishing Isar Aerospace, named for the river running through the Bavarian capital. The company's orbital-class first rocket, named Spectrum, is set to lift off from a shoreline launch pad in Norway as soon as Monday. "The launch date remains subject to weather, safety and range infrastructure," Isar said in a statement. Isar's Spectrum rocket rolls out to its launch pad in Norway. Isar said it received a launch license from the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority on March 14, following the final qualification test on the Spectrum rocket in February to validate its readiness for flight. Success is never assured on the inaugural launch of a new rocket. Isar is the first in a wave of European launch startups to arrive at this point. All told, Isar says it has raised more than 400 million euros, or $435 million at today's currency exchange rate, more than any other European launch startup.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

So it's not far-fetched to believe this technology will support those chips as well. ASR is built on AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 technology, and at its initial unveiling, Arm claimed 53% more FPS at 2x upscaling with the Immortalis-G720 GPU (Dimensity 8400 and 9300). Since ASR is open-source, developers can tweak and finetune it to match their needs. The Benefits of Arm ASR (Accuracy Super Resolution) - YouTube Watch On As a part of their promotional efforts, Arm has introduced a new chapter in its Mali Manga series featuring ASR and to be honest, I could get used to reading PRs like this. Think of it like DLSS or FSR for your mobile devices, and game integration is expected to be simplified as Arm releases pre-baked plugins for Unity and Unreal Engine later this year. Game developers utilizing these engines should find ASR integration relatively straightforward. Due to its open-source nature, ASR can be integrated into other game engines as well but that will require increased developer efforts. Sticking to mobile-only SoCs, ASR should work on Qualcomm's Snapdragon, MediaTek's Dimensity, Google's Tensor, Samsung's Exynos, and Apple's A-series/M-series hardware. While we believe ASR should be as scalable as FSR 2 and support virtually all modern-day Arm hardware, the requirements depend on the developers and Arm itself, though they should be pretty lenient.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In our opinion, some of the best Pi projects come from makers who ask, "Why not?" Using our favorite SBC, he's put together an ASCII video camera project and showed it off at the latest Pi Jam conference. I had only 3 days to build this Raspberry Pi Project (ASCII Video Camera) - YouTube Watch On ASCII art was much more common in retro computing, but you can still find some fun modern examples like this project today. In this creation, the Pi is able to convert video frames into ASCII art, which is then displayed frame by frame to make a video feed using Python. Esser opted to use a Raspberry Pi 5 as the main board, which has plenty of processing power for a project like this. For video input, Esser opted to use a Raspberry Pi camera module. Esser was kind enough to make the project open source and has shared all the source code over at GitHub for anyone interested in either recreating the project or just digging deeper to see how it works.

Storing digital content in DNA is an emerging technology that takes advantage of the molecule's density, durability, and low power needs. DNA can last for generations, unlike NAND flash and HDDs that degrade in years or decades, at best. However, retrieving data from DNA storage is a complex and rather slow process. A team at Technion – Israel Institute of Technology has created an AI tool that makes retrieving digital information stored in DNA dramatically faster and more accurate. This new approach allows for processing 100MB in only 10 minutes, compared to several days using the best current methods. DNAformer handles these issues using algorithms that identify correct patterns from flawed inputs. The model includes tailored correction codes and a safety layer to detect highly noisy sequences. It uses specialized tools to clean up those errors before translating the sequences back into digital form. Besides the speed improvement, DNAformer also showed up to 40% higher accuracy over previous quick retrieval methods. This performance marks a breakthrough in handling real-world DNA storage data, especially when dealing with incomplete or noisy sequences that challenge traditional correction methods.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Nvidia's R570 branch of GPU drivers came with several instability issues that troubled RTX 50 series owners, and reports suggest the impacts were felt by some using older GPU architectures, as well. Multiple reports indicate recurring symptoms, with impacted customers still awaiting a response from Nvidia. Users report that these instability issues manifest in the form of BSODs, hard crashes which typically require a reboot, and system freezes. A significant chunk of these reports stem from application and feature-specific crashes, particularly when enabling Nvidia's DLSS Frame Generation feature. It's important to understand that these stability concerns are not new, as we can find traces of them dating back to late January with the introduction of Nvidia's 572.16 driver, which enabled RTX 50 support. A large chunk of these users are facing compatibility problems with titles such as Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2, God of War Ragnarok, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, just to name a few. The community has found several workarounds, with a few common fixes including rolling back drivers, disabling Frame Generation and/or G-Sync, downgrading the DLSS version, and lowering refresh rates, among other related Band-Aid solutions. These issues have been troubling RTX 40 series owners for almost three months, with no definite or official resolution. Nvidia has addressed several compatibility issues in multiple driver releases across its R570 software, however, most of them are only applicable to the RTX 50 series. A source of significant frustration and disconnect is that Nvidia is not officially acknowledging these concerns, as the "Known Issues" section under almost every new driver release fails to mention anything related to the RTX 40 series.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Leading laptop ODM Compal has won another iF Design Award 2025 for a quirky concept product. The Compal Adapt X is described as a modular laptop, and it is immediately quite clear it takes a leaf out of the Framework laptop playbook. It is also something of a hybrid / convertible, with the components being usable slotted together, or independently. Compal says this concept design is appealing to customers because it offers multiple usage modes, reduced upgrade frequency, and should cut down on e-waste. Of course, Compal's customers are laptop OEMs, so it is up to them whether this design ever hits the retail space. This looks similar to how an old Lenovo Yoga tablet design worked. Compal says this dock can offer "expanded IO ports and modular AI units." It could also be an extra battery, AI accelerator, or dGPU - but that isn't discussed by Compal. Lastly, remember Compal designs and shows these concepts to its OEM customers, and while some of the ideas might seem amazing, and may get partially adopted, we rarely see any of these concepts make it to retail unchanged.

While the iPhone 18 series won't be launching for another year and a half, we've already heard several predictions about it – and the latest one suggests all four models in the range are going to get a substantial performance upgrade. This comes from well-respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has reiterated a prediction he made six months ago: that the A20 chipsets destined for the iPhone 18 handsets will use a 2-nanometer production process. The current iPhone 16 devices use A18 processors made with 3nm technology. iPhones get faster every year of course, but a change in the manufacturing process like this means significant performance gains, above and beyond the usual increases. It should mean the iPhone 18 can offer next-level processing power. Reiterating my prediction from six months ago: the 2H26 new iPhones (iPhone 18) will be powered by TSMC’s 2nm chips.Worth noting, TSMC’s 2nm R&D trial yields reached 60–70% three months ago, and they’re now well above that. There remains some ambiguity around whether or not the chips for every iPhone 18 model will get this 2nm upgrade. Kuo now seems more optimistic about this than he was in September, but it may be an upgrade just for the Pro and Pro Max models. It would well be that even Apple and its supply chain partners aren't sure yet. These phones should get upgrades to A19 processors – but they'll be built using the existing 3nm process technology.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Nvidia's GTC 2025, an annual event where the company lays out its roadmap of new products and vision for the coming year, created a flood of news as the company extended its roadmap out to a four-year horizon with plenty of mind-bendingly powerful new AI GPUs and systems. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also clarified the company's recent maneuvers behind the scenes, including that it is now building production silicon in the US in TSMC's Arizona fab, and he also threw cold water on rumors of Nvidia's participation in a supposed industry consortium that would take over rival company Intel's chipmaking fabs. That news comes as Intel begins shuffling its foundry management structure under new CEO Lip-Bu Tan. This year, we found quite a few interesting developments on the storage front, including a demo for PCIe-connected NVMe hard drives, the first production liquid-cooled SSDs, and a new Toshiba SSD that's bursting at the seams with 122 TB of capacity. Early in the week, we learned that Nvidia's explosive growth equates to making nearly as much revenue as its next nine fabless competitors combined last year. Yes, that includes big names like AMD, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and MediaTek, among others. Nvidia announced its new Rubin GPUs for 2026, Rubin Ultra in 2027, and teased an all-new Feynman architecture that will arrive in 2028, extending its public roadmap out to a four-year window, which Jensen claimed is "something no other technology CEO has ever done before." Those massive chips will be combined with Nvidia's 88-core CPUs and crammed into Kyber racks, consuming up to 600,000 Watts (600kW) of power apiece. That will push Nvidia SuperPODS up to multi-megawatts of power consumption. That pushes performance density to once-unthinkable levels, but power constraints are already a pressing issue for new and existing data centers alike: Most data center projects are now limited by how much power they can access from the grid. As Kyber shows, this will become a more critical issue soon — these systems are expected to land in the second half of 2027. One pertains to TSMC, as Nvidia announced that it is now running production silicon through TSMC fabs in Arizona (it's also producing some Blackwell systems in the US, too), but Nvidia also shared details, or rather lack thereof, about Intel. Jensen throws cold water on Intel consortium rumors as company begins restructuring moves This would help TSMC take over the Intel Foundry chipmaking operations. That's good news for Intel, which made news of its own as Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, has now taken the helm with a $1 million yearly salary plus a whopping potential total of $68 million in bonuses. Perhaps we'll see more similarly decisive actions at Intel soon as Tan enacts a turnaround plan. Meanwhile, Intel ex-CEO Pat Gelsinger stopped by GTC to repeat his claim that Jensen "got lucky with AI." Gelsinger also lamented Intel's past indecisive execution of his Larabee GPU project, which was famously killed after he left the company. Old HDDs learn a new NVMe jam while SSDs get liquid cooling HBM memories attract all the attention for AI GPUs and accelerators, but the massive data training sets have to be stored somewhere, and storage solutions tailored specifically for AI use cases are now proliferating. I'm always a sucker for high-capacity SSDs, and Kioxia's new PCIe 5.0 LC9 certainly fits that bill. When it comes to NVMe, we naturally think of SSDs, but HDDs with the interface have been under development for quite some time. We've seen more than a few different takes on watercooled SSDs for the consumer market. Solidigm's D7-PS10101 E1.S is watercooled but also hot-swappable, meaning it can be changed without shutting down the server, thus also meeting critical serviceability criteria for AI data centers that can't miss a beat.

While the U1 chip in Apple devices enables ultra-wideband (UWB) technology to determine the direction of your phone and help you share files with nearby devices, AirDrop uses Bluetooth for the initial discovery process and then switches to Wi-Fi to transmit files. Google merged Nearby Share with Samsung’s Quick Share in 2024, and much like AirDrop, it uses Bluetooth to establish a connection and then Wi-Fi to transfer files. Bluetooth is named after King Harald “Bluetooth” Gormsson—the logo is a combination of his runes for his initials—who had a literal blue tooth (it was dead). This short-range radio technology grew from a 1996 meeting between Intel, Ericsson, and Nokia. The standard is managed by a not-for-profit Bluetooth Special Interest Group, or Bluetooth SIG, and it's headquartered in the US. Every version brought myriad incremental improvements to make Bluetooth faster, more efficient, more secure, and less buggy, but we’re just going to run through the headline features here.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/power-supplies/fsp-hydro-ti-pro-1000w-power-supply-review'>FSP Hydro Ti Pro 1000W power supply review</a></h2><b>Source:</b> tomshardware&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-23 13:00:00 <p>
The FSP Hydro Ti Pro 1000W excels in efficiency, thermal performance, and reliability, ideal for high-end systems. Despite the cost, it offers excellent long-term value backed by a solid 10-year warranty. For a 1000W PSU, top-tier performance means being able to support multiple GPUs and demanding overclocking conditions, all without wavering elsewhere. The FSP Hydro Ti Pro 1000W PSU arrived in a well-designed cardboard box, emphasizing durability and aesthetics. FSP provides a comprehensive bundle with the Hydro Ti Pro 1000W. The package includes more than just the essentials: there is an AC power cable, a set of cable straps for organized cable management, and a dummy 24-pin ATX connector, allowing the PSU to be powered on independently of a motherboard. This extra item is particularly useful for testing or troubleshooting purposes. The FSP Hydro Ti Pro 1000W PSU adeptly balances substantial power output within a 150mm long chassis that extends slightly beyond the standard ATX form factor. This careful design consideration ensures compatibility with a wide range of ATX-compliant cases, including desktop HTPC and other compact setups. In contrast to extravagant designs, the Hydro Ti Pro 1000W PSU boasts a refined and understated aesthetic. The PSU is devoid of overly flashy elements, maintaining a professional look. Standard decorative stickers on the sides add a touch of branding, while the top sticker with electrical specifications is both informative and unobtrusive. The unit's top side is adorned with a sticker detailing its electrical specifications and certifications, providing easy reference for users. For its cooling requirements, the FSP Hydro Ti Pro 1000W PSU utilizes a Protechnic Electric MGA13512XF-A25 fan, fitting the maximum 135 mm size that can be accommodated in its slightly extended ATX chassis. This fan is of high quality, featuring a Fluid Dynamic Bearing (FDB) engine. FDB fans are known for their reliability and quiet operation, complementing the PSU's semi-passive design which stops the fan under low load conditions, reducing noise further. The primary side of the FSP Hydro Ti Pro 1000W PSU is technically characterized by a full-bridge LLC topology, utilizing four Magnachip MMQ60R115PC super-junction power MOSFETs. These MOSFETs were selected for their very low RDS(on) value, less than 0.115 Ohm, which is key in reducing conversion losses. The full-bridge LLC topology is complemented by a dedicated heatsink for the MOSFETs, crucial for effective heat dissipation and maintaining optimal operating temperatures. It also includes DC-to-DC converters on a vertical daughterboard for the 3.3V and 5V lines. Tiny heatsinks are used for these secondary stage components to manage heat. The capacitors on this side are a mix of electrolytic and polymer types from Nippon Chemi-Con and a few from Rubycon, all high-quality Japanese manufacturers, ensuring stability and longevity of the power supply. For the testing of PSUs, we are using high precision electronic loads with a maximum power draw of 2700 Watts, a Rigol DS5042M 40 MHz oscilloscope, an Extech 380803 power analyzer, two high precision UNI-T UT-325 digital thermometers, an Extech HD600 SPL meter, a self-designed hotbox and various other bits and parts. This unit excels remarkably in its energy conversion efficiency, particularly at low to medium loads. When subjected to an input voltage of 230 VAC, the Hydro Ti Pro boasts an average nominal load efficiency of a remarkable 95%, a figure that stands significantly above many of its peers in the power supply landscape. This exceptional efficiency recedes to 92.9% under a reduced input voltage of 115 VAC. Nonetheless, this dip may be significant but does little to overshadow the unit's overall performance, as it remains comparatively very high. Despite its substantial power output, the internal temperatures of the unit remain impressively low, a remarkable achievement considering its standard dimensions and high performance. The fan does not even spin with loads up to 500 Watts, maintaining a quiet operation. Beyond this threshold, the fan's speed incrementally increases, but this escalation in speed is gradual and controlled, keeping acoustic levels in check. The fan never reaches a speed close to its maximum under these operating conditions, while temperatures remain very low. The FSP Hydro Ti Pro is rated for operation at an ambient temperature of 50°C. In the realm of PC power supply units (PSUs), their categorization often hinges on their temperature ratings, where a 50°C rating is indicative of quality high-performance products. The Hydro Ti Pro's 50°C rating is reassuring, aligning with its positioning as a premium product. This rating is a significant marker of its robustness and reliability, especially under high temperature conditions, underscoring its suitability for demanding applications and environments. The performance of PC power supply units (PSUs) can significantly vary with changes in ambient temperature, a factor that largely hinges on the unit's design and build quality. In the context of the FSP Hydro Ti Pro PSU, its energy conversion efficiency demonstrates remarkable stability under varying thermal conditions. During hot testing, the Hydro Ti Pro shows an extraordinarily low efficiency reduction of just 0.2% at low loads, a figure that firmly sits within the realm of top-tier performance. Notably, even as the load intensifies, this decrement in efficiency remains impressively minimal, not exceeding 0.3%. This consistent efficiency profile under both low and high load conditions in elevated temperatures is indicative of the Hydro Ti Pro's superior design and thermal performance. This threshold highlights the efficiency and thermal management capabilities of the unit, allowing for substantial power delivery without immediate fan activation even under such conditions. The electrical performance of the FSP Hydro Ti Pro PSU stands out as exemplary, particularly for a unit geared towards high-performance applications. These rails demonstrate regulation around 1.5% and a voltage ripple up to 18 mV for the 3.3V rail and 16 mV for the 5V rail. Despite this, these figures remain very comfortably within the design limits. The FSP Hydro Ti Pro PSU showed reliable actuation of all protections. Additionally, the Over Power Protection (OPP) also functioned correctly, engaging at 127% under high load conditions, ensuring a strong safety net for the power supply. Its build quality is impressive, characterized by a sleek, matte grey external finish, all-black ribbon cables, and a lack of ostentatious design elements, highlighting its focus on functionality. Despite its understated external design, the internal layout of the Hydro Ti Pro is meticulously organized, implementing advanced topologies and top-quality parts, indicative of FSP's reputation as an experienced manufacturer in the PSU market. In terms of power quality, the Hydro Ti Pro excels, particularly with its superior voltage regulation and filtering on the 12V rail. The PSU boasts extremely high energy conversion efficiency that, with an average efficiency of 95% across the entire load range (230 VAC input), establishes new performance records. The thermal performance of the Hydro Ti Pro is outstanding, maintaining low internal temperatures even under heavy loads, thanks to its exceptional efficiency and selection of active components. The unit operates quietly at low-to-medium loads, with the fan remaining inactive until a 500-watt load is reached, making it an ideal choice for noise-sensitive environments. In practical scenarios, particularly with typical gaming or workstation PCs, the fan in this PSU model is engineered to remain inactive for extended periods due to its efficient design. With its blend of high-quality components, excellent efficiency, and reliable thermal and noise management, the FSP Hydro Ti Pro stands out as a solid choice for users who require a powerful, efficient, and durable PSU, although its higher price point may need to be weighed against individual budget considerations.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A user at r/nvidia has aggregated data on RTX 5090 Founders Edition GPUs sold on eBay into a neat chart, giving us insight into current market trends. It’s important to understand this data accumulates listings featuring both used and new GPUs. A week before launch, we already saw a glimpse of Blackwell's horrendous supply woes with scalpers charging as much as $7,000 for “pre-reserved” RTX 5090 slots. The chart depicts a downward trend in pricing since launch, with average selling prices of completed eBay listings dropping from $6,000 to $4,000. When limiting our scope to just March, the standard deviation sees a sharp decline to $145.60, indicating market stability or, at least, consistent pricing across resellers. We found similar results from Camelcamelcamel, a website that tracks prices for products sold on Amazon where after the initial volatility spikes to $9,000, prices have now settled at $5,000. While this isn’t exactly cause for celebration, it is a welcome improvement and could indicate lower prices in the future. Of course, that’s considering if Nvidia and AIBs manage to supply cards in sufficient quantity. Price gouging this generation unfortunately also extends to system integrators, who are being offered entry-level RTX 5090 variants for over $3,000. AMD’s RX 9070 GPUs face similar constraints, as you’d be hard-pressed to find even an entry-level model at MSRP.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Amid the flurry of Apple Intelligence features pushed out to iPhones, iPads, and Macs in recent months, AI-powered art generation hasn't been forgotten. Apple has debuted a new AI art maker called Image Playground, ready and waiting to turn your text prompts into pictures. If you're running iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, or macOS Sequoia 15.2, you'll find Image Playground on your device as a preinstalled app. You can use it for everything from backgrounds for digital invites to cartoon depictions of your friends and relatives. Note that Apple Intelligence needs to be activated on your device for Image Playground to be accessible. It should be enabled by default, but you can check via the Apple Intelligence & Siri menu in Settings (iOS and iPadOS) or System Settings (macOS). Image Playground will get you started with some suggestions. You can tap on any of these suggestion shortcuts without entering a text prompt, and the app will come up with something that matches after a few seconds. There's another option for a starting point: Down in the lower right corner of the interface, you can tap the + (plus) button to choose a photo from your phone's gallery, or take a new photo with the camera. Take a photo of your pet, for example, and you'll get back an AI version after a few seconds.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230817/'>If you want to extend the lifespan of your iPhone, you can also try not to fully charge it.</a></h2><b>Source:</b> cnet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-23 12:23:00 <p>
Many modern smartphones can be used all day long on a single full charge. Even in the middle range and entry-level models, there is not much need to carry a spare battery with you or charge it multiple times a day. Therefore, rather than worrying about whether the battery will last for a day or not, there is a tendency to emphasize how well the battery can be kept for several years, or "battery life." If you want to manually control the battery, there is a way to use the "Charge Limit" function. For iPhone 15 and later models, if you go to Settings > Battery > Charge, you can set the charging limit in 5% increments in the 80% to 100% range. According to Apple, using a charging limit can extend battery life, and depending on how you use it, iOS may automatically recommend it. That said, even if you leave it in a 100% state and still plug it in, there's no need to be so nervous, says CNET reporter Patrick Holland. "Full charge is not the only factor that affects battery life. Apple and other manufacturers use software to reduce various factors and make it easier for users to control if necessary. Balance is important, so there's no need to overly fear 100% charging."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Have you ever deleted an SMS or a conversation on your iPhone to realize later that you still need it? The IMEAGE application generally keeps SMS deleted up to 40 days. If you act before this deadline, you should be able to recover this lost but not forgotten message. Receive a selection of strategic advice and concrete tips every week in your mailbox with our newsletter practical guides. Learn more about the use of personal data An option is to use a third -party recovery tool for iPhone. I use the Imazing utility, which allows me to save my phone and selectively access certain data. I can even consult the old SMS without having to restore them. The main drawback is that you will already need a backup of your phone to restore the old SMS deleted since. It is therefore advisable to use a program like this regularly, before deleting messages you may need later. How to restore a deleted message in iMessage To recover the messages and conversations deleted in iMessage, you must have iOS 16 or a later version on your iPhone and iPados 16.1 or a later version on your iPad. Download and install the latest version, if necessary. If you have already looked for the desired message and you do not find it, it's time to check all the SMS deleted. If you've already filtered unknown shipments, press filters at the top left. If you find the conversation you want to restore, select it and press Recover at the bottom. Press filters at the top and select all messages. To access SMS permanently deleted, you can use a third -party backup tool. It allows you to save all of your phone data and display the deleted content selectively. Although there are several programs of this type, I recommend the IMAZING utility, free as long as you restore any application or given. The good news is that you can consult and even export a message from the backup without having to restore it on your phone. Again, you must already use this tool for your backups so that you can consult a deleted SMS. It is a good option to adorn any eventuality. Open IMAZING and wait for it to associate with your phone. You use IMAZING or a similar program to save your phone, if possible regularly, and you now want to access a deleted SMS. You have already consulted the recently deleted section of your phone, but nothing helps. You can also save attachments and print all of the conversation.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theverge.com/policy/634264/customs-border-protection-search-phone-airport-rights'>Is it safe to travel with your phone right now?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theverge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-23 12:00:00 <p>
In recent weeks, airport Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents have drawn public outcry for denying travelers US entry based on searches of their phones. A doctor on an H-1B visa was deported to Lebanon after CBP found “sympathetic photos and videos” of Hezbollah leaders. A French scientist was turned away after a device search unearthed messages criticizing the Trump administration’s cuts to research programs, which officers said “conveyed hatred of Trump” and “could be qualified as terrorism.” As the administration ratchets up pressure to turn away even legal immigrants, its justifications are becoming thinner and thinner — but travelers can still benefit from knowing what are supposed to be their legal rights. Your ability to decline a search depends on your immigration status — and, in some cases, on where and how you’re entering the country. Courts across the country have issued different rulings on device searches at ports of entry. During the 2024 fiscal year, less than 0.01 percent of arriving international travelers had their phones, computers, or other electronic devices searched by CBP, according to the agency. But even before this recent wave of incidents, inspections were on the rise: eight years earlier, during the 2016 fiscal year, CBP searched only 19,051 devices. That exception applies far beyond the US’s literal borders, since airports are considered border zones, too. This data can precede your travel by over a decade because of how much information is stored on the cloud,” Hussain said. It can reveal so much information that is not analogous at all to the notion of a customs officer looking through your luggage.” Privacy advocates have warned of this issue for years, but in an environment where officers are seeking any pretext to turn someone away, it’s an even bigger problem. But if you refuse, CBP can still take your phone, laptop, or other devices and hold onto them. Permanent residents can similarly refuse a search, but with complicating factors. If someone with a green card leaves the US for more than 180 days, they’re screened for “inadmissibility” — reasons they may be barred from entry — upon returning to the country. Green card holders who have certain offenses on their record may also be deemed inadmissible. That appears to have been the case with Fabian Schmidt, a permanent resident whose family said he was “violently interrogated” by CBP agents at Boston Logan Airport after returning from a trip to Europe. Because of these factors, permanent residents may not feel comfortable refusing a search, even if doing so wouldn’t bar them from entering the country. Visa holders have fewer rights at ports of entry, and refusing a search could lead to them being denied entry to the country. There are two types of device searches CBP officers can conduct: basic and forensic, or advanced. “There’s a distinction that the government draws between searching your phone and just looking at whatever is on it, versus connecting your phone to external equipment to search it using advanced algorithms or to copy the contents of your phone,” Hussain said. The government maintains that it doesn’t need a warrant to conduct “basic” searches of the contents of a person’s phone. During these searches, Hussain explained, agents are supposed to put your phone on airplane mode and can only look at what is accessible offline — but that can still be a lot of information, including any cloud data that’s currently synced. Last year, a federal judge in New York’s Eastern District ruled that CBP can’t conduct any warrantless searches of travelers’ devices. Elsewhere in the country, judges have imposed some limitations on advanced searches. This does not make a lot of sense, but the Supreme Court has consistently declined to address these disparities by consistently denying petitions for certiorari in cases that have teed the question up.” The Ninth Circuit — which includes Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington — prohibits warrantless forensic searches unless officers are looking for “digital contraband,” such as child sexual abuse material. The Fourth Circuit — covering Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia — prohibits warrantless forensic searches unless officers are looking for information related to ongoing border violations, such as human smuggling or drug trafficking. In 2023, a federal judge in the Southern District of New York ruled that the border search exception doesn’t extend to forensic searches, for which warrants are needed. In 2021, Adam Malik, an immigration lawyer, sued CBP after agents at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport seized his phone and searched the contents without a warrant. A federal court ruled in favor of DHS, saying the warrantless search hadn’t violated Malik’s rights. In other words, the constitutionality of these searches is still an open question — and CBP won’t stop conducting them until and unless it’s expressly forbidden from doing so. These distinctions matter because they determine a person’s basis for challenging device inspections in court. Travelers should disable biometric logins like Face ID, since some courts have ruled that police can’t compel you to tell them your password but they can use biometrics to unlock your phone. The EFF recommends that travelers limit what can be found during basic phone or laptop searches by uploading their data onto the cloud and deleting it off their device — and ensuring that it’s fully been removed, since agents can also look through your phone’s “recently deleted” files during basic searches. Customs agents are supposed to keep your phone on airplane mode while they conduct a basic search, but that still lets them see any cached emails, text messages, and other communications. The best way to safeguard this information is to back it up onto the cloud and then wipe your phone or laptop entirely. Backing up sensitive or personal data doesn’t just prevent others from accessing your device; it also ensures you don’t lose that data if CBP seizes your phone or computer. “Turning the phone off means that when you turn it back on, it requires a passcode whether or not you use FaceID or other biometric measures,” McBrien said. For now, if CBP really wants to look through your phone, they’ll likely find a way.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.androidauthority.com/screen-off-fingerprint-unlock-pixel-3537472/'>Android 16 now lets all Pixel phones use fingerprint unlock even when the screen is off</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theverge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-23 11:30:13 <p>
TL;DR All Pixel phones can now use the Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock feature in Android 16 Beta 3. It was first introduced in Android 16 DP2 but only worked on the Pixel 9 series. Unlike many other smartphones, however, Pixel phones currently require the screen to be on for the fingerprint scanner to function. Thankfully, this limitation will be addressed in the upcoming Android 16 update for Pixel. The Android 16 update for Pixel phones is set to introduce a new Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock feature. When this feature is enabled, the fingerprint scanner will be active even when the screen is off. Once enabled, you can press the fingerprint scanner area when the screen is off, and your Pixel phone’s screen will illuminate and unlock if the correct finger is used. I confirmed it works on my Pixel 6a, and a tester verified it on their Pixel 7 Pro. While there’s a possibility Google could remove the feature in the stable Android 16 release, there’s no apparent reason for them to do so. Otherwise, simply wait for the Android 16 rollout and then enable the Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock toggle in the Fingerprint Unlock settings, as it will be disabled by default.

It certainly doesn’t hurt that the tickets to these live tapings and early screenings are usually free. And while the competition to score those free tickets can be classified as its own extreme sport, the payoff can leave you feeling like an X-Games medal winner. Others are vying for the same tickets, so you need yogi-level patience—or Divine Intervention—to acquire a promo code. And I save money, so it’s a double win.” My first encounter with the free-screening subculture occurred when I was living on a budget in Austin. At a time when I couldn’t always afford to go out, the many available free test screenings kept my social calendar full. The entire process kept me entertained, offering a way to see new films without spending money I didn’t have. Here are the top sites and platforms (some require logins): 1iota: The fan platform distributes free passes to sitcoms, talk shows, red carpet events, and exclusive fan experiences in New York, California, and select cities elsewhere. Members create an account and submit requests for each individual event they wish to attend. Lucky winners receive a confirmation email link to accept their tickets, which are distributed on the site.

According to a memo circulating among State Department staff and reviewed by WIRED, the Trump administration plans to rename the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as US International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA), and to bring it directly under the secretary of state. The document, on which Politico first reported, states that as part of its reorganization, the agency will “leverage blockchain technology” as part of its procurement process. “All distributions would also be secured and traced via blockchain technology to radically increase security, transparency, and traceability,” the memo reads. The memo does not make clear what specifically this means—if it would encompass doing cash transfers in some kind of cryptocurrency or stablecoin, for example, or simply mean using a blockchain ledger to track aid disbursement. The memo comes as staffers at USAID are trying to understand their future. The agency was an early target of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has effectively been headed by centibillionaire Elon Musk. Shortly after President Trump’s inauguration, the State Department put the entire agency’s staff on administrative leave, slashed its workforce, and halted a portion of payments to partner organizations around the world, including those doing lifesaving work. Few blockchain-based projects have managed to achieve large-scale use in the humanitarian sector. Linda Raftree, a consultant who helps humanitarian organizations adopt new technology, says there’s a reason for that—the incorporation of blockchain technology is often unnecessary. “I don’t think we were ever able to find an instance where people were using blockchain where they couldn’t use existing tools.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine. At first her goals were relatively modest: She hoped to prove a theorem or two that would make incremental progress on the problem, as many other mathematicians had done before her. While working together, the pair fell in love and eventually started a family. Math is full of enormously complicated abstract objects that are impossible to study in their entirety. But often, mathematicians have discovered, it’s enough to look at a small fragment of such an object to understand its broader properties. Similarly, when mathematicians want to understand an impossibly convoluted function, they might only need to look at how it behaves for a small subset of possible inputs. That can be enough to tell them what the function does for all possible inputs. The McKay conjecture is another example of this principle. It says that if you want to formulate a thorough description of a group—an important mathematical entity that can get prohibitively difficult to study—you only need to look at a tiny piece of it. They made partial progress—and in the process they learned a great deal about groups, which are abstract objects that describe the various symmetries of a mathematical system. “I wanted there to be parades,” said Persi Diaconis of Stanford University. John McKay—described by one friend as “brilliant, soft-spoken, and charmingly disorganized”—was known for his ability to spot numerical patterns in unexpected places. The Concordia University mathematician is perhaps most famous for his “monstrous moonshine” conjecture, which was proved in 1992 and established a deep connection between the so-called monster group and a special function from number theory.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

My ears always perk up a bit when I run across something original for the kitchen. An internal thought process goes from something like there's probably a good reason why no one has ever done this before to how has no one ever done this before? Devices that allow you to do a bit of smoking while indoors pop up every few years, and often end up being a bit too impractical to make many waves, or fun but very niche. Unfortunately, some indoor smokers can set your smoke alarm off with relationship-damaging frequency. Those very thoughts ran through my brain when I heard about a new electric indoor smoker from GE which I called in to test. This oven had just enough promise to make me wonder if it might be worth one more try. It was easily the largest appliance on my kitchen counter, about twice the size of my microwave, Sparky Jr., whose spot it took. (Sparky took its temporary placement on top of the cooler like a champ.) Small for a built-in oven, very small for a smoker, but hey, it's in my kitchen and not out on my cold, wet deck in Seattle. You feed standard barbecue wood pellets into a little hopper on the top, they drop into the interior and get toasty, then fall into a metal "waste bin" that's half filled with water, ensuring they are properly extinguished. There's a well laid out control panel on the front. It’s also important to state up-front that it retails for $1,000, though the price fluctuates a lot and has dipped as low as $500 at times.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

“​​This was Steve's last deal,” Siri cofounder Tom Gruber told WIRED. “He was personally involved in all stages of the deal, negotiating the deal and following through, making sure that we were successful at Apple after they bought us.” Early Siri worked, but only within highly limited functional silos. “What we acquired was a demo that would work great for a couple of people but wouldn’t scale to our user base … there was a lot of smoke and mirrors behind the original Siri implementation,” former Apple exec Richard Williamson told the Computer History Museum in a 2017 interview so long it involves costume changes. But now, even with AI, Siri reportedly still can’t be relied on to actually work when facing real-world use. Chatbot tech may not be fully mature, but it is at least prevalent enough to be used daily by nontechnophiles on competing platforms. You'll need to be comfortable handing over large amount of data to make Alexa work its best, while OpenAI’s Sam Altman seems happy to destroy entire categories of jobs at the altar of progress. A cleaner, more positive image has for decades been part of the company’s appeal, and that includes a very clear focus on privacy. “There's one good excuse for [Apple] waiting, and that is if you really hold the privacy and data stewardship value as a sacred right. And [Apple] does say those kinds of words,” says Gruber. The upcoming Siri is based around two core components. A small language model runs on the iPhone itself, while more complex queries are offloaded to OpenAI. It is estimated Apple’s on-iPhone AI systems consist of around 3 billion parameters, where some estimates place the number of parameters in OpenAI’s GPT-4 at 1.8 trillion—six hundred times the number.

Scientists scrutinizing the seafloor beneath a calving iceberg found a remarkable array of living creatures, switching up notions of how the giant chunks of ice affect their immediate environs. The scientists investigated a region of seafloor recently exposed by the calving of a gigantic iceberg—A-84—which is as large as Chicago. The team found a surprisingly vibrant community of critters on the seafloor below where A-84 was once attached to an ice shelf attached to Antarctica. “We didn’t expect to find such a beautiful, thriving ecosystem,” said Patricia Esquete, the expedition’s co-chief scientist and a researcher at the University of Aveiro in Portugal, in a British Antarctic Survey release. The team found large corals and sponges supporting other lifeforms, including icefish, giant sea spiders, and octopus. The scientists who made the discovery were part of a team aboard the Schmidt Ocean Institute’s R/V Falkor (too), a 363-foot-long (111-meter) vessel that’s regularly revealing hidden details of life at the bottom of Earth’s oceans. “The ice loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet is a major contributor to sea level rise worldwide,” said the expedition’s other co-chief scientist, Sasha Montelli, a researcher at University College London, in the same release. “Our work is critical for providing longer-term context of these recent changes, improving our ability to make projections of future change — projections that can inform actionable policies. Though the ice shelf disappearing is worrying, it also creates an opportunity for scientists to explore an area that is otherwise even harder to access.

Despite recent leaps forward in image quality, the biases found in videos generated by AI tools, like OpenAI’s Sora, are as conspicuous as ever. A WIRED investigation, which included a review of hundreds of AI-generated videos, has found that Sora’s model perpetuates sexist, racist, and ableist stereotypes in its results. “OpenAI has safety teams dedicated to researching and reducing bias, and other risks, in our models,” says Leah Anise, a spokesperson for OpenAI, over email. She says that bias is an industry-wide issue and OpenAI wants to further reduce the number of harmful generations from its AI video tool. OpenAI declined to give further details, except to confirm that the model’s video generations do not differ depending on what it might know about the user’s own identity. The “system card” from OpenAI, which explains limited aspects of how they approached building Sora, acknowledges that biased representations are an ongoing issue with the model, though the researchers believe that “overcorrections can be equally harmful.” The issue largely stems from how these systems work, slurping up large amounts of training data—much of which can reflect existing social biases—and seeking patterns within it. Other choices made by developers, during the content moderation process for example, can ingrain these further. Research on image generators has found that these systems don’t just reflect human biases but amplify them. Past investigations into generative AI images have demonstrated similar biases across most tools. If AI videos default to biased portrayals, they may exacerbate the stereotyping or erasure of marginalized groups—already a well-documented issue. “It absolutely can do real-world harm,” says Amy Gaeta, research associate at the University of Cambridge’s Leverhulme Center for the Future of Intelligence.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

For example, we objectively discover the rule that if we type white, the stones between them will turn white. It feels like nature is white and you are black, and you are fighting each other. This is the essential feature of quantum mechanics. Altara continues to accumulate a huge amount of data, and overlays and remembers various historical events, from the past to the future, that is, states of various time axes. History state refers to the concept that a state at a certain time can be obtained by measuring the states of various steps from the initial time of a calculation by superimposing them. Therefore, "Altara" which remembers various time axes states can be said to have realized its history state in a sense. However, it would be difficult to create an actual digital twin with such precision. It's like calculating all atoms on Earth. Kenji's head is similar to a quantum computer! The first and most interesting thing about Summer Wars is that the main character, Koiso Kenji, is studying Shore's algorithms. Shore's algorithm was a major catalyst for quantum computer research in the 1990s, and was created to efficiently solve prime factorization. In the work, when the virtual world "OZ" is taken over, Kenji works on prime factorization to decipher code. The setting that if a majority of OZ users are taken over, the entire world will also be taken over is similar to decentralized consensus building in blockchain technology.

Take a recent Vulnerable U report concerning the Cyberhaven data loss prevention service, which discovered that an extension chrome used by more than 400,000 of its customers contained code to steal their private/sensitive data. This extension remained available for more than 30 hours before being deleted. This then allowed an attacker to download a new malicious version of the extension. This story is becoming more and more common: an element as harmless as an extension contains a malicious code ready to steal your secrets and your data. It is more difficult to protect yourself in a digital world. Regarding browser extensions, it is unfortunately the end of the end user to be vigilant about what he installs on his computer. In this context, how to ensure your safety and avoid installing dangerous browser extensions? Here are five ways to know if you can trust an extension. My first rule is to trust only extensions published by large companies. This following rule is similar to that which I use for mobile devices: install only the essential elements. I no longer count the number of times I had to delete purchasing extensions of user browsers because they had fallen into the panel. As a general rule, if software has not been updated in the last 30 days, I immediately be wary and I find out about the developer to see if he has abandoned the project or if he has a doubtful reputation. For example, if you add an extension that has no reason to access keyboard entry or webcam, think twice before installing it. On each extension, click Details and consult the required authorizations. If you notice something suspect, immediately delete the extension. Unfortunately, this kind of situation is not going to disappear. Despite all the attention of safety browser developers, malicious actors are always one step ahead. If the answer is no, do not install it.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Apple last updated its affordable “SE” series smartwatch back in 2022. Priced at $250, the smartwatch offered a decent mix of wellness capabilities, clean design, and long battery life. But in time that has elapsed since, rivals like Samsung, OnePlus, and Mobvoi have offered fantastic value-centric models of their own. As per Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the affordable model might be in “serious jeopardy” due to hardware-related snags. So far, Apple has sold the Watch SE in a chassis made out of aluminum, while the pricier models have also experimented with stainless steel and titanium. Moreover, it would allow Apple to experiment with more color options, without worrying too much about the durability aspect or the weight factor. However, it doesn’t feel nearly as premium as metal, an aspect that has been a hallmark of Apple’s smartwatch aesthetics for years. If you’re looking for a precedent, stray no further than the iPhone SE family. It served a 5G tax not too long ago, and then asked for much higher price tag with the iPhone 16e makeover. We’ve heard rumors that Apple wanted to bring the cost of its next SE smartwatch further down to tackle the hot competition. With that in mind, it’s entirely plausible that the lower-cost models are made out of plastic, while the more upscale trims stick with an aluminum build. On the other hand, given Apple’s environmental commitments and the slow phasing out of plastic-based materials in its products, shifting to an all-plastic look for the Watch SE 3 sounds a tad odd. Other rumors predict a size boost, going from 40mm to 41mm on the smaller version, while the bigger variant jumps from 44mm to 45mm.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A mathematical problem that had resisted for over a century - 125 years, to be precise - has finally been resolved by a team of scientists from the University of Michigan and other research institutes. Basically, Hilbert (Si) asked how it was possible to derive some laws of physics axiomatically, in particular those relating to the behavior of fluids on different spatial stairs: well, the three authors of the work just loaded on Arxiv claim to have successfully unified these laws, which could have profound implications in the field of fluidodynamics and improve our understanding of the atmosphere and oceans. The question raised Hilbert, roughly summarized, is this. The second part of the sixth problem of Hilbert is precisely relating to the derivation and unification of these three treatments from first axioms and in an organic and harmonious theory. Why did it take so much time to solve this mathematical problem? One of the main difficulties is linked to time, a subtle and complex entity whose understanding and treatment has been pursued for some time (sic!) In particular, as Deng explains, some of the laws in question (those of Newton, for example) are symmetrical with respect to the temporal reversal, in the sense that they "work" whether the weather flows forward and backwards, that is, in other words, they do not identify a privileged direction for the passage of time. Our daily experience, however, tells us the opposite - we know that time always flows in one direction - and so they also make the laws of Boltzmann and thermodynamics, which precisely indicate a precise direction for the passage of time, from the past to the future, that is, (to be more technical) from a state of minor entropy to a state of greater entropy. But despite success, they are not yet satisfied: "The solution of Hilbert's problems - Hani said - is not yet complete. We know that the models, at a certain point, at a certain spatial or temporal scale, cease to work. Scientists are particularly interested, in particular, to understand what happens to even more microscopic stairs, when fluid equations lead to the so -called singularity, that is, to mathematical solutions that have no sense from the point of view of physics. As the authors admit, however, it could still take a long time.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Kurosawa gave us an incredible amount of masterpieces, a films that sometimes sanctioned the birth of a precise genre, others have been able to influence others and often have also gone further, creating a real universe in its own right. Few authors are on a par for depth of analysis and writing, by visual power, dynamism, for the ability to be a point of contact between the West and the East, moving between epic and normality, outlining a humanity always in the balance between heroism and fragility, between light and darkness. Today that the anniversary of his birth occurs, honoring him with a top 5 of his most important films is a task not only heavy, but also very difficult, so much is the quality expressed by the Japanese director, still today a monument of the Rising Sun.

After 35 years Pretty Woman remains an absolute cinematographic myth, in spite of the very profound changes of society and above all the image of the woman. Still, the endless success of this film tells us a lot about how much a certain type of cinema and narration continues to exercise a unique charm, even when it would be to be relegated to oblivion. Pretty Woman still continues to depopulate every time it arrives on television or streaming, and after 35 years it continues to be indicated as one of the most loved by the general public. Garry Marshall in that end of 1989 is found in his hands a script that owes a lot, indeed very much, to the fairy tale of Cinderella, and which clings for every minute to all the stereotypes that the romantic comedy and not only has had as regards the relationship between the sexes during the 1980s. In fact, it is impossible to split Pretty Woman from what the American society had been up to that moment, the narration on the small and large screen that represented fashions, principles, more or less declared ideals. The 80s are the years of consumerism, of popular glamor, of the supermodels that begin to become absolute different, of the pop cultures and the extreme sexualization of all its elements. But they are also the years of reaganism, of the woman who becomes more and more declination of male desire, a body to possess and admire. It is what you have, you are what you are aesthetically and poverty is worse than everything, even of cruelty. And to say that Pretty Woman initially had to be a dramatic film, there was to be of half drug addiction, crime and a critical look at the Los Angeles of those years. Those who decide to turn everything towards fairytale tones is a woman, the producer Laura Ziskin, on the indication of Jeffrey Katzenberg, at the time at the top of Disney.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Earlier this year, the Italian government explored the possibility of an agreement with Starlink, but opposition officials denounced the idea of a contract with Musk, citing his comments on Ukraine. Negotiations are on hold for now, he said, and Italy will focus on what is "useful and safe" for the country in its defense contracts. Authorities in Italy are currently not working on a contract with Starlink but will consider it in the future, Crosetto said. "The technical plan is not being discussed. Starlink internet access is crucial to Ukraine's battlefield communications.

SpaceX's full rocket start plan could affect the beach days. Should the company successfully transform its starting place into an official city, SpaceX could take full control over the closures of streets and beaches in Boca Chica, Texas. SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk first proposed the idea of ​​a Starbase city in 2021. Most of the residents are SpaceX employees who submitted a petition in December 2024 to ask for a choice regarding the decision to make Starbase their own community. Now an additional law was submitted on March 14 that SpaceX would grant control over road and beach closings for its rocket activities. Although the law, submitted by two Republican senators, does not mention SpaceX, it refers to counties with room ports and beach access "on the border to the Gulf of Mexico or its tidal boundaries," says My RGV. Cameron County officers are currently responsible for closing streets and beaches. However, there are concerns that SpaceX's starting place damages the surrounding landscape. In addition, SpaceX from the Environmental Protection Agency is faced with fines of almost $ 150,000 because the company allegedly tipped out pollutants into a Texas water without permission. At the beginning of last year, SpaceX also announced plans to open a shopping center and a restaurant worth $ 15 million near Starbase.

Saturn will temporarily lose its iconic look from our point of view on earth and appear as a pale, yellow ball without its swirling rings that envelop the gas giant. This rare phenomenon occurs every 13 to 15 years when the earth moves through the ring level of Saturn. Saturn is surrounded by billions of buzzing pieces from comet, asteroids and broken fragments of moons that were captured in the orbit of the planet. The exquisite ring system extends up to 175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) away from the planet and consists of tiny, dust -sized, icy grains to chunk the size of a house, according to NASA. While it creeps up the sun, the inclination of Saturn shifts in relation to the earth, which means that its rings disappear from our field of vision when our planet crosses its level. However, the rings disappear from our field of vision between these two phases. With a powerful telescope you could see a very thin line that runs around the middle of Saturn. Saturn's rings will not be fully visible from the earth for a few months, and we could possibly only see them again in November, according to Earth.com. Although it is not ideal for most of the sky observation, the heavenly phenomenon is a rare insight into how the planets move around our common star.

For several seasons, a war has been raging between Japan's hero alliance and the super villains around Shigaraki and All for One. The seventh season already ended with severe losses on both sides. My Hero Academia manga was completed at the end of 2024 - according to 430 chapters and an epilogue in December. Series creator Kohei Horikoshi has not commented on new projects since then, but regularly provides fans with new illustrations and fan art of his cult figures. But before we finally have to say goodbye to Deku and Co., there is a new spin-off: My Hero Academia: Vigilantes starts on April 7, 2025. The series plays around five years before the main series events and revolves around so -called "vigilante" - so not licensed heroes, who still protect their city. Also there: younger versions of fan loves like Mirko and Eraserhead. Even if it is still unclear what Horikoshi is working next, My Hero Academia has long since found its place among the very big ones in the anime and manga world. But as we know it from superheroes: every end is also a new beginning. This article has been translated from gizmodo us by Franco Nervegna.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

We may not have an agreed-upon definition of AI “agent” yet, but a multitude of startups want to create “agentic” tools to automate various tasks online. One such firm, Browser Use, has attracted a ton of interest from developers and investors thanks to its solution that makes websites more “readable” for AI agents. Browser Use told TechCrunch that it has raised a sizable $17 million seed funding round led by Felicis’ Astasia Myers with participation from Paul Graham, A Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners. The company’s funding hasn’t previously been reported. Browser Use, part of Y Combinator’s 2025 winter batch, has gained notoriety in recent months. Magnus Müller and Gregor Zunic founded Browser Use last year through ETH Zurich’s Student Project House accelerator. Müller had been working on web-scraping tools for years, and met Zunic in 2024 while the pair were getting their master’s degrees in data science. There’s an increasing number of AI companies that want to make their agents interact with websites more gracefully, and Müller thinks Browser Use can become a “fundamental layer” serving this need. He added that more than 20 companies in the current Y Combinator Winter batch used Browser Use for their own requirements. “We think web AI agents are the next frontier that really helps with the end-to-end automation of human tasks,” Myers told TechCrunch. “[W]eb AI agents are this dynamic bridge between static pre-trained models that are mostly text-focused in the ever-changing digital landscape.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Turkey’s slide into autocracy seems to have reached a tipping point, evident from the recent events that have thrown the nation’s fragile democratic framework into a major crisis. Detained in a dawn raid just before he was about to be nominated as the presidential candidate for the opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), İmamoğlu now faces charges of embezzlement, corruption and terrorism. Critics see this as a calculated move by Erdoğan to neutralise the only figure who could challenge him in elections due before 2028 but might take place earlier. The opposition claims that three lakh people flooded Istanbul’s streets on a Friday night, defying roadblocks and riot police. Playing a key role in this unfolding drama by siding with the government is Elon Musk’s social media platform X, which has suspended numerous accounts linked to opposition figures and democracy activists. Erdogan: "You can't go out and protest in Turkey anymore against me! This hardline stance is mirrored online, where X’s suspensions have silenced key voices of resistance. The targeted accounts, largely university-associated activists with lakhs of followers, were instrumental in sharing protest locations and rallying students. This is not a new tactic for X in Turkey; during Erdoğan’s 2023 re-election campaign, the platform restricted content to maintain its accessibility, bowing to government pressure. Transparency reports underscore this compliance: X honoured 86 per cent of Turkey’s content takedown requests in the second half of 2024, up from 68 per cent earlier that year. These suspensions are based on Turkey’s 2022 social media law, a sweeping measure that grants the state vast and ambiguous powers to suppress online content. While lawful under Turkish statutes, these actions reflect a broader strategy to mute dissent as the nation’s democratic credentials crumble. As mayor of Istanbul, which is Turkey’s cultural and economic heart, his detention strikes at the opposition’s core, threatening to dismantle the existing system that has allowed electoral competition, however imperfect, to persist. Yet, opposition victories, such as last year’s municipal elections, have kept the system from tipping fully into autocracy. Barring İmamoğlu from the presidential race would mark a decisive shift, aligning Turkey with countries like Russia, Belarus or Azerbaijan, where elections occur but lack meaning. It could cement Turkey’s transformation into an outright autocracy, a trajectory critics argue Erdoğan has pursued relentlessly. The United Nations has put out a vanilla statement, while the US State Department has declined to comment, calling it Turkey’s “internal decisions.” President Donald Trump’s recent call with Erdoğan, hailed as “transformational” by Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, hints at a burgeoning alliance, possibly linked to Turkey’s strategic roles in Syria and Ukraine. Trump’s administration, indifferent to democratic backsliding abroad, aligns with a global climate that enables autocrats. European leaders, meanwhile, once vocal critics of Erdoğan, have softened their stance. By acquiescing to Turkey’s demands, X secures its foothold in a vital market, but at the cost of amplifying the censorship Musk claims to abhor.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Tencent is expanding its AI portfolio with the launch of Hunyuan T1, a reasoning-optimized model designed to compete with China’s top-tier large language models, including DeepSeek-R1. Developed in-house and deployed on Tencent Cloud, the model is part of a broader strategy to provide enterprise-ready AI solutions tuned for cost efficiency, Chinese-language tasks, and stable performance. Tencent positions the model as a commercially viable tool for businesses that need high-performance reasoning without the compute burden or licensing costs tied to Western alternatives. Before T1 entered the spotlight, Tencent introduced Hunyuan Turbo S on February 27. Hunyuan T1 is Tencent’s most reasoning-optimized model to date, positioned to meet the needs of enterprise users requiring structured logic, consistent long-form generation, and reduced hallucination. Tencent has applied reinforcement learning techniques to improve long-form consistency and minimize factual hallucination. T1 is engineered specifically for complex reasoning tasks, such as structured problem-solving, mathematical analysis, and decision support. Tencent has applied reinforcement learning techniques to improve long-form consistency and minimize factual hallucination. Chinese Language Optimization: The model performs particularly well in Chinese-language logic and reading comprehension tasks, aligning with Tencent’s focus on domestic enterprise use cases. The model performs particularly well in Chinese-language logic and reading comprehension tasks, aligning with Tencent’s focus on domestic enterprise use cases. Tencent’s Hunyuan T1 is positioned as a high-performance reasoning model optimized for enterprise-grade tasks in Chinese and mathematical domains. Combined with full domestic hosting on Tencent Cloud and integration into productivity tools like Tencent Docs, Hunyuan T1 is tailored for business environments that demand robust logic, regulatory compliance, and native language fluency. Knowledge: Hunyuan T1 scores 87.2 on MMLU PRO, outperforming DeepSeek R1 (84.0) and GPT-4.5 (86.1), though trailing o1 (89.3). It achieves the highest score on DROP F1 at 93.1, ahead of DeepSeek R1 (92.2), GPT-4.5 (84.7), and o1 (90.2). On Zebra Logic, it scores 79.6, just behind o1 (87.9) but well above GPT-4.5 (53.7). It achieves the highest score on DROP F1 at 93.1, ahead of DeepSeek R1 (92.2), GPT-4.5 (84.7), and o1 (90.2). On Zebra Logic, it scores 79.6, just behind o1 (87.9) but well above GPT-4.5 (53.7). Its AIME 2024 score is 78.2, slightly under DeepSeek R1 (79.8) and o1 (79.2), but far above GPT-4.5 (50.0). Its AIME 2024 score is 78.2, slightly under DeepSeek R1 (79.8) and o1 (79.2), but far above GPT-4.5 (50.0). Code: The model scores 64.9 on LiveCodeBench—marginally below DeepSeek R1 (65.9) and o1 (63.4), but significantly ahead of GPT-4.5 (46.4). This positions it as capable, though not exceptional, in code generation. Tool Use: Hunyuan T1 scores 68.8 on T-Eval, which measures AI’s ability to operate external tools. During its Q4 2024 earnings call, executives explained how inference efficiency—not compute scale—is guiding their deployment choices. Tencent recently confirmed its use of DeepSeek’s architecture-optimized models to reduce GPU consumption and improve throughput. “Chinese companies are generally prioritizing efficiency and utilization—efficient utilization of the GPU servers. Rather than scaling GPU clusters, it is focusing on lower-latency, inference-tuned models that are lighter to run. The strategy mirrors research-backed methods like Sample, Scrutinize and Scale, which emphasize verification at inference time instead of more resource-heavy training. Despite this efficiency focus, Tencent isn’t backing away from hardware investments. These chips support Tencent’s integration of DeepSeek models into backend services, including those powering WeChat. Additional restrictions may follow, complicating cross-border AI adoption for models developed in China. Back home, the Chinese government is actively promoting newer AI startups. Reuters reportes that Beijing is supporting Monica, the developer of Manus, an autnomous AI agent. While Tencent is not directly involved with these initiatives, its leadership in the domestic cloud and software markets ensures it remains central to the broader AI ecosystem. A portion of that growth was attributed to enterprise AI development, with the company signaling further investment in 2025 to expand both consumer-facing and enterprise-ready AI infrastructure. Rather than scaling up a single large model, the company is aligning each release with precise usage scenarios: complex logic for internal analytics, fast interaction for customer interfaces. This approach may appeal to businesses seeking AI solutions that are fully hosted in China and compliant with national data standards. The company’s combination of in-house development, selective external adoption, and integrated product rollout suggests a strategy rooted in adaptability rather than volume. As policy pressure and hardware constraints reshape the market, that approach could prove increasingly pragmatic.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Mr. Musk, as the architect of a group he called the Department of Government Efficiency, has taken a chain saw to the apparatus of governing, spurring chaos and dread by pushing out some 100,000 federal workers and shutting down various agencies, though the government has not been consistent in explaining the expanse of his power.

But in selected spots across the government, SpaceX is positioning itself to see billions of dollars in new federal contracts or other support, a dozen current and former federal officials said in interviews with The New York Times.

The boost in federal spending for SpaceX will come in part as a result of actions by President Trump and Mr. Musk’s allies and employees who now hold government positions. The company will also benefit from policies under the current Trump administration that prioritize hiring commercial space vendors for everything from communications systems to satellite fabrication, areas in which SpaceX now dominates.

Already, some SpaceX employees, temporarily working at the F.A.A., were given official permission to take actions that might steer new work to Mr. Musk’s company.

The new contracts across government will come in addition to the billions of dollars in new business that SpaceX could rake in by securing permission from the Trump administration to expand its use of federally owned property.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has reaffirmed on Saturday that Apple is on track to introduce next-gen 2-nanometer (2nm) chips in its iPhones by late 2026. Kuo shared an update on X, saying Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is making strong progress with its 2nm technology. He noted that trial production yields reached 60–70% three months ago and have since improved significantly. iPhone 17 lineup will be powered by TSMC’s improved 3nm chips using the N3P process, an improved version of its 3-nanometer chip technology, offering better performance and lower power usage compared to the earlier N3B process. This is a more efficient and powerful version of the 3nm tech used in iPhone 16. iPhone 18 models are expected to feature Apple’s first 2nm chips, made by TSMC. However, due to high production costs, not all iPhone 18 versions may get the 2nm chip. Some could stick with the 3nm generation. The move to 2nm chips would mark a significant jump in performance and power efficiency for Apple devices, possibly boosting battery life and speed for future iPhones. Kuo first made this prediction in 2024 and is now doubling down, pointing to steady progress at TSMC as a key sign Apple is on schedule.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Apple’s rumored plan to redesign the Apple Watch SE with a plastic casing is reportedly in “jeopardy,” according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Citing internal sources, Gurman claims Apple’s design team is dissatisfied with the look of the plastic model, while the operations team is struggling to make the casing meaningfully cheaper than the current aluminum version.

Gurman first reported on the potential shift to plastic last year, noting that the change was aimed at reducing production costs and making the device more appealing — and affordable — for younger users. A plastic chassis could allow Apple to offer the Watch SE in a range of vibrant colors, reminiscent of the iPhone 5c, which launched in bold hues like blue, pink, green, and yellow.

However, despite the potential benefits, the redesign now appears unlikely to move forward. Design quality concerns and cost inefficiencies have reportedly stalled the effort, casting doubt on whether a plastic Apple Watch SE will ever reach the market.

The current Apple Watch SE, released in 2022, starts at $249 in the U.S. A plastic version was expected to come in at a lower price point, potentially making it a more attractive option for families or first-time smartwatch users. It remains unclear whether Apple will still pursue a kid-focused model in a future iteration.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

One thing you can certainly say about Linux is that it does not lack variety. You can find desktop distributions that are equal parts art and functionality, as well as those created purely for the sake of efficiency. If you're a big fan of the Dr460nized release, fear not, as it will most likely always be a part of the Garuda lineup, which features several different releases. Also: This Linux distro can be used without installation (and it's totally free) One of those releases is the Mokka Edition, a Catppuccin-themed KDE Plasma desktop experience that offers a fresh and inviting take on the KDE environment. I'm reviewing this edition, and it's a game-changer for those who prioritize aesthetics. For those who aren't familiar, the Catppuccin theme is a popular, visually appealing theme for Linux desktops that offers soothing pastel colors and supports GTK-based desktop environments like GNOME, Cinnamon, XFCE, and Mate. Well, the Garuda team has applied this theme to KDE Plasma, and it's spectacular. Before we get too far into this, know that Garuda is an Arch-based distribution. So, if Arch isn't your cup of kefir, you might want to pass on this fantastic distribution. Other than the Catppuccin theme, what else is new with Broadwing? Garuda Rani Welcome App: A new unified tool that combines the functionality of the previous welcome, gamer, and assistant apps to make system setup and management easier for users of all types. I've reviewed and used KDE Plasma for a long time, and the Mokka Edition of Broadwing might be the best-looking take on this open-source desktop I've ever seen. Of course, such opinions are quite subjective, and if you're not a fan of pastel purples, you might be repulsed by the color scheme. Also: The 4 most Windows-like Linux distros to try because change is hard Of course, I'm a writer by profession, so the ability to work with documents is crucial for me. Even though this is a KDE Plasma desktop, you won't find the Discover app store. Because this is all based on Arch, which prefers GUIs like Octopi. Although I'd much rather have Discover at my disposal, Octopi does a fine job. You can install various apps for important categories in the Setup Assistant. That's big for someone who regularly configures, reconfigures, tweaks, bends, and changes his desktop on a whim. That could very well be because I ran my test as a virtual machine with limited resources, but it seems to me the Catppuccin theme lacks a bit of stability. For example, when I open the FireDragon web browser, it opens fairly quickly, but some of the theme elements appear with a slight delay. On top of that, after opening the web browser, things started slowing down a bit. Also: What's the best tiling window manager for a Linux beginner? Next, I ran the upgrade tool to see if there were any updates. If you're interested in seeing the majesty of the Garuda Broadwing Mokka edition, I suggest you do so on a spare computer and not as a virtual machine. My guess is that much of Mokka's "wobbliness" will not appear when running on bare metal. Either way, Garuda Broadwing is a brilliant take on Arch Linux, and if you're looking for what might well be the most beautiful Linux distribution of 2025, this could be it.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/23/rumored-apple-watch-se-3-serious-jeopardy/'>Rumored plastic Apple Watch SE now in ‘serious jeopardy’ for two key reasons</a></h2><b>Source:</b> techmeme&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-23 00:00:00 <p>
According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the rumored plastic design for the next-generation Apple Watch SE is now in ‘serious jeopardy.’ There are some internal conflicts regarding the plastic housing, and it isn’t necessarily cheaper to produce.

Last year, Bloomberg reported that Apple was considering switching to a ‘rigid plastic’ for the next-generation Apple Watch SE. This would’ve potentially allowed for an even lower starting price.

Now, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports that the switch to plastic is ‘in serious jeopardy.’ Design teams don’t like how it looks, and it isn’t currently cheaper to produce than the already-existing aluminum casings:

And the redesigned, plastic Apple Watch SE I’ve written about is also in serious jeopardy. The design team doesn’t like the look, and the operations team is finding it difficult to make the casing materially cheaper than the current aluminum chassis.

Whether or not Apple overcomes these hurdles remains to be seen. That said, Apple Watch SE will be coming up on 3 years old this fall, so we’ll likely see a refresh in about 6 months, plastic or not.

Gurman also reiterates that the next-generation Apple Watch Ultra will gain support for satellite texting, as well as 5G connectivity.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/23/apple-watches-with-cameras-rumored/'>Apple Watches With Cameras Rumored, But FaceTime Unlikely</a></h2><b>Source:</b> techmeme&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-23 00:00:00 <p>
Apple is working on multiple new Apple Watch models with built-in cameras for release by 2027, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.



In his Power On newsletter today, Gurman said Apple plans to add a camera in the screen area on a future Apple Watch Series model. On a future Apple Watch Ultra, he expects the camera to be on the right side of the watch, near the Digital Crown.

Gurman does not expect the cameras to enable FaceTime on the Apple Watch. Instead, he said the cameras would enable Visual Intelligence on future Apple Watch models. This feature would allow Apple Watch users to quickly receive information about items or places their surroundings. For example, they could point their Apple Watch at a restaurant to receive its hours or ratings as they pass by on the sidewalk.

Visual Intelligence debuted on all iPhone 16 models last year, and it is available on iPhone 15 Pro models starting with iOS 18.4.

Apple is also planning to add tiny cameras to future AirPods models, he said. The cameras will bring more AI capabilities to both the Apple Watch and AirPods, allowing Apple to better compete with other AI-powered wearables on the market.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
