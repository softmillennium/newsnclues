                <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, 台積電) is expected to lead its peers in the advanced 2-nanometer process technology.

The company's sophisticated products and large production scale are expected to allow it to dominate the global 2-nanometer process market this year, TrendForce Corp analyst Joanne Chiao said.

TSMC is scheduled to begin mass production of chips made on the 2-nanometer process in its Hsinchu fab in the second half of this year and hold a ceremony on Monday next week to mark its efforts to expand 2-nanometer production in its Kaohsiung plant.

TSMC, which has grasped almost all global businesses in chips used in artificial intelligence applications by using its 3-nanometer process technology, expects its 2-nanometer process to attract even more orders, as more clients have expressed interest in using the new technology.

Samsung so far has not built a large customer base for its 2-nanometer process yet, and its major user is expected to come from its system LSI units, Chiao said.</p></b>

                <p>Nature is full of surprises - and one of the largest may be flying around, discreetly, with a branch in the beak.

It is the newborn crow, a species that has been impressing scientists around the world for its highly intelligent behavior. According to research, this bird has a level of cognition comparable to that of an eight-year-old. And the most fascinating: it creates, transports and adapting tools to solve complex problems.


The crow that manufactures tools and plans the future

While most birds simply seek food with the beak or claws, the newbird goes beyond: it manufactures its own tools. Using branches, leaves and even vegetable fibers, it shapes hook-shaped objects to reach hidden insects in narrow holes or cracks.

This ability to transform the environment and using available features to facilitate tasks is already a milestone of intelligence - but this crow is even further.


A creative mind that learns and adapts

Most impressive it is that crows not only use tools - they also change them to improve their efficiency. In observational experiments, scientists have realized that these birds adjust the shape and size of their utensils according to the kind of challenge they face. This demonstrates not only creativity but also a sophisticated understanding of cause and effect.

In addition, they often carry their tools with them, which indicates an awareness of the environment and future challenges.


The crow and its intelligence comparable to the human

Professor John Marzluff of the University of Washington points out that this kind of intelligence is comparable to that of human children. At the age of eight, a child can already plan, predict consequences and solve problems based on previous experiences - exactly what scientists have observed in these crows.

In laboratory tests, birds have shown to understand complex logical relationships, manipulate objects strategically, and even expect the best opportunity to act. According to the researchers, all this requires not only memory, but also abstract reasoning.


A well-known recognition

Thanks to decades of study and observation, the newborn kick was officially recognized as the smartest bird in the world. Your ability to think, plan and adapt strategies put this species on top of the list of animals with remarkable intelligence - rivaling even with some primates.</p></b>

                <p>Artificial intelligence is increasingly present in areas that once seemed exclusively human - such as art, aesthetics and tourism.

Recently, an AI system has been trained to identify the most beautiful countries in Latin America. Using parameters such as geographical diversity, environmental preservation, architecture and cultural wealth, the algorithm analyzed images and data to reach a conclusion.


The top 3 reveals destinations that combine lush nature, contrasting landscapes and cities full of history. 

Brazil: lush nature and vibrant contrasts

At the top of the list is Brazil. Artificial intelligence highlighted the diversity of landscapes, from the Amazon rainforest to the beaches of the Bahian coast, through rock formations and tropical forests.

The analysis also valued the way nature is part of urban life, especially cities such as Rio de Janeiro.


Argentina: Geographic Extremes and Urban Charm

Argentina appears in second place for its impressive geographical variety. Artificial intelligence evaluated images of Patagonia, with its glaciers and lakes, the Andes, the Pampas Plains and the Mendoza vineyards.

Each region contributes a unique and imposing type of beauty.


Chile: extreme geography and contrasting landscapes

In third position is Chile, whose singular geography caught the IA's attention. The country extends from the Arid desert of Atacama in the North to the cold fields of Patagonia in the south.

This extension allows a contrast of rare scenarios in the world.

The algorithm valued, in particular, the Torres del Paine National Park, the Gray Glacier, the Central Valley vineyards and the coastal landscapes of Valparaiso.</p></b>

                <p>On March 10 and 11, the Interconnects forum took place in Rennes, organized by an association of communities pushing digital boundaries in territorial public service.

Generative AI was invited to the program, taking center stage in discussions and exchanges, with two extreme attitudes emerging: radical rejection of certain AI applications and a marked attraction for accelerated modernization.

The administration discovered teleworking, videoconferences, and revised operating methods during the Covid-19 pandemic, an effect comparable to that of generative AI, according to Greensi.

Two years ago, Montpellier prohibited the use of Chatgpt to its agents due to political and ethical considerations linked to data protection and digital sovereignty.

This prohibition triggered a virtuous dynamic by accelerating reflection around AI, leading to the setup of a territorial committee dedicated to AI and specific training for elected officials and executives.

A citizen convention on AI collected opinions and concerns from inhabitants regarding possible uses, ethical or environmental risks associated with AI.

The results were published online, strengthening transparency and acceptability of projects among citizens.

Resistance is often the first step in change, indicating that an approach has started, according to Greensi.

The Occitanie region highlighted a high demand for modernization among its agents, revealing a great motivation to become actors in change through adopting roles as "volunteer IA referents".

The regional IA strategy focuses on absolute transparency of decision-making processes, human control over algorithms, digital sovereignty, reinforced data security, and other strict principles.

This framework allows agents to commit to experimenting and integrating new technologies while having a clear political line in mind.

Diagnosis by the Hauts-de-France region revealed that 62% of professions could be affected by AI, with automation of repetitive tasks or low-added-value functions on the rise.

Professions linked to computer sectors and administrative management will need to integrate new working practices based on constant interaction with sophisticated technological tools.

A strengthening of social dialogue is required to prevent potential social tensions and the establishment of observatories for monitoring the social impacts of AI would be beneficial.</p></b>

                <p>If your washer has released an unpleasant smell right after each washing cycle, know that this discomfort has explanation - and solution.

Dirt, accumulated humidity and lack of proper ventilation are the main responsible for bad odor, which may even transfer to clothes.

Fortunately, with simple cleaning and conscious use, it is possible to end this problem and improve machine performance.

According to the organization of consumers and users (occupation) of Spain, the main cause of the bad smell is related to the accumulation of dirt and moisture in internal parts of the machine, such as the filter and the sealing rubber.

These waste favor the proliferation of bacteria and fungi, especially when the washer is kept closed after use, preventing air circulation.

Over time, this damp and muffled environment favors the appearance of mold and bad smell, which also eventually impregnate clothes.

To solve the problem, the first step is to do a deep cleaning. Occupa recommends sanitizing the filter and rubber of the door, which accumulate detergent residues, leaks and various dirt.

The filter should be taken carefully and cleaned with running water, removing any obstruction. Rubber can be cleaned with a damp cloth and white vinegar or baking soda, which help eliminate mold and neutralize odors.

After manual cleaning, make an empty wash cycle, with water at high temperature (between 70 ° C and 90 ° C), adding sodium baking soda in the soap compartment.

This process helps disinfect the interior of the drum and remove waste that is not visible to the naked eye.

If the bad smell has already contaminated the clothes, it is important to wash them again at high temperature-since the fabric allows it-using a cup of baking soda in place of the traditional soap.

Bicarbonate acts as a natural cleaning agent, eliminating odors and waste without assaulting the fabric fibers.

Another effective option is to add white vinegar during rinse. Its disinfectant properties help remove impurities and neutralize persistent odors.

Just avoid exaggeration as overuse can damage long-term clothing.

After washing, hang the clothes in the sun in a well-ventilated place. Sunlight helps eliminate moisture and prevent the bad smell from returning.

Prevention is the key to keeping the washer always clean and efficient.

One of the most common errors is excessive use of soap. Following the manufacturer's instructions on dosage prevents accumulation of waste and internal obstructions.

Leaving the washer and soap compartment open after each use is also essential. This practice allows the machine to vent and dry completely, avoiding the emergence of mold.

It is recommended to do hot water washing cycles periodically, especially if you usually use low temperature programs that do not eliminate residues effectively.

Occupa recommends cleaning the filter at least once a month and regularly check the rubber and soap compartment.</p></b>

                <p>The so-called "Smart Cities" have been gaining protagonism as a model of urbanization for the future.

Megaprojects that promise to revolutionize urbanism Among the largest projects on the planet is Neom, in Saudi Arabia. With an estimated investment of US $ 1.5 trillion by 2030, the plan includes cities without cars, 100% renewable energy and advanced technological infrastructure, such as high-speed trains and artificial intelligence applied to urban management.

Japan also bets on this future with Toyota Woven City. More than a city, it is a living laboratory where companies test mobility and automation solutions in real time. With its first phase completed, the project should start receiving residents in 2025.

In China, Chengdu Future Science and Technology City wants to become the largest applied science center in the country, with fully automated mobility and unused functional areas. Oceanix Busan, in South Korea, proposes a floating and self-sustaining community, designed to face the increase in sea level.

The challenges behind the glamor Despite futuristic concepts, not all smart cities have a promising trajectory. The case of Masdar City in the United Arab Emirates illustrates the risks: designed to house 50,000 people, today is just a research center with few inhabitants, marked by high costs and low functionality.

Another example is Quayside, in Canada, a partnership from Google canceled after data privacy problems and divergences with the government. Even with billions invested, the project ended before leaving the paper.

In addition, complaints about labor violations in major works, such as those linked to the Vision 2030 project of Saudi Arabia, light ethical and humanitarian alerts about the backstage of these megaconstructions.

Europe shows that it is possible While some cities are built from scratch, others reinvent themselves intelligently. London, Copenhagen, Zurich and Barcelona adopt technologies that improve mobility, reduce energy consumption and involve citizens in public decisions.

With sensors, 5G networks and digital platforms, these cities can monitor traffic, air quality and resource consumption in real time. In addition, they invest in transparency and popular participation through applications and open data.

Singapore, for example, combines technology with social welfare. There, sensors monitor seniors at home, drones fight dengue outbreaks and self-employed buses already circulate in specific areas.

And Brazil in this race? Although still far from the sophistication of Asia and Europe, Brazil has good examples in its territory. According to the Ranking Connected Smart Cities 2024, Florianópolis leads with a strong presence of startups, almost total coverage of 5g and accelerated expansion of the IT sector.

Vitória and São Paulo also stand out with advances in health, mobility and connectivity. Salvador is the only representative of the Northeast in the top 10, investing in lighting and intelligent traffic lights and almost total 5G coverage.

However, the country still faces barriers such as lack of integration between sectors, internal resistance in public agencies and difficulties in adapting urban legislation to new technologies.

Conclusion The future is promising, but requires caution Smart cities promise to revolutionize the way we live, work and interact with the environment. But for this to happen in an ethical, functional and inclusive way, planning, transparency and involvement of society is required. More than technology, the future of cities depends on human vision and collective responsibility.</p></b>

                <p>Don't fall in love: the AI is not your confidant. Although your answers appear human and empathetic, you should never forget that artificial intelligence has no emotions or loyalities.

It is simply a model that is trained to answer you naturally. Share personal data with her can bring you into a vulnerable position. Your full name, address, ID card number, passwords or any private information should not be part of your conversations with the AI.

Not only because they could be saved depending on the platform, but also because you could unintentionally leave a trace that is difficult to delete. In addition, this information can be used in the wrong hands for social engineering attacks or identity theft.

And although it may feel like a harmless "conversation", the data you share could be used for training future models or stored without your knowledge. Therefore, no matter how friendly the conversation sounds, you should always have in mind that you don't talk to a person.

Don't play the doctor (or lawyer) AI is great in giving you technical information, complex concepts or clear explanations on illnesses, laws or procedures. But that doesn't make her an expert in medical diagnoses or legal disputes.

Searching for advice on physical symptoms, health diagnoses or treatments is risky, no matter how convincing the answer sounds. Only an experienced specialist can offer you the right orientation. The same applies to legal issues.

Consult yes. Based on the answer of a AI based, no. Sometimes the AI can make mistakes or simply cannot be up to date, which adds another risk level.

Don't ask for inadmissible: the dark side of the AI It is one thing that artificial intelligence is powerful, and something completely different that it can (or should) do everything you ask.

If your intention is to search for illegal content, such as pirate links, hacking methods, weapon production or how to access non-authorized services ... simply stop. AI is trained to reject all inquiries that are considered dangerous, illegal or inappropriate.

Regardless of whether it is content for adults that violate community guidelines, the production of malware or instructions for the damage of others or yourself - the platforms have made it clear: they will not allow this.

In addition, such inquiries can trigger internal warnings and even automatic reports. You could target, only because of a small experiment or a misunderstood curiosity. Is that worth the effort?

Impossible pictures: the puzzle of the watch Although it may seem like a joke, there are certain things that the visual AI simply cannot do.

A short, curious (and frustrating) example is the request to create a picture of a watch with pointers that show 12:03 or 6:28. No matter how detailed yours are: In most cases, the AI watches that are set to 10:10 will show.

This is because the models tend to reproduce images that they often saw during their training, and clocks at this time are most common in reference material. This type of mistake shows that the AI is still far from being perfect, and that even the simplest inquiries can uncover surprising restrictions.

The future is uncertain ... even for the AI One of the most common temptations is to ask artificial intelligence to predict the future.

From the winning numbers of the lottery to the results of the next football game or the Oscar winners. But although she can give you probabilities or analyze statistics, the AI is not a fortune teller.

She does not have the ability to see what has not yet happened. So if you are looking for certainties about future events, you shouldn't put your hopes for your answers.

Beware of sensitive topics Do you want to talk about politics? Discuss religion? Ask AI about sensitive topics like these.

AI may not be able to provide you with an accurate or helpful response, as its training data may be biased or incomplete. In addition, discussing sensitive topics can be a complex and nuanced issue that requires human judgment and empathy.

Therefore, it's best to avoid asking AI about sensitive topics unless you're sure it will be able to provide you with a helpful and respectful response.

So what can you ask? The AI is ideal for learning, researching, exploring ideas, solving technical doubts or helping you with better expression.</p></b>

                <p>The US Internal Revenue Service has assured undocumented workers they can file taxes without fear of deportation.

Under the proposed agreement, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would be able to send requests to the IRS for names and addresses of people suspected of being undocumented.

The IRS would then cross-reference those names with its confidential taxpayer databases to confirm their information.

This deal reportedly only covers immigrants who have already been ordered to leave the country and specific requests.

It may seem surprising that the IRS doesn't already share this information, but there are good reasons for that.

Sharing taxpayer information is against the law, except in rare cases requiring a court order beforehand.

The IRS has long promised undocumented workers it's safe for them to file taxes without fear of their information being shared with law enforcement.

Undocumented workers have paid $100 billion in taxes in 2022 and can't claim benefits like the earned income tax credit or Social Security retirement benefits.

Per the Tax Policy Center, an immigrant who comes to the US at age 25 will pay $200,000 more in taxes than what they'll get in government benefits.

The Trump administration has been pushing for the IRS to share data on undocumented workers to aid in its mass deportation campaign.</p></b>

                <p>Not invited to a birthday, being alone during the break or feeling different from others - that can be childhood for many seemingly insignificant episodes, but for many these experiences have left a lasting impression.

Psychology has shown that early exclusion has an impact on how one person interacts with others, affects their self-esteem and perception of the world. However, these scars not only create challenges, but can also produce unexpected strengths.

The 11 properties from the childhood exclusion

According to experts, people who have experienced social exclusion in childhood tend to develop certain emotional and behavior-related patterns that remain until adulthood. Some of these patterns can represent injuries, while other valuable aids become life.


Social uncertainty: Fear of rejection or social fear is one of the most common consequences. The constant concern as you are perceived, can cause you to avoid new interactions or strain excessively to please.

Perfectionism: For some, the need for recognition means that they do extreme efforts to prove their value through success or excellence.

Creativity: Refuge in the imagination is a common reaction to loneliness. Many people who have been excluded in childhood develop artistic skills or innovative forms of expression.

Untested loyalty: If you enter into meaningful ties, you are extremely loyal and committed, and appreciate those who offer them support.

Extreme empathy: After you have felt the pain of rejection, you are often very sensitive to the suffering of others and offer great support.

Low self-esteem: The feeling of not being enough can remain until adulthood and make it difficult for them to recognize their own value.

Excessive analysis: They are hyper-vigilant to signs of disapproval or exclusion, which can cause them to interpret situations negatively or to doubt the intentions of others.

Desire to please others: To avoid rejection, you can develop a tendency to adapt to what others expect and to push your own interests aside.

The need for external validation: Many of their decisions and emotions depend on the consent of others because they want to strengthen their self-esteem through social recognition.

Insolation potential: Some decide to withdraw from others so as not to feel the pain of rejection again. This barrier can make it difficult for you to build trust in new people.

Resilience: Despite the difficulties, many develop a high level of adaptability and the ability to overcome adversity and use their experiences as a source of strength.

The exclusion experiences in childhood do not define the future of a person, but can still leave valuable lessons. Therapy and work on personal development can help transform these scars into powerful tools for life.

Learning to build healthy relationships, strengthen self-esteem and become independent of external validation are basic steps for those who have experienced exclusion.</p></b>

                <p>Apple is exploring how it can make the Apple Watch an AI wearable.

To get there, it will need to build cameras to the device and then build on its Visual Intelligence work from the iPhone.

The company is planning something similar for its AirPods earbuds.


It would like to switch to its own AI models in time, as it does with the hardware components and software that it ships with its devices. Today, Visual Intelligence uses OpenAI and Google models.


An Apple Intelligence-powered Apple Watch is still years away, Gurman cautions.

After all, this is the company that can’t ship conversational Siri features because of its stringent privacy guarantees.


The cameras are apparently coming to the standard and Ultra versions of the Apple Watch, though the placement of those cameras will vary by device. Standard Apple Watches will use an in-display camera, while the Ultra will place the camera on the side, near the crown and side button.


Adding Apple Intelligence to the Apple Watch feels like an obvious next step, but because of the device’s low-end processor, it’s unlikely that any of the processing will occur locally.


Which is fine, given how tightly the device is tied to the iPhone, which now includes the necessary internals. Gurman expects to see camera-equipped Apple Watch and AirPods models appear in 2027 at the soonest.


Apple recently reorganized the teams working on Apple Intelligence and conversational Siri.

Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell has been tasked with fixing Siri as part of a larger shake-up. The Vision Pro team is being split into separate hardware and software groups. Former AI lead John Giannandrea “isn’t being fired” despite the Siri problems, and a few other execs will move laterally.

The plastic Apple Watch SE redesign is in "serious jeopardy," which feels a bit dramatic given the low stakes.


It appears that the plastic cases aren't less expensive than aluminum, and the design team isn't happy with the look. The next Apple Watch Ultra will apparently include satellite texting support, thanks to a new MediaTek modem.


Gurman also notes that smart ring maker Oura hired an Apple veteran away from the company.

The next Apple Watch Ultra will apparently include satellite texting support, thanks to a new MediaTek modem.

This year’s thin iPhone 17 Air will lead to a folding iPhone model in 2026 that will cost $2000 and compete head-on with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold.</p></b>

                <p>Decades ago, acid rain was a devastating environmental threat. Today a new danger falls from heaven and their effects could be worse.

Air pollution has adopted a different form and is almost invisible this time. Recent research has shown that microplastics are contained in the rain that falls through cities, fields and oceans.

The problem with microplastics is not limited to seas and rivers. These pollutants are now in the air and fall from the sky together with the rain, spread over the entire planet.

Microplastics arise from the decomposition of plastic waste on streets, landfills and in the oceans. Muffle into microscopic particles, they are transported from the wind into the atmosphere, where they can cover thousands of kilometers before returning to earth with the rainfall.

This contamination is alarming because microplastics cannot be easily dismantled, which means that they can remain in the environment for centuries. In addition, their ability to penetrate into ecosystems and the human body represents serious health risks.

The rain of microplastics represents a greater challenge than acid rain for various reasons: they are not easy to eliminate, they affect human health, and they spread worldwide.

Microplastics are found in drinking water, in food and even in the air we breathe. They were also found in marine organisms, birds and people, which indicates that they have entered the food chain.

The long-term effects of microplastics are still being examined, but it is assumed that they can affect the respiratory system if inhaled, disturb the endocrine system due to chemical compounds available in plastics, cause inflammation and cell stress, and be related to chronic diseases.</p></b>

                <p>Researchers studying jubart whales on California's coast have detected a significant change in their vocal behavior.

The decrease in corners, essential for communication, guidance, and feeding, is being interpreted as a clear alarm on the growing impact of climate change on marine ecosystems.

When silence speaks louder 
 

In Monterey Bay, scientists at the Monterey Bay Research Institute (Mbari) have noted that, in periods of unfavorable ocean conditions, whales drastically reduce their vocalizations.

This was found during a study conducted between 2015 and 2021, when a marine heat wave severely affected the region. Food availability - such as krill, sardines, and anchovies - has been critically reduced.

These factors have altered the migratory behavior of whales and caused a clear drop in the frequency and intensity of their corners.

The singing as an ocean thermometer 

Oceanographer John Ryan explains that the songs of whales are true indicators of the health of the marine environment. "All whales showed the lowest levels of vocalization when ocean conditions were in the worst condition."

These songs fulfill various vital functions: they serve for communication, space orientation, social interaction, and even to locate food.

Their absence represents more than a behavioral change - it is a sign of environmental alert.

Direct impacts of seas warming 

The analysis showed that as ocean temperature increases and prey availability decreases, whales are forced to migrate to new areas in search of food. This requires more energy, increases stress, and directly affects its reproduction and survival capacity.

The study also concludes that when the water temperature returns to colder levels and food abundance improves, whale corners become frequent again.</p></b>

                <p>More than half a million migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela will lose their legal status in the USA during the new decision of the Trump administration.

The government of Donald Trump has tightened its immigration policy with a measure that affects more than 500,000 people who have joined the United States under the CNHV program.

The CNHV program was introduced to give citizens of these countries legal and safe access to the United States and thus avoid dangerous border crossings. It allowed migrants to apply for entry from abroad and to fly directly into the country with a temporary work permit.

However, the Trump government has decided to abolish this legal protection. According to the reference that was published in the Federal Register, the measure is formalized on March 25 and affects around 532,000 people. The Ministry of Internal Security has announced that people have to leave the country without another legal basis for their stay in the United States or have to expect deportation.

The abolition of the program represents a drastic change in the United States immigration policy and exacerbates the application of the law itself for those who have entered completely legally and without criminal records. This has alerted numerous human rights organizations that indicate the social and humanitarian effects of this decision.

For many of those affected, this decision means that they are exposed to the fear of deportation to countries in which their lives could be in danger. In addition, those who have managed to gain a foothold, find work and have started building a life in the USA must now endure the uncertainty about their future.

The abolition of the temporary status also means a significant loss of workers in sectors in which these migrants are busy, which could affect the local economy in some communities.</p></b>

                <p>Humanity stood on the edge of a space disaster that could have brought our civilization to a standstill, and nobody noticed it.

The Pentagon warns of a Russian nuclear weapon in orbit, which threatens the global space infrastructure.

The commander of the US World Commercial Command, General Stephen Whiting, has expressed an urgent warning: Russia could develop an antisatellitarian nuclear weapon that would endanger the safety of all of humanity.

During the conference "Air, Space & Cyber" in Washington, Whiting emphasized that it would be a disaster to allow Russia to develop such a weapon.

According to him, this violation of the 1967 space contract would not only have fatal consequences for the United States, but also for all countries that rely on the space infrastructure.

Whiting emphasized that the influence of a nuclear explosion in orbit would make no difference: it would destroy both American and Russian, Chinese, Indian, European and Japanese satellites.

A collision that almost happened

On February 28, 2024, a driving Russian satellite, the Cosmos 2221, was to collide with the American satellite Timed, which monitors the earth's atmosphere.

The distance between the two was only 10 meters, which corresponds to a fatal strip in space.

If the collision had taken place, it would have created millions of particles that fly at speeds of 16,000 km/h.

Pam Melroy, deputy administrator of NASA and former astronautin, admitted that she was "horrified".

The impact would have triggered the dreaded Kessler syndrome, a chain reaction that would destroy a large part of the global space infrastructure.

The situation was so serious that NASA couldn't do anything to prevent it: Both space vehicles had no way to control.

The problem is not only the number of satellites, but also the so-called "zombie satellites", which are no longer functional but continue to take up space.

According to the NASA, the solution should be to issue regulations, include the systems for maneuverability and to return from orbit in future starts.

In addition, it is urgently needed to limit the spread of commercial networks that endanger sustainability in space.</p></b>

                <p>The Pentagon has recognized maneuvers of combat operations in space by Chinese spaceships and surprised the world with movements that are reminiscent of science fiction films.

Space is not just a territory for scientific explorations, but the new battlefield for the world powers. The recent discoveries of Chinese spatial operations have triggered concern in Pentagon because they recognize China's technological progress in the field of orbital warfare.

China's satellites involved in these maneuvers include the Shiyan-24c and two Shijian-6 05 (A and B), which were allegedly started for scientific research purposes in 2024. However, the Pentagon sees a clear military goal in these maneuvers: satellites of other powers such as the USA, Russia, India or Japan to record or to go out of operation.

In contrast to ground-based air maneuvers, the struggle in space brings much greater technical challenges. The US mission Victus Haze, which is planned for autumn 2025, is trying to simulate space scenarios by working with private companies such as Rocket Lab and True Anomaly.

The North American strategy stipulates that the Chacal spaceship is initially started by True Anomaly, followed by a Rocket Lab spaceship that has to pursue and defend simulated attack vectors. The aim is to train the reactionability in real time to potential attacks in space, which will be crucial for the future military defense of the United States.

China's ability to carry out combat maneuvers in space before the United States does this questions the American military leadership role in orbit. According to General Guetlein, the difference in skills has decreased alarming, which requires a re-evaluation of the USA defense strategy.</p></b>

                <p>A gigantic iceberg broke off the ice layer in the Antarctic and revealed part of the ocean that had not seen any light for decades.

The scientists took this rare opportunity to explore the unknown, and what they found left everyone speechless. Gigantic spider crabs, octopuses and previously seen species appeared from the frozen abyss and challenged everything we knew about life in depths.

On January 13, an iceberg of about 30 kilometers of length broke off from the ice layer on the Antarctic coast and exposed a section of the ocean that had not seen any light for decades. Scientists on board the Falkor research ship did not hesitate to take this opportunity to explore the mysterious ecosystem that had remained hidden under the huge layer of ice.

The head of the expedition, Patricia Esquete, admitted that the event was so unexpected that the team hired all ongoing work to examine the location. Although expectations were low because it was not believed that many life forms could thrive in such an extreme environment, the finds were overwhelming under the iceberg.

A variety that exceeds all expectations

The find was surprising: an abundance of marine life that is adapted to extreme conditions. Among the discovered creatures were huge spider crabs, octopuses, deep-sea fishing, corals and hundreds of old sponges in the form of vases. The scientists estimate that after a comprehensive analysis they could identify dozens of new species.

The scientific team, consisting of experts from the Schmidt Ocean Institute, documented the discovery with a remote-controlled underwater vehicle that took pictures and collected samples from the sea floor. The amazement was overwhelming because biodiversity under the Antarctic ice exceeded all previous expectations.

According to Esquete, biodiversity contradicts conventional theories about marine life in Polar regions. In other parts of the ocean, nutrients come from the surface thanks to photosynthetic organisms, but under the Antarctic ice, oceanic currents and meltwater seem to be the key to supporting these complex biological communities.

Effects of climate change

The effects of climate change on these ecosystems are of great interest to researchers, since global warming may lead to a more frequent breakdown of icebergs in the coming years, which exposed zones that have been hidden for centuries.

The scientists believe that some of the creatures discovered may be completely new to science. Crustaceans, sea apples, unusual fish and snails are part of the provisional catalog of the organisms found. However, the formal identification of these species could require months or even years of analyzes.

Jyotika Virmani, director of the Schmidt Ocean Institute, emphasized that it was the key to being in the right place at the right time to observe a unique natural phenomenon. This extraordinary opportunity could offer new research opportunities on how climate change affects life on the sea floor.</p></b>

                <p>While a large part of Latin America is preparing for a growth circuit and new settings, a key state remains.

With numbers that confuse and alarming signs, his job market seems to be trapped in a limbo.

At a time when many Latin American countries show signs of relaxation and economic expansion, one of them seems to be stopped abruptly.

Argentina positions itself as the country with the worst expectations for the creation of jobs in Latin America, according to the latest data collected by ManpowerGroup.

The survey on employment expectations (ENE) for the second quarter of 2025 shows a worrying value of 0 % in net employment expectations.

This stagnation is in a strong contrast to some macroeconomic forecasts that predict up to 5 % for the same year.

Nevertheless, this economic optimism does not yet find any reverberation in the labor market.

The companies that should actually expand mainly decide to maintain their current structures or even reduce them.

The report shows that 25 % of employers plan to increase their staff while 23 % provide layoffs.

The remaining 44 % do not expect changes in your team.

Although this may seem like a balance, the net result leads to an absolute zero in the expectations of the creation of jobs.

Luis Guastini, President of ManpowerGroup Argentina, said that after months of uncertainty, the corporate environment shows a certain stability, but does not result in a specific willingness to attend.

In fact, he found that Argentina has been struggling with employment expectations that are significantly below the regional and global average for more than a decade.

"We had positive figures, but never over 5 or 6 %," emphasized Gutini.

Among the causes of the low willingness to attend the weak local demand, the low export competence and the lack of incentives to expand the companies should be emphasized.

These factors create an environment of extreme caution in the private sector, where many decisions are postponed, in the hope of a more tangible and sustainable recovery.

The difference becomes even more obvious if you compare Argentina's numbers with those of countries like the USA and Mexico.

According to the same survey, net employment maintenance in the United States reaches impressive +34 %, while Mexico shows an encouraging +33 %.

Even smaller countries such as Costa Rica and Canada exceed +30 %, which reflects a global tendency to reactivate the labor market.

Of the 42 countries evaluated by Manpowergroup, 41 project an increase in their attitudes.

The exception is Argentina.

This number is not only symbolic, but also represents an alarm sign for the isolation of the country in terms of working dynamics.

Sectors such as information and financial technology show some optimism in the country.

In contrast, key areas such as healthcare and life sciences report a significant decline in their attitudes.

The result is a fragmented labor market situation in which progress is limited to very specific niches.</p></b>

                <p>Seven years ago, three classmates at the Technical University of Munich believed their student engineering project might hold some promise in the private sector.

At the time, one of the co-founders, Daniel Metzler, led a team of 40 students working on rocket engines and launching sounding rockets. Josef Fleischmann was on the team that won the first SpaceX Hyperloop competition. Together with another classmate, Markus Brandl, they crafted rocket parts in a campus workshop before taking the leap and establishing Isar Aerospace, named for the river running through the Bavarian capital.

The company's orbital-class first rocket, named Spectrum, is set to lift off from a shoreline launch pad in Norway as soon as Monday. The three-hour launch window opens at 12:30 pm local time in Norway, or 7:30 am EDT in the United States. "The launch date remains subject to weather, safety and range infrastructure," Isar said in a statement.

Isar received a launch license from the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority on March 14, following the final qualification test on the Spectrum rocket in February to validate its readiness for flight. Notably, this will be the first orbital launch attempt from a launch pad in Western Europe.</p></b>

                <p>Months after announcement, Arm is finally making its ASR (Accuracy Super Resolution) upscaler open to developers to integrate into their games.

It's not far-fetched to believe this technology will support chips like Qualcomm's Snapdragon X series SoCs as well.

ASR is built on AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 technology, and at its initial unveiling, Arm claimed 53% more FPS at 2x upscaling with the Immortalis-G720 GPU (Dimensity 8400 and 9300).

Moreover, it is likely to be supported on a majority of Arm devices, irrespective of the vendor.

The company showed off ASR in Unreal Engine 5 delivering up to 30% more FPS, with no compromises to the visuals.

Game developers utilizing these engines should find ASR integration relatively straightforward due to pre-baked plugins for Unity and Unreal Engine later this year.

Sticking to mobile-only SoCs, ASR should work on Qualcomm's Snapdragon, MediaTek's Dimensity, Google's Tensor, Samsung's Exynos, and Apple's A-series/M-series hardware.</p></b>

                <p>André Esser created an ASCII video camera project using a Raspberry Pi.

There are some Raspberry Pi projects that are just so cool, you don't have to bother to ask why someone would ever create them.

If you're not familiar with ASCII art, it's a way of displaying images using text in something like a terminal.

The characters comprise the image in either a simple but crude fashion or with great complexity.

ASCII art was much more common in retro computing, but you can still find some fun modern examples.

In this creation, the Pi is able to convert video frames into ASCII art, which is then displayed frame by frame to make a video feed using Python.

This demo is in black and white, which is great for showing off the ASCII format's potential.

However, Esser wanted to make something interactive for the conference and took things a step further by integrating a camera connected to the Raspberry Pi as a main input source.

The project requires no special components, just a Raspberry Pi 5 with a screen and a Raspberry Pi camera module.

Esser was kind enough to make the project open source and has shared all the source code over at GitHub for anyone interested in recreating the project or just digging deeper to see how it works.</p></b>

Apple is working on adding cameras to the Apple Watch in order to enable AI features like Visual Intelligence within the next two years, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman in today’s Power On Newsletter.

The cameras will be “inside the display” for the standard Series Watch, while the Apple Watch Ultra would feature it on the side, next to the digital crown and button, according to Gurman. With them, the Apple Watch would be able to “see the outside world and use AI to deliver relevant information,” which he says is also the plan for camera-equipped AirPods Apple is rumored to be working on.

The Visual Intelligence features that these devices would use debuted on the iPhone 16, where it works with the phone’s camera to do things like add details from an event flyer to your calendar, or look up information about a restaurant. It’s underpinned by AI models from other companies, but Gurman writes that Apple hopes to power the feature with its own in-house models by 2027, when he says the company plans to release these new Apple Watches and AirPods.</p></b>

                <p>The Apple 2024 M4 Mac Mini Desktop is available at Amazon for $499, its lowest price to date.

Apple has released a mini PC in its Mac Mini range. The machine features an M4 chip and comes with 16GB of RAM and 256 GB of internal storage using an SSD.

This edition features Apple's M4 chip, not to be confused with the M4 Pro, which is a bit more powerful. We had the opportunity to review the Mac Mini M4 Pro last year and loved our experience. For a Mini PC this size, it has plenty to offer, making it a great option for someone that wants a machine oriented for work purposes rather than gaming.

The SoC powering the Apple Mac Mini is an M4 chip. This features a 10-core processor alongside a 10-core GPU.

This mini PC lives up to its name with a form factor that measures in at 5 x 5in. It's created by Apple, it's easy to integrate the Mac Mini into a family with numerous iDevices.

The system comes with two USB Type-C ports, three Thunderbolt ports, and an HDMI output for connectivity. For network support, you can take advantage of WiFi 6 wireless connections or use a hard wire with its Ethernet jack. As far as audio support goes, it has a built-in speaker alongside an optional 3.5mm audio jack for connecting external audio peripherals.

The Mac Mini supports iPhone Mirroring, allowing users to access their iPhone from the computer and control and interact with it in real time.</p></b>

                <p>Storing digital content in DNA is an emerging technology that takes advantage of the molecule's density, durability, and low power needs.

DNA can last for generations, unlike NAND flash and HDDs that degrade in years or decades, at best. It also offers a data capacity about 100 million times higher than typical data storage systems.

Retrieving data from DNA storage is a complex and rather slow process. A breakthrough made by Israeli researchers speeds up the activity by 3,200 times, reports TechXplore.

A team at Technion – Israel Institute of Technology has created an AI tool that makes retrieving digital information stored in DNA dramatically faster and more accurate. The system, named DNAformer, is 3,200 times faster than the most accurate previous methods and is claimed to deliver excellent results, showing promise for efficient, large-scale data storage using biological material.

This new approach allows for processing 100MB in only 10 minutes, compared to several days using the best current methods. On a test involving 3.1MB, the tool handled several types of content: a still image in color, a short sound recording of Neil Armstrong on the Moon, a text about DNA's storage advantages, and randomly generated data mimicking encrypted or compressed files.

To store data, customized DNA molecules are synthesized. Reading the information requires sequencing, but this introduces various errors like deletions or substitutions, and returns unordered and sometimes corrupted data copies. 

The researchers plan to adjust DNAformer for specific needs and believe the system can scale for industrial and research applications. It is designed to be flexible and can evolve with future progress in how DNA is written and read, helping meet the growing demand for sustainable and high-capacity storage solutions.</p></b>

                <p>Nvidia's R570 branch of GPU drivers came with several instability issues that troubled RTX 50 series owners, and reports suggest the impacts were felt by some using older GPU architectures as well.

A few hotfixes down the road, Nvidia has pushed fixes for these black screen issues specifically for the RTX 50 series. However, it appears that older GPUs continue to suffer.

Users report that these instability issues manifest in the form of BSODs, hard crashes which typically require a reboot, and system freezes. A significant chunk of these reports stem from application and feature-specific crashes, particularly when enabling Nvidia's DLSS Frame Generation feature.

The community has found several workarounds, with a few common fixes including rolling back drivers, disabling Frame Generation and/or G-Sync, downgrading the DLSS version, and lowering refresh rates.</p></b>

                <p>The Compal Adapt X is a modular laptop concept designed by ODM Compal, which has won an iF Design Award 2025.

 

Compal's design features multiple usage modes, reduced upgrade frequency, and should cut down on e-waste. It takes a leaf out of the Framework laptop playbook with its modularity. The product is described as a hybrid/convertible, with components being usable slotted together or independently. Compal says this concept design appeals to customers because it offers multiple usage modes, reduced upgrade frequency, and should cut down on e-waste.

 

The main image shows the Compal Adapt X broken down into its various components. To the left is a 14-inch screen, to the right is a 16-inch screen with a keyboard deck in front of it and a modular dock to the right. The user can decide which screen size they need for the day, according to Compal's idea.

 

The stand under the screen appears to make the laptop as a whole pretty strong/rigid when put together. The stand can also be flexed back, similar to how an old Lenovo Yoga tablet design worked. The main overlap with Framework is the USB-C connected I/O, which you see separated in the top image.

 

Compal says this dock can offer "expanded IO ports and modular AI units." It's not clear what hardware is between the screen and keyboard deck in the 16-inch screen configuration.</p></b>

                <p>Apple is reportedly planning to add cameras to future Apple Watch models.

As part of this plan, Apple is considering adding cameras to both its standard Series watches and Ultra models.

The current idea is to put the camera inside the display of the Series version, like the front-facing lens on the iPhone.

The Ultra will take a different approach, with the camera lens sitting on the side of the watch near the crown and button.

Apple will seemingly be able to put the camera on the side of the Ultra because of more internal space.

This will let users point the watch’s camera at an object to access more information.

However, do not expect to use the camera for making FaceTime calls.</p></b>

                <p>The iPhone 18 phones are tipped to use A20 chips, which could be based on an improved 2nm process.

Those CPUs could be based on an improved 2nm process, meaning faster, more efficient chips.

This comes from well-respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has reiterated a prediction he made six months ago: that the A20 chipsets destined for the iPhone 18 handsets will use a 2-nanometer production process.

The current iPhone 16 devices use A18 processors made with 3nm technology. A switch from 3nm to 2nm essentially means more transistors can be packed inside a processor – making it speedier and more efficient.

iPhones get faster every year of course, but a change in the manufacturing process like this means significant performance gains, above and beyond the usual increases.

Reiterating my prediction from six months ago: the 2H26 new iPhones (iPhone 18) will be powered by TSMC’s 2nm chips.

There remains some ambiguity around whether or not the chips for every iPhone 18 model will get this 2nm upgrade.

It would well be that even Apple and its supply chain partners aren't sure yet. The iPhone 18 handsets aren't going to see the light of day until September 2026, so there's a lot of time yet for the manufacturing processes to be refined.

In the meantime, we've got the iPhone 17 series to look forward to, which should be unveiled in September 2025. These phones should get upgrades to A19 processors – but they'll be built using the existing 3nm process technology.</p></b>

                <p>A games console modder has revealed a crab-themed PS One creation dubbed the 'Playstacean.'

GingerOfOz's real-world remake of an artwork of the same name by Anh Dang, a concept artist on League of Legends, is crab-solutely stunning.

GingerofOz has had the idea to build a real-life Playstacean in his mind for a few months, ever since he first spotted Anh Dang's artwork.

With the actual console in hand, GingerOfOz started work on 3D CAD artwork, melding the original Playstacean visual with the real-world console's physical form.

The original PS One's motherboard didn't survive this project unmodded. GingerOfOz documents several trims of the ground plane, but nothing major or too worrying.

After many hours of design, modifications, and test prints, GingerOfOz was happy enough with his Playstacean to call it a day.

                <p>Nvidia's GTC 2025, an annual event where the company lays out its roadmap of new products and vision for the coming year, created a flood of news as the company extended its roadmap out to a four-year horizon with plenty of mind-bendingly powerful new AI GPUs and systems.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also clarified the company's recent maneuvers behind the scenes, including that it is now building production silicon in the US in TSMC's Arizona fab, and he also threw cold water on rumors of Nvidia's participation in a supposed industry consortium that would take over rival company Intel's chipmaking fabs.

That news comes as Intel begins shuffling its foundry management structure under new CEO Lip-Bu Tan.

Nvidia is dominating not only the AI market, but also the entire fabless chipmaker realm. Early in the week, we learned that Nvidia's explosive growth equates to making nearly as much revenue as its next nine fabless competitors combined last year.

The real fireworks began the following day when Nvidia unveiled its new roadmap. Nvidia announced its new Rubin GPUs for 2026, Rubin Ultra in 2027, and teased an all-new Feynman architecture that will arrive in 2028, extending its public roadmap out to a four-year window.

That included the headline announcement of the company's next-gen Blackwell Ultra B3000 GPUs.

Looking out to Nvidia's most exotic high-powered AI systems, the company had its future Rubin Ultra systems on display, and we had the chance to get up close and personal with the new rack design.

These powerful GPUs will come with four reticle-sized GPU dies crammed onto a single chip, which is a major increase over previous generations of Nvidia's datacenter GPUs.

Nvidia also showed off its latest H100 Tensor Core GPU, which features a 550mm2 die size and packs 576 GB of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) on each card.

The company's latest A800 accelerator will use the same HBM memory technology to deliver up to 10.5 petaflops of performance in a single unit.

The massive data training sets have to be stored somewhere, and storage solutions tailored specifically for AI use cases are now proliferating.

I'm always a sucker for high-capacity SSDs, and Kioxia's new PCIe 5.0 LC9 certainly fits that bill.

Kioxia announced the new 122.88TB SSD at the show, and it packs a big performance that matches the big capacity with up to 15 GB/s of bandwidth on tap.

Seagate also had a proof-of-concept demo that included NVMe HDDs.

When it comes to NVMe, we naturally think of SSDs, but HDDs with the interface have been under development for quite some time.

Extra performance isn't the goal, though. Seagate says utilizing the NVMe interface will enable scaling pools of SSDs up to the exabyte level by utilizing the fast and flexible NVMe-over-Fabrics (NVMe-oF) protocol.

Solidigm's D7-PS10101 E1.S is watercooled but also hot-swappable, meaning it can be changed without shutting down the server.</p></b>

                <p>Companies employ Bluetooth in many proprietary features, like Apple’s AirDrop and Google’s Quick Share.

The U1 chip in Apple devices enables ultra-wideband (UWB) technology to determine the direction of your phone and help you share files with nearby devices, AirDrop uses Bluetooth for the initial discovery process and then switches to Wi-Fi to transmit files. Google merged Nearby Share with Samsung’s Quick Share in 2024, and much like AirDrop, it uses Bluetooth to establish a connection and then Wi-Fi to transfer files.

These are just two examples. Google also has a standard called Fast Pair that quickly connects a wireless device with a smartphone, and it uses Bluetooth too.


Bluetooth is named after King Harald “Bluetooth” Gormsson—the logo is a combination of his runes for his initials—who had a literal blue tooth (it was dead). He united Denmark and Norway in 958. This short-range radio technology grew from a 1996 meeting between Intel, Ericsson, and Nokia.


The standard is managed by a not-for-profit Bluetooth Special Interest Group, or Bluetooth SIG, and it's headquartered in the US. While there are thousands of members, the most influential companies help shape the direction of the standard and include companies like Ericsson, Intel, Nokia, Apple, Microsoft, Lenovo, and Google.


Every version brought myriad incremental improvements to make Bluetooth faster, more efficient, more secure, and less buggy, but we’re just going to run through the headline features here. Bluetooth 1.2 in 2003 figured out how to avoid Wi-Fi interference and enabled quicker pairing, helping to popularize the standard.

Bluetooth 2.0 in 2004 brought EDR (Enhanced Data Rate), tripling the data rate from 1 to 3 Mbps. Bluetooth 2.1 in 2007 brought SSP (Secure Simple Pairing), enhancing security and reducing power draw.


Bluetooth 3.0 + HS (High Speed) in 2009 bumped rates up by initially connecting via Bluetooth and then switching to Wi-Fi. Bluetooth 4.0 LE (Low Energy) landed in 2010 and, as the name suggests, reduced power requirements even further.

Bluetooth 4.1 in 2013 allowed Bluetooth devices to communicate with each other. Bluetooth 4.2 boosted data rates and IoT connectivity in 2014.


Bluetooth 5 in 2016 increased the potential range massively, going from around 50 meters to well over 200 meters. But range is dependent on the power class, and there are three classes. Class 1 devices have the greatest range and use the most power, Class 2 are limited to around 10 meters, and Class 3 is only 1 meter.


Bluetooth 5.1 in 2019 brought faster pairing and better tracking accuracy. Bluetooth 5.2 in 2020 allowed for multiple simultaneous data streams and better control over the power and signal required by connected devices.


Bluetooth 5.3 in 2021 brought improvements in audio quality, increased power efficiency, and wider compatibility. Bluetooth 5.4 in 2023 improved security and reduced latency, but it also included functionality aimed at retailers, allowing them to monitor and change electronic shelf labels (ESL).


Devices that support ESL are expected to ship in 2027. Bluetooth 6.0 is the latest version, announced in 2024. It includes a precise tracking capability called Channel Sounding that enables two devices to accurately measure the distance between them, alongside various efficiency improvements.


One of the main reasons Bluetooth is so popular is because it's easy to use. You can generally turn Bluetooth on via the settings of your phone or computer and find a menu of available devices to connect with. Sometimes you need to put the device you want to connect with into pairing mode, which may involve holding down a button (refer to the device manufacturer).</p></b>

                <p>Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card has been hard to secure since launch, unless you're willing to pay 2-3x the MSRP to scalpers.

 

A user on r/nvidia aggregated data on RTX 5090 Founders Edition GPUs sold on eBay into a chart. After post-launch volatility, market prices have somewhat stabilized for the past one month, with a slow but consistent downward trajectory.


The chart depicts a downward trend in pricing since launch, with average selling prices of completed eBay listings dropping from $6,000 to $4,000.

From January 30 to March 21, the standard deviation was $1,121.98, indicating variation in market prices. When limiting the scope to just March, the standard deviation sees a sharp decline to $145.60.

The average price of an RTX 5090 has also dropped in March, with listings selling for around $4,000 and some change on eBay. Prices on Amazon have settled at $5,000 after initial volatility spikes.</p></b>

                <p>The iPhone 17 is around six months from release, but it may be worth holding off a year for the next generation if you can.

 
Ming-Chi Kuo has not only doubled down on his prediction from six months ago that Apple will introduce 2nm chips for the iPhone 18 Pro, but suggested that regular models may now also be in line for the upgrade. 

“Reiterating my prediction from six months ago: the 2H26 new iPhones (iPhone 18) will be powered by TSMC’s 2nm chips,” he wrote on X.

 
While he states this is a reiteration of the earlier message, it’s slightly different. In September, he added, "Due to cost concerns, not all new iPhone 18 models may be equipped with a 2-nanometer processor.”

 
Assuming we’re not reading too much into what is admittedly an ambiguous sentence, the reason for this might be revealed in the second part of the post. “Worth noting, TSMC’s 2nm R&D trial yields reached 60–70% three months ago, and they’re now well above that,” Kuo wrote.

 
The iPhone 17 will be worth skipping due to cost concerns with newer chips built to the same fabrication process reducing in size.</p></b>

                <p>Many modern smartphones can be used all day long on a single full charge. Even in the middle range and entry-level models, there is not much need to carry a spare battery with you or charge it multiple times a day.

One way to extend battery life is to not keep it fully charged for a long time. This is because if the battery is fully charged, it will put a load on the battery, causing it to deteriorate more quickly in the long term.

Furthermore, thanks to the function "Battery Charging Optimization", iPhones may already have learned charging patterns. If you turn on this function, it will adjust the function so that even if you charge it overnight, it won't reach 100% until the morning.

How to set the upper charge limit

If you want to manually control the battery, there is a way to use the "Charge Limit" function. This function is a function that allows you to stop the battery charging at 95%, and is useful for reducing the load on the battery.

For iPhone 15 and later models, if you go to Settings > Battery > Charge, you can set the charging limit in 5% increments in the 80% to 100% range.</p></b>

                <p>We have probably all passed by there. Do not worry, there is a way to reactivate a deleted message.

But what to do if you exceed the deadline and need to access an SMS definitively deleted? An option is to use a third -party recovery tool for iPhone.

The main drawback is that you will already need a backup of your phone to restore the old SMS deleted since. It is therefore advisable to use a program like this regularly, before deleting messages you may need later.


To recover the messages and conversations deleted in iMessage, you must have iOS 16 or a later version on your iPhone and iPados 16.1 or a later version on your iPad.

2 Open Imessage

Open iMessage. If you have already looked for the desired message and you do not find it, it's time to check all the SMS deleted. 

3 Recover a message

If you find the conversation you want to restore, select it and press Recover at the bottom.

4 Consult the restored conversation

Press filters at the top and select all messages. Look for the restored message.

To access SMS permanently deleted, you can use a third -party backup tool.

1 Open IMAZING and associate your phone

Download and install IMAZING. Connect your iPhone to your Windows or Mac PC via USB.

2 Run the backup

On the next screen, activate the Activate the encryption of the backup and add a password if you want to quantify the backup.

3 Consult the conversation

Now let's see the future. You use IMAZING or a similar program to save your phone, if possible regularly, and you now want to access a deleted SMS.</p></b>

                <p>Hi, friends! Welcome to Installer No. 76, your guide to the best and Verge-iest stuff in the world. (If you’re new here, welcome, sorry if your bracket’s busted, and also you can read all the old editions at the Installer homepage.)

I also have for you a new-old gadget I love, a new Assassin’s Creed title, a new mid-range Android phone, a decidedly not mid-range camera you’ll want anyway, a great journaling app, and much more. I want to buy too many things this week. Let’s dive in.

(As always, the best part of Installer is your ideas and tips.)

The Drop

Screen share
My favorite iOS browser these days is Quiche Browser. It’s somehow both incredibly simple and one of the most customizable browsers I’ve ever tried, which is a really hard balance to pull off. I spent 10 minutes mucking around in the settings, moving all the buttons and icons into exactly the right spot for me, and now everything seems to be where my thumb expects. It’s great.

Quiche is made by Greg de Jonckheere, a solo developer living in Japan. I reached out to Greg to see if he’d share his Quiche Browser setup with me, because I wondered if he had any cool tips I didn’t know about. Then I figured he should share with all of us and asked him to write up his ideal settings. Here's what he came up with.

The Settings

Here are the settings that Greg uses in Quiche:

* Tab title format: "Tab 1 - [website name]"
* URL bar format: "[website name] - [URL]"
* Bookmark menu format: "[category]" - [subcategory]
* Reader view layout: Large text, minimal ads, and a narrow reading area.

                <p>The Android 16 update for Pixel phones is set to introduce a new Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock feature.

This feature lets you unlock your Pixel phone even when its screen is off, making it more convenient to use the fingerprint scanner.

It was first introduced in Android 16 DP2 but only worked on the Pixel 9 series.

Since the Pixel 6, every Pixel phone (excluding foldables) has featured an under-display fingerprint scanner. However, they require the screen to be on for the fingerprint scanner to function.

To enable the Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock feature, navigate to Settings > Security & privacy > Device unlock > Face & Fingerprint Unlock > Fingerprint Unlock.

Then, within the “when using Fingerprint Unlock” section, enable the Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock toggle.

Once enabled, you can press the fingerprint scanner area when the screen is off, and your Pixel phone’s screen will illuminate and unlock if the correct finger is used.

Google initially introduced the Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock feature in the second developer preview of Android 16, but it was limited to the Google Pixel 9 series.

However, with the release of Android 16 Beta 3, the company expanded compatibility to all Pixel phones. I confirmed it works on my Pixel 6a, and a tester verified it on their Pixel 7 Pro.

While there’s a possibility Google could remove the feature in the stable Android 16 release, there’s no apparent reason for them to do so.

If you prefer not to wait for the official Android 16 release or join the beta program, enabling the always-on display is your only current option to keep the fingerprint scanner active.</p></b>

                <p>There’s something uniquely exhilarating about seeing a live TV show taping or exclusive movie screening.

The experience includes gripping performances, communal camaraderie, and delectable smugness from previewing new entertainment before the general public.

Securing tickets can be competitive, but those who score them feel like X-Games medal winners.

Desmond Jonas, a catering coordinator, says he doesn't mind putting in work for a free ticket because movies are his passion and it's a double win to save money.

My first encounter with free-screening subculture occurred when I was living on a budget in Austin.

I would stalk AdvanceScreenings.com several times daily to see new promo codes posted.

The process kept me entertained, offering a way to see new films without spending money I didn’t have.

Later, those same viewings gave me something to look forward to when I moved to San Francisco and was going through a rough patch.


Where to Find Free Tickets


The key to scoring free passes is knowing where to look.

Here are the top sites and platforms that distribute free tickets:

1. 1iota: Members create an account and submit requests for individual events they wish to attend.
2. AdvanceScreenings: The site collects information from various sources about viewings in big cities and small towns.
3. Gofobo: Users create their own account, which keeps track of ticket requests and allows them to scan for screenings near their Zip code.</p></b>

                <p>According to a memo circulating among State Department staff, the Trump administration plans to rename USAID as US International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA) and bring it directly under the secretary of state.

The document states that as part of its reorganization, the agency will "leverage blockchain technology" as part of its procurement process. 

All distributions would be secured and traced via blockchain technology to increase security, transparency, and traceability.

The memo does not make clear what specifically this means in terms of using blockchain for cash transfers or tracking aid disbursement.

USAID staffers are trying to understand their future after the agency was targeted by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) headed by Elon Musk shortly after President Trump's inauguration.

The State Department put USAID staff on administrative leave, slashed its workforce, and halted payments to partner organizations around the world.

A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against the dismantling of the agency, but the memo indicates that the administration plans to continue cutting USAID and folding it into the State Department.

Staffers are also caught off guard by the plans for blockchain use in humanitarian assistance.

Few blockchain-based projects have achieved large-scale use in the humanitarian sector, with some experts questioning the need for blockchain technology in aid delivery.</p></b>

                <p>Britta Späth, a German graduate student, encountered the McKay conjecture in 2003, one of the biggest open problems in group theory.

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.


In 2003, a German graduate student named Britta Späth encountered the McKay conjecture, one of the biggest open problems in the mathematical realm known as group theory. At first her goals were relatively modest: She hoped to prove a theorem or two that would make incremental progress on the problem, as many other mathematicians had done before her.


There was a risk that such a single-minded pursuit of so difficult a problem could hurt her academic career, but Späth dedicated all her time to it anyway.

In 2003, a German graduate student named Britta Späth encountered the McKay conjecture, one of the biggest open problems in the mathematical realm known as group theory. At first her goals were relatively modest: She hoped to prove a theorem or two that would make incremental progress on the problem, as many other mathematicians had done before her.


It brought her to the office of Marc Cabanes, a mathematician now at the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu in Paris who, inspired by her efforts, became consumed by the conjecture, too.

While working together, the pair fell in love and eventually started a family.

The problem that absorbed them takes a key theme in mathematics and turns it into a concrete tool for group theorists.

Math is full of enormously complicated abstract objects that are impossible to study in their entirety.


But often, mathematicians have discovered, it’s enough to look at a small fragment of such an object to understand its broader properties.


In the third century BC, for instance, the ancient Greek mathematician Eratosthenes estimated the circumference of the Earth—roughly 25,000 miles—by measuring shadows cast by the sun in just two cities about 500 miles apart.

Similarly, when mathematicians want to understand an impossibly convoluted function, they might only need to look at how it behaves for a small subset of possible inputs.


The McKay conjecture is another example of this principle. It says that if you want to formulate a thorough description of a group—an important mathematical entity that can get prohibitively difficult to study—you only need to look at a tiny piece of it.

After the conjecture was posed in the 1970s, dozens of mathematicians tried their hand at proving it.


They made partial progress—and in the process they learned a great deal about groups, which are abstract objects that describe the various symmetries of a mathematical system.


But a full proof seemed out of reach.

Then Späth came along. Now, 20 years after she first learned about the problem and more than a decade after she met Cabanes, the two mathematicians have finally completed the proof.

When the couple announced their result, their colleagues were in awe.


The McKay conjecture began with the observation of a strange coincidence.

John McKay—described by one friend as “brilliant, soft-spoken, and charmingly disorganized”—was known for his ability to spot numerical patterns in unexpected places.</p></b>

                <p>The GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker is a large appliance at 16.25 inches high by 16.5 wide and 20.35 deep.

Opening the door reveals a cavity roughly a foot deep, a foot high, and eight inches wide.

You feed standard barbecue wood pellets into a little hopper on the top, they drop into the interior and get toasty, then fall into a metal "waste bin" that's half filled with water, ensuring they are properly extinguished.

There's a well laid out control panel on the front. A mobile app gives you a degree of remote control if you want that.

The temperature range of the smoker is 175 to 300 degrees Fahrenheit.

It retails for $1,000, though the price fluctuates a lot and has dipped as low as $500 at times.</p></b>

                <p>Still, Apple was entranced by the possibilities, as was then-CEO Steve Jobs. “​​This was Steve's last deal,” Siri cofounder Tom Gruber told WIRED. “He was personally involved in all stages of the deal, negotiating the deal and following through, making sure that we were successful at Apple after they bought us.”

However, other Apple execs who were around at the time paint the picture of a very flawed digital assistant that was never really up to the job that Apple sold. Early Siri worked, but only within highly limited functional silos.

“What we acquired was a demo that would work great for a couple of people but wouldn’t scale to our user base … there was a lot of smoke and mirrors behind the original Siri implementation,” former Apple exec Richard Williamson told the Computer History Museum in a 2017 interview. 

“This notion of AI? It wasn’t AI … it was a hot mess,” Williamson said. "It’s super easy to trick Siri. There’s no NLP [natural language processing], there’s no contextualization of words. It’s just keyword matching.”

But now, even with AI, Siri reportedly still can't be relied on to actually work when facing real-world use.

The key question is why? Chatbot tech may not be fully mature, but it is at least prevalent enough to be used daily by nontechnophiles on competing platforms.</p></b>

                <p>Scientists investigated the seafloor recently exposed by the calving of a gigantic iceberg, A-84.

The team found a surprisingly vibrant community of critters on the seafloor below where A-84 was once attached to an ice shelf attached to Antarctica.


“We didn’t expect to find such a beautiful, thriving ecosystem,” said Patricia Esquete. “Based on the size of the animals, the communities we observed have been there for decades, maybe even hundreds of years.”

The team used the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) SuBastian to scrutinize the seafloor at depths of 4,265 feet using the Schmidt Ocean Institute’s R/V Falkor.

The team found large corals and sponges supporting other lifeforms, including icefish, giant sea spiders, and octopus.


The scientists hypothesized that ocean currents are a critical driver for life beneath the ice sheets. The team also collected data on the larger ice sheet, whose shrinking size spells concern for the animals that live beneath it.

“The ice loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet is a major contributor to sea level rise worldwide,” said Sasha Montelli. “Our work is critical for providing longer-term context of these recent changes, improving our ability to make projections of future change.”</p></b>

                <p>A WIRED investigation found that OpenAI's Sora model perpetuates sexist, racist, and ableist stereotypes in its video generations.

In Sora’s world, everyone is good-looking. Pilots, CEOs, and college professors are men, while flight attendants, receptionists, and childcare workers are women. Disabled people are wheelchair users, interracial relationships are tricky to generate, and fat people don’t run.


“OpenAI has safety teams dedicated to researching and reducing bias, and other risks, in our models,” says Leah Anise, a spokesperson for OpenAI, over email.

Bias has plagued generative AI systems since the release of the first text generators, followed by image generators. The issue largely stems from how these systems work, slurping up large amounts of training data—much of which can reflect existing social biases—and seeking patterns within it.


Past investigations into generative AI images have demonstrated similar biases across most tools.

The issues we identified are unlikely to be limited just to one AI model.

What's interesting about the film "HELLO WORLD" is the worldview of the digital twin, created in the memory device called "Altara" that appears in the story. Altara continues to accumulate a huge amount of data, and overlays and remembers various historical events, from the past to the future.

This is very similar to the "history state" that is referred to in quantum computer research. History state refers to the concept that a state at a certain time can be obtained by measuring the states of various steps from the initial time of a calculation by superimposing them.

                <p>Some consider browser extensions as an essential part of the puzzle, while others perceive them as a danger.

A recent Vulnerable U report concerning the Cyberhaven data loss prevention service discovered that an extension chrome used by more than 400,000 of its customers contained code to steal their private/sensitive data. The malicious version of the extension remained available for more than 30 hours before being deleted.


This story is becoming more and more common: an element as harmless as an extension contains a malicious code ready to steal your secrets and your data.

It is more difficult to protect yourself in a digital world. Regarding browser extensions, it is unfortunately the end of the end user to be vigilant about what he installs on his computer.


Here are five ways to know if you can trust an extension.


Favor extensions of large companies. This does not mean that you should not exclude a single developer or a small team, but it is always the easiest way to make sure not to be trapped by a malicious campaign.

Add only what you need. Install only the essential elements. I also tend to limit my browser extensions to the bare minimum.


Prepare the land. Perform some research before installing an extension. Consult the reviews and the number of downloads. If the latter is weak or there is very little review, avoid this extension.

Check updates. Always check the date of the last extension update. One of the problems linked to the installation of browser extensions not updated for some time is the risk of unsuccessful safety flaws.

Think of authorizations. Finally, check the authorizations required by an extension. For example, if you add an extension that has no reason to access keyboard entry or webcam, think twice before installing it.</p></b>

                <p>The "traffic jam tax" introduced on January 5th had a major impact on New York City, particularly in Midtown and Lower Manhattan.

Most notably, the ease of congestion has improved in these areas.

Additionally, the increase in pedestrians around the area has benefited retailers with brick and mortar stores. 

As a result of the increase in people taking the subway, crime on trains has decreased.

The city is also benefiting financially as traffic jam taxes average $9 per passenger car at peak times and over $21.60 for heavy trucks. In the first month of introduction, revenue was $48.6 million.

News of the remarkable success of the traffic tax has faded into the shadows after President Trump announced he would abolish the program, but many experts see the president's attempts as unsuccessful.

Traffic taxes have made the lives of cyclists moving across the streets of New York more comfortable. Commuters, delivery workers, delivery companies, and hobbyists on bicycles – the situation in places that everyone riding their bikes in Manhattan once considered dangerous is gradually improving.

"I was forced to act aggressively to defend myself," says Anna Berlanga, organizer at Transportation Alternatives. "But once the traffic jam tax was introduced, there's no need for that."

The city's bicycle sharing platform CitiBike has not yet released user information for January, but it appears that the number of users is increasing compared to previous years.

                <p>Apple has not updated its affordable "SE" series smartwatch since 2022.

The Apple Watch SE was priced at $250 and offered a mix of wellness capabilities, clean design, and long battery life.

Rivals like Samsung, OnePlus, and Mobvoi have released value-centric models that may be affecting the sales of the Apple Watch SE.

Apple has not announced any plans for a third-generation Apple Watch SE.

According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the affordable model might be in "serious jeopardy" due to hardware-related issues.

The design team at Apple does not like the look of the current casing, and the operations team is struggling to make it cheaper than aluminum.

Apple has been experimenting with other materials to reduce manufacturing costs, including plastic-based materials.

Using a plastic derivative would allow for more color options without worrying about durability or weight.

However, this may compromise on the premium feel that Apple's smartwatches are known for.

If Apple doesn't use plastic, it might have to raise the price of the device to upgrade the internal hardware.

Apple has sold the Watch SE in an aluminum chassis and also experimented with stainless steel and titanium on pricier models.

A size boost is expected, from 40mm to 41mm on the smaller version and from 44mm to 45mm on the bigger variant.

A processor update is anticipated, but it's unclear whether Apple will upgrade the sensor stack.

The launch timeline of the Apple Watch SE 3 may be affected by the ongoing issues.

Apple has made environmental commitments, which might make shifting to an all-plastic look seem unusual.

Other rumors predict that only the lower-cost models would use plastic, while upscale trims stick with aluminum.</p></b>

                <p>A mathematical problem posed by David Hilbert in 1900 has been resolved by a team of scientists from the University of Michigan.

The sixth problem of Hilbert, also known as "mathematical treatment of the axioms of physics," was an ambitious challenge that had resisted for over a century. The problem related to deriving laws of physics axiomatically, particularly those describing fluid behavior on different spatial scales.

There are three discussions for the motion of fluids: microscopic (Newton's laws), mesoscopic (Boltzmann equation), and macroscopic (Euler and Navier-Stokes equations). Hilbert asked how these three treatments could be derived from first axioms in an organic and harmonious theory.

A team of scientists, Yu Deng, Zaher Hani, and Xiao Li, claim to have successfully unified the laws of fluid dynamics. They derive the macroscopic equations of fluids starting from Newton's laws and passing through the kinetic theory of Boltzmann.

The resolution of this problem was delayed due to the complexity of time as a concept in physics. The laws of Newton are symmetrical with respect to temporal reversal, while those of Boltzmann and thermodynamics indicate a specific direction for time flow.

The authors explain that they have managed to understand how the switch from temporal symmetry to a privileged direction for time occurs. This resolution overcomes the paradox of temporal symmetry.

Until now, only partial solutions had been proposed to Hilbert's sixth problem. The new approach led by Deng, Hani, and Li provides a more general formulation of the solution.

The team has simplified the discussion of equations of motion for interacting particles, reducing complexity and allowing them to unify all three treatments.

Despite their success, the authors acknowledge that the solution is not yet complete. They emphasize the importance of understanding the implications of these mathematical models, particularly at smaller spatial or temporal scales.

Fluid equations lead to a singularity when they fail to work, and scientists are interested in understanding this phenomenon. The resolution could help deal with this issue in oceanography and atmospheric science scenarios.

The authors admit that more time may be required to fully resolve the problem. They highlight the importance of understanding what happens at even smaller scales.

They aim to place mathematical models in terms of physical phenomena, rather than just solving equations.

It is not clear how their work will impact our daily lives, but it could potentially have a significant effect on various scientific disciplines.

The resolution of Hilbert's problem may lead to new insights into fluid dynamics and its applications.

Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of this mathematical breakthrough.</p></b>

                <p>Akira Kurosawa claimed that cinema contained many other arts within itself. Certainly almost nobody in the history of the seventh art has been able to represent this concept as well as him, born in Tokyo on March 23, 1910 and became during a very fertile and extraordinary career, one of the greatest and influential directors of all time. Kurosawa gave us an incredible amount of masterpieces, a films that sometimes sanctioned the birth of a precise genre, others have been able to influence others and often have also gone further, creating a real universe in its own right. Few authors are on a par for depth of analysis and writing, by visual power, dynamism, for the ability to be a point of contact between the West and the East, moving between epic and normality, outlining a humanity always in the balance between heroism and fragility, between light and darkness. Today that the anniversary of his birth occurs, honoring him with a top 5 of his most important films is a task not only heavy, but also very difficult, so much is the quality expressed by the Japanese director, still today a monument of the Rising Sun. Certainly what he created still lives today in films, TV series, anime, manga, graphic novels, painting and literature. In some cases it can be said that without him these universes would not be what we know and love today.</p></b>

                <p>After 35 years, Pretty Woman remains an absolute cinematographic myth, in spite of the very profound changes of society and above all the image of the woman.

Pretty Woman still continues to depopulate every time it arrives on television or streaming, and after 35 years it continues to be indicated as one of the most loved by the general public. Garry Marshall in that end of 1989 is found in his hands a script that owes a lot, indeed very much, to the fairy tale of Cinderella.

The 80s are the years of consumerism, of popular glamor, of the supermodels that begin to become absolute different, of the pop cultures and the extreme sexualization of all its elements. But they are also the years of reaganism, of the woman who becomes more and more declination of male desire, a body to possess and admire.

That decade is not by chance that of the crisis of the feminist movement, which in the 90s with the third wave will return to the rescue. Meanwhile, in the meantime, in spite of female characters that is anything but meek (see the money, the success, the success, the only real points of reference, the great dream that everyone must ride.

It is what you have, you are what you are aesthetically and poverty is worse than everything, even of cruelty. And to say that Pretty Woman initially had to be a dramatic film, there was to be of half drug addiction, crime and a critical look at the Los Angeles of those years.</p></b>

                <p>Italian authorities have frozen talks with SpaceX to obtain Starlink access, Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said in an interview.

 

Earlier this year, the Italian government explored the possibility of an agreement with Starlink, but opposition officials denounced the idea of a contract with Musk, citing his comments on Ukraine.

"It seems to me that everything has stopped ... the topic has moved from Starlink to the statements of and about the person," Crosetto said.

Negotiations are on hold for now, he said, and Italy will focus on what is "useful and safe" for the country in its defense contracts.

 

European officials voiced concern Starlink could cut off Ukraine's access to its internet service, following media reports that the U.S. had threatened to terminate Starlink service in order to pressure Kyiv to sign a minerals deal with Washington.

Starlink internet access is crucial to Ukraine's battlefield communications.

Musk and top White House officials clashed with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski over the legitimacy of such concerns on March 9.

 

Musk denied Starlink access could be cut off in Ukraine following backlash from Ukraine's allies.

"To be extremely clear, no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will never turn off its terminals," Musk said on March 9.</p></b>

                <p>A measles epidemic has caused two deaths in Western Texas and New Mexico, where vaccination rates have dropped.

The first victim was a child who had not been vaccinated in Texas, without previous health problems, at the end of February.
 
Together with the epidemic, a lot of disinformation about measles is also spreading on social media.

In the United States, many conservative and no-vax accounts minimize the severity of the virus, claiming for example that the child in Texas died of other causes.

The current Texas epidemic began in late January. The official data, updated to March 21, report 309 cases, with 40 hospitalizations.

Most of the infected people live in the County of Gaines, where the vaccination rate for measles at kindergarten is 82%, a share significantly less than 95% necessary to protect a community from the disease.

In the nearby county of Lea, in New Mexico, there have been 42 infected so far, with two hospitalizations.</p></b>

4月22日がアースデイとされたのは、いまから半世紀以上前の1970年のこと。人々の意識を高めるために「環境の日」をつくるべきという、米国のゲイロード・ネルソン上院議員（当時）の呼びかけに対し、スタンフォード大学の学生だったデニス・ヘイズが応えたことが始まりだ。

その動きはすぐに全米へと広がり、年ごとにさまざまなイベントやキャンペーンが催されるようになった。そして、やがては世界的なムーブメントとなったのである。

3. アースデイの今年のテーマは？

昨今のアースデイでは特定の環境問題にフォーカスすべく、毎年世界共通のテーマが設定されている。スタートから55年を経た2025年のテーマは、「Our Power, Our Planet」。太陽光や風力、水力、地熱といった再生可能エネルギーを活用する取り組みに注力し、エネルギーの安定供給や温室効果ガスの排出抑制、つまりはさらなる地球温暖化対策を目指すというものだ。

4. 地球環境のために選ぶべきエコグッズ12選

さて、ここでは選ぶことが地球環境を守ることにつながるプロダクトを幅広くピックアップした。環境に配慮した素材を使用するものから、工場の電力をすべて風力でまかなう企業のものまで、かたちは違えど、そのどれもがエココンシャスなアイテムである。地球環境のためにすでにアクションを起こしているという人にも、このアースデイをきっかけに始めたいという人にもおすすめだ。

                <p>SpaceX's full rocket start plan could affect the beach days.

The Texas legislators have submitted a law that would essentially give SpaceX-Officials the sole authority of closing streets and public beaches near the Starbase starting place in south-wing starts for rocket starts, soil tests or other associated activities during the week.


SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk first proposed the idea of ​​a Starbase city in 2021. In February, the Cameron County in Texas approved the implementation of a choice to enable residents to coordinate the creation of a new city called Starbase, which is grouped around the current start projects from SpaceX.


Now an additional law was submitted on March 14 that SpaceX would grant control over road and beach closings for its rocket activities. Although the law, submitted by two Republican senators, does not mention SpaceX, it refers to counties with room ports and beach access "on the border to the Gulf of Mexico or its tidal boundaries," says My RGV.


Cameron County officers are currently responsible for closing streets and beaches. If the law was approved, the Cameron County would continue to keep the authority at the weekend, while Starbase, as a jurisdiction, would have control over the closure of roads and public beaches near the starting site on weekdays.


During a public hearing on Wednesday, the State Senator Adam Hinojosa claimed that the law would not increase the frequency of the beach transitions, but rather "rationalize the administrative processes and at the same time maintain local supervision," said local reports.</p></b>

                <p>Saturn will temporarily lose its iconic look from our point of view on earth and appear as a pale, yellow ball without its swirling rings that envelop the gas giant.

The billions of rocky and icy chunks, which swirl around Saturn, will disappear from our field of vision on Sunday, March 23, since the thin edges of the rings of the planet are aligned onto the earth and apparently disappear from the field of vision. This rare phenomenon occurs every 13 to 15 years when the earth moves through the ring level of Saturn.

Saturn is surrounded by billions of buzzing pieces from comet, asteroids and broken fragments of moons that were captured in the orbit of the planet. The exquisite ring system extends up to 175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) away from the planet and consists of tiny, dust -sized, icy grains to chunk the size of a house.

The movement and the disappearance of the rings

Similar to the earth, the Saturn's axis is inclined by 26.73 degrees. While it creeps up the sun, the inclination of Saturn shifts in relation to the earth, which means that its rings disappear from our field of vision when our planet crosses its level.

The intersection of the plane begins on Sunday at 12:04 p.m. ET, according to in-the-sky.org. Saturn's rings will not be fully visible from the earth for a few months, and we could possibly only see them again in November, according to Earth.com.

Heaven observers in the middle southern latitudes have the best chance of discovering the naked Saturn if you can see him from the dawn at the eastern horizon, according to Space.com.</p></b>

                <p>The last showdown is approaching.

At the weekend, a first teaser for the final season was released on the Animejapan in Tokyo. In it, the hero Izuku "Deku" Midoriya and his adversary Tomura Shigaraki share the floor - everyone with their own view of the fight and the question of who actually belongs.

The announcement of the final season is not surprising. My Hero Academia manga was completed at the end of 2024 - according to 430 chapters and an epilogue in December.

The final anime relay is expected to adapt the last story arcs and declare Deku's journey to a "true hero". The fans can look forward to epic battles, emotional farewells and a worthy finale. 

My Hero Academia: Vigilantes starts on April 7, 2025. It plays around five years before the main series events and revolves around so-called "vigilante" - not licensed heroes, who still protect their city.

Even if it is still unclear what Horikoshi is working next, My Hero Academia has long since found its place among the very big ones in the anime and manga world. An era comes to an end with millions of fans worldwide, numerous merchandise series, movies and now the final anime showdown.</p></b>

                <p>Former President Barack Obama has joined social network Bluesky.

The company confirmed this on Sunday, responding to a post wondering if the account posting as Obama was legitimate by writing "Confirmed!" 

In his first posts on the platform, Obama celebrated the 15th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), calling it "a reminder that change is possible when we fight for progress."

Obama has a large following on other social media platforms, including X and Facebook.

The post on Bluesky reads: "FIGURED A HOP IS HERE Today for the 15th Anniversary of the Affordable Care Act. With Everything Going on Right Now, It's Easy To Feel Like Regular Folks Can't Make A Difference - But the Aca Is A Reminder that Change is Possible When We Fight for Progress. -Barack Obama (@barackobama.bsky.social)"


Many US users left X after the 2024 U.S. elections due to Elon Musk's involvement in promoting MAGA-aligned views.

This led to a large bump in user growth for Bluesky, which now has over 33 million users and is continuing to grow.

Other prominent US politicians are also active on Bluesky, including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, AL Green, Gavin Newsom, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p></b>

                <p>Browser Use has raised $17 million in seed funding led by Felicis' Astasia Myers.

 

Browser Use, a company founded by Magnus Müller and Gregor Zunic, has gained notoriety in recent months due to its use in Chinese startup Butterfly Effect's Manus tool.

 

Müller had been working on web-scraping tools for years before meeting Zunic, with whom he came up with the idea of combining web scraping with data science.

 

The company essentially breaks down website elements into a "text-like" format for agents to understand options and make decisions autonomously.

 

A lot of agents rely on vision-based systems that navigate websites through screenshots, but this can lead to errors. Browser Use converts websites into something agents can understand, allowing tasks to be run at a cheaper cost.

 

Müller thinks Browser Use can become a "fundamental layer" serving the need for AI companies to make their agents interact with websites more gracefully.

 

More than 20 companies in the current Y Combinator Winter batch have used Browser Use for their own requirements, and many companies are asking how they can make it easier for agents to navigate their website.

 

Felicis has been actively looking at the AI agents space for several years and saw Browser Use as an opportunity to grow its portfolio there.

 

Myers said that web AI agents are the next frontier in automating human tasks, acting as a bridge between static pre-trained models and the ever-changing digital landscape.</p></b>

                <p>Turkey's slide into autocracy has reached a tipping point, evident from recent events that have thrown the nation's democratic framework into crisis.

The latest crisis is the result of the arrest of Ekrem İmamoğlu, the mayor of Istanbul and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's chief political rival. Detained in a dawn raid just before he was about to be nominated as the presidential candidate for the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), İmamoğlu now faces charges of embezzlement, corruption, and terrorism.

Critics see this as a calculated move by Erdoğan to neutralise the only figure who could challenge him in elections due before 2028 but might take place earlier. The arrest has led to a wave of protests across Turkey, despite a government-imposed ban on gatherings.

From Istanbul to Ankara, demonstrators have clashed with police wielding water cannons, tear gas, and rubber bullets, with 343 arrests reported in a single night. The opposition claims that three lakh people flooded Istanbul's streets on a Friday night, defying roadblocks and riot police.

The suspensions of numerous accounts linked to opposition figures and democracy activists by Elon Musk's social media platform X have played a key role in this unfolding drama. These suspensions cast further doubt on X's role as a beacon of open discourse and raise profound questions about the limits of free speech and democracy in politically volatile states.

The Turkish government's response has been unrelenting. Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya has vowed zero tolerance for those disrupting "societal order," while Erdoğan has branded the protests "street terrorism."

This hardline stance is mirrored online, where X's suspensions have silenced key voices of resistance. The targeted accounts, largely university-associated activists with lakhs of followers, were instrumental in sharing protest locations and rallying students.

Turkey has never been a paragon of democracy. Over the past decade, Erdoğan has steadily tightened his hold, appointing his loyalists to the judiciary and bureaucracy, co-opting the media to limit dissent, and wielding state prosecutors to punish adversaries.

Opposition victories, such as last year's municipal elections, have kept the system from tipping fully into autocracy. Barring İmamoğlu from the presidential race would mark a decisive shift, aligning Turkey with countries like Russia, Belarus, or Azerbaijan, where elections occur but lack meaning.

The international reaction has been muted, offering Erdoğan little resistance. The United Nations has put out a statement, while the US State Department has declined to comment, calling it Turkey's "internal decisions."

Economically, the fallout from İmamoğlu's arrest has been swift. The Turkish lira plummeted, prompting the central bank to spend an estimated $11.5 billion in a single day to stabilise it.

The protests are the largest since the 2013 Gezi Park uprising, but Erdoğan's defiance suggests a leader confident in his impunity.</p></b>

Here is the article content without commentary:

Tencent continues to rely on third-party models like DeepSeek to meet performance demands while lowering infrastructure costs, according to its Q4 2024 earnings call. Executives explained how inference efficiency—not compute scale—is guiding their deployment choices.

During its Q4 2024 earnings call, executives explained how inference efficiency—not compute scale—is guiding their deployment choices. "Chinese companies are generally prioritizing efficiency and utilization—efficient utilization of the GPU servers," said the company's chief strategy officer. This approach allows Tencent to tailor models to specific infrastructure constraints.

Rather than scaling GPU clusters, it is focusing on lower-latency, inference-tuned models that are lighter to run. The strategy mirrors research-backed methods like Sample, Scrutinize and Scale, which emphasize verification at inference time instead of more resource-heavy training.

Tencent isn't backing away from hardware investments. According to a TrendForce report, the company has placed large orders for NVIDIA's H20 chips—specialized GPUs for the Chinese market. These chips support Tencent's integration of DeepSeek models into backend services, including those powering WeChat.

The launch of T1 comes amid heightened scrutiny of Chinese AI tools abroad. On March 17, 2025, the U.S. Commerce Department barred DeepSeek's applications from use on federal government devices, citing privacy risks and potential links to state-controlled infrastructure.

Back home, the Chinese government is actively promoting newer AI startups. Reuters reportes that Beijing is supporting Monica, the developer of Manus, an autonomous AI agent.

In Q4 2024, Tencent's revenue rose 11% year-over-year to 172.45 billion yuan. A portion of that growth was attributed to enterprise AI development, with the company signaling further investment in 2025 to expand both consumer-facing and enterprise-ready AI infrastructure.

Tencent's two-pronged AI strategy—Hunyuan T1 for structured reasoning and Turbo S for instant replies—enables it to deliver model-specific capabilities across different business verticals. Rather than scaling up a single large model, the company is aligning each release with precise usage scenarios: complex logic for internal analytics, fast interaction for customer interfaces.

Each model is deeply integrated into Tencent's cloud infrastructure. This approach may appeal to businesses seeking AI solutions that are fully hosted in China and compliant with national data standards.

In contrast to OpenAI's trajectory—which saw the release of its largest and most expensive model yet, GPT-4.5, in February—Tencent's strategy appears more calibrated.</p></b>

                <p>OpenAI and Meta Platforms have held separate discussions with India’s Reliance Industries over potential partnerships to expand their artificial intelligence offerings in the country, technology news website The Information reported on Saturday.

A possibility being discussed involved a relationship between Reliance Jio and OpenAI to distribute ChatGPT, according to The Information, which cited two sources familiar with the matter.

OpenAI also discussed with employees cutting the ChatGPT subscription price to as low as several dollars instead of $20 a month, according to the report, which added that it is not clear if OpenAI has discussed the idea of price reduction with Reliance.

Reliance has discussed selling OpenAI’s models to its enterprise customers through an application programming interface, The Information report added, saying that the Mukesh Ambani-led conglomerate also discussed hosting and running OpenAI models locally, so the data of local customers can be kept within India.

In particular, Reliance has discussed running the Meta and OpenAI models in a three-gigawatt data center that the company is planning to build, which it has said would be the largest data center in the world, located in the city of Jamnagar in Gujarat.

Meta declined to comment on The Information report.

                <p>Browser Use, a startup from Y Combinator's 2025 winter batch, has raised $17 million in seed funding led by Felicis' Astasia Myers.

Browser Use makes websites more "readable" for AI agents by breaking down buttons and elements into a text-like format.

The company was founded last year by Magnus Müller and Gregor Zunic, who met while getting their master's degrees in data science at ETH Zurich.

Müller had been working on web-scraping tools for years, and he and Zunic came up with the idea of combining web scraping with data science to prompt a browser to perform a task.

Browser Use's technology helps agents understand website options and make decisions autonomously, reducing the cost of running tasks repeatedly.

There are an increasing number of AI companies that want to make their agents interact with websites more smoothly, and Müller thinks Browser Use can become a fundamental layer serving this need.

More than 20 companies in the current Y Combinator Winter batch use Browser Use for their own requirements.

Companies are coming to Browser Use and asking how they can make it easier for agents to navigate their website.

Felicis has been actively looking at the AI agents space for several years and saw Browser Use as a chance to grow its portfolio there.

Myers said that web AI agents are the next frontier in automating human tasks, serving as a dynamic bridge between static pre-trained models and the ever-changing digital landscape.</p></b>

                <p>Mr. Musk, as the architect of a group he called the Department of Government Efficiency, has taken a chain saw to the apparatus of governing, spurring chaos and dread by pushing out some 100,000 federal workers and shutting down various agencies, though the government has not been consistent in explaining the expanse of his power.

But in selected spots across the government, SpaceX is positioning itself to see billions of dollars in new federal contracts or other support, a dozen current and former federal officials said in interviews with The New York Times.

The boost in federal spending for SpaceX will come in part as a result of actions by President Trump and Mr. Musk’s allies and employees who now hold government positions. The company will also benefit from policies under the current Trump administration that prioritize hiring commercial space vendors for everything from communications systems to satellite fabrication, areas in which SpaceX now dominates.

Already, some SpaceX employees, temporarily working at the F.A.A., were given official permission to take actions that might steer new work to Mr. Musk’s company.

The new contracts across government will come in addition to the billions of dollars in new business that SpaceX could rake in by securing permission from the Trump administration to expand its use of federally owned property.</p></b>

                <p>Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has reaffirmed that Apple is on track to introduce next-gen 2-nanometer (2nm) chips in its iPhones by late 2026.

Kuo shared an update, saying Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is making strong progress with its 2nm technology. He noted that trial production yields reached 60–70% three months ago and have since improved significantly.


September 2025

iPhone 17 lineup will be powered by TSMC’s improved 3nm chips using the N3P process, an improved version of its 3-nanometer chip technology, offering better performance and lower power usage compared to the earlier N3B process. It’s more cost-efficient to produce, making it ideal for Apple’s iPhone 17 lineup.

This is a more efficient and powerful version of the 3nm tech used in iPhone 16.


Second Half of 2026

iPhone 18 models are expected to feature Apple’s first 2nm chips, made by TSMC. However, due to high production costs, not all iPhone 18 versions may get the 2nm chip. Some could stick with the 3nm generation.

The move to 2nm chips would mark a significant jump in performance and power efficiency for Apple devices, possibly boosting battery life and speed for future iPhones.</p></b>

Meanwhile, next year’s iPhone 18 series is expected to be powered by the A20 series processors, which will be fabricated using TSMC’s 2nm process. Previous reports suggest that TSMC’s 2nm trial production has already achieved a yield rate of 60%, with mass production expected by the end of this year. As the leading brand in the high-end smartphone market and TSMC’s largest customer, Apple is likely to be the first to adopt TSMC’s 2nm process. [Icsmart, in Chinese]

Apple’s rumored plan to redesign the Apple Watch SE with a plastic casing is reportedly in “jeopardy,” according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Citing internal sources, Gurman claims Apple’s design team is dissatisfied with the look of the plastic model, while the operations team is struggling to make the casing meaningfully cheaper than the current aluminum version.

Gurman first reported on the potential shift to plastic last year, noting that the change was aimed at reducing production costs and making the device more appealing — and affordable — for younger users. A plastic chassis could allow Apple to offer the Watch SE in a range of vibrant colors, reminiscent of the iPhone 5c, which launched in bold hues like blue, pink, green, and yellow.

However, despite the potential benefits, the redesign now appears unlikely to move forward. Design quality concerns and cost inefficiencies have reportedly stalled the effort, casting doubt on whether a plastic Apple Watch SE will ever reach the market.

The current Apple Watch SE, released in 2022, starts at $249 in the U.S. A plastic version was expected to come in at a lower price point, potentially making it a more attractive option for families or first-time smartwatch users. It remains unclear whether Apple will still pursue a kid-focused model in a future iteration.</p></b>

                <p>Garuda Dr460nized has been a popular Linux distribution known for its unique aesthetic and functionality.

The developers of Garuda have released a new version called Broadwing, which includes several new features and improvements.


One of these releases is the Mokka Edition, a Catppuccin-themed KDE Plasma desktop experience that offers a fresh and inviting take on the KDE environment.

For those who aren't familiar, the Catppuccin theme is a popular visually appealing theme for Linux desktops that offers soothing pastel colors and supports GTK-based desktop environments like GNOME, Cinnamon, XFCE, and Mate.

The Catppuccin theme is gorgeous.


Garuda is an Arch-based distribution, so if you're not familiar with Arch, it might not be the best choice for you.


Other than the Catppuccin theme, what else is new with Broadwing? Garuda Rani Welcome App: A new unified tool that combines the functionality of the previous welcome, gamer, and assistant apps to make system setup and management easier for users of all types.

Linux Kernel 6.13: The latest kernel ensures better hardware support and improved performance.


Updates to the Chaotic-AUR infrastructure.


Improved customization for the Dr460nized edition.


Enhancements/improvements for the Hyperland, i3, and Sway desktop environments.


The usual bug fixes, performance enhancements, and security patches.


I've reviewed and used KDE Plasma for a long time, and the Mokka Edition of Broadwing might be the best-looking take on this open-source desktop I've ever seen.


Out of the box, the only thing missing for me is an office suite. 

There's the Octopi GUI, which allows you to easily install applications.


Other than the lack of an office suite, you'll find apps like the FireDragon web browser, the Dolphin file manager, Snapper Tools (to create and manage system snapshots), the fish shell, a firewall GUI, the Garuda Network Assistant, the Kate text editor, System Monitor, VLC media player, and more.


From the Garuda Setup Assistant, you can choose from all sorts of apps to install (software centers, kernels, office tools, browsers, email clients, communication/internet tools, audio tools, and more).</p></b>

                <p>According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the rumored plastic design for the next-generation Apple Watch SE is now in ‘serious jeopardy.’ There are some internal conflicts regarding the plastic housing, and it isn’t necessarily cheaper to produce.

Last year, Bloomberg reported that Apple was considering switching to a ‘rigid plastic’ for the next-generation Apple Watch SE. This would’ve potentially allowed for an even lower starting price.

Now, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports that the switch to plastic is ‘in serious jeopardy.’ Design teams don’t like how it looks, and it isn’t currently cheaper to produce than the already-existing aluminum casings:

And the redesigned, plastic Apple Watch SE I’ve written about is also in serious jeopardy. The design team doesn’t like the look, and the operations team is finding it difficult to make the casing materially cheaper than the current aluminum chassis.

Whether or not Apple overcomes these hurdles remains to be seen. That said, Apple Watch SE will be coming up on 3 years old this fall, so we’ll likely see a refresh in about 6 months, plastic or not.

Gurman also reiterates that the next-generation Apple Watch Ultra will gain support for satellite texting, as well as 5G connectivity.

                <p>Apple is working on multiple new Apple Watch models with built-in cameras for release by 2027, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.



In his Power On newsletter today, Gurman said Apple plans to add a camera in the screen area on a future Apple Watch Series model. On a future Apple Watch Ultra, he expects the camera to be on the right side of the watch, near the Digital Crown.

Gurman does not expect the cameras to enable FaceTime on the Apple Watch. Instead, he said the cameras would enable Visual Intelligence on future Apple Watch models. This feature would allow Apple Watch users to quickly receive information about items or places their surroundings. For example, they could point their Apple Watch at a restaurant to receive its hours or ratings as they pass by on the sidewalk.

Visual Intelligence debuted on all iPhone 16 models last year, and it is available on iPhone 15 Pro models starting with iOS 18.4.

Apple is also planning to add tiny cameras to future AirPods models, he said. The cameras will bring more AI capabilities to both the Apple Watch and AirPods, allowing Apple to better compete with other AI-powered wearables on the market.</p></b>
