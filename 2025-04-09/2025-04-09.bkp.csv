            Frenchman David Pereira grew up watching dubbed versions of American TV shows like “The A-Team,” “Happy Days” and “The Dukes of Hazzard” in France.
    


            He was obsessed with American culture: he used to collect vintage Mustangs, owns a GMC pick-up truck from the '70s, and has visited the US nearly a dozen times. This summer, he was looking forward to fulfilling a lifelong dream and visiting Yellowstone National Park with his family, after having completed a successful circuit of national parks on the West Coast two years ago.
    


            But after following Donald Trump's aggressive rhetoric for months, the 53-year-old business owner said he couldn't, in good conscience, go through with it and has canceled the trip.
    


            “Like many French people, we are immersed in American culture. So we love it. But it's just unbelievable now,” Pereira, who lives about an hour north of Paris, told CNN Travel.
    


            “I kept watching the news and thinking, ‘this can't be happening.' It was getting worse and worse. It was just fake news on fake news on fake news.”
    


            Similar feelings of disbelief, anger, anxiety and fear that beset America's neighbors, Canada and Mexico, have spread across the Atlantic, where European travelers are canceling planned visits or rethinking their US travel plans amid the Trump administration's hostile anti-European rhetoric and tariff war.
    


            Safety concerns following a string of plane crashes and cuts affecting the Federal Aviation Administration, as well as stories about tourists being thrown into detention centers without due process or being denied entry possibly because of anti-Trump views, have also heightened travel anxiety.
    


            In response, countries like Ireland, the Netherlands, Denmark, UK, Germany, Finland and Canada have issued new travel updates warning citizens that travelers can be denied entry even with the appropriate visas and approvals, or that transgender travelers must indicate their biological sex at birth in their passports and could face added difficulties entering the US.

‘It feels terrifying:' Why some Americans are anxious about traveling abroad under Trump



            As cautionary tales of travel to the US began to pile up, British writer Farah Mendlesohn knew that she had to forfeit the month-long trip that would have taken her from Scotland to Oregon, Seattle and Vancouver this summer. Three years in the making, her plan was to conduct research at a public university for a book on a science fiction writer that she was working on, and to volunteer at the sci-fi Seattle WorldCon convention and visit friends.
    


            But after reading about a Welsh woman who was detained for 19 days in the US and sent home in chains after being accused of working illegally while on a tourist visa, Mendlesohn canceled her trip and lost £800 (about $1,050) in travel bookings.
    


            She also feared that her left-leaning political stance (she edited a deliberately provocative 2007 sci-fi anthology titled “Glorifying Terrorism” to challenge sweeping British anti-terror laws in 2006) would have gotten her into trouble at the border.
    


            “As well as my own political views, I don't think I want to go to America in those circumstances and put money into the American economy,” Mendlesohn said.
    


            On Friday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to minimize concerns international travelers may have of coming to the US and being detained, saying those who are flagged at the border are flagged “for a reason.”
    


            “If you're not coming to the United States to join a Hamas protest, or to come here and tell us about how right Hamas is, or … stir up conflict on our campuses and create riots in our streets and vandalize our universities, then you have nothing to worry about,” he told reporters in Brussels.
    


            But the chilling effect among international travelers is starting to bear out in the numbers.
    


            New figures from the National Travel and Tourism Office (NTTO) show that overseas international arrivals for the month of March dropped 12% compared to the same period last year. That figure excludes arrivals from Canada and Mexico.
    


            After forecasting a 5% dip for inbound travel to the US this year in February, travel forecasting group Tourism Economics has revised its projections, telling CNN Travel that it now expects that figure to almost double to 9.4%.
    


            Summer hotel bookings from European travelers for Accor properties in the US are also down a whopping 25%, CEO Sébastien Bazin said in a recent interview with Bloomberg TV. Accor hotel brands include Fairmont, Ibis, Novotel, Mercure and Raffles.
    


            Jean-François Rial, CEO of France's leading luxury tour operator Voyageurs du Monde, said that ever since Trump's inauguration in late January, bookings for US travel among his wealthy French clients have dropped a “colossal” 20%.
    


            “In the 30 years I've been in this business, I've never seen anything like this for any destination. It's huge,” he told CNN Travel.
    


            Rial also criticized the US government for downplaying the impact of Trump's policies on international travel, and said that colleagues in the industry in France are reporting similar trends.
    


            The NTTO's 2025-2029 forecast, published in March, projects that total international arrivals will increase nearly 7% this year to 77.1 million, spike another 10% in 2026 for the World Cup, and then dip down to a 6% increase in 2027 — numbers that seem overly optimistic, Rial said.
    


            “When the US says there's no impact on travel sales from the Europeans to the US, they're wrong. There you go. They're talking nonsense.”
    


            CNN Travel reached out to NTTO for comment on the forecast but didn't hear back. The NTTO forecast is based on travel and economic trends through the end of 2024.
    


            Didier Arino, general director of travel consulting firm Protourisme in France, also said that anti-Trump sentiment has led to an “unprecedented” drop in interest for travel to the US, which is the leading long-haul destination among French tourists.
    


            “It's unheard of. It's happened before in a country at war, in a county where there was a security risk, or risk of health crisis, but in a normal situation, we've never seen this kind of turnaround,” Arino said.
    


            British long-haul carrier Virgin Atlantic has recently warned that demand for transatlantic travel to the US has slowed.
    


            The NTTO's 2025-2029 forecast of a nearly 3% increase in Canadian tourist arrivals in 2025 is also at odds with recent stats showing a decline in Canadian travel to the US. 



            According to figures from US Customs and Border Protection, the average number of daily travelers crossing the Canada-US land border by car fell 15% in February from 92,983 to 79,407 this year compared to the same period last year. Likewise, transborder air travel from Canada to the US was down 2% in February, marking the first month to record a year-over-year decrease since the start of the pandemic.
    


            And flight bookings between Canada and the US for travel between April to September show a precipitous drop of more than 70% compared to the same period last year, according to aviation analytics company OAG.
    


            But while Canada's largest airlines Air Canada and WestJet have axed seats in response to plummeting demand, OAG chief analyst John Grant said there have been no significant adjustments from Europe or other international markets so far, mostly due to the logistical challenges that presents. And while airlines may try to stimulate demand by lowering prices, he pointed out that the days of post-pandemic revenge spending are over.
    


            “Let's not forget that the vast majority of tourism in the United States is still domestic tourism,” he added. “And if that holds, the loss of a few million people from Europe could be absorbed.”
    


            A grassroots boycott movement that started in Canada is also gaining momentum in Europe, with “boycott USA” groups on Facebook from countries like Denmark, which leads the charge at 95,000 members, Germany, Italy, France, UK, Norway and Sweden attracting new members daily.
    


            For Swede Johan Björnsson, canceling his 2026 cruise out of Miami is an important gesture, even if it means losing a $500 deposit. He's never been particularly political, Björnsson said. But the moment he saw clips of Trump and Vice President JD Vance berating Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office, the 43-year-old said he knew he had to take a stand.
    


            “It had nothing to do with politics, it was just a crude assault. It was disrespectful and wrong on so many levels. It got personal,” he said. “That was probably the drop that made everything go over for me.”
    


            For Europeans living close to the war in Ukraine, the threat of Russian aggression across the continent looms in the background. Last month, the EU Commission urged its 450 million citizens to stockpile enough food, water and essentials for 72 hours in the event of emergencies like cyberattacks, climate disasters, disease and also geopolitical conflicts.
    


            “Peace and stability are intrinsic to the European project. Yet, Europe faces a new reality, marked by growing risks and deep uncertainty,” read the first lines of the EU's 18-page European Preparedness Union Strategy.
    


            Trump's alignment with Putin, suspension of aid to Ukraine and the administration's general anti-Europe rhetoric are seen as deep betrayals across the continent. In a leaked Signal thread published by The Atlantic, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote: “I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.”
    


            And during a visit to Greenland, a semiautonomous territory in the kingdom of Denmark, last week Vance upbraided Denmark, saying they have “not done a good job” for the people of Greenland, in a speech that was largely viewed as hostile and insulting.
    


            “We consider the US to be our best friend,” said Jacob Bøll, a consultant who lives in Copenhagen. “Now, we're not only not friends anymore, it's like our friend started a fist fight with us.”
    


            The turn of events has driven Bøll, 52, to cancel travel plans to Cincinnati where he was to visit close family friends this summer, and then travel to Nashville. He was also planning to attend the World Cup soccer tournament next year, but now will only go on the condition Denmark plays in Canada if they qualify.



            “I just can't imagine a scenario where I would go back,” he said. “You vote with your feet when you're a consumer.”
    


            After much deliberation, fellow Dane Robert Christiansen has also canceled plans to fly to Texas this summer and surprise his teenage daughter, who is studying in Dallas. But Christiansen said fears of flight safety and his own activity on social media, where he shares the latest news stories as his small act of resistance, would have made him anxious about his travels.
    


            “I cannot trust the government of the United States,” Christiansen said.

            Israeli forces raided six United Nations schools in East Jerusalem, ordering them to close within 30 days, according to UNRWA, the UN agency for the Palestinian refugees, and the Israeli Ministry of Education.
    


            Approximately 800 students will be directly impacted by the closure orders and may not be able to finish the school year, UNRWA's Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said on social media. Schools run by the agency serve Palestinians in areas occupied by Israel, including East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza.
    


            “UNRWA schools are protected by the privileges and immunities of the United Nations,” Lazzarini said. “Today's unauthorized entries and issuance of closure orders are a violation of these protections.”
    


            Israel's Ministry of Education said in a statement that parents were directed to register their students at other schools. “The professional staff at the Ministry of Education continue to support the educational framework for each student.”
    


            In October, Israel's parliament passed a law banning UNRWA from activity within Israel and revoking the 1967 treaty that allowed the agency to carry out its mission.
    


Yulia Malinovsky, a member of the Israeli parliament who sponsored the bill to ban UNRWA, confirmed the closure orders. The schools will have until May 8, she said.
    


            “We're also working very hard to close the water and electricity to all of UNRWA's facilities (in areas occupied by Israel),” Malinovsky said. “We're doing everything we can to implement the UNRWA bills fully in all institutions and in all aspects.”
    


            Israel has long sought to dismantle the UN agency, arguing that some of its employees are members of Hamas and that UNRWA's education system teaches students to hate Israel.
    


            A UN-commissioned inquiry found that examples in textbooks of anti-Israel bias were “marginal” but nonetheless constituted “a grave violation of neutrality.”
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have alleged that a handful of UNRWA's 13,000 employees in Gaza participated in the October 7 massacre. UNRWA has repeatedly denied these accusations, saying there is “absolutely no ground for a blanket description of ‘the institution as a whole' being ‘totally infiltrated.'”

            UNRWA was founded by the United Nations a year after the 1948 creation of Israel that led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes in an event known by Palestinians as the “Nakba” (catastrophe).
    


            The agency, which began by assisting about 750,000 Palestinian refugees in 1950, now serves some 5.9 million across the Middle East, many of whom live in refugee camps in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and East Jerusalem as well as in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria.
    


            In the Gaza Strip, which has been ravaged by a devastating Israeli war for more than a year, UNRWA serves some 1.7 million Palestinian refugees. In the West Bank and East Jerusalem, it assists around 871,500 refugees.
    


            On Wednesday, an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City killed at least 23 Palestinians, including eight children, according to Gaza's Civil Defense, as the Israeli military said it targeted a senior Hamas militant.
    


            The strike destroyed a four-story residential building in the Al-Shujaiya neighborhood in Gaza City and wounded at least 60 others, the Civil Defense said. More than 30 Palestinians are also missing under the rubble, the organization said, including 19 members from one family.
    


            “I was heading out to fill water and, on my return back, all of a sudden an entire block was targeted with women and children,” said Hatem Jundyeh, who lives nearby. “What have we done? Are we Hamas so they strike us?”
    


            In the aftermath of the strike, rescue crews searched under the debris for any signs of life. One group pulled the body of young boy from the rubble, his body limp and his face bloodied. Another crew nearby tried to jackhammer through enormous slabs of destroyed concrete in a race to save anyone who might still be trapped.
    


            “What tools do we have? The entire world is fighting us,” said one volunteer with the Civil Defense. “We recovered a body of a child, but next to him there – his brothers and parents and siblings. The entire world is watching with silence.”
    


            Ambulances quickly filled with the wounded in a rush for medical treatment. At the hospital, Palestinians killed in the strike were wrapped in white cloths or rugs.
    


            Dr. Fadel Naim, director of Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza, said on social media that one of “the most harrowing cases I've witnessed during this war” was a 20-year-old woman who had both breasts and an arm amputated. “What crime did she commit to deserve such brutal disfigurement and the shattering of her future?” Naim asked.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they struck a “senior Hamas terrorist” who planned and carried out attacks from northern Gaza. “Prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate harm to civilians including the use of precise weapons, aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence,” the IDF said in a statement after the strike. The IDF did not identify the target of the strike.
    


            The strike in northern Gaza comes as the IDF expands its operations in Rafah in the southern portion of the coastal enclave, as a source familiar with the matter tells CNN Israel is planning to hold a significant portion of Gaza for an “indefinite” period of time.
    


            Last week, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced a major expansion of the military's operation in Gaza involving the seizure of large areas of land that would be “incorporated into Israel's security zones.”
    


            The operation would also involve “large-scale evacuation of Gaza's population from combat zones,” his statement said without specifying details. Katz said the military operation would expand to “crush and clear the area of terrorists and terror infrastructure, while seizing large areas that will be incorporated into Israel's security zone.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Dress Codes: Why don't women get as many pockets as men?","https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/09/style/women-clothes-pockets-men-dress-codes/index.html","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 12:02:00 GMT","


    Editor's Note: Examining clothes through the ages, Dress Codes investigates how the rules of fashion have influenced different cultural arenas — and your closet.



            It's a familiar exchange to many women: “I love your dress.” “Thanks, it has pockets!”
    


            So coveted is the spacious inset pouch in womenswear that when they exist, they are likely to attract attention. Take Dua Lipa's look at the 2023 Met Gala — a vintage, cream-colored Chanel gown with pockets she was able to slip her hands inside, to the delight of many internet users, or Emma Stone's decision to stuff the exaggerated hip pockets of her red Louis Vuitton dress with popcorn at Saturday Night Live's 50th anniversary celebration.
    


            Usable pockets seem like an obvious feature to include in ready-to-wear garments, but that is far from the case. It is standard for dresses and skirts to be pocketless, and when pockets do exist in slacks and blazers, they can be deceptively small. Other times, they're just deceptive: see the fake pockets that come as a shallow lip over a disappointing seam on a pair of jeans, or a jacket with flaps but no actual opening beneath it.
    


            Yet the demand for pockets is clear. Online, fantasies for pocket space find a like-minded audience, from designer Nicole McLaughlin's hyperfunctional creations made from upcycled materials (chip-and-dip work vest, anyone?) to Y2K throwback creator Erin Miller cramming childhood paraphernalia into her old JNCO jeans, Mary Poppins-style. The question is rinsed and repeated in forums and on social media: Why don't women get as many pockets as men?
    


            If it all feels vaguely sexist, it is, according to Hannah Carlson, an apparel design lecturer at the Rhode Island School of Design and the author of “Pockets: An Intimate History of How We Keep Things Close.” Since the internal pouch's arrival in fashion, women have been “differently pocketed,” Carlson said — marking a symbol of gender inequality for hundreds of years.
    


            The lack of pockets in women's clothing may feel  “perplexing,” because they “seem like just this simple, functional device,” she said on a phone call with CNN. “I think objects reveal the things we don't want to say out loud. We still live in a patriarchy, and (the) objects (in our lives) are made under those conditions.”
    


            One of the earliest forms of pockets were  drawstring bags stitched into men's breeches in the 1550s. Before that, both men and women carried their belongings independently. “That men had a fashion bag I think is something we tend to forget,” Carlson explained.
    


            But as tailoring advanced and custom-fit garments were created for men, “pockets really came into play.”

            That was largely not the case for women, who at the time continued to wear purses suspended from their belts.  As menswear evolved it began to incorporate a variety of pockets, evident in the European three-piece suits developed from Persian kaftans by the late 17th-century, she noted. 



            Carlson found that it took centuries for womens' clothing to acquire practical pockets at all. Instead, they were saddled with awkward options, including tear-shaped pouches stitched onto skirts or tie-on pockets that were always at risk of coming undone. For a brief period in the 1870s and '80s, dressmakers placed pockets in the back of the bustle, requiring wearers to slip a hand backwards and rummage around for their belongings. When some French and British female equestrians adopted riding overcoats with pockets during the 18th century, they were nicknamed “Amazons” — after the female warriors in Greek mythology — and criticized for their masculine dress.
    


            Pockets had become associated with an adventurous, enterprising (and therefore, male) spirit, as evidenced by the tools and objects scaled down to fit inside them: the pocket knife, pocket watch and pocket pistol, to name a few. Carrying a number of objects on oneself was considered resourceful, according to Carlson — but not for women, whose tie-on pockets, popular across the 17th and 18th centuries, were likened to female genitalia by caricaturists or ridiculed in writings from the era, with their size equaling suspicion for what was inside.
    


            Transporting too many belongings had negative implications of gender and class, not unlike the “ludicrously capacious bag” in the final season of TV series “Succession.'” The remark was made by the calculating corporate climber Tom Wambsgans, on spotting a large Burberry handbag worn by a woman outside of the Roy family's inner circle. (“What's even in there?” Wambsgans speculated. “Flat shoes for the subway? Her lunch pail? It's gargantuan. You could take it camping. You could slide it across the floor after a bank job.”)
    


            Pockets prompted a range of connotations for men who kept their hands inside them — criminal activity, sexual deviancy, rebellious attitudes — further reinforcing them as a distinctly male feature. But at their core, pockets represented functional clothing, and women's dress was meant to be decorative; these ideas crystallized during the Enlightenment era, which also led to men ditching their heels and more ornate adornments, and instead adopting more sober, standardized dress.
    


            “Men's fashion was systematized a century earlier than women's,” Carlson pointed out. With no tradition for women's pockets, they were left out; instead handbags emerged as an entire market for holding women's things.
    


            “It's historical circumstance and contingency and sexism all together, it's like this perfect storm,” she said.
    


            Today's disgruntled calls for pockets are not new — in fact they became associated with the Suffrage movement at the turn of the 20th century as women demanded the right to vote. Men walked down the street “free as a lark,” activist Elizabeth Cady Stanton once complained, according to “Pockets,” while women were restricted by holding or carrying their belongings. Retorting against the anti-Suffragist idea that voting was not a “natural right” for women, feminist poet Alice Duer Miller used the right to pockets as a biting metaphor in the 1915 publication, “Are Women People? A Book of Rhymes for Suffrage Time.”
    


            But as womenswear modernized in the 20th century across the West, allowing wearers to ditch restrictive corsets and full skirts and opt for a wider range of silhouettes, pockets finally made more regular appearances. Wartime accelerated these changes, with more women requiring practical outfits — which included pockets — as they entered the workforce and enlisted in the military.
    


            In the pages of Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, fashion illustrations imagined new feminine takes on the component: snap pockets and coin-purse-style pockets on outerwear, or pockets tailored to the needs of computer programmers (designed by Bonnie Cashin and illustrated by Andy Warhol in 1958) or to hold tennis balls on the courts. In 1940, the transformative fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli designed a gold-embroidered dinner jacket with “cash and carry” front pockets to replace the handbag — and in case the wearer needed her hands free to secure her gas mask.
    


            Still, the sexist double standards around pockets have continued to be present in absurd ways. In World War II, the 150,000 volunteers for Women's Army Corps (WAC), who served in non-combat roles, carried regulation leather purses as part of their uniforms, which included faux pocket flaps. “Army designers cannot figure out how to make a useful pocket for women; they get rid of the breast pocket, because it's unseemly to put your hand in your breast,” Carlson explained. Because the organization was met with derision by the press and public, “the uniform had to be as feminine as possible.”

            Postwar, and with the efforts of second-wave feminism in the 1960s, pants became more widely acceptable for women, but pocket sizes have not always followed. A 2018 study by online culture publication The Pudding comparing men's and women's skinny jeans and straight jeans found striking disparities in size, with women's designs often unable to hold basic personal items or the wearer's hand.
    


            The acceleration of fast fashion has only complicated the issue, as non-essential features are cheapened or ditched in a bid to push down prices. By now, the idea is firmly entrenched: pockets are a given for men's clothing, but expendable for women's.
    


            The fashion industry “assumes women are going to carry handbags and doesn't want to (put in) the extra work and cost,” Carlson said.
    


            Pockets continue to be seen as an interruption, too, as designers have emphasized clothing that elevates the contours of women's bodies at the expense of carrying space. That's not to say that pockets never get a moment — cargo pants are back (though some, inexplicably, have pockets without buttons) and fashion designers have been praised for bringing the pocket back on the runway. But their historic lack of availability makes them something to be noted and noticed, a space to hold objects of desire that has become one itself.
    


            Ultimately, the idea that “fit is more important than utility” has remained, Carlson said. That even goes for “utilitarian” styles — this writer's ASOS jumpsuit, worn while reporting this piece, has three fake pocket flaps on the chest and in the back. There may be larger concerns for women's rights in any given decade, but the pocket remains a small, glaring reminder of gender inequality, and is, frankly, a nuisance.

Follow:


            Only a few days after Ja Morant was fined by the NBA for a contentious celebration, the Memphis Grizzlies star was at it again.
    


            Having apparently retired the finger-gun gesture which saw him fined $75,000 by the league, Morant celebrated a three-pointer against the Charlotte Hornets by pretending to throw a grenade into the Spectrum Center crowd.
    


            This came in the first quarter of Tuesday's road game as Morant feigned the pulling of a pin with his teeth before covering his ears with his hands.
    


            Memphis went on to win 124-100 with Morant recording a game-high 28 points along with eight assists and five rebounds.

            Neither Morant nor Grizzlies interim head coach Tuomas Iisalo commented on the celebration after the game.
    


            The NBA fined the 25-year-old point guard last week for “twice making an inappropriate gesture on the playing court” – against the Golden State Warriors, which led to a warning from the league, and then again against the Miami Heat.
    


            Morant has previously said that he is “well aware” of the criticism he has received for the finger-gun celebration, adding that he is “kind of used to it” and “pretty much a villain for two years now.”
    


            The NBA has already handed him two lengthy suspensions in 2023 after Morant appeared to flash a gun in Instagram live streams on two separate occasions.
    


            The victory against the Hornets marked the Grizzlies third-straight win having fired Taylor Jenkins – the most successful coach in the team's history – at the end of last month.
    


            However, the win was overshadowed by a serious-looking injury to rookie Jaylen Wells, who was stretchered off the court in the second quarter after being undercut by Hornets guard KJ Simpson during a dunk attempt.
    


            Wells appeared to land on his head and was immediately tended to by medical staff. Simpson seemed distressed by the fall and went to check on his opponent, before later being called for a flagrant 2 foul, leading to an automatic ejection.
    


            The game was resumed after a delay of more than 20 minutes, and Iisalo later confirmed that Wells had suffered a broken wrist but was moving all of his extremities.
    


            “Puts everything into perspective, seeing that situation and seeing Jalen there,” he told reporters. “Tough situation for everybody, he's an incredibly tough kid, had a great season and he's in all of our thoughts.”
    


            Desmond Bane scored 19 points for Memphis, while Zach Edey had 17 points and 19 rebounds. The Grizzlies are seventh in the Western Conference with a 47-32 record and next face the Minnesota Timberwolves on Thursday.

            A new documentary reveals the incredible results of a project to create 3D underwater scans of the doomed ocean liner RMS Titanic, which sank 113 years ago.
    


            “Titanic: The Digital Resurrection” tells the story of how deep-sea mapping company Magellan created “the most precise model of the Titanic ever created: a full-scale, 1:1 digital twin, accurate down to the rivet,” according to a statement from National Geographic, published Tuesday.
    


            When Titanic set sail on April 10, 1912, she was the largest passenger ship in service and considered unsinkable.
    


            Just four days later, Titanic's maiden voyage became an international tragedy when she struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic at 11:40 p.m. April 14. She sank in less than three hours.
    


            The ship did not have enough lifeboats for the approximately 2,220 people on board. More than 1,500 people died in the accident, and Titanic became the most famous shipwreck in history. There were just over 700 survivors.

            The 90-minute National Geographic documentary allows filmmaker Anthony Geffen “to reconstruct the ship's final moments—challenging long-held assumptions and revealing new insights into what truly happened on that fateful night in 1912,” according to the statement.
    


            In the film, Titanic analyst Parks Stephenson, metallurgist Jennifer Hooper and master mariner Chris Hearn walk around a full-scale reproduction of the ship, highlighting previously hidden details.
    


            One key finding is a visibly open steam valve, which corroborates accounts that engineers manned their stations in Boiler Room Two for more than two hours after Titanic hit the iceberg.

            This maintained the electricity supply and allowed crew to send distress signals, meaning the 35 men in the boiler room may have sacrificed themselves to save hundreds of other people.
    


            The team also reconstruct hull fragments found scattered around the site, revealing that Titanic didn't split in two, but “was violently torn apart, ripping through first-class cabins where prominent passengers like J.J. Astor and Benjamin Guggenheim may have sought refuge as the ship went down.”
    


            The scan also helps to exonerate First Officer William Murdoch, who has been accused of abandoning his post. The position of a lifeboat davit, a piece of equipment used to lower the craft, corroborates testimony that Murdoch was, in fact, washed out to sea as the crew prepared to launch it.
    


            Magellan's scans also reveal how parts of the wreck are collapsing, but National Geographic said the digital twin means “the Titanic is preserved in perfect detail as it appeared in 2022, securing its place in history for generations to come and marking a new era in underwater archaeology.”
    


“Titanic: The Digital Resurrection” will premiere on National Geographic on April 11, and then be available on streaming services Disney+ and Hulu from April 12.

Follow:


            German Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz has unveiled a new coalition deal between the country's two major centrist parties in a bold and optimistic speech in Berlin on Wednesday, hours after it was announced that an agreement to form a new government had been reached.
    


            Pressure was on between the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) to reach an agreement as Europe's largest economy teeters on the brink of recession after sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration caused global turmoil.
    


            The deal was presented by Merz, leader of the CDU, which emerged as winner in February's federal election. Also present at the news conference was leader of the CDU's Bavarian sister party Christian Social Union (CSU), Markus Soeder, and co-leaders of the center-left Social Democratic party (SPD) Saskia Esken and Lars Klingbeil.
    


            Speaking during a news conference, Merz laid out a vision of a Germany restored to its former strength and reliability. “The future government, the future coalition, will reform and invest to keep Germany stable, make it more secure and make it economically stronger again,” he said. He added that Europe would be able to “rely” on Germany.
    


            Merz continued that the coalition negotiations had been carried out “in a situation of growing political tensions around the world,” and at a time when many outside forces are working not with Germany, but against it.
    


            “The war in Ukraine continues unabated, the Russian aggressor (President Vladimir) Putin is showing no willingness to end the war and silence the weapons, and at the same time the economic uncertainties are increasing enormously – just this week decisions by the American government have triggered new turbulence, we can observe the reactions in real time, so to speak,” he said, referring to Trump's widereaching tariff announcement.
    


            Unveiling the details of the agreement, Merz said the new coalition would lengthen the amount of time it takes to obtain German citizenship to at least five years — up from a minimum of three years previously.
    


            He also spoke of a need to improve Germany's foreign and domestic security policies, including dramatically increasing Germany's defense spending and creating a Swedish-style voluntary military service scheme.
    


            Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz's CDU party emerged victorious in February's vote but failed to win a majority, with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) surging into second place and almost doubling its supporter base.
    


            Since then, the CDU/CSU have for weeks been locked in formal coalition talks with the SPD – Germany's other main centrist party, which came in third in the vote and had led a three-way coalition government until its collapse in November 2024.

            Pressure in Berlin to reach a deal had only mounted in the face of wider uncertainty, including the Trump administration's introduction of sweeping import tariffs that have reshaped global trade. Merz has promised to revive Europe's largest economy if he becomes chancellor, after years of uncharacteristic stagnation.
    


            Continued mounting support for the AfD since the election also infused the talks with a sense of urgency. An Ipsos poll released Wednesday showed the far-right coming out on top for the first time, landing on 25%, ahead of the CDU on 24%.
    


            “For the first time in the still-young history of the AfD, we are the strongest force in Germany. Thank you for your tremendous trust - the political change will come!” AfD co-leader Alice Weidel wrote in a post on X alongside the poll's findings.
    


            Merz has also pledged to boost the country's defense spending, as Europe grapples with the threat from Russia and the US adopting a more hostile stance to European security. Berlin has reformed its so-called “debt brake” in order to loosen borrowing limits and allow for new investments in defense.
    


            Merz has vowed to significantly tighten Germany's immigration policies following a series of attacks perpetrated by migrants that catapulted the issue to the forefront of the 2025 election.

            Having a cat or a dog to keep you company could boost your wellbeing as much as being married or meeting up regularly with friends and relatives, new research suggests.
    


            The study, which was published on March 31 in the journal Social Indicators Research, concludes that having an animal companion is worth up to £70,000 ($90,000) a year in life satisfaction – a metric economists use to quantify the “implicit price” of otherwise intangible things.  



            That figure is roughly the same as the theoretical boost in income you would get from having a spouse or meeting up with friends and relatives regularly, researchers said, comparing their findings with other studies that have used the same statistical method.

            The results surprised even the researchers. “First when I obtained the values I was surprised; I was thinking that is a lot of money even for me who loves (pets),” said Adelina Gschwandtner, an economics professor at the University of Kent, who co-authored the paper.  



            Then, she thought, “most people claim that their pets are like friends or family members to them, so that is comparable,” she told CNN.
    


            “If pets are indeed like friends and family, why shouldn't that measure be comparable to talking to friends and family once a week? You have your pet every day.”
    


            Although the mental and physical health benefits of having a dog, in particular, are well known, there is more debate among scientists surrounding the overall impact of pets on their owners' wellbeing.
    


            “(It's) a little bit more complex than people think,” says Megan Mueller, an associate professor at Tufts University, who studies the relationship between people and animals and wasn't involved in this study.
    


            “A lot of us perceive our pets as contributing to our life satisfaction but depending on how you measure that in the research it comes out different ways,” she told CNN, adding that she was unfamiliar with the specific statistical analysis Gschwandtner used in this study.
    


            In their study, Gschwandtner and her co-author Michael Gmeiner, an assistant profes sor of economics at the London School of Economics, used data collected in a long-running survey of 2,500 British households.

            Rather than simply comparing life satisfaction and pet ownership, which would reveal little except a correlation between the two variables, the economists then set about proving a causal link.
    


            To do this, they used a complicated statistical tool known as an instrumental variables approach. This works by finding “a third variable which is correlated with … in our case the pets but is not correlated with life satisfaction,” Gschwandtner explained.
    


            “And so what this variable tries to capture is potential omitted variables, potential reverse causation.”
    


            For example, the authors wrote, “It could be that happy and healthy people decide to take a pet as a companion rather than pets making people happy and healthy.” So, in their research, they used survey data on personality types as well as pet ownership and life satisfaction, to control for this factor.
    


            If pets improve life satisfaction as much as the study suggests, Gschwandtner called on policymakers to make it easier for people to own them, for example by relaxing regulations that restrict renters' access to them.
    


            However, Mueller cautioned against “anthropomorphizing pets too much” and equating our relationships with them to our relationships with other humans.
    


            “There's some elements that are similar,” she said. “And we know that social support and emotional support are really key aspects of human-pet relationships that are also the same types of support we get from our human social connections… While animals are connected to us in powerful ways, they are not the same as humans.”

Follow:


            Misha Pride, then the mayor of South Portland, Maine, was greeting voters early on Election Day when police cars suddenly swarmed outside the city's community center with lights flashing.
    


            “Possible shooting,” the city manager texted Pride. Officers locked down the center.
    


            Authorities quickly determined the call to police was a hoax, one of hundreds of threats and cyberattacks last November aimed at disrupting the presidential election – some pushed by partisan zealots, others perpetrated by foreign state actors including Russia and China. Voting at the community center was delayed by only ten minutes.
    


            The attacks in Maine, and elsewhere across the US, had minimal impact because of strong preparation and quick work by an information-sharing and analysis network of hundreds of federal, state and local election, cybersecurity and law-enforcement officials.
    


            But now key parts of this network, much of it built over the past eight years, are being systematically dismantled by the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, a CNN investigation has found – leaving election offices across the country scrambling to protect against future threats.
    


            In early February, Musk's team laid off 130 staffers at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, including 10 regional security specialists who worked with local and state election officials. The Trump administration is also advancing plans to strip civil service protections from 80% of the remaining CISA workforce, potentially allowing them to be fired for political reasons. Attorney General Pam Bondi that month disbanded a key FBI task force charged with investigating foreign efforts to influence elections. She also left in the wind the fate of another FBI task force that investigated threats against election workers and polling places.
    


            Homeland Security chief Kristi Noem, meanwhile, on March 6 canceled the funding for national information sharing efforts that helped state and local election officials detect and ward off coordinated hacking attacks and other threats.
    


            Those moves come as Trump has appointed to key positions officials who embrace his false claims of widespread voting fraud, including Bondi, Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel, among others – and as Trump has cashiered the head of the National Security Agency and the US Cyber Command, Gen. Timothy Haugh, who was involved in countering Russian interference in past elections.
    


            Trump officials argue that some of the election security agencies targeted for cuts were improperly hurting the president's allies. During her confirmation hearing in January, Noem said that CISA has “gotten far off mission” in trying to combat foreign disinformation. She pledged to help “rein in” the agency, which critics say pushed social media companies to target conservative commentators. Bondi said disbanding the Foreign Influence Task Force was necessary to end the “risk of further weaponization … of prosecutorial discretion.”
    


            But the administration's actions have deeply alarmed state officials, who warn the next round of national elections will be seriously imperiled by the cuts. A bipartisan association representing 46 secretaries of state, and several individual top state election officials, have pressed the White House about how critical functions protecting election security will perform going forward. They have not received clear answers, according to documents shared with CNN.
    


            Trump has justified his efforts to exert more control over America's state and local election systems as a way of stopping illegal voting by noncitizens and other voter fraud, both of which experts say are rare.
    


            Officials involved in administering elections say the moves already are making it harder, and less safe and secure, to vote in America.
    


            “It's absolutely hypocritical,” said Sen. Alex Padilla, a Democrat and former secretary of state of California, “for a president who has lied ad nauseam about rampant voter fraud to be undoing the very tools we rely on to protect the integrity and security of our elections.”
    


            Much of the election security system now under siege by Trump was created during his first term in the wake of the 2016 election. After the US intelligence community determined that Russia and its proxies had engaged in hacks, disinformation campaigns and direct cyberattacks against voter-registration systems and election offices – largely seeking to help Trump – the outgoing Obama administration declared the elections system as critical infrastructure in January 2017.
    


            That fall, Trump's first FBI director, Christopher Wray, established the Foreign Influence Task Force “to identify and counteract … malign foreign influence operations,” including those aimed at US elections. Trump signed into law an act creating CISA in 2018, halfway through his first term, to help protect the country's critical infrastructure against physical and cyber threats. From the start, that included election infrastructure.
    


            But more recently, CISA has come under fire from Republicans over efforts to get social media companies to remove disinformation about Covid-19 and about elections. Project 2025, a blueprint created by the conservative Heritage Foundation and allies for a second Trump term, targeted CISA, the FBI and the Department of Justice as part of what it termed the “censorship industrial complex.” That blueprint argued that CISA should engage only in assessing the security of elections offices, and not in planning, incident-response management, or much of its other work.
    


            It's part of a “broader right-wing effort to dismantle the networks that existed to correct the record on the 2020 election and push back on false information on elections,” said Lawrence Norden, vice president of the Elections and Government Program at the non-profit Brennan Center.
    


            In early February, CISA acting director Bridget Bean fired 130 employees and, in a memo first obtained by Wired, put all election-security and counter-disinformation work on hold pending an internal review. The agency hasn't revealed the outcome of that review, which was completed March 6. A CISA spokesperson said the review “is not planned to be released publicly.”
    


            While courts have since ordered CISA to reinstate the fired employees, some said as of April 8 that they remain on administrative leave.
    


            “I was terminated February 20… technically I was reinstated yesterday [March 17], but I don't have anything that guarantees I'm back,” Kyle Rahn, a manager in CISA's infrastructure security division, told CNN. “I don't have my ID to log into systems; I don't have my IT equipment.”
    


            Noem also ordered CISA in February and March to cancel more than $9 million in annual contracts with the Center for Internet Security, a non-profit group. Many of the cuts imposed by DHS targeted the Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center, or EI-ISAC, which brought together more than 1,300 election and law enforcement officials around the country to help monitor and share information about threats to voting.
    


            That center played a key role in alerting officials that the scores of emailed and phone threats they were seeing on Election Day – like the one in South Portland – were false. And it helped counter thousands of hacks, cyberattacks and other threats to that election. Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat, said that, nationwide, the EI-ISAC “saw a 158% increase in the number of cyberthreats reported by members from 2023 to 2024.” On Election Day alone, a domain-security service provided through the center blocked more than 138,000 attempted links to malicious domains, according to a Center for Internet Security assessment.
    


            Election officials and CISA employees say the loss of that center raises alarm bells.
    


            “The election integrity ISAC is gone,” Rahn said. “That just blows my mind. … Intentionally, unintentionally, they're creating holes.”
    


            Bellows added, “What made EI-ISAC special was that collaboration of election officials directly with each other all across the nation. We've lost information sharing among election officials nationwide.”
    


            A CISA spokesperson told CNN that election officials “have access to the same CISA support as other critical infrastructure entities, including access to cyber and physical security services and incident response.” A spokesperson also said the EI-ISAC contract termination “did not preclude CIS from funding the EI-ISAC with other funds.”
    


            In a letter last month to state and local partners, the Center for Internet Security said it would try to figure out “how best to support these critical services without federal funding.” But 28 states have adopted laws in recent years that bar election offices from accepting private donations and privately funded services – which could apply in this instance, officials said.
    


            Meanwhile, Bondi in February disbanded the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force. Last year, it was among several agencies that warned that Russia, Iran and other countries were conducting operations meant “to undermine public confidence in the integrity of U.S. elections and stoke divisions among Americans.”
    


            Bondi said the administration needed to “free resources to address more pressing priorities.”
    


            The head of the FBI Elections Threats Task Force, John Keller, who also served as the acting head of the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section, resigned last month after prosecutors were ordered to drop federal corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Bondi has thus far left the position unfilled and the fate of the task force unclear.
    


            The Department of Justice did not respond to queries from CNN about the task force.
    


            In the weeks since the sweeping cuts to CISA and other agencies, local and state election officials have scrambled for answers about how to guarantee election security without that federal help.
    


            New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, a Democrat, told CNN, “There's been so much work done … to shore those up and create a national network. Now we're looking at it being completely dismantled. We feel like we're having to combat these foreign threats and domestic threats as individual states. Without the assistance of the federal government, how do we make that happen?”
    


            In a February 21 letter, the bipartisan National Association of Secretaries of State urged Noem not to toss out CISA's core election services, noting that the election systems are officially considered critical infrastructure. They said that EI-ISAC and CISA have helped protect recent elections from “sophisticated cyber threat actors including nation-state and cybercriminal groups.”
    


            A coalition of US senators, led by Padilla, also wrote to CISA leaders demanding explanations for terminating EI-ISAC, slashing the agency's workforce, and related actions.
    


            On February 10, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes wrote to Trump comparing the cuts at CISA to “kneecapping the Federal Aviation Administration while [it's] managing thousands of active flights.” The next month, the Democratic official detailed in a letter to Noem how CISA and the federal government had helped probe threats to Arizona election officials and disrupt bomb threats and false voting fraud claims from Russian groups. He asked her to commit to leaving CISA's election services intact.
    


            Fontes said an official at the White House called him in response, but didn't offer any clear answers. The White House executive office didn't respond to CNN requests for comment.
    


            “The biggest issue I have right now is the abject lack of communication from the administration. If they're just going to wholly eviscerate these services, that's highly problematic,” the Democratic secretary of state told CNN. “The very existence of these task forces and agencies is, in itself, a deterrent. If they're gone, we're going to have a lot more problems.”
    


            Noem wrote to the secretaries of state on March 7, saying that election officials could continue to receive “cyber and physical security assessments, incident response planning resources, and tabletop exercises” through a body knows as the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center. That center, also operated by the Center for Internet Security, offers general cybersecurity services to state and local governments.
    


            But Homeland Security is evaluating possible further cuts by the end of this fiscal year, September 30 – including to networked sensors that detect attempted intrusions and cyberattacks, and quickly share that information with election offices around the country.
    


            “The information sharing is supremely important,” Padilla told CNN. “As a former California secretary of state, I saw how valuable it was … in protecting the integrity and security of our elections,” especially, he added for smaller counties and localities that have tiny staffs and few resources.
    


            Padilla and a coalition of 31 senators also wrote to Bondi on March 17 asking her to explain her plans for the FBI's Election Threats Task Force and urging her not to shutter it.
    


            Bondi has yet to comment on the future of that task force or to appoint a successor to Keller. “You won't hear anything more about it,” a person close to that task force, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation, told CNN. “It will just quietly go away.”
    


            Padilla's office said March 31 that he was still waiting for a response from Bondi about the fate of the task force.
    


            “They're undoing resources at the FBI that protect election workers and officials from threats of violence,” the California Democrat told CNN. “It's the wrong thing to do.”
    


            The cuts hitting the national election security apparatus come as Trump has sought to exert more control over elections.
    


            On March 25, the president issued a sweeping executive order that he said was meant to protect the integrity of elections. But the order largely reflected Trump's debunked claims that large numbers of noncitizens vote illegally and that voting by mail is riddled with fraud.
    


            Trump ordered states to give DOGE access to voter rolls. His order also tries to force states to require federally approved IDs to register to vote – a move that critics say would make it harder for millions of people who don't have such IDs. And Trump told Bondi to take “enforcement action” against the roughly 20 states that accept mailed ballots that arrive after Election Day.
    


            On April 1, a coalition of voting-rights groups filed suit in US District Court in Washington, DC challenging the constitutionality of Trump's executive order. The suit argues that the order would take powers reserved to the states and to Congress, and that it would disenfranchise millions of eligible voters. At least three other lawsuits have been filed challenging the order, including one filed April 3 in US District Court in Boston by 19 Democratic state attorneys general.
    


            Meanwhile, some state election officials are discussing how to protect elections on their own – for example, by replacing, at least in part, the information sharing about threats and cyberattacks that was central to EI-ISAC.
    


            In Arizona, Fontes has led an effort to set up a lab to identify artificial intelligence-related election threats and has proposed an alternative non-profit information-sharing center to replace the shuttered EI-ISAC. Fontes' office said he has been in touch with his counterparts in other states, along with other potential partners, to try to secure funding for the effort – a prospect that could be a challenge in Republican-controlled state legislatures, like Arizona's.
    


            Even if a state-level network emerges, it's not clear whether it would be granted the same level of collaboration from federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies under Trump. One reason that matters: There's little question that “Russia, Iran and China will continue to attempt to interfere in the next election,” said Gowri Ramachandran, a director for elections and security at the Brennan Center for Justice, and co-chair of Fontes' advisory committee on AI and election security.
    


            CISA was “privy to information from so many sources,” said Kim Wyman, CISA's former elections security lead. “They had this bird's-eye view of the national security elections subsector in a way that didn't exist before. They could take this information and analyze it in ways to make it accessible to state and local election offices.”
    


            Many election officials told CNN they have broader concerns about the fate of elections going forward – and about the likelihood that further cuts to security programs may be in the offing. A person familiar with the situation at CISA said as many as 1,300 additional positions are expected to be cut this month.
    


            “I'm worried that there are folks in the state and federal government who want to completely dismantle the election security infrastructure,” said Fontes.

India's central bank cut its key interest rate for the second time this year on Wednesday. The 0.25 bps cut to the repo rate from the previous 6.25% is expected to decrease borrowing costs for both consumers and businesses, with the goal of boosting economic activity, according to the bank.

The repo rate is the interest rate at which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lends to commercial banks for their short-term needs. Adjusting this rate is a major tool to manage liquidity and control inflation.

The RBI's cut also comes at a time when the US has imposed reciprocal tariffs of 26% on the world's fifth largest economy.

The RBI said in its monetary policy statement on Wednesday that the increased tariffs had led to greater uncertainties, obscuring the economic outlook worldwide and creating additional challenges for global growth and inflation.

Governor Sanjay Malhotra said that in light of all this, the central bank will transition from a “neutral stance” to an “accommodative” one. This refers to an approach where a central bank adopts a supportive and expansionary policy to stimulate economic growth and stability.

Malhotra said, “the dent on global growth due to trade frictions will impede domestic growth and higher tariffs shall have a negative impact on net exports.” 

Adding that he was “more concerned” about growth, the governor hinted at more rate cuts this year. He also cautioned that uncertainty in itself “dampens growth by affecting investment and spending decisions of businesses and households.” 

However, Malhotra noted that India was better equipped to handle the tariff increases due to its smaller trade surplus with the US and also because tariffs imposed on the country were lower than those for other major economies.

Wednesday's rate cuts need to be seen in the light of a slowdown in India's economy. India's GDP grew by 6.2% in the fourth quarter of 2024, which was lower than expected, and the economy is projected to grow by 6.5% in the financial year ending March 2025, a significant decline from the 9.2% growth seen in the previous year.

The RBI said that it cut interest rates due to a “decisive improvement” in the inflation outlook, and is confident that inflation will meet its 4% target within the next 12 months.

Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who is in London on an official visit, said on Tuesday that India's economy is expected to remain a key driver of growth due to its resilience and strong domestic demand, despite the changing global trade dynamics caused by US tariffs.

The maternal and newborn mortality rates in Africa have dropped since 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported on Monday.  

Between 2000 and 2020, maternal deaths in the African region decreased by 40%, from 727 to 442 per 100,000 live births, according to the UN's agency. However, the pace of this decline is still insufficient to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of fewer than 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030. 

According to the data, over 60% of countries in Africa now report that more than 80% of births are attended by skilled health workers, up from 28% in 2010. Despite this progress, significant gaps remain in rural and crisis-affected areas across the region. 

“Key barriers to progress include inadequate financing, weak governance, health workforce shortages and recurring shocks, such as disease outbreaks and conflicts, all of which disrupt maternal and child health services. In fragile and crisis-affected settings, women and children are particularly at risk,” the WHO stressed. 

The region still accounts for 70% of the world's recorded deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth, with an estimated 178,000 maternal deaths and 1 million newborn fatalities occurring annually in Africa. 

The agency identifies several factors contributing to maternal deaths, including severe bleeding, infections, high blood pressure during pregnancy, complications from delivery, and unsafe abortions. Newborn deaths are often caused by preterm birth, complications during delivery, and infections. Many of these deaths are preventable with timely interventions. 

The WHO emphasizes the need for accelerated efforts to improve maternal and newborn health in Africa.  

“In too many places, pregnancy and childbirth are still life-threatening events ... Every dollar invested in maternal and newborn health delivers major returns: healthier families, stronger societies and sustainable economic growth,” Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, Acting WHO Regional Director for Africa said.  

The Guardian cited a warning by UNISEF director Catherine Russell that global funding cuts to health services are endangering more pregnant women, particularly in vulnerable areas, by restricting access to essential care. She stressed the need for investment “in midwives, nurses and community health workers to ensure every mother and baby has a chance to survive and thrive.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Global tariff war: Key developments","https://www.rt.com/news/615442-global-tariff-war-us-china/","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 12:34:00 GMT","

China announced on Wednesday that it will raise tariffs on US goods to 84%, up from the previous 34%, amid a deepening trade war between the world's two largest economies that analysts warn could spark a global recession.

Beijing's move came a day after US President Donald Trump declared a sweeping 104% tariff on all Chinese imports – far higher than the 34% hike he had initially proposed last week. On April 2, Trump imposed a baseline 10% tariff on all imports and introduced “reciprocal” duties ranging from 11% to 50% on roughly 200 countries he accused of maintaining unfair trade practices.

While most US trade partners threatened retaliation but moved to negotiate, China swiftly responded with its own levies, prompting Trump to escalate further.

The growing standoff has fueled fears of a global trade war and economic downturn. Financial markets have already taken a hit, with major indexes across the US, Europe, and Asia suffering declines for four consecutive days.

09 April 2025

Are Trump's tariffs really just economic nonsense – or part of a bigger, calculated strategy? In this sharp and provocative analysis, economist Igor Makarov challenges the conventional wisdom on trade policy and makes the case that there's more behind Trump's actions than meets the eye.



Following Bessent's remark, Spanish Agriculture Minister Luis Planas has struck a defiant tone, stating that Madrid has “excellent trade relations with China, which we intend to not only continue having, but expanding.”

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that countries considering closer economic ties with China amid Washington's recent draconian tariff policies “would be cutting [their] own throat.” The official expressed confidence that the US would eventually secure deals with allies, and then “approach China as a group.” 

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has said that his country is voting against the European Commission's proposal to impose counter-tariffs on the US. The diplomat argued that “escalation is not the answer,” calling for negotiations instead. 



Today Hungary is voting against the @EU_Commission's proposal to impose counter-tariffs on the US. Escalation is not the answer. Such measures would cause further damage to European economy and citizens by raising prices. The only way forward is negotiations, not retaliation.



The trade war between the US and China could have an adverse effect on Christmas celebrations stateside, Reuters has reported, citing festive decoration manufacturers. The media outlet estimates that 87% of such goods are imported into the US from China, with fears that orders will sag considerably this year.

China's Tourism Ministry has urged the country's citizens to “fully assess the risks of traveling to the United States and be cautious” in light of the “deterioration of China-US economic and trade relations and the domestic security situation in the United States.”

George Saravelos, head Forex researcher at Deutsche Bank, has warned that “we are entering unchartered territory [sic] in the global financial system” amid a “simultaneous collapse in the price of all US assets, including equities, the dollar versus alternative reserve FX and the bond market.”

The US stock market has opened slightly higher than expected, with the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all edging up despite concerns over a potential market meltdown, following China's and the EU's announcements of retaliatory tariffs.

Global markets have been reacting sharply to the escalating tariff war since last Thursday, when a selloff wiped nearly $5 trillion from the value of US stocks.

US recession is “probably” a “likely outcome” of Trump's tariff war, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has told Fox Business. He said he has heard “recessionary talk” in conversations with “just everybody,” referring to other financiers.

“We haven't had any slowdown or real recession... in so long,” Dimon stated, adding that he expects “more credit problems than people have seen in a long time.”

JPMorgan economists raised the risk of a US and global recession this year to 60% after Trump unveiled the tariff hike last week.

Donald Trump has invited global manufacturers to move their business to the US.

“This is a GREAT time to move your COMPANY into the United States of America, to move your COMPANY into the United States of America, like Apple, and so many others, in record numbers, are doing. ZERO TARIFFS, and almost immediate Electrical/Energy hook ups and approvals. No Environmental Delays. DON'T WAIT, DO IT NOW!”

The next round of talks aimed at improving US-Russia diplomatic ties will take place in Istanbul, Türkiye on Thursday, the US State Department has confirmed.

Washington and Moscow have held several rounds of high-level meetings since US President Donald Trump took office, with the next round of negotiations expected in the coming days, the Russian Foreign Ministry said earlier on Tuesday.

“On April 10, US and Russian delegations will meet for a second time in Istanbul to try to make progress on further stabilizing the operations of our bilateral missions,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce confirmed at a press briefing later in the day.

The US official stressed that the upcoming talks are “solely focused on our embassy operations, not on normalizing a bilateral relationship overall, which can only happen, as we've noted, once there is peace between Russia and Ukraine.”

“There are no political or security issues on the agenda, and Ukraine is not – absolutely not – on the agenda,” she added.

In recent years, Russia and the US have cut diplomatic staff at each other's missions, imposed banking restrictions, and seized diplomatic properties. The escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022 further deepened tensions and led to additional measures.

Trump, however, has moved away from many Biden-era policies, calling for a swift resolution to the Ukraine conflict and a reset in bilateral ties. The first meeting between high-level Russian and US delegations took place in Riyadh on February 18, focusing on restoring embassy operations and easing restrictions. A follow-up round in Istanbul on February 27 addressed diplomatic funding and Russia's proposal to reinstate direct flights.

According to Moscow, the venue, format, and participants of this week's talks will remain unchanged. The Russian delegation will be led by the country's new ambassador to Washington, Aleksandr Darchiev, while the US side will be headed by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Eurasian Affairs Sonata Coulter.

Attitudes in France ‘barely evolving' amid ‘collective denial' years after the #MeToo movement began, according to parliamentary commission

Sexual violence and sexual harassment are “endemic” in France's entertainment industry, a damning report by French politicians has found, concluding that women and children are still being routinely preyed on, despite the country's #MeToo movement.

The Green MP Sandrine Rousseau and the centrist Erwan Balanant found that sexual violence, harassment and bullying were “systemic, endemic and persistent” in all sectors of the French culture and entertainment industry, from TV and cinema to theatre, radio, comedy, advertising, rock and classical music.

After a five-month inquiry, in which they described receiving “overwhelming” testimony from almost 400 people, including actors and industry workers, the politicians said attitudes in France were “barely evolving” many years after the #MeToo movement began.

The parliamentary inquiry had heard accounts of rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment, with “numerous” alleged assaults happening recently. They said a decades-long culture of silencing victims was getting worse in France, amid a sense of “collective denial”. They described an “ambient sexism” as well as racism in the sector.

The lawmakers made almost 90 recommendations, including better protections for actors and models aged under 18, and improved regulation of actors' agents and casting procedures.

They also proposed banning the sexualisation of minors on screen and in fashion photos. They said compulsory intimacy coordinators should be present for any scene of intimacy involving minors, and that intimacy coordinators should be suggested as compulsory for cinema, TV and theatre.

Women working on film sets told how, in the course of their daily work, senior male crew members would make sexual comments such as demands for oral sex. Young women described being pushed up against a wall and sexually assaulted while at work. One assistant director described being summoned to see an actor and finding him waiting with his trousers down.

The report found that sexual assault was common during the casting process. Scenes of sex or nudity were also found to have been a place for sexual assaults and rape to occur. One film worker said she realised that a female actor had been raped during a bedroom scene, but the director took no action when it was reported to him.

The report found children were particularly vulnerable and subject to abuse in cinema and the performing arts.

One actor described how, aged 10, she had to appear in a rape scene, but was prevented from meeting the actor first and was taken by surprise when she was grabbed by him. “I was petrified,” she said. Another teenager was pushed and verbally abused during a romantic scene with an actor decades older. One young child had his trousers pulled down on set when he did not want to perform in only his underpants. One director reminded another child of his father's death just before a scene, to get the right look of emotion for a shot.

The politicians called for better regulation of music schools, acting schools and choirs after hearing allegations of a music teacher telling a young girl “to look more like a whore” while playing the flute. They also heard allegations of a choir master kissing girls on the neck.

Rousseau said what struck her in testimony from the film industry was how young some actors were when sexual harassment began. She said: “For some, it started in childhood, in school, at castings and went on all the way through their careers.”

The actor Sara Forestier, who started working in film aged 13, told the inquiry that at her first casting she was asked to take off her underwear and throw it on to someone's plate. Throughout her career she repeatedly had to say “no” to directors who wanted to have sex with her and who threatened to take roles away if she refused.

“In our country, there's a cult of talent and creative genius,” Balanant said, adding that some star directors and actors felt they could act how they pleased.

The report comes weeks after the Paris trial for sexual assault of the French film star, Gérard Depardieu. He denies the charges against him, and the verdict will be announced next month.

The actor and director Judith Godrèche, who became a leading voice in France's #MeToo movement and called for the inquiry, said Wednesday's report was “terrifying”. She has filed complaints against the directors Benoît Jacquot and Jacques Doillon for sexually assaulting her while she was a teenager. Both have denied the allegations.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Falling demand suggests loss of financial confidence in US as Donald Trump escalates trade standoff with China

US government bonds, traditionally seen as one of the world's safest financial assets, are suffering a dramatic sell-off as Donald Trump's escalation of his tariff war with China sends panic through all sectors of the financial markets.

The falls suggest that as Trump's fresh wave of tariffs on dozens of economies came into force, including 104% levies against Chinese goods, investors are beginning to lose confidence in the US as a cornerstone of the global economy.

UK bonds also came under pressure from investors, who sent the cost of financing government borrowing to its highest level since 1998, heaping further pain on Rachel Reeves as the chancellor struggles to prevent her budget plans from being wrecked by a panic on global markets.

The yield – or interest rate – on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury bond rose to 4.516% on Wednesday before slipping back to 4.451%, up 0.14 percentage points on the day. This week it has undergone the three biggest intraday moves since Trump was elected in November. Yields move inversely to prices, so surging yields mean falling prices as demand drops.

The move in the 30-year bond was more dramatic. The yield briefly jumped above 5% to its highest since late 2023 and was last trading at 4.899%, or 0.12 percentage points higher than Tuesday.

Both yields came down from their highest levels, however, after a much-anticipated $39bn (£31bn) US bond auction later in the day met market expectations.

“This is a fire sale of Treasuries,” said Calvin Yeoh, a portfolio manager at the hedge fund Blue Edge Advisors. “I haven't seen moves or volatility of this size since the chaos of the pandemic in 2020,” he told Bloomberg.

Analysts believe the US Federal Reserve may need to step in. Jim Reid, at Deutsche Bank, said: “Markets are pricing a growing probability of an emergency [interest rate] cut, just as we saw during the Covid turmoil and the height of the GFC [global financial crisis] in 2008.”

UK bonds came under severe pressure after the US moves. The yield on a 30-year UK gilt hit 5.65%, surpassing a previous 27-year high of 5.472% set in January.

Shorter-dated 10-year gilt yields were slightly higher at 4.78%, while two-year yields ticked down to 4%.

Higher yields on gilts – UK government bonds – will make things even more difficult for Downing Street, as it will raise the cost of borrowing to fund investment.

China's intransigence in the face of escalating US tariffs appeared to indicate that the world's two largest economies were heading for a showdown, with an outcome that analysts said was difficult to predict.

“When challenged, we will never back down,” said China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian. The commerce ministry said: “China will fight to the end if the US side is bent on going down the wrong path.” Beijing has promised further countermeasures.

It was not clear whether China, which is one of the world's largest holders of Treasuries, included among its policy changes the sale of those bonds, accelerating the sell-off and the US administration's financial pain.

Global stock markets suffered another tumultuous day as the tariffs took effect.

Japan's Nikkei benchmark index fell almost 4%, while Taiwan's benchmark stock index was 5.8% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index recouped some earlier falls to close 0.4% down, and South Korea's Kospi 200 index dropped by 1.8%.

However, China's stock markets rose, appearing to weather the storm after government interventions. The SSE composite index in Shanghai ended the day 1.1% higher, while the Shenzhen SE composite rose 2.2%.

In Europe, the major markets also fell back. In London, the FTSE 100 dropped by 3% on Wednesday, immediately undoing the gains on Tuesday. Germany's Dax index dropped by about 2.3%, leading to a 16% drop since 18 March, while France's Cac 40 fell by 3.3%. Spain's Ibex index was down by 2.2%.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

An estimated 300,000 Canadians visit Palm Springs each year and Trump's levies threaten tourism in the region

Worried that Donald Trump's policies are scaring away Canadians, a key segment of its tourist industry, a California resort city has put up “Palm Springs Loves Canada” signs across its downtown.

“It was a gesture to let our Canadian visitors know that what happens in Washington DC, is not the way that Palm Springs is looking at Canada,” Ron deHarte, the city's mayor, said of the signs, which were installed on Friday.

An estimated 300,000 Canadians each year visit the Palm Springs region, DeHarte said, some of them staying for months at a time as they trade Canada's harsh winters for southern California's reliable warmth. But the mayor said he had been hearing from some Canadians that the US government's tariffs, and its rhetoric about Canada, were unacceptable to them, and that they were responding by cancelling their annual trips, pledging they were “not spending a dime in Palm Springs”.

DeHarte said he understood that perspective, but he and other local officials were sending a “positive message” and hoping Canadians would reconsider.

Canadian visitors spend an estimated $300m annually in the region, and “represent about 2,000 jobs in the hospitality industry”, deHarte said. “So when we have a group of visitors who are leaving early, or deciding not to come next year, that's significant. That's our restaurants, our stores, theater, arts, it's all of our businesses. The maids, the janitors, everyone is touched by the economic impact, or the loss of those dollars coming in.”

Canadians choosing not to come back to Palm Springs next winter would have more than just a financial impact, the mayor added.

“They volunteer. You see Canadians at our functions and events. They're getting involved any way they possibly can,” deHarte said. “It's not just a visitor coming to sit and hang out by the pool. These are really people who are part of our community.”

The new pro-Canada signs were first reported by the Palm Springs Post, which noted that a local carwash, Desert Hand Wash, had installed a large “We Love Canada” sign even before city officials had taken action.

“The Canadian business is 30% of my business in the winter. It's essential we do something significant,” Bob Smiland, the car wash's owner, told the Palm Springs Post.

Palm Springs, a desert oasis two hours outside of Los Angeles, is known for its vacation homes and large gay community. In 2018, it elected the US's first all-LGBTQ+ city council, a milestone that came as an afterthought in a city where inclusion had long been taken for granted. A recent Palm Springs protest against Trump and Elon Musk drew thousands of people, a local newspaper reported, and demonstrators have also been picketing outside a local Tesla showroom for weeks.

But what some locals describe as the Palm Springs “liberal bubble” has not been enough to insulate it from the effects of Trump's trade, immigration and anti-LGBTQ+ polices – as well as Trump's repeated claims that Canada should become the “51st state” in the US, while mockingly referring to the then prime minister Justin Trudeau as a “governor”.

In early April, the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, announced a 25% tax on US cars, calling Trump's tariffs on Canadian steel and automobiles “unjustified”.

As Canadian sports fans have started booing the US national anthem and some Canadians have adopted the phrase “elbows up” to show their combative attitude towards US aggression, there are some signs that the political conflict may also be influencing Canadian tourism to the US.

Two Canadian budget airlines, WestJet and Flair, have reduced their flights between western Canada and Palm Springs in recent weeks, citing reduced demand.

“As a result of the current political environment, we have seen a downward shift in demand for trans-border bookings between Canada and the US,” Josh Yates, a spokesperson for WestJet, said. “Notably, we are seeing increased demand for sun destinations across Mexico and the Caribbean, and to Europe.”

Multiple local real estate agents in the Palm Springs area have spoken out about Canadians contacting them about selling their California vacation homes in response to Trump's agenda.

“Within the first two weeks of tariffs talks, I had sellers calling and saying, ‘We're out of here, Trump has irrevocably damaged the relationship between Canada and the United States,” the Palm Springs realtor Sherri Dettman told Fast Company.

Another Palm Springs realtor, Paul Kaplan, published a blog post outlining the financial factors Canadians should consider when selling a US vacation home.

A Canadian-American who lives in Palm Springs told the Los Angeles Times that a group of his gay Canadian friends had cancelled their spring trip to Coachella to see Lady Gaga because of Trump's policies.

Local officials are paying close attention to these indicators, though they said the full impact of Canadians cancelling trips to Palm Springs was not likely to be felt until the coming winter season.

“The economic impact, it's going to make a difference this year, for sure, but where we're really going to feel it is if this turmoil continues into next year,” said deHarte.

A 2021 study found that Canadians owned 7% of vacation properties in the area, a higher proportion than residents of any other foreign country. Compared with the average Palm Springs visitor, Canadians tended to stay longer and spend more, a 2017 economic analysis found.

“We do have to hope that this turmoil in DC is going to be short-lived, and that everybody can get back to their daily lives, and not be in fear of how our pocketbooks and livelihoods are going to be affected,” the mayor said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Hebei nursing home's other residents have been transferred to nearby hospitals as authorities investigate cause of the blaze

Twenty people have died in a fire at a nursing home in northern China's Hebei province, Beijing's state news agency Xinhua said on Wednesday.

The fire broke out on Tuesday night at the nursing home in Longhua County, roughly 180km northeast of the Chinese capital Beijing, Xinhua said.

As of Wednesday morning, 20 people were confirmed dead, it added.

“Other elderly people in the nursing home have been transferred to nearby hospitals for further observation and treatment,” the state news agency said.

The cause of the blaze is under investigation, it said.

Deadly fires are relatively common in China due to lax building codes and an often slipshod approach to workplace safety.

In January, a fire at a vegetable market in Zhangjiakou city, northwest of Beijing, killed eight people and injured 15.

A month before that, nine people died in a fire at a construction site in eastern China's Rongcheng city.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Since Trump's first trade war with China in 2018, Beijing has ramped up trade with other countries, making it less dependent on the US

The opening shots seem like a distant memory. Back in January, US president Donald Trump threatened to impose a tariff of 10% on Chinese imports. Less than three months later, the rate is now 125%.

China has condemned the tariffs. As well as applying its own reciprocal tariff of 84% on US imports, Beijing has been fighting a war of words.

“When challenged, we will never back down,” said China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian. The commerce ministry said: “China will fight to the end if the US side is bent on going down the wrong path.” Further countermeasures have been promised by Beijing.

The tit-for-tat measures could spark fears of a race to the bottom, with ordinary people suffering as prices rise and a fears of a global recession grow.

But although China's economy has in recent years been beset by its own challenges, when it comes to tariffs specifically, Beijing is unlikely to blink first.

“For President Xi, there is only one politically viable response to Trump's latest threat: Bring it on! Having already surprised domestic audiences with a forceful 34% reciprocal tariff, any appearance of backing down would be politically untenable,” says Diana Choyleva, founder and chief economist at Enodo Economics, a forecasting firm.

One of the most helpful factors in Beijing's favour is the fact that the US is far more dependent on Chinese imports than China is on the US.

The main items that the US imports from China are consumer goods, such as smartphones, computers and toys. Last week, analysts at Rosenblatt Securities predicted that the cost of the cheapest iPhone available in the US could rise from $799 to $1,142 – and that was when Trump's China tariffs were just 54%. “Trump cannot credibly deflect blame on to China for these economic hardships,” Choyleva says.

In contrast, the goods that China imports from the US are industrial and manufacturing supplies, such as soya beans, fossil fuels and jet engines. It is much easier for price increases in these commodities to be absorbed before a consumer gets their wallet – or in the case of China, their smartphone – out to pay.

Plus, this is not China's first rodeo. Since Trump's first trade war with China in 2018, China has ramped up trade with other countries, making it less dependent on the US. Between 2018 and 2020, Brazil's soya bean exports to China increased by more than 45% compared to the 2015-2017 average, while US exports declined 38% over the same period. China is still the largest market for US agricultural goods, but the market is shrinking, hurting American farmers. In 2024, the US exported $29.25bn of agricultural products to China, down from $42.8bn in 2022.

China has other measures up its sleeve. On Tuesday, two influential nationalist bloggers published identical lists of possible Chinese retaliations, based on sources. China's foreign ministry declined to comment on the articles but did not deny their content either.

The suggestions included suspending cooperation on fentanyl control, investigating US companies' intellectual property gains in China, and banning Hollywood films from China. On the final point, a top-down embargo may not be necessary. China has in the past allowed online nationalists to whip up grassroots boycott campaigns. In 2017, Chinese consumers participated in a mass shunning of the South Korean supermarket chain Lotte, in response to the conglomerate's involvement in a deal that allowed a US missile defence system to be installed in South Korea, which China saw as a security threat. Nearly half of the company's more than 100 stores in mainland China were forced to close.

China's strategic advantages do not make it totally immune from a trade war. The stock markets in China and Hong Kong are falling. Beijing has not yet figured out a way to meaningfully boost domestic demand, something that economists say is essential to truly tariff-proof the economy.

The political impact of Trump's tariffs, coupled with the fear that the US is trying to turn other countries against China, is pushing US-China relations to an all time low. “I do not remember ever being this pessimistic about the trajectory of US-China relations,” wrote China analyst Bill Bishop in a newsletter. “The trade relationship is the linchpin between the two countries, and as it breaks we should probably expect other areas to see more stress.” But as the Trump administration talks of “Chinese peasants” and suggests that China is playing with a weak hand, Beijing is unlikely to back down anytime soon.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Alessandro Coatti described by former colleagues at Royal Society of Biology as ‘passionate and dedicated'

Tributes have been paid to a “passionate and dedicated” scientist after parts of his dismembered body were found in a suitcase in Colombia.

Alessandro Coatti, who worked at the Royal Society of Biology (RSB) in London, was discovered on the outskirts of Santa Marta, a port city on the Caribbean coast. The 42-year-old molecular biologist was travelling and conducting research in South America after working in London for eight years.

The mayor of Santa Marta, Carlos Pinedo Cuello, said a £9,000 reward was being offered for information leading to the capture of those responsible for the death of the Italian national.

In a statement posted on X, Pinedo Cuello said: “This crime will not go unpunished. The criminals must know that crime has no place in Santa Marta. We will pursue them until they are brought to justice.”

Santa Marta, which is surrounded by beaches and mountains, is a gateway to some of Colombia's most popular tourist destinations, including the village of Minca, the Tayrona national park and the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountains.

A hotel worker who spoke to the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo said Coatti had inquired about visiting Minca, which is famous for its organic coffee and varied birdlife, and was conducting research on local animal species, the Associated Press reported.

Coatti, who did his master's degree at University College London, was described as “funny, warm, intelligent” by former colleagues at the RSB, where he worked for eight years first as a science policy officer before being promoted to senior science policy officer. Coatti was among RSB representatives who appeared before parliament in June 2022 to discuss the future regulation of UK genetic technologies.

He left the RSB at the end of 2024 to volunteer in Ecuador and travel in South America.

“He was a passionate and dedicated scientist, leading RSB animal science work, writing numerous submissions, organising events and giving evidence in the House of Commons,” the RSB said in a statement. “Ale was funny, warm, intelligent, loved by everyone he worked with and will be deeply missed by all who knew and worked with him.

“Our thoughts and best wishes go out to his friends and family at this truly awful time.”

Coatti had previously talked about his passion for his work on social media. On LinkedIn, he explained he was “focused specifically on ethical research and innovation topics, particularly in the animal and biomedical fields”.

Discussing his move into policy in a February 2022 interview published on the RSB website, he described being motivated by a longstanding “passion for science” and “a new passion for community building and stakeholder engagement”, adding: “I have discovered I really like the mediation and negotiation part of the role. You have to listen to people with different views and try to understand their thoughts, what their interests are and how you can reach a consensus.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Oleksandr Syrskyi risking lives with ‘borderline criminal' orders, says Bohdan Krotevych, former Azov brigade leader

A high-profile former Ukrainian commander has called for the head of the country's military to step aside, accusing him of a lack of strategic imagination and putting Ukrainian soldiers' lives at risk with “borderline criminal” orders.

Bohdan Krotevych, who quit as the chief of staff of the Azov brigade in February partly so he could speak out, said he believed that armed forces commander, Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, “must go” and Ukraine's military leadership must be shaken up.

The veteran complained in an interview that Syrskyi and the existing leadership were engaged in “manual micro-management of the whole army” and highlighted orders given to soldiers and units forcing them to rest and base too close to the front.

“I started receiving from the high army command, from the commander-in-chief HQ, orders that became more and more borderline criminal, which I, in my good conscience, was unable to fulfil and follow,” Krotevych said.

One of Ukraine's best-known soldiers, Krotevych, 32, served in Azov from 2014 and survived the last stand at the Azovstal steelworks in spring 2022. Captured by Russian forces, he endured a short period of captivity before being exchanged.

Krotevych then chose to return to the front, and became increasingly outspoken during his final period of military service, openly criticising other commanders who he believed had been careless with soldiers' lives.

But the veteran told the Guardian that he had “70% decided to quit” the Ukrainian military because commanders were still “asking of soldiers things which they wouldn't ask of themselves”. As a former prisoner of war, he is one of the relatively few serving soldiers who has the right to leave.

“The general staff ordered that when a soldier's shift [on he frontline] is over, they can't rest in the rear, they have to rest 50 metres from the front,” Krotevych said, which he added was typically at a platoon forward observation base.

Forcing soldiers to recover so close to the front put “all these people in grave danger”, he argued. He accused the army command of being “criminally guilty of not understanding the principles of war right now” and in particular “how FPV drones work, how glide bombs work”.

The dramatic expansion of the use of FPV drones – which could operate at a range of up to 22km, Krotevych said – and Russian glide bombs, which until recently Ukraine had struggled to stop, have dramatically expanded the depth of the frontline. But Krotevych said Ukraine's commanders had failed to react accordingly.

“They still have the mentality of fighting in the second world war,” he said. “They still refuse to acknowledge the new means of hitting targets.” He said the army commander was relying on regulations issued in 2016 to justify forcing soldiers to be based so far forward, a time when “war was completely different”.

He said similar thinking affected the positioning of larger headquarters. At one point, Krotevych said, Azov's brigade headquarters was itself struck, after the unit had been “asking, insisting” that it be moved back because Russian forces were advancing. “They specifically told us no, and we got a direct hit.”

Krotevych said: “Syrskyi must go,” arguing that the military commander-in-chief, appointed in February 2024, had failed to break the Russian lines except into Kursk in August, where he had found “the weakest spot” and executed a simple “linear strike”.

Though Krotevych said the attack into Russia had made sense at the time, he accused Syrskyi of being overly focused on the attack “when we had huge issues” defending Pokrovsk in southern Donbas and “remaining there too long” as Moscow has gradually rolled up the salient, with Ukrainian forces incurring significant losses.

Ukraine had failed to find a way of prosecuting manoeuvre warfare while “the enemy somehow manages to break through our lines every month”, Krotevych complained.

“Syrskyi is not trying to apply a high science and an art of war,” Krotevych said, accusing him of having “just two functions: if the enemy is attacking, you just throw more people in there. And if the enemy is overwhelming, withdraw the people and say that you're concerned about the lives of the people.”

Ukraine has been gradually losing territory throughout 2024 and 2025 as Russian forces first advanced from Avdiivka in the east towards Donbas, before Moscow's main effort switched to eliminating the Kursk incursion.

Many observers have put Russia's modest but persistent success down to its greater personnel numbers and a pause in US weapons shipments in the early part of 2024, but Krotevych's comments are notable because they try to shift the focus on to Ukraine's commanders and their direction of the war effort.

The former soldier now intends to set up a private company, Strategic Operational and Intelligence Agency (Soia), obtaining intelligence on Russia, Belarus, North Korea and other countries unfriendly to Ukraine and acting as an expert liaison with the west.

As part of that work, Krotevych said he hoped to spend time in London, though he stressed he was not aligned with Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, a predecessor to Syrskyi, who is considered a potential future candidate for Ukraine's presidency.

Krotevych said he had no intention of entering politics himself. “I just want to destabilise Russia so it could not make war again,” he said.

Ukraine's general staff was approached for comment but did not respond prior to publication.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The death toll from an Israeli strike in the Shujaiya area of Gaza City has risen to 29 Palestinians, Reuter reports. Local health authorities said the deaths included children.

The Israeli military said in a statement it struck a senior Hamas militant responsible for planning and executing attacks from Shujaiya in northern Gaza, whom it did not identify. The military said several steps were taken before the attack to mitigate harm to civilians.

Local health authorities said nine other Palestinians were killed in separate Israeli military strikes in other parts of the territory, raising Wednesday's death toll to 38.

It is approaching 5pm in Gaza City and 6pm in Tel Aviv. This blog will be closing shortly but you can follow the Guardian's Middle East coverage here.

Here is a summary of the latest updates from today's live blog:

At least 29 Palestinians, including children, were killed on Wednesday from an Israeli strike in the Shujaiya area of Gaza City, local health authorities said. Medics said dozens of others were injured in the attack that hit a multi-floor residential building in the eastern suburb of Gaza City. They said many were still believed to be missing and trapped under the ruins of the building. The strike damaged several other houses nearby.

Local health authorities in Gaza added that nine other Palestinians were killed in separate Israeli military strikes in other parts of the territory, raising Wednesday's death toll to 38. The Gaza health ministry said on Wednesday that at least 1,482 Palestinians have been killed since Israel resumed intense strikes on the Gaza Strip on 18 March, taking the overall death toll since the start of the war to 50,846.

The Israeli military said in a statement it struck a senior Hamas militant responsible for planning and executing attacks from Shujaiya in northern Gaza, whom it did not identify. The military said several steps were taken before the attack to mitigate harm to civilians.

Indonesian president Prabowo Subianto said on Wednesday that his country will offer temporary shelter to Palestinian medical evacuees and children orphaned by the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. He said Indonesia is ready to evacuate a first group of about 1,000 victims, who will stay in the country until they have fully recovered from their injuries and Gaza is safe enough to return to. Subianto said the move was not for permanent resettlement.

United Nations (UN) secretary general António Guterres said on Tuesday that Gaza had become “a killing field” because Israel has continued to block aid, an accusation an Israeli official quickly denied, saying there was “no shortage” of aid. “More than an entire month has passed without a drop of aid into Gaza. No food. No fuel. No medicine. No commercial supplies. As aid has dried up, the floodgates of horror have re-opened,” Guterres said in remarks to journalists.

Six weeks since Israel completely cut off all supplies to the 2.3 million residents of the Gaza Strip, food stockpiled during a ceasefire at the start of the year has all but run out. “All basic supplies are running out,” said Juliette Touma from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unrwa). She said: “Every day without these basic supplies, Gaza inches closer towards very, very deep hunger.” Israel accuses the Hamas militants who have run Gaza of exploiting aid but Hamas deny this and accuses Israel of using starvation as a military tactic.

The mother of an Israeli soldier held hostage in Gaza told Agence France-Presse (AFP) that she fears that Israel's renewed bombardment of the territory puts his life at even greater risk. “Our children are in danger,” Herut Nimrodi told AFP during an interview. Her son, Tamir, who turned 20 in captivity, is one of 24 hostages believed to be alive, though no proof of life has been sent since his abduction.

Suspected US airstrikes pounded the area around Yemen's Red Sea port city of Hodeida on Tuesday night, killing at least 10 people and injuring 16 others, the Iran-backed Houthi rebels said. The strikes hit around Hodeida's al-Hawak district, the rebels said, and injured 16 people.

President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Wednesday Iran has no objection to US investors doing business in the country but the country firmly opposes any attempts at regime change or foreign interference. “The leader has no objection to the presence of American investors in the country,” Pezeshkian said of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a speech broadcast on state television. “We oppose their flawed policies, such as conspiracies and attempts at regime change.”

Saudi Arabia's top diplomat is in Washington to lay the groundwork for US president Donald Trump's upcoming visit, the first foreign trip of his second term, a Saudi government source told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Wednesday. Last month, Trump said he may visit Saudi Arabia as early as April. The source, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said “developments in Gaza, Yemen and Syria” were some of the topics on the agenda of the Saudi foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan.

As calls for Lebanon's Hezbollah to disarm gain momentum, a senior Hezbollah official told Reuters the group is ready to hold talks with the Lebanese president about its weapons if Israel withdraws from south Lebanon and stops its strikes. US-backed president Joseph Aoun, who vowed when he took office in January to establish a state monopoly on the control of arms, intends to open talks with Hezbollah over its arsenal soon, three Lebanese political sources told Reuters.

The Trump administration has reversed sweeping cuts in emergency food aid to several nations while maintaining them in Afghanistan and Yemen, two of the world's poorest and most war-ravaged countries, officials said on Wednesday. Funding has been restored for programmes in Somalia, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Ecuador, according to the USAID official and one of the UN officials.

Almost 40 MPs and peers in the UK have signed a letter organised by politician Jeremy Corbyn calling for an independent inquiry into the government's role in the war in Gaza. In the letter, they say the death toll in Gaza has exceeded 61,000 and that “Britain has played a highly influential role in Israel's military operations, including the sale of weapons, the supply of intelligence and the use of Royal Air Force (RAF) bases in Cyprus”. They say an inquiry should establish what decisions were taken and what the consequences were.

The US state department said on Tuesday it was aware of the killing by Israeli forces of a Palestinian American teenager in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and was seeking more information about the incident. A state department spokesperson made the comments to reporters when asked about the killing of US citizen Omar Mohammad Rabea, 14, and the shooting of two other teenagers.

The death toll from suspected US airstrikes that pounded the area around Yemen's Red Sea port city of Hodeida (see 9.44am BST) has risen to at least 10 people, according to the Houthis. The rebels also aired footage they said showed the debris left after shooting down yet-another American MQ-9 Reaper drone.
  The strikes on Tuesday night hit around Hodeida's al-Hawak district, the rebels said, and injured 16 people.

Saudi Arabia's top diplomat is in Washington to lay the groundwork for US president Donald Trump's upcoming visit, the first foreign trip of his second term, a Saudi government source told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Wednesday.

Last month, Trump said he may visit Saudi Arabia as early as April in a reprisal of 2017, when the oil-rich, conservative kingdom was the first destination of his first term in office.

Foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan arrived in Washington on Tuesday, aiming to “prepare for Trump's visit to Riyadh”, the source close to the Saudi government told AFP.

The source, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said “developments in Gaza, Yemen and Syria” were also on Prince Faisal's agenda.

The official Saudi Press Agency said Prince Faisal was to meet his US counterpart Marco Rubio to discuss “key regional and international developments”.

In January, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, promised to pile $600bn into US trade and investments. Trump later said Saudi Arabia had agreed to “spend close to a trillion dollars … in our American companies, which to me means jobs”.

Trump forged close relations with Riyadh in his first term and is expected to push Saudi Arabia towards normalising ties with Israel as a major foreign policy objective.

The US state department said on Tuesday it was aware of the killing by Israeli forces of a Palestinian American teenager in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and was seeking more information about the incident, reports Reuters.

A state department spokesperson made the comments to reporters when asked about the killing of US citizen Omar Mohammad Rabea, 14, and the shooting of two other teenagers.

“We are certainly aware of that dynamic,” the state department spokesperson said. “There is an investigation that is going on. We are aware of the reports from the IDF that this was a counter-terrorism act, we need to learn more about the nature of what happened on the ground.”

The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned the weekend incident as an “extra-judicial killing” by Israeli forces during a raid. A local mayor said Rabea was shot along with two other teenagers by an Israeli settler and that the Israeli army pronounced him dead after detaining him.

The Israeli military said it shot a “terrorist” who endangered civilians by hurling rocks.

“We don't have the complete picture of what was going on on the ground,” the state department spokesperson added.

The family of the teenager, who was a New Jersey native, said he was shot multiple times. Local community leaders gathered at the Palestinian American community centre in Clifton, New Jersey, on Tuesday to pay tribute to him and demand justice.

Six weeks since Israel completely cut off all supplies to the 2.3 million residents of the Gaza Strip, food stockpiled during a ceasefire at the start of the year has all but run out, while emergency meal distributions are ending, bakeries are closed and markets are empty, reports Reuters.

Aid agencies that have been supplying emergency meals say they will have to stop within days unless they can bring in more food.

The World Food Programme used to provide bread at 25 bakeries across the Gaza Strip. All of those bakeries are now shut. It will soon have to halt distribution of food parcels at reduced rations.

“All basic supplies are running out,” said Juliette Touma from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unrwa). She said:

The prices of commodities have exponentially increased over the past one month plus since the Israeli authorities put the siege on the Gaza Strip.

It means babies, children are going to bed hungry. Every day without these basic supplies, Gaza inches closer towards very, very deep hunger.”

According to Reuters, a 25 kilo sack of flour that used to sell for $6 now costs ten times as much, while a litre of cooking oil – if it can be located – costs $10 instead of $1.50.

“Food distributions have almost stopped altogether, with remaining stocks now diverted to keep hot meal distributions going for a few more days, but that will soon finish too,” said Gavin Kelleher, an access manager for the Norwegian Refugee Council in Deir al-Balah.

Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières says it is encountering children and pregnant women with severe malnutrition, and lactating mothers are themselves too hungry to be able to breastfeed.

Israel denies that Gaza is facing a hunger crisis. The military accuses the Hamas militants who have run Gaza of exploiting aid, and says it must keep all supplies out to prevent the fighters from getting it.

“The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) is acting in accordance with the directives of the political echelon. Israel is not transferring and will not transfer aid to the hands of terrorist organizations,” the military said.

The ministry of foreign affairs said 25,000 aid trucks had entered Gaza in the 42 days of the ceasefire – before it shut the border at the start of March – and that Hamas had used the aid to rebuild its war machine.

Hamas denies exploiting aid and accuses Israel of using starvation as a military tactic.

The Trump administration has reversed sweeping cuts in emergency food aid to several nations while maintaining them in Afghanistan and Yemen, two of the world's poorest and most war-ravaged countries, officials said Wednesday.

The United States had initially cut funding for projects in more than a dozen countries, part of a dramatic reduction of foreign aid led by billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Aid officials warned the cuts would deny food to millions of people and end health programs for women and children.

The administration informed the World Food Program of its reversal on Tuesday, according to two UN officials. An official with the US Agency for International Development (USAID) confirmed that Jeremy Lewin, the Musk associate overseeing the dismantling of USAID, ordered the reversal of some of his weekend contract terminations after The Associated Press reported them. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media, AP reported.

The WFP said Monday it had been notified that USAID was cutting funding to the UN agency's emergency food program in 14 countries.

Funding has been restored for programs in Somalia, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Ecuador, according to the USAID official and one of the UN officials. The status of funding for six other unidentified countries was not immediately clear.

One of the UN officials said the decision to restore funding came after intense behind-the-scenes lobbying of members of Congress by senior UN officials.

The cuts could prove disastrous for millions in Afghanistan and Yemen, reeling from decades of war and US-led campaigns against militants.

The death toll from an Israeli strike in the Shujaiya area of Gaza City has risen to 29 Palestinians, Reuter reports. Local health authorities said the deaths included children.

The Israeli military said in a statement it struck a senior Hamas militant responsible for planning and executing attacks from Shujaiya in northern Gaza, whom it did not identify. The military said several steps were taken before the attack to mitigate harm to civilians.

Local health authorities said nine other Palestinians were killed in separate Israeli military strikes in other parts of the territory, raising Wednesday's death toll to 38.

Here are some of the latest images that have been shared via the newswires:

The Israeli military said it targeted a senior Hamas militant on Wednesday in a strike that local health authorities said had killed at least 26 Palestinians, including children.

When asked by Agence France-Presse (AFP) about the strike in the city's Shujaiya neighbourhood, the military said it “struck a senior Hamas terrorist who was responsible for planning and executing terrorist attacks” from the area. It did not give the target's name, reports AFP.

Almost 40 MPs and peers in the UK have signed a letter organised by politician Jeremy Corbyn calling for an independent inquiry into the government's role in the war in Gaza.

In the letter, they say the death toll in Gaza has exceeded 61,000 and that “Britain has played a highly influential role in Israel's military operations, including the sale of weapons, the supply of intelligence and the use of Royal Air Force (RAF) bases in Cyprus”.

They say an inquiry should establish what decisions were taken and what the consequences were, and that ministers from the last Conservative government and the current Labour one should cooperate fully. They add:

Many people believe the government has taken decisions that have implicated officials in the gravest breaches of international law.

These charges will not go away until there is a comprehensive, public, independent inquiry with the legal power to establish the truth.

The letter has been signed by 37 MPs and peers, from the Labour party, Sinn Féin, the Greens, the SNP, Plaid Cymru, as well as independents.

In a message on social media where he has posted the letter, Corbyn says:

Last month, I wrote to the prime minister calling for an independent inquiry into the UK's involvement in Israel's assault on Gaza.

Today, more than 30 MPs have supported that call.

This is not going away. We will campaign for as long as it takes to establish the truth.

All seven Sinn Féin MP have signed the letter. In a statement explaining why, the Sinn Féin Chris Hazzard said:

For 18 months now, the Israeli army has continually attacked the defenceless population of Gaza, while world leaders turn a blind eye to these barbaric and inhumane actions.

Some members of the international community are complicit in the ongoing genocide, displacement and apartheid targeting the Palestine people.

This letter calls for a public inquiry into the British government's role in the war on Gaza, and how it has assisted Netanyahu's reckless and out-of-control regime.

While Israel must be held fully accountable for its flagrant breaches of international law, we also must establish what role successive British governments have played in this war.

President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Wednesday Iran has no objection to US investors doing business in the country but the country firmly opposes any attempts at regime change or foreign interference, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

“The leader has no objection to the presence of American investors in the country,” Pezeshkian said of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a speech broadcast on state television. “We oppose their flawed policies, such as conspiracies and attempts at regime change.”

Iran has had no diplomatic relations with Washington since 1980, but is to hold nuclear talks with US officials in Oman on Saturday.

The talks follow a letter sent by US president Donald Trump on 7 March, urging Khamenei to resume nuclear negotiations and warning of possible military action if Iran refuses.

Tehran responded weeks later, saying it was open to indirect negotiations and dismissed the possibility of direct talks as long as the US maintains its “maximum pressure” policy. “The leader said that we are ready to negotiate, but not in direct negotiations because we do not trust them,” Pezeshkian said.

The death toll from an Israeli strike in the Shujaiya area of Gaza City has risen to 26 Palestinians, local health authorities said, according to Reuters. The number includes children, local health authorities said on Wednesday.

Medics said dozens of others were injured in the attack that hit a multi-floor residential building in the eastern suburb of Gaza City. They said many were still believed to be missing and trapped under the ruins of the building. The strike damaged several other houses nearby, medics said.

Women with disabilities are the biggest minority group in the world, but are still shut out of society. In an extract from her new book, the writer reveals how that is changing – and what more needs to be done

I would like to be able to start this story with a stellar anecdote about how exactly my life imploded. “I was walking down Sunset Boulevard and Harry Styles ran me down in a Ferrari.” “I was dancing on a podium in Ibiza when a falling speaker semi- decapitated me.” In reality, it was much more mundane, as these things inevitably tend to be. I went to the pub and I caught the flu. That was it.

I spent Christmas 2017 with what I thought was a regular illness. By February, I was unable to breathe or move. Flu had become flu complications and I was strapped to a ventilator mask. My energy had all but disappeared to the extent that even breathing was a high-end task. In my bedroom, alone, plastic casing enveloped my skin. I looked like Darth Vader, if Darth Vader spent a lot of time in Primark pyjamas. The cliche for this sort of thing is to say that the months that followed were a blur. But as anyone who has ever been through anything knows, really, it is the opposite. You wish it was a blur. You would pay good money for a haze, to black out for as long as it takes to get through the worst and re-emerge fabulous, like a contestant in a Netflix makeover show.

The days did not blur. Each minute was sharpened, as if I was living in a new reality that had been cut out with lasers. I couldn't leave my house, I could barely get out of bed, and I didn't understand any part of that.

Fatigue is hard to comprehend until you have it. I learned abruptly that it was not being tired from a big night out or burnout after a stressful spell at work. It was all-consuming, as if my body were wearing a weighted blanket that I couldn't shake off. Getting up from the toilet was enough to make my knees buckle, pills and dignity draining down the bottom of the sink. For a while, I was surviving off cookies; my narrowed oesophagus refusing to swallow anything else, every muscle now apparently a toddler in a tantrum.

Born with a muscle weakness, I was familiar with my body falling short of society's standards. I had used a wheelchair since I was old enough to reach the wheels and had grown up happy and accomplished. I always thought that meant I had a pretty good handle on my health but it turns out I was merely a novice. If my body was a domestic appliance, I would have been asking to speak to the manager at this point.

As the months went on, I waited for “recovery” – that thing that is meant to follow falling ill. I looked out the window each day, twitching the curtain when recovery began to run late. It never came. Instead, the fatigue and pain hung around, like a noxious smell. There was some improvement – my legs no longer buckled when asked to stand – and yet not enough. In bed, I looked through photographs on my camera-roll for evidence of my former life. Just a few months earlier I had been out at midnight singing at a gig with an old friend. Now, I had a “pill basket” and knew the weights of gateway opioids. In the four walls of my bedroom, my days had shrunk to fit inside. Seasons passed, the sun crept through the blinds, and I blinked into tomorrow. I'd barely hit 30 and it felt as if my life had ended.
 When your entire world feels like it has fallen in on itself, you tend to cling to any hint of normality. For me, it was my job. Working as a journalist became something to focus on, a lost part of myself I could still find in the dark. I don't want to call it delusion but there was probably a fair hint of that. Besides, I needed to feel something other than sickness. I needed to believe there was going to be more to the rest of my life than simply being ill. I made a plan. I would try writing for 10 minutes in a morning. Then 20. If I got dizzy, I would stop.

Two years after falling ill, I had an award-winning column in this newspaper, my first book was published to critical acclaim and I was named one of Britain's most influential disabled people. It had also been so long since I had washed my hair that my scalp was forming its own paste. Perhaps I was a fraud. Perhaps I was in denial. Or perhaps – go with me here – life is much more complicated than they tell you. Perhaps boxes such as “normal” and “success” are tricks to trap us and a day can be meaningful, hard and funny all at once. Perhaps it is possible to have a body that is unruly, broken, bruised and to actually be OK. To be bloody spectacular. To pick the shards of the broken vase off the floor and superglue life back together, marvelling at the scent of the flowers (and then find a plaster for the blood).

No one really talks about it. No one really talks about what it is to be a disabled woman, especially a young one. To go through something transformative before you can drink legally. To experience pain or exhaustion or to feel 92. To navigate all the standard parts of life – exams, careers, relationships – but with a body that is different from everyone else's. If we do ever share this, we are expected to sanitise it, to dress up disability and sickness in a palatable bow. Even as I write this I am reticent to share the details of my own experience, not simply because it is private but because it runs against how disabled women are told to speak. We learn early on which parts of ourselves can be shared with the world and which parts we must hide, lest we be pitied, rejected or shamed. We are allowed to talk about our disabled bodies only if and when we have managed to make them appear like “normal” ones. Everyone wants to share the TikTok of the girl rising from her wheelchair to dance at the school prom, not when she feels the music pinprick her skin as she sits. I think it's time that changed.

When I grew up as a disabled teenager in the late 1990s, I knew no other disabled women like me. I'd seen barely a handful on television and next to none in films. Women's mags portrayed perfection, and sickness and disability seemingly had no part in that. In some ways, it doesn't feel much better now. It's estimated that disabled people make up only 2.5% of people on our TV screens and 3.4% of children's books have a disabled main character.

The exclusion of disabled women is not simply representational – disabled women are, quite literally, physically shut out of everyday life. Despite the UK having anti-discrimination laws that give rights to disabled people, society is still too often designed for non-disabled bodies. Nearly a third of disabled people say they find using public spaces difficult “all the time” or “often”, according to the UK Disability Survey in 2021. Only 9% of English housing provides the most basic features for people with physical disabilities. In the last 30 years, not a single friend or family member's home has been accessible to me.

It is not as if life outside the home for disabled people is more welcoming. Just 15% of restaurants and shops in the UK have hearing loops while only 1% of space at sporting venues is made available for disabled fans. I have regularly sat for seven hours sipping one drink in a pub because there is no accessible toilet. I have missed a friend's wedding because the venue had no lift. I have sat outside restaurants eating in the cold because the website falsely said a wheelchair user could get inside. I would like to say there is outrage each time but, as I think we all know, nothing happens. The lesson for disabled women comes early and it comes often: the problem is not how society is built – the problem is your body.

It isn't only infrastructure that we're shut out of – it's a decent income too. Nearly half the people in poverty in the UK are disabled or live with a disabled person. We are, on average, paid less than non-disabled people, more likely to be turned down for a job and less likely to be given senior roles at work, all while shouldering the extra costs of disability with often insufficient or no support from government. Even a Labour government cuts disability benefits.

On top of this, disabled people routinely face negative attitudes from the public. Research by the disability charity Scope in 2022 showed that a quarter of disabled people had been accused of faking their condition or not really being disabled, while a third had experienced people making assumptions about them or judging their capabilities based on their disability. This idea that disabled people are inherently different to “normal people” is startlingly common: separate research by Scope shows more than one in 10 non-disabled people “hardly ever” or “never” think of disabled people as the same as everyone else.

Growing up, I surveyed a world around me that was not made for people like me, and worse, actively kept us out. I had no idea what it was to be a disabled woman, or that it was possible to be happy, to have a career or relationships. This only increased when I got sick. It's no wonder. Women are routinely fed the message that we must be perfect; any hint of fallibility or difference – a career misstep, an anxious mind, a diet that includes gluten – means we are somehow failing. Every open-mouthed stare at a club when you laugh from your wheelchair, every comment from a stranger that they would rather die than be like you, sends a painfully clear message about how life with a disability is “meant” to be. We are taught from an early age that good health is the precursor to a positive existence, even more than wealth or social prestige. “At least you've got your health!” the adage goes. But what if you haven't? It is hard to imagine the world has wonderful things to offer you when it routinely tells you it doesn't.

This is not because there aren't many of us. Almost a quarter of people in the UK have some sort of disability – be it a physical impairment, mental health condition or chronic illness. Look at the global picture and the scale is even more vast: the World Health Organization estimates there are 1.3 billion people globally who have “significant disabilities”. What is more, the “disabled club” is not an exclusive one: any one of us can develop a long-term health condition at any point in our lives and find ourselves part of this community. That's even more the case if you're a woman: the World Health Survey estimates that the prevalence of disability among women is 60% higher than our male counterparts. Disabled women are by far the biggest minority group in the world but we are still the least visible. Where are our voices? Why aren't we part of the conversation?

This doesn't mean we aren't contributing. Far from it. Disabled women are making waves like never before, ushering in societal change through politics, business, acting, science, sport, music, journalism and more. Some of the most famous and influential women in the world today have a long-term health condition, from Greta Thunberg (autism), Billie Eilish (Tourette syndrome), Greta Gerwig (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), Selena Gomez (lupus and bipolar disorder), to Lady Gaga (fibromyalgia). We are winning Oscars, leading communities and legislating in parliaments. We are topping the charts, campaigning for equality and winning gold medals. Imagine what it would be like if these stories were put front and centre of mainstream culture. Imagine what it would feel like if women's disabilities were not just acknowledged, but celebrated. This is in many ways why I wrote a book about life for disabled women in Britain today, including interviewing more than 70 well-known women and experts with physical and mental health conditions. I wanted to take a subject – and a section of society – that is still shrouded in stereotypes and shame to shine a light on it, in all its glory, nuance and pain.

Years on from that night in the pub, I'm still sick. I'm still disabled. But I'm proud of my body, achieving, and laughing. Also occasionally, weeping. This is not the narrative society is used to. They don't make Hallmark movies about someone never learning to walk again. But I think it is a much more important story. It is easy to be celebratory when you have made it to the top of the mountain, much harder when you're stuck halfway, freezing your tits off. One thing makes that mountain easier, though: knowing it's not just you on it. If there is any crumb that I hope you take away from my experience – and those I collected – it is the feeling that there are many women in the world who are experiencing the same things you are.

On my more philosophical days, I think of bad health as something that happens naturally to living things. The pink peonies that brown at the edges. The honey bee that stings only to fall, depleted, through the air. Human beings are no different, really. The difference is that, for us, it is not the end. The clocks don't stop. The music still plays. We go on. In a society that greets disability with low expectations or outright prejudice, and demands perfection from the mess of modern existence, I will share a secret: it is entirely possible to be happy and fulfilled and disabled or sick, and to proudly carve out your own path. Who wants normal anyway?

Australia well placed to deal with uncertainty of global economy but should be prepared as US doubles down on protectionist policies, economists warn

Australia's economy will not escape unscathed from Donald Trump's trade war, economists have warned, after the US hiked duties on Chinese imports to 104% and enacted world-wide tariffs that have reversed a century of American trade liberalisation.

As regional sharemarkets tumbled further on Wednesday and the Australian dollar slid below US60 cents, and to its lowest in more than two decades outside the pandemic, experts warned trade between China and the United States would grind to a halt as Trump followed through on his threat to slap even higher “reciprocal” import duties on about 60 trading partners.

The CBA's chief economist, Luke Yeaman, said it was a historic moment and that it was difficult to predict how the trade shock would flow through to the global economy.

“The era of trade liberalisation, free market reforms, deregulation and fiscal discipline – the Washington Consensus – is officially dead and buried,” Yeaman said.

Treasury officials and leading economists, such as the ANU's Warwick McKibbin, have predicted Australia should be relatively shielded from a global trade war.

Financial markets already believe it could lead the Reserve Bank to deliver a rare double rate cut when it next meets on 19-20 May, and that the larger duties on Chinese imports and the escalating rhetoric have ratcheted up the risk of an even greater blow to Australia's growth.

A survey of consumer sentiment this week showed a sharp drop in confidence among Australians – a precursor to lower spending should households already hit by the high cost of living feel they have to become more frugal.

The ANZ's chief economist, Richard Yetsenga, said it was not a time to be complacent about the risks to Australia's outlook.

“The trajectory is quite worrying. I don't think anyone should be sanguine,” Yetsenga said.

“China is one third of global production, and the US is a quarter of global demand, and 100% tariffs make it hard for much trade to happen between those two countries. How can Australia not be materially affected?”

Yetsenga believes that the damage to the American economy and financial markets will eventually force Trump to “pivot” away from his protectionist policies.

For now, however, the US president is doubling down. In response, Chinese officials have promised to “fight to the end”, and Europe is reportedly preparing its own retaliatory measures.

China, Japan, South Korea, India and Taiwan are among Australia's biggest export markets and as of Wednesday were hit with import duties of 104%, 25%, 27% and 32%, respectively.

That was on top of the 10% “baseline” tariffs on all countries, including Australia, announced on 2 April.

Yeaman, a former Treasury deputy secretary, said he believed Australia, with its relatively limited direct trade links with the US, was “as well placed as anybody” to ride out Trump's trade war.

“Our economic fundamentals are strong,” he said, pointing to the solid support to growth and employment from high government spending, and the buffer offered by a weakening exchange rate.

“We are well placed, but not immune.”

The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, echoed that view ahead of meeting with the Council of Financial Regulators on Wednesday afternoon, which includes the Treasury secretary and the Reserve Bank governor.

“There's a lot of uncertainty in the global economy, but Australia is well placed and well prepared to deal with it,” Chalmers said.

“We are working closely with the regulators, and we are confident that we can weather these global conditions, but we're not complacent about that.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

            Hot Stocks 




Follow:


“Liberation Day” came and went, with President Donald Trump's sweeping new tariffs battering markets, unsettling the global order, and prompting businesses and households to reconsider their spending.
    


            And it's far from over.
    


            There's the immediate aftermath: Trump's actions, based on economically questionable math, have triggered retaliatory tariffs, stoked trade wars, and escalated recession odds.
    


            There are near-, medium-, and long-term risks: The dangerous mix of fear, unpredictability, lost investments, and sudden cost spikes could quickly spill into the economy, causing real and lasting pain for people.
    


            And there are likely more tariffs coming down the pike: A suite of crucial materials was exempt from Wednesday's tariff actions, including copper, computer chips, lumber, pharmaceuticals and critical minerals. However, Trump administration officials have indicated these products could be subject to tariffs at a later date.
    


            It also remains to be seen whether Canada and Mexico, two of the biggest targets of Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs, will continue to be largely spared.
    


            “This list does not strike me as a negotiating position right now,” said Tyler Schipper, associate professor of economics at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. “Hopefully, some of these come down, but it's a big list, and it's across the board.”
    


            “This seems to suggest more like we're putting up walls, rather than we're negotiating to hopefully get all the walls to come down,” he added.
    


            Trump's one-two tariff punch announced last week included a baseline 10% tariff on all imported goods to the US, followed by steeper “reciprocals” tariff on five dozen countries that the White House claimed were the “worst offenders” in charging high tariffs or imposing non-tariff trade barriers.
    


            The former went into place April 5, and the latter took effect Wednesday.
    


            However, the “reciprocal” tariffs were anything but that, further complicating and potentially amplifying the negative consequences of Trump's actions. The additional levies, some of which shot north of 45%, were calculated by essentially dividing bilateral goods trade deficits by goods trade exports.
    


            Trade deficits, by their very nature, aren't necessarily all bad.
    


            “It's very wrongheaded economics; it's quite natural that you will have deficits with some countries and surpluses with others,” economist Marcus Noland, executive vice president and director of studies with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CNN. “So, trying to implement a policy to generate balanced trade with all countries just flies in the face of any kind of comparative advantage or specialization.”
    


            Plus, the resulting tariffs should be a quarter lower than stated because the Trump administration erred in its calculations by undervaluing how the duty could impact items' import prices, noted economists for the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. The formula, which AEI economists said had “no foundation in either economic theory or trade law,” instead wrongly incorporated the elasticity for retail prices.
    


            As it stands, the Trump administration's severe and widespread tariff actions flung a powder keg into the global economy, pushing recession forecasts higher.
    


            Domestically, the tariffs could have swiftly negative consequences, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned.
    


            “As for the short-term, we are likely to see inflationary outcomes, not only on imported goods but on domestic prices, as input costs rise and demand increases on domestic products,” he wrote in his annual letter to shareholders. “How this plays out on different products will partially depend on their substitutability and price elasticity. Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth.”
    


            And plenty of uncertainties remain, Dimon noted, including the extent of retaliatory actions and the effects on confidence, investments, capital flows, corporate profits and the almighty dollar.
    


            “The quicker this issue is resolved, the better, because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse,” he wrote.
    


            The freefall in the financial markets indicates there's a crisis of confidence brewing in the US dollar, said Joe Brusuelas, RSM US chief economist.
    


            “We can now not ignore nor avoid the discussion of the devaluation of the dollar and the dollar's reserve currency status,” Brusuelas told CNN.
    


            In terms of the economic impact, even the best-case scenario involves accelerated inflation in addition to hits to real gross domestic product growth and unemployment, according to Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola-Marymount University and president of SS Economics, who detailed the economic implications for the US in a note issued last week.
    


            The best-case scenario over the next 12 months: Real GDP contracts by 0.2 percentage points, employment shrinks by 0.1% and inflation ticks up by 0.2 percentage points.
    


            The worst-case: Economic activity sinks 1.3 percentage points (real GDP grew 2.4% at the end of 2024), the US economy loses 1.3 million jobs, and inflation rises by 1.3 percentage points, he noted.
    


            Sohn, whose “base case” falls in between, expressed optimism that the US economy could be resilient enough to avoid a recession.
    


            A few factors played into his calculus: The US economy is overwhelmingly services-driven, so the sectoral composition should provide a cushion; tariffs are a one-time price adjustment and shouldn't accelerate underlying inflation pressures; touted policies such as tax cuts and deregulation could provide a stimulating effect on demand; and now that the announcements have been made, it could ease uncertainty.
    


            However, certainty is anything but a sure thing these days, and the bread-and-butter of the US economy might not go unscathed, said RSM economist Brusuelas.
    


            “The US is a service-based economy,” he said. “That's where the wealth is; that's where the money is. (Countries) are going to likely retaliate against the banks, the airlines and tech.”
    


            The retaliation could very well escalate, depending on how the administration moves forward on plans for sectoral tariffs and Trump's continued application of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (what used to be a rarely employed trade provision) that allows a president to impose tariffs if there are potential national security threats.
    


            Last week's tariff announcement came with several notable exclusions: Steel, aluminum and autos (three areas already subjected to their tariffs); copper and lumber (which are under Section 232 investigations for potential national security impacts); and pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and critical minerals (where Section 232 investigations are expected).
    


            Trump has frequently quipped that the US doesn't need to import items like lumber, cars and oil, claiming that natural resources and manufacturing potential are plentiful enough domestically for America to be self-sufficient.

            Economists, researchers and other experts have frequently warned that it's not that simple: It takes years for manufacturing facilities to be built, supply chains to be established, and skilled workforces to be trained. (Plus, the construction of those new facilities would likely require imported materials that now are coming at a premium.)
    


            Still, the sector tariffs could push inflation even higher, said Kathy Bostjancic, Nationwide Mutual's chief economist.
    


            Following last week's announcement, Nationwide's modeling indicated that the Consumer Price Index, which had cooled to an annual rate of 2.8% in February, could climb to between 3.5% and 4% by the end of the year. The sector tariffs could very well push that to the higher range of 4% to 4.5%, she said.
    


            CPI hasn't been above 4% for nearly two years, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows.
    


            In addition to those near- and longer-term headwinds, tariffs could pose unique challenges for each sector:
    


Copper and critical minerals:  It's not yet known which minerals the US could consider investigating under Section 232; however, an investigation is already underway on copper — a critical cog in the ongoing electrification of America and industries such as defense.

            The US imports about 50% of the copper it uses, and demand is only expected to grow, especially as energy-consuming industries such as artificial intelligence and blockchain boom, Dan Ikenson, economist and trade policy scholar at Ikenomics Consulting, told CNN.
    


            “It takes 16, 17, 18 years to get the licenses for mines and permits for refining,” he said. “Since we don't have those resources, and we're dependent on the world for it, we should not be agitating and looking to pick trade fights, we should be working out arrangements where we can have long-term access to Canada's exports, Chile's and Peru's.”
    


Lumber: Softwood lumber is a critical and preferred ingredient to homebuilding, and 30% of it is imported by the US. Homebuilders warn that tariffs and other charges (including the potential doubling of existing duties on Canadian lumber) on softwood lumber and other materials could further exacerbate the housing affordability crisis.
    


            Higher costs of lumber imports could also affect other products, such as furniture and even toilet paper.
    


            The Trump administration, to bolster the US lumber industry, recently ordered that half of America's national forests be opened up for logging — a move criticized for its potential negative effects on the environment, species, watersheds, and recreation.
    


Pharmaceuticals: Tariffs here present conflicting policy goals for Trump, who's stated he wants to bring down the prices of pharmaceutical products and bolster US manufacturing, Diederik Stadig, health care sector economist for ING, wrote in a post last week.
    


            “While some branded production might gradually be shifted to the US, a big increase in generic production is unlikely,” he said, noting that the construction of new facilities takes roughly 10 years.
    


            Tariffs also have an inflationary effect, which would drive up health care costs and hamper the affordability of medication, especially for people without insurance: Under a 25% tariff, commonly prescribed drugs could increase from 82 cents per pill to 94 cents a pill, or roughly $42 more per year, he wrote. More complex prescriptions, such as those for cancer treatment, could jump even higher, he wrote, estimating that a 24-week prescription could see additional costs in the $8,000 to $10,000 range.
    


Semiconductors: Medical devices, Wi-Fi routers, laptops, smartphones, cars, household appliances and LED lightbulbs are just a few examples of where semiconductor chips are found. And these products often don't just require one or two. For instance, new cars contain thousands of them.
    


            Put another way, semiconductor chips are “the crude oil of the 21st century.” And it became glaringly obvious what happens when that oil runs dry: As a side effect of the pandemic, a chip shortage put cars and other products in short supply and fanned the flames of inflation.
    


            Although the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act passed in 2022 helped incentivize chipmakers like TSMC to open US facilities, even if tariffs spurred more domestic chip production, America still lacks electronic assembly capabilities, John Dallesasse, an electrical and computer engineering professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, previously told CNN.
    


            Because of that, any chips produced in the US would still have to be shipped abroad to places like Taiwan, South Korea, China and Mexico to be put into the finished electronics Americans buy, and those would be subject to tariffs.

Follow:


            Acting Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Melanie Krause informed her staff Tuesday she is leaving the agency amid internal chaos and the exodus of several senior IRS officials, according to two current IRS employees and one former IRS employee.
    


            Krause's decision to accept the agency's deferred resignation offer comes on the heels of the IRS and Department of Homeland Security finalizing an agreement Monday to provide sensitive taxpayer data to federal immigration authorities to help the Trump administration locate and deport undocumented immigrants.
    


            The controversial data sharing agreement between the agencies was one factor that played a role in Krause's decision to leave, according to one source with knowledge of the situation. The source said that the last draft of the agreement that Krause had been involved with, and had reviewed, was different than the final agreement. Krause learned about the details of the final agreement from the news,  the source said.
    


            There were other reasons Krause wanted to leave, the source said, including the direction the agency was going in and the exodus of multiple senior executive career employees within the last few days.
    


            The IRS has seen three leaders depart this year — an unprecedented level of upheaval for the beleaguered tax-collecting agency.
    


            The Biden-appointed and Senate-confirmed IRS commissioner, Danny Werfel, resigned on Inauguration Day. The acting commissioner who succeeded him, Doug O'Donnell, refused to sign a data-sharing agreement with DHS in February. Shortly after that, he retired.
    


            Krause then took over in an acting capacity. She had only been at the IRS for three-and-a-half years before her decision to leave.
    


            “Melanie Krause has been leading the IRS through a time of extraordinary change. As we focus on IT modernization and re-organize the agency to better serve the taxpayer, we are also in the midst of breaking down data silos that for too long have stood in the way of identifying waste, fraud, and abuse and bringing criminals to justice,” a Treasury Department spokesperson said in a statement. “We believe these goals are critical to a more efficient government and safer country. We wish Melanie well on her next endeavor.”
    


            Multiple senior career IRS officials refused to sign the data-sharing agreement with DHS because of grave concerns about its legality, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.
    


            This is why Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent ultimately ended up being the person who signed the “memorandum of understanding” with DHS, that source said.
    


            As CNN reported earlier Tuesday, the dispute over the data-sharing deal triggered multiple resignations among senior IRS officials.
    


            Krause and other officials have faced pressure in recent weeks from Treasury and other administration officials amid broader discussions of planned changes at the IRS, according to a person familiar with the talks.
    


            A top priority for the administration is reassigning IRS criminal investigators to do immigration-related investigations to support DHS in border enforcement work. The discussions have also included the possibility of moving the IRS criminal investigations agency to be part of the Treasury, the person familiar with the matter said.

Follow:


            Delegations from Japan and South Korea are en route. Italy's prime minister will be in Washington next week. And Israel's “proactive approach” to seeking out new US trade agreements could serve as a model for everyone, according to the White House.
    


            A day before President Donald Trump's new worldwide tariffs are set to take hold, the White House made clear Tuesday the door for new trade negotiations was wide open — even if the exact formula for earning relief from the duties remained unclear.
    


            “These countries are calling us up. Kissing my a**. They are dying to make a deal,” Trump told a group of Republicans on Tuesday evening, hours before the tariffs were set to take hold. He described foreign leaders essentially groveling to avoid the new tariffs: “Please, please sir, make a deal. I'll do anything sir.”
    


            As countries scramble to respond to Trump's sweeping tariff announcements last week, many are receiving advice from US diplomats and sources close to the White House encouraging them to think creatively, beyond the scope of trade, as they prepare to negotiate with the White House.
    


            Their message to foreign counterparts seems simple: If they have a unique card to play, they should.
    


            Ideas being discussed run the gamut, and include possible action on securing the freedom of Americans wrongfully detained abroad, committing to working with US artificial intelligence companies, buying more US energy or combatting global drug trafficking, according to five people familiar with the brainstorming sessions.
    


            After days of mixed signals over how willing the president would be to negotiate tariff relief, Tuesday's message was far clearer: Trump is ready for opening bids.
    


            “The phones have been ringing off the hook, wanting to talk to this administration, this president and his trade team to try to strike a deal,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said midday.
    


            It's not just foreign leaders who have been calling. As the tariff deadline neared this week, the chief executives of some of the largest multinational companies — who have been loathe to criticize Trump's tariffs publicly — nonetheless maintained a robust backchannel to the White House.
    


            An onslaught of CEOs from banking, technology, and industrial companies – among others – have been lighting up the phone lines of chief of staff Susie Wiles, Vice President JD Vance and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, several executives told CNN, to argue the tariff policy will harm the global economy and credibility of American business and government. The recent effort was described by one CEO close to the White House as a “tsunami” in recent days.
    


            Trump endorsed the shift in message toward more dealmaking – and notably, messengers – after becoming frustrated by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's television appearances, which seemed to fuel the market's meltdown, several executives familiar with the discussions told CNN. The shift also came after aides warned Trump that the damage sustained in the market would endanger him politically, those people told CNN.
    


            Wiles, those executives added, had been particularly effective in convincing Trump that the market rout was costing considerable political capital that he would need for future agenda items, with lawmakers fielding increasingly angry constituent calls as the market continued sinking.
    


            “There are voices in the White House that want high tariffs forever. There are angels and demons sitting on President Trump's shoulders,” Texas Sen. Ted Cruz posted on X. “Who does he listen to? I hope he listens to the angels.”
    


            After days of criticism from some of his closest allies over his tariff strategy, Trump on Tuesday made clear he was confident in his decisions.
    


            “I know what the hell I'm doing,” he told the GOP crowd.
    


            White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CNN that “the administration maintains regular contact with business leaders, industry groups, and everyday Americans,” adding that “the only special interest guiding President Trump's decision-making, however, is the best interest of the American people.”
    


            Desai added: “The entire Trump administration is playing from the same playbook – President Trump's playbook – to level the playing field for our industries and workers, and Secretary Lutnick continues to be one of the administration's most effective TV communicators for that playbook.”
    


            But what precisely the president is looking for from his foreign interlocutors will vary by nation, White House officials said. It seemed certain the contours of his new trade deals would extend well beyond tariffs and trade barriers to other areas, including US military presence and foreign aid.
    


            Trump described the approach Tuesday as “one-stop shopping”: using the threat of withering tariffs as leverage on any manner of issues arising between the United States and its partners.
    


            “A beautiful and efficient process!!!” he wrote online.
    


            In some cases, the White House is working with the State Department on preparing lists of actions that countries could take, according to one US official.
    


            That is the case with China, where one idea on the table is for President Xi Jinping to make a public pronouncement that Chinese companies should stop producing fentanyl precursor chemicals, which could be an effective step in reining in the global drug war, an issue that Trump has prioritized.
    


            There is no expectation that an offer completely devoid of trade or tariff action will spur movement, particularly because Trump himself has said that this is the “only chance” for the US to “re-set the table” on trade. But sources involved in the current discussions expect offers that couple action on trade plus something else to sweeten the deal could be effective.
    


            Trump's advisers hope to have results soon that can demonstrate the success of his tariff plan, which has generated deep concern even among his closest allies and sent markets reeling earlier this week.
    


            Trump, too, is eagerly watching as his global counterparts seek him out in the hopes he'll lift his tariffs, relishing his role as the ultimate decider on what — and who — gets a reprieve, depending on what they're offering.
    


            “I call them tailored, not off the rack,” Trump said of the nascent agreements his team is now entertaining with as many as 70 countries that have approached the administration to talk trade.
    


            The logistics of arbitrating dozens of new bilateral agreements did not seem lost on the president, who suggested he may conscript lawyers at the large law firms he's targeted for retribution to help him write up the terms.
    


            “We need a lot of talent. We have a lot of countries coming that want to make deals,” he said in the East Room, where he was discussing a new energy initiative surrounded by coal workers in hard hats. “Our problem is [we] can't see that many that fast,” he said of the countries reaching out.
    


            For that reason, there appeared little hope for an eleventh-hour cancelation of the new duties that are set to take effect at midnight. For as keen as Trump and his team are to secure new agreements that can be trumpeted as examples of the tariffs' success, advisers expressed doubt they could be struck in only a day's time, even for a president in a hurry.
    


            And for as enthusiastic as many foreign leaders appeared to be to hop on an airplane or pick up the phone, the world's second-largest economy proved a tougher case.
    


            “China also wants to make a deal, badly, but they don't know how to get it started,” Trump wrote on social media. “We are waiting for their call. It will happen!”
    


            It hadn't happened by the time US markets closed Tuesday. After posting big gains earlier in the day, the S&P 500 slumped again in late-day trading when it became clear Trump was plowing ahead with the new tariffs, including an extraordinary 104% tariff on China that will take effect a minute past midnight.
    


            Trump has spent the last four years brooding about the shortcomings of the trade agreements he signed with China during his first administration. Beijing reneged on many of its promised purchases of American farm products, and Chinese duties on US soybeans and corns caused agricultural exports to sink.
    


            This time around, Trump is seeking out a bigger, better trade agreement, and hopes the massive tariffs applied on China will lure its  leader, Xi Jinping, to the negotiating table. So far, however, Xi has resisted Trump's pressure to submit, ratcheting up tit-for-tat tariffs that could have widespread consequences.
    


            Trump acknowledged the effect his tariffs were having on global stability in his remarks Tuesday.
    


            “Sometimes you have to mix it up a little bit,” he said, describing his tariffs as “somewhat explosive.”
    


            Just this week, the market has shifted based on the conflicting messages of the people around the president. On Sunday, Lutnick said any chance of Trump reversing, pausing, or diluting his tariffs would “absolutely not” happen. That stance spurred steep losses for global markets that positioned US markets to open at levels that represented a 20% drop from all-time highs reached in mid-February, the fastest drop of that magnitude in history.
    


            Markets experienced a slight bounce on Monday when National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett sidestepped a question over whether Trump would consider a 90-day pause – leading to false interpretations that Trump was, in fact, open to such a move.
    


            By Tuesday, though, Bessent was front and center, attempting to reset the White House's message that the tariffs were a means to a negotiated end.
    


            But as early deliberations are now underway among nations looking to strike a deal, some countries say they are still receiving mixed messages from different corners of the administration.
    


            In recent days, Lutnick told Japanese officials that making commitments on a possible future 800-mile pipeline facilitating transport of US natural gas to Asia more quickly – which has been referenced as a possible Alaska pipeline – would not be meaningful in these conversations, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.
    


            The Alaska pipeline is a project Trump has supported and has urged Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to partake in. And on Tuesday morning, Bessent, who has been tapped to lead the tariff talks with Japan, publicly spoke about the Alaska pipeline as a ripe topic to include in the negotiations.
    


            “We will see what our trading partners offer. For instance there is talk of a big energy deal in Alaska where the Japanese, and perhaps the Koreans, perhaps the Taiwanese, would provide – would take a lot of the offtake – and provide financing for the deal,” Bessent said on CNBC. “That could be an alternative for them to come forward with that because not only would that provide a lot of American jobs, it would narrow the trade deficit.”
    


            The confusion over what to include and what not to include underscores a concern among some former Trump administration officials that negotiating without a clear end game could become messy and unproductive.
    


            “The president always wants the same thing in any negotiation: more,” said a former administration official.
    


            “Even if the president was willing to discuss compromises, his differing rationales for the tariffs could conflict with one another and raise a question as to if he is even willing to negotiate.”

            President Donald Trump was speaking to reporters alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office on Monday when he made a surprise announcement: Direct nuclear talks are underway between the United States and Iran and a “very big meeting” will take place on Saturday.

            If true, these would be the first direct talks between the two nations since 2015, when they signed a landmark nuclear deal under the Obama administration, which Trump ditched three years later.
    


            Iran denies that negotiations are direct, insisting they will be mediated by the Gulf Arab nation of Oman, where Saturday's talks will take place. Direct or not, the talks represent a breakthrough between the Islamic Republic and a US administration led by a president whom American officials accuse Tehran of once plotting to assassinate.
    


            Trump has pledged to deliver a far “stronger” nuclear deal than Obama's. His administration has said it will push for the complete dismantling of Iran's nuclear program, rather than merely restricting it to peaceful purposes. Israel backs this demand – but Tehran has dismissed it outright as a non-starter.
    


            Here's what we know about the talks, why they may be happening now and what's at stake.
    


            Trump on Monday said a “very big meeting” would take place Saturday “at the top level,” adding that “everybody agrees that doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious,” referring to potential military action against Iranian nuclear sites.
    


            US envoy Steve Witkoff will be leading the US delegation, according to the US State Department, and Araghchi will represent Iran in indirect talks moderated by Oman officials, according to Iranian officials.
    


            On Wednesday, Araghchi said in a Washington Post op-ed that his country is ready to strike a peaceful deal with the US through diplomacy, which could result in a “trillion-dollar” business opportunity, and avoid a costly US military involvement in the region.
    


            He wrote that the “ball is in America's court” to achieve peace and normalize relations, which could include lucrative business opportunities, in an apparent attempt to speak to Trump's business background.
    


            Araghchi also made clear the talks would be indirect, writing that “indirect negotiations is not a tactic or reflection of ideology but a strategic choice rooted in experience,” especially when faced with “a significant wall of mistrust.”
    


            Hossein Mousavian, a former Iranian diplomat and ex-nuclear negotiator, said that Iran and the US are likely to “initially start the negotiations indirectly, and after an hour or two, if the outcome is positive, Iranian and American representatives will begin direct talks.”
    


            “It seems that Washington and Tehran have adopted a wise approach, and there is a chance for an agreement,” he wrote on X.



            A nuclear deal was reached in 2015 between Iran and world powers, including the US.
    


            Under the deal, Iran had agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.
    


            That agreement was, however, abandoned by Trump in 2018 during his first presidential term. Iran retaliated by resuming its nuclear activities, and has so far advanced its program to alarming levels.



            In December, Rafael Grossi, the head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, told Reuters that Iran was “dramatically” accelerating its enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, closer to the roughly 90% level that is weapons grade. In January, Grossi again warned that Iran was “pressing the gas pedal” on its uranium enrichment.
    


            Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful.
    


            Last month, Trump sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei proposing negotiations on a new nuclear deal, making it clear that Iran had a two-month deadline to reach an agreement, a source familiar with the letter's contents told CNN.
    


            Days later, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said the Islamic Republic rejected direct negotiations with the US. He said however that Iran's response, delivered by Oman, left open the possibility of indirect talks with Washington.

            “We don't avoid talks; it's the breach of promises that has caused issues for us so far,” Pezeshkian said in televised remarks. “They must prove that they can build trust.”
    


            Iran has in recent weeks been vocal with its concerns about striking a nuclear deal with Trump, who it says has a history of backtracking.
    


            Pezeshkian was elected last year on a reformist agenda that pledged to mend the country's relationship with the world and ease sanctions that have crippled the economy. But he also faces a powerful hardline establishment, including Khamenei, that distrusts the US and is wary of engaging with it.
    


            The value of Iran's currency, the rial, increased off the back of the news of talks after recording a record low just weeks ago.
    


            US officials have said that Trump is demanding that Iran dismantle its entire nuclear program, and not just accept restrictions on its ability to build a nuclear weapon, as it did in 2015.
    


            The 2015 deal allowed Iran to “fully enjoy its right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes under the relevant articles of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT),” according to the treaty. The NPT, to which Iran is signatory, is an international agreement aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.

As Trump offers new nuclear talks, Iran weighs the cost of losing its final leverage



            Experts have said that complete denuclearization would be a non-starter for Iran given that the nuclear program is its last remaining point of leverage against the West after its regional proxies have been weakened.
    


            Last week, National Security Adviser Michael Waltz told CBS' “Face the Nation” that Trump will demand a “full dismantlement” of Iran's uranium enrichment program.
    


            “Iran has to give up its program in a way that the entire world can see,” Waltz said, adding that Tehran must agree to “walk away completely” from its pursuit of nuclear weapons.
    


            Waltz added that this time, the deal won't be “some kind of tit for tat that we had under the Obama administration, or Biden.”
    


            Asked whether the deal would be similar to the 2015 agreement, Trump on Monday told reporters that “it'll be different, and maybe a lot stronger.”
    


            If talks are not successful, he added, “I think Iran's going to be in great danger… I actually think it'll be a very bad day for Iran.”
    


            The sudden revelation of the upcoming US-Iran talks at the press conference following Trump and Netanyahu's meeting appeared to surprise the Israeli prime minister, the smile quickly vanishing from his face as he looked toward his team of advisers.
    


            News of the talks are “certainly not” to Israel's liking, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            It's unclear if Netanyahu was given advance notice of the US-Iran talks or if he was consulted ahead of time, the sources said.
    


            Sat beside Trump at the Oval Office, Netanyahu touted a Libya-style nuclear deal between the US and Iran, which in 2003 dismantled the North African nation's nuclear program in the hopes of ushering in a new era of relations with the US after its two-decade oil embargo on Muammar Qaddafi's regime.
    


            “If it can be done diplomatically, in a full way, the way it was done in Libya, I think that would be a good thing,” Netanyahu said.



            Following denuclearization, Libya eventually descended into civil war after a 2011 NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed Qaddafi. Iranian officials have long warned that a similar deal would be intended to weaken Iran and eventually overthrow its regime.
    


            Asked about a Libya-style deal, Araghchi told Iranian media on Tuesday that Israel's hopes for what Iran's nuclear program should look like would be disregarded.
    


            “When it comes to the Zionist regime's hopes of what a deal will look like and what they have suggested, that's their hopes and ultimately will not be factored in,” he said.
    


            Netanyahu had vehemently opposed the 2015 nuclear deal, saying it did not prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon.
    


            Since the last US-Iran talks, Tehran has seen its ability to project power in the region significantly curtailed after Israel struck severe blows to its allied regional militias and launched direct attacks on Iranian soil.
    


            In Gaza, Israel continues to pound the enclave as it seeks to eradicate Hamas. In Syria, which Iran used as transit for weapons to proxies, Tehran's ally Bashar al-Assad has been deposed, and Israel continues to attack the country and take new territory. In Iraq, the US has retaliated against attacks by Iran-backed militants on its assets there. And in Lebanon, a series of Israeli attacks on the country have decapitated the militant group Hezbollah.
    


            In Yemen, where Iran's last remaining ally, the Houthi rebel group, remains standing, the US is intensifying airstrikes.
    


            Last year, Iran and Israel exchanged two rounds of tit-for-tat attacks, the first time either side has directly attacked the other. Israel is said to have taken out Iranian defenses in one of those attacks.
    


            “Remember, the Iranians' air defenses have been eviscerated by that attack from Israel. They're open to attack today,” Witkoff told journalist Tucker Carlson in an interview last month.

BRUSSELS (AP) — European Union member states voted Wednesday to approve retaliatory tariffs on $23 billion in goods in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, as the largest U.S. trading partner described them as “unjustified and damaging.”

The tariffs will go into effect in stages, with some on April 15 and others on May 15 and Dec. 1. The EU executive commission didn't immediately provide a list of the goods.

Members of the 27-country bloc repeated their preference for a negotiated deal to settle trade issues.

“The EU considers U.S. tariffs unjustified and damaging, causing economic harm to both sides, as well as the global economy,” the EU's executive commission said in a statement. “The EU has stated its clear preference to find negotiated outcomes with the U.S., which would be balanced and mutually beneficial.”

The targeted goods are a tiny fraction of the 1.6 trillion euros ($1.8 trillion) in U.S.-EU annual trade, which sees some 4.4 billion euros in goods and services cross the Atlantic each day in what the European Commission calls “the most important commercial relationship in the world.”

The head of the EU's executive commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has offered Trump a zero-for-zero tariffs deal on industrial goods including cars. But Trump has said that's not enough to satisfy U.S. concerns.

Trump's expanded steel and aluminum tariffs came into effect in March.




The EU has targeted smaller lists of goods in hopes of exerting political pressure and avoiding economic damage from a wider escalation of tit-for-tat tariffs.

The EU is also working on a response to Trump's blanket 20% tariff on all European goods, imposed as part of his sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs imposed on global trading partners. That could include measures aimed at U.S. tech companies and the services sector as well as trade in goods.

France's Economic Minister Eric Lombard said the second package “will take account not only of European imports, but also of other ways in which we can respond.”

Speaking to legislators in the National Assembly in Paris, Lombard added that “the idea is that, with these extremely strong, extremely powerful measures, we can get to the negotiating table on an equal footing, so that both sides of these duties can be lowered and all our economic sectors protected.”

China again vowed to “fight to the end” against Donald Trump's tariffs on Wednesday, arguing that trade between the two countries is in balance as a 104% tax on the country's exports to the U.S. came into effect.

BANGKOK (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday raised tariffs on China to 125%, hours after China boosted taxes on American imports to 84% and vowed to “fight to the end” in an escalating battle that threatens to disrupt trade between the world's two largest economies.

The new rate levied by Beijing, which has taken effect, comes in response to Trump's earlier move to raise the tariff on Chinese products to 104% as part of increases that hit U.S. trading partners worldwide. Europe and Canada also hit back Wednesday with new tariffs on imports from America.

Citing lack of respect, Trump responded by raising tariffs on China to 125%, while pausing tariffs on most countries for 90 days.

The hikes are the latest in an ongoing trade war that threatens to raise prices for consumers in America and derail China's attempts to reinvigorate its sluggish economy. The response from the Chinese government signals its determination not to bend to Trump's pressure, despite the risks.

“If the U.S. insists on further escalating its economic and trade restrictions, China has the firm will and abundant means to take necessary countermeasures and fight to the end,” the Ministry of Commerce said before announcing its latest tariff hike.

Beijing also imposed restrictions on doing business with nearly a dozen American companies and said it was launching a new challenge to the American tariffs at the World Trade Organization.




The United States sent a record $199 billion in exports to China last year, while China exported $463 billion in goods and services to the United States, third behind Mexico and Canada, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. 




China was the top source of U.S. imports as recently as 2022 but it has lost ground to America's neighbors amid heightened tensions with the United States.

The European Chamber of Commerce in China accused the U.S. of rolling back many of the principles that have underpinned its approach to trade and investment. It said that Trump's tariffs would have a significant impact on European companies exporting from China to the U.S., forcing them to rethink their business models and supply chains.

“This will lead to a substantial increase in operational costs and inefficiencies, and ultimately higher prices for consumers,” it said.

Though the U.S. and China may want to find a way back to the negotiating table, “this won't be an easy path to navigate with both countries doubling down and bilateral engagement at a virtual standstill,'' said former U.S. trade official Wendy Cutler, a vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute.




China does not appear interested in bargaining, as some other countries have started doing.

“If the U.S. truly wants to resolve issues through dialogue and negotiation, it should adopt an attitude of equality, respect and mutual benefit,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said.

The Chinese Ministry of Culture and Tourism issued a travel advisory asking its citizens to evaluate the risks of visiting the U.S. as tourists and to exercise caution. The advisory, which came shortly after the announcement of the tariff hike, cited the deterioration in economic and trade relations as well as the “safety situation” in America.

Trump has now raised the tariff on Chinese goods five times since taking office in January. The first two hikes of 10% each were met with what analysts described as a measured response from China that left the door open for talks. 

But after Trump announced an additional 34% tariff on Chinese goods last week, along with tariffs on other countries in his “Liberation Day,” China matched that with a 34% tariff on imports from the U.S. 

Trump then added a 50% tariff on goods from China, saying negotiations were terminated, and bringing the cumulative U.S. tariff to 104%. China responded by raising the tariff on American products by the same amount, bringing its total rate to 84%. 

China's latest measures include adding 11 American companies to an “unreliable entities” list that bars Chinese companies from selling them goods that could have military uses. Among the companies are American Photonics, and SYNEXXUS, which both work with the American military.

A Chinese position paper issued Wednesday said that the U.S. has not honored the promises it made in an earlier “Phase One” trade deal concluded during Trump's first term. As an example, it said a U.S. law that would ban TikTok unless it is sold by its Chinese parent company violates a promise that neither would “pressure the other party to transfer technology to its own individuals.” 

Trump signed an order to keep TikTok running for another 75 days last week after a potential deal to sell the app to American owners was put on ice. Representatives from ByteDance, the parent company, told the White House that the Chinese government would no longer approve a deal until there could be talks on trade.

“History and facts have proven that the United States' increase in tariffs will not solve its own problems,” the Commerce Ministry said in a statement introducing the paper. “Instead, it will trigger sharp fluctuations in financial markets, push up U.S. inflation pressure, weaken the U.S. industrial base and increase the risk of a U.S. economic recession, which will ultimately only backfire on itself.”

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran's president again pledged Wednesday that his nation is “not after a nuclear bomb” ahead of talks between Tehran and the United States, going as far as dangling the prospect of direct American investment in the Islamic Republic if the countries can reach a deal.

The comments by reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian represent a departure from Iran's stance after its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, in which Tehran sought to buy American airplanes but in effect barred U.S. companies from coming into the country. 

“His excellency has no opposition to investment by American investors in Iran,” Pezeshkian said in a speech in Tehran, referring to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. “American investors: Come and invest.”

Such a business proposal could draw the interest of U.S. President Donald Trump, who withdrew America from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers in his first term and now seeks a new agreement with the country. 

Pezeshkian, who campaigned on a platform of outreach to the West during his election last year, also added that Saturday's talks in Oman between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff would be conducted “indirectly.” Trump has said the talks would be direct negotiations — something Tehran hasn't ruled out after the first round of discussions.

“We are not after a nuclear bomb,” Pezeshkian added. “You (in the West) have verified it 100 times. Do it 1,000 times again.”




In 2015, Khamenei opposed importing American consumer goods into Iran.

“We neither allow economic influence, nor political influence and presence as well as cultural influence by Americans in our country,” he said then. “We will confront it by all means, we will not allow.”

But after Trump's comments on the talks went public, Iran's ailing economy showed new signs of life. Its rial currency, which hit a record low of over 1 million rials to the dollar, rebounded Tuesday to 990,000 rials.

Iran's economy has been severely affected by international sanctions, particularly after Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. At the time of the 2015 deal, which saw Iran drastically limit its enrichment and stockpiling of uranium in exchange for lifting of international sanctions, the rial traded at 32,000 to the dollar. 

There also appeared to be a direct influence from the top on how hard-line media reported the upcoming talks Wednesday as there was no criticism of the negotiations whatsoever — something highly unusual in Iran's fractious internal politics.

“At first, Iran may unilaterally accept a decrease in enrichment. This should not be considered a withdrawal,” the hard-line newspaper Javan, believed to be close to the country's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, said in an editorial.

“Keeping the nuclear industry and enrichment that meets our needs is what we have been saying and seeking for years. In return for a decrease of the level of enrichment and an increase of monitoring, Iran should gain concessions on lifting all sanctions and stopping open hostility through the support to the opposition” by the U.S.

Pezeshkian himself spoke at an event marking Iran's National Nuclear Technology Day, which in the past had seen Tehran show off advances in centrifuge technology that worried the West. This year it focused on medical applications and other projects. 

However, not everyone agrees with the U.S. outreach. There had been anger toward Trump from Iran's theocracy, particularly over his decision to launch a drone strike that killed prominent Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad in 2020. U.S. officials have said Trump faced assassination threats from Iran in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election.

A protest in Tehran on Wednesday drew some hundreds people and saw demonstrators burn an effigy of the U.S. flag, chanting both “Death to America!” and “Death to Israel!” Fake coffins for Israeli officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sat to one side as protesters also carried signs decrying the death of civilians in the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. 

“Negotiations with whom? With a murderer? With an occupier?” asked one woman holding a “Death to Israel” placard who declined to give her name at the protest for fear of reprisal. “We should keep these in mind. They always show their true nature.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — By declaring a trade war on the rest of the world, President Donald Trump has panicked global financial markets, raised the risk of a recession and broken the political and economic alliances that made much of the world stable for business after World War II.

Trump's latest round of tariffs went into full effect at midnight Wednesday, with higher import tax rates on dozens of countries and territories taking hold.

Economists are puzzled to see Trump trying to overhaul the existing economic order and doing it so soon after inheriting the strongest economy in the world. Many of the trading partners he accuses of ripping off U.S. businesses and workers were already floundering.

“There is a deep irony in Trump claiming unfair treatment of the American economy at a time when it was growing robustly while every other major economy had stalled or was losing growth momentum,” said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University. “In an even greater irony, the Trump tariffs are likely to end America's remarkable run of success and crash the economy, job growth and financial markets.''

Trump and his trade advisers insist that the rules governing global commerce put the United States at a distinct disadvantage. But mainstream economists — whose views Trump and his advisers disdain — say the president has a warped idea of world trade, especially a preoccupation with trade deficits, which they say do nothing to impede growth.

The administration accuses other countries of erecting unfair trade barriers to keep out American exports and using underhanded tactics to promote their own. In Trump's telling, his tariffs are a long-overdue reckoning: The U.S. is the victim of an economic mugging by Europe, China, Mexico, Japan and even Canada.




It's true that some countries charge higher taxes on imports than the United States does. Some manipulate their currencies lower to ensure that their goods are price-competitive in international markets. Some governments lavish their industries with subsidies to give them an edge.

However, the United States is still the second-largest exporter in the world, after China. The U.S. exported $3.1 trillion of goods and services in 2023, far ahead of third-place Germany at $2 trillion.

The fear that Trump's remedies are deadlier than the maladies he's trying to cure has sent investors fleeing American stocks. Since Trump announced sweeping import taxes on April 2, the S&P 500 has cratered 12%.

Trump and his advisers point to America's lopsided trade numbers — year after year of huge deficits — as proof of foreigners' perfidy. He's seeking to restore justice and millions of long-gone U.S. factory jobs by taxing imports at rates not seen in America since the days of the horse and buggy.

“They've taken so much of our wealth away from us,” the president declared last week at a White House Rose Garden ceremony to celebrate the tariffs announcement. “We're not going to let that happen. We truly can be very wealthy. We can be so much wealthier than any country.''

But the U.S. is already the wealthiest major economy in the world. And the International Monetary Fund in January forecast that the United States would outgrow every other major advanced economy this year.

China and India did grow faster than the United States over the past decade, but their living standards still don't come close to those in the U.S.

Manufacturing in the U.S. has been fading for decades. There is widespread agreement that many American manufacturers couldn't compete with an influx of cheap imports after China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Factories closed, workers were laid off and heartland communities withered.

Four years later, nearly 3 million manufacturing jobs had been lost, though robots and other forms of automation probably did at least as much to reduce factory jobs as the “China shock.''





To turn around this long decline, Trump has repeatedly unsheathed the tariffs that are his weapon of choice. Since returning to the White House in January, he's plastered 25% taxes on foreign cars, steel and aluminum. He's hit Chinese imports with 20% levies, on top of hefty tariffs he imposed on China during his first term.

On April 2, he blasted his big bazooka: 10% “baseline'' tariffs on just about everybody and “reciprocal'' tariffs on everyone else that the Trump team identified as bad actors, including tiny Lesotho (a 50% import tax) and China (34% before adding earlier levies).

Trump views tariffs as an all-purpose economic fix that will protect American industries, encourage companies to open factories in America, raise money for the U.S. Treasury and give him leverage to bend other countries to his will, even on issues that have nothing to do with trade, such as drug trafficking and immigration.

The president also sees a smoking gun: The United States has bought more from other countries than it has sold them every year for the past half-century. In 2024, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services came to a whopping $918 billion, the second-highest amount on record.

Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro calls America's trade deficits “the sum of all cheating'' by other countries.

However, economists say trade deficits aren't a sign of national weakness. The U.S. economy has nearly quadrupled in size, adjusted for inflation, during that half-century of trade deficits.

“There is no reason to think that a bigger trade deficit means lower growth,” said former IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics and an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. “In fact, the opposite is closer to the truth in many countries.”

A trade deficit, Obstfeld said, does not mean a country is losing through trade or being “ripped off.”

The faster the U.S. economy grows, in fact, the more imports Americans tend to buy and the wider the trade deficit tends to get. The U.S. trade deficit — the gap between what it sells and what it buys from foreign countries — hit a record $945 billion in 2022 as the American economy roared back from COVID-19 lockdowns. Trade deficits typically fall sharply in recessions.

Nor are trade deficits primarily inflicted on America by other countries' unfair trading practices. To economists, they're a homegrown product, the result of Americans' propensity to save little and consume more than they produce.

American shoppers' famous appetite for spending more than the country makes means that a chunk of the spending is used for imports. If the United States boosted its saving — for example, by reducing its budget deficits — then that would reduce its trade deficit as well, economists say.

“It's not like the rest of the world has been ripping us off for decades,” said Jay Bryson, chief economist at Wells Fargo. “It's because we don't save enough.”

The flip side of America's low savings and big trade deficits is a steady inflow of foreign investment as other countries sink their export earnings into the United States. Direct foreign investment into the U.S. came to $349 billion in 2023, the World Bank reported, nearly double No. 2 Singapore's inflows.

The only scenario in which tariffs reduce the U.S. deficit is if they cause investment in the U.S. to crash, said Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. That “would be a disaster.''

Harvard University economist Dani Rodrik said a “well-designed industrial policy” supported by select tariffs “might have fostered increased investment and capacity in manufacturing.”

Instead, Rodrik said, Trump's actions just “throw up a lot of uncertainty” and alienate America's best allies, making for “a terrible policy all in all.''

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are surging on a euphoric Wall Street Wednesday after President Donald Trump said he would temporarily back off on some of his tariffs, as investors had desperately hoped he would. 

The S&P 500 was up 7.8% in afternoon trading. It had been down earlier in the morning amid worries about Trump's trade war and whether it would cause a recession as economists fear. But it spiked immediately after Trump sent the social-media posting that investors have been waiting for.

Trump said that because so many countries had “not retaliated” against his latest crank higher in tariffs, he said, “I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2,476 points, or 6.6%, as of 1:35 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 9% higher. 

Trump, though, also said that he was raising tariffs even higher against China, up to 125%. 

Huge swings have become routine for financial markets worldwide recently, not just day to day but hour to hour, as investors struggle to game out what Trump's trade war will do to the economy. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 careened between a gain of 4% and a loss of 3% for a second straight day of shocking reversals. 

Wall Street's latest moves came after Trump's latest round of tariffs  kicked in after midnight for imports from around the world. That included a 104% tax on things coming from China, and the world's second-largest economy quickly retaliated by saying it would raise tariffs on U.S. goods to 84% on Thursday. 




“If the U.S. insists on further escalating its economic and trade restrictions, China has the firm will and abundant means to take necessary countermeasures and fight to the end” the Ministry of Commerce said.

Such aggressive brinkmanship between the world's two largest economies is raising fears that tariffs will stick around for a while, which economists and investors expect would create a recession. 

Wall Street also got a boost Wednesday from a relatively smooth auction of U.S. Treasurys. Earlier jumps in Treasury yields had rattled the market, indicating increasing levels of stress. 

Analysts say several reasons could have benbe behind the move, including hedge funds and other investors having to sell their Treasury bonds to raise cash in order to make up for losses in the stock market. Investors outside the United States may also be selling their U.S. Treasurys because of the trade war. Such actions would push down prices for Treasurys, which in turn would push up their yields. 

Regardless of the reasons behind it, the higher yields on Treasurys add pressure on the stock market and will likely push up rates for mortgages and other loans for U.S. households. 

The moves are notable because U.S. Treasury bonds have historically been seen as some of the safest possible investments, and their yields have tended to fall — not rise — during scary times for the market. This week's sharp rise has brought the yield on the 10-year Treasury back to where it was in late February.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury pulled back to 4.36% after 4.50% earlier in the morning. 

In stock markets abroad, indexes tumbled across most of Europe and much of Asia.

London's FTSE 100 dropped 2.9%, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 sank 3.9% and the CAC 40 fell 3.3% in Paris. 

Chinese stocks were an outlier, and indexes rose 0.7% in Hong Kong and 1.3% in Shanghai.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Tuesday declared a state of emergency in New Mexico's largest city, saying that a significant increase in crime in Albuquerque warrants the help of the New Mexico National Guard. 

She signed an executive order, clearing the way for several dozen troops to be deployed along the historic Route 66 corridor starting in mid-May. The order also frees up state funds for the National Guard to use as part of the effort. 

Training for 60 to 70 troops already is underway, the governor's office said.

Governors typically call up the National Guard to help with natural disasters like wildfires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes. Governors in recent years also have ordered troops to address illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border. In New York last year, the National Guard helped patrol the subway system following a series of high-profile crimes.

In New Mexico, Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina called it a crucial time for the National Guard to provide support that gives police officers more time to patrol the streets for crime.

Medina and Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller pointed to a large chart during a news conference, saying nearly every category of crime has come down since the beginning of the year because of the work already being done by the police force. 

The National Guard will not be engaging with the public, they said, but rather taking on duties that drain the time of sworn officers, like directing traffic. The troops can help secure crime scenes, distribute food and supplies to the homeless population throughout the corridor, transport prisoners, provide courthouse security and run drone operations used for locating suspects or assessing incidents, officials said.




Watchdog groups have concerns that militarizing civilian law enforcement will lead to civil rights violations.

Daniel Williams, policy advocate at the ACLU of New Mexico, called the governor's action a show of force, not a solution.

“New Mexico already has one of the highest per capita rates of people killed by police in the nation,” Williams said. “History has shown that military collaboration with local law enforcement often leads to increased civil rights violations, racial profiling, and criminalization of vulnerable populations, particularly those experiencing homelessness and poverty.”

It's not the first time Lujan Grisham has tried to leverage state resources to address high crime rates in Albuquerque. In 2021, the two-term Democrat temporarily assigned state police officers to the area to help local authorities tackle vehicle thefts, drug trafficking, aggressive driving and the apprehension of violent criminals with felony warrants.

The year before, then-President Donald Trump sent federal agents, including Homeland Security officers, to Albuquerque as part of an effort to contain violent crime. He also targeted Chicago and other U.S. cities with the surge in resources.

Lujan Grisham's latest emergency declaration follows a March 31 request by Albuquerque's police chief, who pointed to the fentanyl epidemic and an increase in violent juvenile crime. Medina wrote that progress has been made in reducing shootings and aggravated assaults along what is known as Central Avenue but that more resources are needed.

The New Mexico Legislature adjourned last month, drawing much criticism from law enforcement leaders, prosecutors and even the governor for failing to adequately bolster public safety in Albuquerque and other New Mexico communities.

Statistics released by the Albuquerque police department in February showed an 11% decrease in aggravated assaults in 2024 compared to the prior year, while homicides decreased for a second straight year.

NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump has launched tariff wars with nearly all of America's trading partners. And there's no end in sight.

A number of sweeping new taxes on goods from other countries are already here — and more took effect on Wednesday. Trump implemented higher rates for his latest and most severe volley of duties, which he calls “reciprocal” tariffs. Further escalation is set to soon follow. China has vowed to roll out a heightened set of counter tariffs on U.S. goods starting Thursday and, separately, E.U. member states voted to approve their own retaliatory levies in response to previously-imposed steel and aluminum taxes.

With so many back-and-forth tariff actions and threats, it can be tough to keep track of where things stand. Here's a rundown of what you need to know.

Higher rates for Trump's latest — and most sweeping — round of tariffs took effect on Wednesday.

Trump announced these new import taxes on April 2, which he dubbed “Liberation Day,” as part of his “reciprocal” trade plan. In a fiery speech claiming that other countries had “ripped off” the U.S. for years, Trump declared that the U.S. would now tax nearly all of America's trading partners at a minimum of 10% — and impose steeper rates for countries that he says run trade surpluses with the U.S.

The 10% baseline already went into effect Saturday. And when the clock struck at midnight Wednesday, the higher import tax rates on dozens of countries and territories took hold.




The steeper levies run as high as 50% — with that biggest rate landing on small economies that trade little with the U.S., including the African kingdom of Lesotho. Some other rates include a tax of 47% on imports from Madagascar, 46% on Vietnam, 32% on Taiwan, 25% on South Korea, 24% on Japan and 20% on the European Union.

Economists warn that the levies will raise prices for goods consumers buy each day — particularly as these new tariffs build on some previous trade measures. 

Trump last week announced a tariff of 34% on China, for example, to come on top of 20% levies he imposed on the country earlier this year. He then added on another 50% in response to Beijing's recently-promised retaliation — bringing the combined total to 104% tariffs on Chinese goods starting Wednesday.

Yes. Starting Thursday, China says it will now tax American goods at 84%.

China announced a flurry of countermeasures in response to the “Liberation Day” tariffs last week, including plans for its own 34% levy on U.S. goods to match what was then Trump's new rate. But after Trump threatened — and then followed through — on adding an additional 50%, China said Wednesday that it would raise its tariffs to 84%.

“If the U.S. insists on further escalating its economic and trade restrictions, China has the firm will and abundant means to take necessary countermeasures and fight to the end,” the Ministry of Commerce wrote in a statement introducing its white paper on trade with the U.S.

The trade war between the U.S. and China isn't new. The two countries had exchanged a series of tit-for-tat levies in recent months — on top of tariffs imposed during Trump's first term, many of which were preserved or added to under former President Joe Biden.

While China has taken the toughest approach so far, a number of countries are evaluating their own responses to Trump's levies — and some have already promised, if not already taken, more retaliation.

EU members voted Wednesday to approve retaliatory tariffs on $23 billion in goods in response to Trump's previous 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, for example. The EU's counter tariffs will come in stages, with some arriving April 15 and others on May 15 and Dec. 1. The executive commission didn't immediately specify which goods would be effected.

Members of the 27-country bloc repeated their preference for a negotiated deal to settle trade issues — calling the U.S. tariffs “unjustified and damaging.” Ursula von der Leyen, head of the EU's executive commission, has offered a zero-for-zero tariffs deal on industrial goods, but Trump has said that's not enough to satisfy U.S. concerns.

Trump could also roll out more product-specific tariffs down the road. The president has previously threatened import taxes on goods like copper, lumber and pharmaceutical drugs — all of which are currently exempt from Trump's “reciprocal” levies.

During a speech Tuesday night, Trump boasted he was offering “breaking news” before vowing, “We're going to be announcing, very shortly, a major tariff on pharmaceuticals.” In the same remarks, the president lamented that the U.S. no longer produces many of the pharmaceuticals its citizens take, and said new tariffs would change that — bringing production of medication back to the U.S.

A handful of tariffs are already in effect, including Trump's 10% baseline tax which took effect on Saturday.

Prior to that sweeping levy, Trump had rolled out several other rounds of tariffs targeting particular countries and products. His 25% tariffs on auto imports began last Thursday, with taxes on fully-imported cars. Those levies are set to expand to applicable auto parts in coming weeks, through May 3.

Canada responded with a 25% levy on auto imports from the U.S. that do not comply with the 2020 US-Mexico Canada Agreement. Those also took effect on Wednesday.

Trump's expanded steel and aluminum tariffs came into effect in March. Both metals are now taxed at 25% across the board, with Trump's order to remove steel exemptions and raise aluminum's levy from his previously-imposed 2018 import taxes taking effect March 12.

Beyond previous levies on China, Trump also targeted Mexico and Canada earlier this year. They were spared from last week's heightened rates, Trump imposed — and later partially suspended — 25% duties on goods from both countries. 

Meanwhile, goods complying with the USMCA can continue to enter the U.S. duty-free, according to the White House. Other imports are still levied at 25%, as well as a lower 10% duty on potash and Canadian energy products. 

Once the two countries have satisfied Trump's demands on immigration and drug trafficking, the White House said the tariff on non-USMCA compliant imports will drop from 25% to 12%.

Idaho police officers opened fire from behind a chain-link fence just seconds after exiting their patrol cars and critically wounded a teenage boy — described by his family as nonverbal, autistic and intellectually disabled — as he stepped toward them with a knife, video from a witness shows.

Seventeen-year-old Victor Perez, who also has cerebral palsy, remained hospitalized in critical condition Tuesday after having nine bullets removed from his body and having his leg amputated, Ana Vazquez, his aunt, told The Associated Press. Doctors were planning tests on his brain activity.

“We don't know if he's going to wake up,” she said.

The shooting Saturday in Pocatello outraged the boy's family and neighbors as well as viewers online who questioned why the officers opened fire within about 12 seconds of exiting their patrol cars while making no apparent effort to de-escalate the situation or use less lethal weapons. Dozens of protesters gathered outside the police department Sunday, eastidahonews.com reported.

There is no indication the police were aware of the boy's conditions.

“The police barely spoke to anyone,” Vazquez said. “They just said get back and they just, they shot to kill.”

In a video statement posted to the Pocatello Police Department's Facebook page on Monday, Chief Roger Schei said he wanted to “provide clarity, share the information we can at this stage and address some misconceptions that have emerged.”

“We understand the concern and emotion surrounding the officer-involved shooting that occurred,” he said, adding, “We are also aware of the video circulating online, which shows only one angle. The full picture requires careful review of all facts and evidence.”

Brad Andres, who took the video, has an auto shop nearby and told the AP he noticed a disturbance when he stepped outside to take a phone call around 5:20 Saturday. His 19-year-old son, Bridger, called 911 and reported it as a domestic dispute in a backyard.

The 911 caller said an apparently intoxicated man — the teen — was wielding a kitchen knife and periodically chasing a man and woman in the yard, according to audio of the 911 call released by the Pocatello Police Department.

“He seems pretty drunk,” the caller told a dispatcher. “He's just running at them with a knife and then falling over. I think he just stabbed himself, actually.”

The 911 caller noted that the people in the yard were not speaking English.

“He looks like he fell on the ground and kind of passed out,” the caller said.

Perez was still on the ground when police arrived at about 5:25 p.m. Four officers ran to the fence — three pulling out handguns and another pointing what appeared to be a shotgun. They ordered him to drop the knife. Instead, the boy stood up and began taking steps toward them with the knife in his hand. The officers shot repeatedly.

Andres said the police “appeared to be like a death squad or a firing squad,” adding: “They never once asked, ‘What is the situation, how can we help?' They ran up with their guns drawn, they triggered a mentally disabled person to react and when he reacted ... they shot him.”

“This was really traumatic for me to watch, for me and my son to be a part of,” Andres said. “My son was the one that called the 911 with the hopes of helping the family deal with the situation that was going on. He had no idea that what was going to transpire.”

Schei said he would not answer questions about the shooting because of an investigation being conducted by the East Idaho Critical Incident Task Force.

“In situations like this, officers must make decisions in seconds,” Schei said. “They assess threats not just to themselves but to those nearby. In this case, two individuals were within a few feet of an armed, noncompliant individual. The risk was immediate, and the situation rapidly evolving.”

The Pocatello Police Department did not immediately respond to emails seeking further comment Tuesday, including questions about whether the officers were carrying Tasers or other less lethal options. 

According to the department's policy manual, all uniformed officers who have been trained to use Tasers must carry them, as well as either a baton or pepper spray.

Vazquez said Perez walked with a staggering gait because of his disabilities; he was not intoxicated. The boy's 16-year-old sister yelled to the police not to shoot and that he was “special,” Vazquez said.

It was unclear if the police heard any such comments, which were not apparent on the video.

Seth Stoughton, a former police officer who teaches at the University of South Carolina Law School, said after watching the video that he had questions about why the officers did not use less lethal weapons or the basic tactic of backing up to create space between them and Perez.

“It does not appear to me that any officer is in immediate danger at the point where they begin shooting,” Stoughton said. “If he had made it over the fence and officers backed up and he continued to approach … then that could change.”

Vazquez said the family had never called police for help with the boy in the past and that this was his first interaction with law enforcement.

Across the country, police departments are increasing training for officers on best ways to identify and interact with people who may have developmental or intellectual disabilities, including many trainings centering on autism.

The trainings often focus in on ways people on the autism spectrum react to outside stimulus like noise or touching, that can be seen as resisting commands or resisting arrest to someone not on the spectrum.

Some groups have started providing stickers or marked license plates for people with autistic family members as a signal for police.

Pocatello is a city of just under 60,000 residents about 165 miles (265 kilometers) north of Salt Lake City.

US Secretary of Defense Hegseth meets with Panama President amid tensions over China's influence

Pete Hegseth said Tuesday that the Panama Canal faces ongoing threats from China, but together, the U.S. and Panama will keep it secure. Speaking at ribbon cutting for a new U.S.-financed dock at the Vasco Nuñez de Balboa Naval Base, Hegseth said the U.S. would not “allow Communist China, or any other country to threaten the canal's operation or integrity.”

PANAMA CITY (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Tuesday the Panama Canal faces ongoing threats from China but that together the United States and Panama will keep it secure. 

Hegseth's remarks triggered a fiery response from the Chinese government, which said: “Who represents the real threat to the Canal? People will make their own judgement.”

Speaking at a ribbon cutting for a new U.S.-financed dock at the Vasco Nuñez de Balboa Naval Base after a meeting with Panama President José Raúl Mulino, Hegseth said the U.S. will not allow China or any other country to threaten the canal's operation. 

“To this end, the United States and Panama have done more in recent weeks to strengthen our defense and security cooperation than we have in decades,” he said. 

Hegseth alluded to ports at either end of the canal that are controlled by a Hong Kong consortium, which is in the process of selling its controlling stake to another consortium including BlackRock Inc.

“China-based companies continue to control critical infrastructure in the canal area,” Hegseth said. “That gives China the potential to conduct surveillance activities across Panama. This makes Panama and the United States less secure, less prosperous and less sovereign. And as President Donald Trump has pointed out, that situation is not acceptable.”

Hegseth met with Mulino for two hours Tuesday morning before heading to the naval base that previously had been the U.S. Rodman Naval Station.




On the way, Hegseth posted a photo on X of the two men laughing and said it was an honor speaking with Mulino. “You and your country's hard work is making a difference. Increased security cooperation will make both our nations safer, stronger and more prosperous,” he wrote.

Late Tuesday, Mulino and Hegseth released a joint statement. 

A vaguely worded portion of the statement suggested the two had discussed the tolls the United States pays for its ships crossing the canal. It said that within the canal's framework, “the Republic of Panama and the United States of America will work, as established, on a mechanism to compensate for the payment of tolls and charges.”

Panama's Foreign Relations Ministry did not immediately answer a request for clarification.

But the Spanish and English versions had at least one significant discrepancy. The Spanish version included that “Secretary Hegseth recognized the leadership and inalienable sovereignty of Panama over the Panama Canal and its adjacent areas.” That sentence appeared nowhere in the English version.

The visit comes amid tensions over Trump's repeated assertions that the U.S. is being overcharged to use the Panama Canal and that China has influence over its operations — allegations that Panama has denied.

Shortly after the meeting, the Chinese Embassy in Panama slammed the American government in a statement on X, saying the U.S. has used “blackmail” to further its own interests and that who Panama carries out business with is a “sovereign decision of Panama ... and something the U.S. doesn't have the right to interfere in.”

“The U.S. has carried out a sensationalistic campaign about the ‘theoretical Chinese threat' in an attempt to sabotage Chinese-Panamanian cooperation, which is all just rooted in the United State's own geopolitical interests,” the embassy wrote.

After Hegseth and Mulino spoke by phone in February, the U.S. State Department said that an agreement had been reached to not charge U.S. warships to pass through the canal. Mulino publicly denied there was any such deal.

Trump has gone so far as to suggest the U.S. never should have turned the canal over to Panama and that maybe that it should take the canal back.

The China concern was provoked by the Hong Kong consortium holding a 25-year lease on ports at either end of the canal. The Panamanian government announced that lease was being audited and late Monday concluded that there were irregularities.

The Hong Kong consortium, however, has already announced that CK Hutchison would be selling its controlling stake in the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control once the sale is complete.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Mulino during a visit in February that Trump believes China's presence in the canal area may violate a treaty that led the U.S. to turn the waterway over to Panama in 1999. That treaty calls for the permanent neutrality of the American-built canal.

Mulino has denied that China has any influence in the operations of the canal. In February, he expressed frustration at the persistence of the narrative. “We aren't going to speak about what is not reality, but rather those issues that interest both countries,” he said.

The U.S. built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter.

“I want to be very clear, China did not build this canal,” Hegseth said Tuesday. “China does not operate this canal and China will not weaponize this canal. Together with Panama in the lead, we will keep the canal secure and available for all nations through the deterrent power of the strongest, most effective and most lethal fighting force in the world.”

President Donald Trump has signed four executive orders aimed at boosting coal, a reliable but polluting energy source that's long been in decline. Trump used his emergency authority to allow older coal-fired power plants to keep producing electricity.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed a series of executive orders aimed at boosting the struggling coal industry, a reliable but polluting energy source that's long been in decline.

Under the four orders, Trump uses his emergency authority to allow some older coal-fired power plants set for retirement to keep producing electricity to meet rising U.S. power demand amid growth in data centers, artificial intelligence and electric cars. 

Trump also directed federal agencies to identify coal resources on federal lands, lift barriers to coal mining and prioritize coal leasing on U.S. lands.

In a related action, Trump also signed a proclamation offering coal-fired power plants a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene.

Trump's administration had offered power plants and other industrial polluters a chance for exemptions from rules imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA, under Trump appointee Lee Zeldin, set up an electronic mailbox to allow regulated companies to request a presidential exemption under the Clean Air Act to a host of Biden-era rules.

Trump, a Republican, has long promised to boost what he calls “beautiful” coal to fire power plants and for other uses, but the industry has been in decline for decades.

“I call it beautiful, clean coal. I told my people, never use the word coal unless you put beautiful, clean before it,” Trump said at a White House signing ceremony where he was flanked by coal miners in hard hats. Several wore patches on their work jackets that said “coal.” 




“Pound for pound, coal is the single most reliable, durable, secure and powerful form of energy,” Trump said. “It's cheap, incredibly efficient, high density, and it's almost indestructible.”

Trump's orders also direct Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to “acknowledge the end” of an Obama-era moratorium that paused coal leasing on federal lands and require federal agencies to rescind policies transitioning the nation away from coal production. And they seek to promote coal and coal technology exports, and accelerate development of coal technologies. 

Trump also targeted what he called “overreach” by Democratic-controlled states to limit energy production to slow climate change. He ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to take “all appropriate action to stop the enforcement” of such laws.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, co-chairs of the U.S. Climate Alliance, said Trump's order illegally attempts to usurp states' rights to act on climate.

“The federal government cannot unilaterally strip states' independent constitutional authority. We are a nation of states — and laws — and we will not be deterred,” the two Democrats said. “We will keep advancing solutions to the climate crisis that safeguard Americans' fundamental right to clean air and water (and) grow the clean energy economy.”

The climate alliance is a bipartisan coalition of 24 governors representing nearly 55% of the U.S. population.

Trump, who has pushed for U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market, has long suggested that coal can help meet surging electricity demand from manufacturing and the massive data centers needed for artificial intelligence.

“We're ending Joe Biden's war on beautiful, clean coal once and for all,'' he said Tuesday. “All those plants that have been closed are going to be opened, if they're modern enough, (or) they'll be ripped down and brand new ones will be built. And we're going to put the miners back to work.”

In 2018, during his first term, Trump directed then-Energy Secretary Rick Perry to take “immediate steps” to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants, calling it a matter of national and economic security.

At that time, Trump also considered but didn't approve a plan to order grid operators to buy electricity from coal and nuclear plants to keep them open. Energy industry groups — including oil, natural gas, solar and wind power — condemned the proposal, saying it would raise energy prices and distort markets.

Energy experts say any bump for coal under Trump is likely to be temporary because natural gas is cheaper, and there's a durable market for renewable energy such as wind and solar power no matter who holds the White House.

Trump's administration has targeted regulations under the Biden administration that could hasten closures of heavily polluting coal power plants and the mines that supply them.

Coal once provided more than half of U.S. electricity production, but its share dropped to about 16% in 2023, down from about 45% as recently as 2010. Natural gas provides about 43% of U.S. electricity, with the remainder from nuclear energy and renewables such as wind, solar and hydropower.

The front line in what Republicans call the “war on coal” is in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana, a sparsely populated section of the Great Plains with the nation's largest coal mines. It's also home to a massive power plant in Colstrip, Montana, that emits more toxic air pollutants such as lead and arsenic than any other U.S. facility of its kind, according to the EPA. 

EPA rules finalized last year could force the Colstrip Generating Station to shut down or spend an estimated $400 million to clean up its emissions within the next several years. Another Biden-era proposal, from the Interior Department, would end new leasing of taxpayer-owned coal reserves in the Powder River Basin.

Trump vowed to reverse those actions and has named Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright to lead a new National Energy Dominance Council. The panel is tasked with driving up already record-setting domestic oil and gas production, as well as coal and other traditional energy sources.

The council has been granted sweeping authority over federal agencies involved in energy permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation and transportation. It has a mandate to cut bureaucratic red tape, enhance private sector investments and focus on innovation instead of “unnecessary regulation,” Trump said.

Zeldin meanwhile, has announced a series of actions to roll back environmental regulations, including rules on pollution from coal-fired power plants. In all, Zeldin said he's moving to roll back 31 environmental rules, including a scientific finding that has long been the central basis for U.S. action against climate change.

Industry groups praised Trump's focus on coal.

“Despite countless warnings from the nation's grid operators and energy regulators that we are facing an electricity supply crisis, the last administration's energy policies were built on hostility to fossil fuels, directly targeting coal,'' said Rich Nolan, president and CEO of the National Mining Association.

Trump's executive actions “clearly prioritize how to responsibly keep the lights on, recognize the enormous strategic value of American-mined coal and embrace the economic opportunity that comes from American energy abundance,” Nolan said.

But environmental groups said Trump's actions were more of the same tactics he tried during his first term in an unsuccessful bid to revive coal.

“What's next, a mandate that Americans must commute by horse and buggy?” asked Kit Kennedy, managing director for power at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“Coal plants are old and dirty, uncompetitive and unreliable,” Kennedy said, accusing Trump and his administration of remaining “stuck in the past, trying to make utility customers pay more for yesterday's energy.”

Instead, she said, the U.S. should do all it can to build the power grid of the future, including tax credits and other support for renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The Ukrainian military has captured two Chinese men fighting alongside the Russian army in the eastern Donetsk region and has information that “significantly more” are with Russian forces, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced on Tuesday.

There was no immediate comment from China. Beijing is not known to have provided Russia with weapons or military expertise, and it was not clear whether the Chinese had joined the fight on their own initiative. Russia allows foreigners to enlist in its military, as does Ukraine.

Zelenskyy said he asked his top diplomat “to immediately contact Beijing.” He said China would be the third country to offer military support to Russia after Iran, which has supplied attack drones, and North Korea, which has supplied soldiers, according to American and South Korean officials.

China has provided strong diplomatic support for Russia since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022. Beijing has also offered an economic lifeline through the trade in energy and consumer goods.

Zelenskyy said a clash with Chinese soldiers occurred near the villages of Tarasivka and Bilohorivka in Donetsk, where six Chinese military personnel engaged Ukrainian troops. Two Chinese were taken prisoner, Zelenskyy said.

Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Andrii Sybiha, said his ministry summoned China's chargé d'affaires to demand an explanation, saying on X that “Chinese citizens fighting as part of Russia's invasion army in Ukraine puts into question China's declared stance for peace and undermines Beijing's credibility as a responsible permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.”




Russia has effectively rejected a U.S. proposal for an immediate and full 30-day halt in the fighting in Ukraine, and both sides are believed to be readying a spring-summer campaign on the battlefield.

“I cannot see any indications that would lead to a ceasefire or even a peace, but I see many indications (for) the continuation of the war,” Nico Lange, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis in Washington, said in an analysis Monday.

Zelenskyy spoke at a news conference in Kyiv alongside visiting Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever, who announced a 1 billion euro ($1 billion) aid package for Ukraine this year. Ukraine's president said they discussed joint military manufacturing efforts and Belgian private investment in Ukraine's defense sector.

Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russian Foreign Ministry officials will take part in talks with the U.S. in Istanbul planned for Thursday.

He didn't say what the talks would be about, but the foreign ministry's involvement suggests it is another round of talks about normalizing their respective embassies' operations and increasing staff numbers after years of expelling each other's diplomats.

President Donald Trump launched a broadside against longtime foe Adam Schiff, calling him 'corrupt.'

Sen. Adam Schiff fired back late Tuesday after President Donald Trump mocked the California Democrat during a black-tie Republican dinner in Washington, D.C.

""The President of the United States seems oddly focused on me,"" Schiff posted after footage of Trump's jokes made the rounds.

""Shouldn't he be focused on the economy he's crashing?"" he wrote.

During the event hosted by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) – the House Republicans' campaign arm – Trump wove in a few insults about the Boston-born Angeleno's appearance into a verbal indictment of his role in the 2016 Russia collusion investigation.

KASH PATEL ENRAGES ADAM SCHIFF IN CLINTONIAN BATTLE OVER THE WORD ‘WE'

""Adam ‘Schifty' Schiff – can you believe this guy?"" Trump said. ""He's got the smallest neck I've ever seen – and the biggest head: We call him Watermelon-Head."" Trump went on to ruminate about how Schiff's ""big fat face"" could ""stand on a neck"" the size of the president's finger. 

""It's the weirdest thing – it's a mystery; no one can understand it.""

Trump went on to call Schiff ""one of the most dishonest human beings I've ever seen,"" and wondered aloud how people like Schiff could be able to run for office.

FLASHBACK: SCHIFF, WHO REPEATEDLY CLAIMED EVIDENCE OF RUSSIAN COLLUSION, DENOUNCES DURHAM REPORT AS ‘FLAWED'

""He was in charge of the fake witch hunt – with 'Russia, Russia, Russia' – it was a made-up story,"" he said, playing off the ""Brady Bunch"" line ""Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.""

In 2020, Schiff managed the House's impeachment probe into Trump, leading off his opening remarks that January by comparing former Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton's 1792 warning to then-President George Washington about future American leaders who would rise to the executive ""despotic in [their] ordinary demeanor.""

""When a man unprincipled in private life desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper, possessed of considerable talents, having the advantage of military habits… known to have scoffed in private at the principles of liberty—when such a man is seen to mount the hobby horse of popularity—to join in the cry of danger to liberty—to take every opportunity of embarrassing the General Government & bringing it under suspicion—to flatter and fall in with all the nonsense of the zealots of the day—It may justly be suspected that his object is to throw things into confusion that he may ‘ride the storm and direct the whirlwind,"" Schiff said at the time.

Since then, he and Trump have often traded criticisms, with Trump also referring to him in the past as a ""structural marvel,"" with an appearance like a ""finger on a basketball.""

In October, Trump compared Schiff to the ""enemy from within"" and called him a ""sleazebag"" on FOX Business before lamenting that the Democrat would likely defeat former MLB star Steve Garvey for California's open U.S. Senate seat.

For his part, Schiff has also clapped back at Republicans for their criticisms – responding in July to a report that now-Vice President JD Vance had lamented campaign name-calling after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called the GOP ticket ""weird.""

""Shifty Schiff, pencil neck and watermelon head, would like a word, JD,"" Schiff responded at the time on Facebook.

Fox News Digital reached out to Schiff for additional comment but did not immediately hear back.

‘All-Star' panelists Marc Thiessen, Susan Page and Sabrina Singh discuss how the Supreme Court decided that President Donald Trump's deportation measures were allowed under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act on ‘Special Report.

FIRST ON FOX: Venezuelan opposition leader and U.S.-recognized President-elect Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia promised to offer ""reparations"" to Laken Riley's family and other Americans affected by the crimes of street gang Tren de Aragua. 

In a letter to Riley's family, González and fellow opposition leader María Corina Machado wrote, ""Laken's life, full of potential and promise, was tragically cut short by an individual who should have never been allowed to cross your border.""

Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with González and Machado in January, reaffirming that Urrutia is the ""legitimate president"" of Venezuela. The Biden administration had previously referred to Urrutia as the ""president-elect"" before leaving office.

In their letter, the opposition leaders called Riley's murder a ""direct consequence of Nicolás Maduro's regime, which has fostered an environment where criminal organizations like Tren de Aragua can flourish with impunity.""

Urrutia vowed that, if officially installed as president, he would ""hold accountable all those responsible for the devastation they have wrought, both within Venezuela and internationally.""

""We intend to establish a comprehensive framework for reparations, both for the countless Venezuelans harmed by this narco-state and also for victims abroad, including your family.""

Gonzales also noted that the ""vast majority of Venezuelans who have sought safety in the United States are committed to upholding the law and contributing to your nation's economy and society.""

""They long for the day they can return home to reunite with their families and work toward a free and prosperous Venezuela. We look forward to welcoming them back,"" they added. 

""Please accept this letter as a message of our deepest condolence and a solemn promise: Laken will never be forgotten. She will be remembered as an innocent victim of tyranny and a powerful catalyst for the change we are determined to bring about.""

The Trump administration was allowed to move forward with a plan to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime immigration law dating back to 1798, to immediately deport Venezuelan nationals believed to be affiliated with Tren de Aragua. Legal battles over the deportation effort intensified when a federal district court temporarily blocked the policy – prompting Trump allies to call for the impeachment of Judge James Boasberg.

According to United Nations estimates, roughly 7.7 million Venezuelans have fled the country over the past decade, escaping economic collapse marked by hyperinflation, which peaked at 130,000% in 2018, and widespread poverty.

Since taking power in 2013, Nicolás Maduro's regime has been plagued by allegations of corruption, authoritarianism, money laundering and drug trafficking. While many nations recognized González's election victory in July, Maduro has refused to relinquish power.

Maduro has issued an arrest warrant for González, who fled into exile in Spain last September.

Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student, was killed while jogging on the University of Georgia campus in February 2024. The suspect, José Ibarra – a Venezuelan national who entered the U.S. illegally – was arrested and charged with her murder. The killing sparked nationwide outrage and led to new immigration legislation that Trump signed into law shortly after taking office this year.

Fox News' Bryan Llenas has the latest developments on the nursing home industry after losing 15% of its workforce. 

A federal judge in Texas threw out a national mandate on nursing home staffing from the Biden era. 

On Monday, U.S. District Judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk sided with nursing homes regarding a rule that would have required them to add nurses to meet minimum staffing to patient ratios.

""The agency lacks authority to eliminate consideration of a facility's nursing ‘needs' when prescribing minimum staffing standards,"" Kacsmaryk wrote, referring to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

The plaintiffs, the American Health Care Association (AHCA), represented ""approximately 15,000 nursing homes and long term care facilities across the country that provide care to approximately five million people each year,"" according to a media release. VP VANCE BLASTS MCCONNELL'S VOTE AGAINST TRUMP PENTAGON NOMINEE: 'POLITICAL PETTINESS'

""This unrealistic staffing mandate threatened to close nursing homes and displace vulnerable seniors,"" Clif Porter, president and CEO of AHCA and the National Center for Assisted Living, said in a statement. ""The court decision not only upholds the rule of law and balance of powers, but it protects access to care for our aging population.""

Porter is now calling on Congress to act, but says that ""federal policymakers should not be dictating staffing hours but encouraging innovation and high-quality outcomes. The staffing mandate is a 20th Century solution that should be blocked by Congress once and for all.""

In the U.S., ""97.8% of nursing homes participate in Medicare and 95.4% participate in Medicaid,"" Judge Kacsmaryk wrote in the ruling, meaning they must meet a ""consolidated set of regulations.""

""As we have said from the beginning, nursing homes would love to hire more nurses and caregivers, and despite limited resources, we are doing everything within our power to grow our workforce,"" AHCA's Porter said in a statement.

""Even prior to the introduction of the staffing mandate, AHCA was offering federal policymakers a variety of workforce solutions that would help build a pipeline of new caregivers, attract them to long term care, and develop their skills and career,"" he said.

The ‘Fox & Friends Weekend' hosts react to a surprising new poll showing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., with a potential lead over Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in a Democratic primary matchup.

Business tycoon Elon Musk floated the idea that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is somehow profiting off of government fraud, though the lawmaker has pushed back.

""Chuck, I'm starting to think you're getting a piece of the action with the government fraud. But no, that couldn't possibly be the reason, could it?"" Musk posted early Tuesday morning.

Musk, who has been spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) effort to expose waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government, made the comment in response to a Monday post in which Schumer accused DOGE of ""sabotaging"" Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid — the post reflected sentiments Schumer had conveyed during a Senate speech.

Schumer fired back in response to Musk's suggestion he could be benefiting from government fraud.

""Another Elon lie. He wants you to think anyone who dares to stand up to him is committing fraud, meanwhile he's taking tens of billions from the government,"" Schumer declared in a post on Tuesday.

Early Tuesday morning, Musk fired off a response to a post in which Schumer suggested that Musk is slashing Social Security benefits.

""Make no mistake: What Elon Musk is doing at Social Security is cutting benefits,"" Schumer said in a post on Monday, which echoed his speech. 

""The intern running Schumer's social media account is lying,"" Musk shot back Tuesday on X.

During the speech, Schumer claimed that ""Elon Musk is cutting Social Security benefits.""

""When offices close down, when websites crash, when phone lines shut off, that's no different than cutting benefits,"" Schumer said.

The Village of Dolton has been served a subpoena seeking records tied to a land development allegedly linked to Mayor Tiffany Henyards boyfriend. (WFLD)

The final days of Dolton Mayor Tiffany Henyard's term appear to be unfolding with less acrimony than the controversies that marked much of her tenure in office.

The scandal-plagued and self-described ""super mayor,"" a Democrat, failed to show up for her final village board meeting on Monday, marking her fourth consecutive absence, according to reports.  

Henyard lost her bid for reelection in February when she was defeated in a landslide by Jason House, who campaigned on transparency and reform, promising a ""clean house"" and to bring accountability back to Dolton government. House then swept the April 1 election with 95% of the vote over Independent candidate Casundra Hopson-Jordan.

FEDS SUBPOENA DOLTON, ILLINOIS RECORDS TIED TO OUSTED 'SUPER MAYOR' TIFFANY HENYARD'S BOYFRIEND

House, who will be inaugurated on May 5, said audits for the 2023 and 2024 fiscal years will be conducted over the next four months over concerns about financial mismanagement, the Chicago Tribune reports. Since Henyard took office, the village has been delinquent in filing annual financial reports and audits with the state comptroller's office.

Henyard's tenure has brought national attention to the small Chicago suburb for all the wrong reasons. 

In April 2024, the FBI served subpoenas at Dolton Village Hall amid allegations of corruption among officials. Henyard was not served.

DOLTON MAYOR TIFFANY HENYARD FOUND IN CONTEMPT OF COURT AFTER ALLEGEDLY STONEWALLING LIQUOR LICENSES

A town meeting two months later descended into chaos when her opponents and supporters clashed after Dolton trustees voted to reinstate former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot to investigate Henyard. Residents accused her of using village funds as her own piggy bank by billing taxpayers thousands of dollars for her hair and makeup team as well as going on a lavish trip to Las Vegas.

The town had previously hired Lightfoot to look into Henyard, but the Dolton mayor vetoed the move. Henyard also previously vetoed the board's request to launch a federal investigation into gathering information on her alleged spending and financial mismanagement.

Henyard has been dubbed the ""worst mayor in America"" by critics, and has also come under fire for an alleged sexual assault by one of her allies during the Vegas trip, where the alleged victim claims to have been fired after speaking out. Henyard's cancer charity is also facing scrutiny.

A federal subpoena was signed on Feb. 25, the day Henyard lost the mayoral primary in Dolton, as authorities pursue a criminal investigation tied to the ousted mayor. The subpoena is tied to a development project involving land once reportedly owned by Henyard's boyfriend, FOX 32 Chicago reported.

Meanwhile, Dolton trustee Andrew Holmes, a Henyard ally, was also a no-show for Monday's meeting, with some residents saying he hasn't turned up in months. The new administration wants to look into why Holmes is still getting paid even though he is not showing up to village meetings, CBS reports.

Henyard also serves as supervisor for Thornton Township Supervisor, one of the 29 townships in Cook County, Illinois, with Dolton being located in Thornton Township.

She was defeated in her bid for reelection for supervisor by Illinois state Senator Napoleon Harris.

In January, Henyard was seen on video jumping into a chaotic brawl that broke out between her boyfriend and an activist who called her a ""b----"" during a heated Thornton Township Board of Trustees meeting.

After months of slamming Elon Musk as a threat, Democrats are refusing to say whether their inflammatory rhetoric is to blame for the attacks against Tesla owners and dealers across the country.

A spate of violent incidents targeting Tesla car owners, dealerships, charging stations and Republicans in general have been a common occurrence since President Donald Trump took office, compelling some GOP lawmakers to take certain safety measures.

The pattern of violent incidents comes after a new report from the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI), which found that increasingly violent rhetoric online is becoming more normalized than ever. NCRI's findings showed that more than half of left-leaning respondents said killing Trump would be at least ""somewhat justified.""

The increased normalization of violent rhetoric was exhibited in audio recordings of voice mails and handwritten letters sent to GOP North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis.

""Thom Tillis, afraid of death threats? Then get the f--- out of office,"" a caller said in a voicemail sent to the senator's office. In an unsigned letter sent to Tillis, his staffers were referred to as ""sacrificial lambs"" who ""signed up to be [Tillis's] shield.""

Citing the uptick in ""Democrat threats of violence,"" GOP Wyoming Rep. Harriet Hageman moved all of her in-person town halls online. The move came after an incident in which an attendee of one of her town halls followed Hageman as she left and initiated a physical confrontation with her staff, eventually requiring police to intervene. Tillis has similarly taken certain steps to protect his staff, telling them to telework on days when there could be trouble. 

AMERICANS HAVE BECOME ‘DESENSITIZED' TO POLITICAL VIOLENCE, SAYS BRIANNA LYMAN

""What was formerly taboo culturally has become acceptable,"" Joel Finkelstein, lead author of the NCRI report, told Fox News Digital. ""We are seeing a clear shift – glorification, increased attempts and changing norms – all converging into what we define as ‘assassination culture.'""

These new rhetorical norms have translated into significant real-life violence, including just a few days ago at the New Mexico GOP's headquarters in Albuquerque. 

Suspects set the building on fire using incendiary devices, and they spray-painted the words ""ICE = KKK"" across the side of the building. An investigation into the incident, which did not result in any injuries, was initiated after the incident. So far, no arrests have been publicly reported.

Meanwhile, Tesla owners, show rooms and charging stations have been targets of political violence as agitators find ways to challenge CEO Elon Musk and the Trump administration's attempts to reform the government.

Outside Portland, Oregon, a man was arrested for setting a Tesla dealership on fire using Molotov cocktails and then returning the next day to fire more than a dozen bullets into the same showroom. The shooting was the second time in a week that someone opened fire on the Tesla dealership, damaging windows and vehicles but not hurting anyone.

In Boston, seven Tesla charging stations were engulfed in an intentionally set blaze, while in Las Vegas a fire caused numerous Teslas to explode. According to witness reports, the suspect in the Las Vegas arson also fired shots at the dealership and spray-painted the word ""Resist"" across the dealership's front entrance.

Meanwhile, in addition to attacks on Tesla businesses and charging stations, individuals who simply own a Tesla have also been victims of attacks spurred by anti-Musk and anti-Trump sentiment. 

In New York City, vandals targeted multiple Tesla vehicles parked around the city, etching swastikas and the word ""Nazi"" on their passenger-side doors.

The attacks on Tesla vehicles haven't only been when they are vacant either. 

DEMS HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY CAPTIVATED BY ‘FAR-LEFT LUNATICS,' SAYS KAROLINE LEAVITT

Multiple videos of Tesla drivers getting forcibly stopped in the middle of the road and accosted have surfaced on social media. In Seattle, a woman driving a Tesla was cut off by a masked driver on her way to a doctor's appointment before he got out of his car and accosted the woman for owning a Tesla. The driver indicated to local news that the incident made her scared to drive her Tesla.

NCRI's survey found that in addition to a majority of left-leaning respondents justifying violent political attacks against Trump, about 40% also agreed it was justifiable to destroy Tesla dealerships. 

""Property destruction wasn't just an outlier opinion, it clustered tightly with support for political assassinations and other forms of violence,"" Finkelstein said. ""This points to a coherent belief system, not just isolated grievances.""

DEM SENATOR WHO DITCHED TESLA TO PROTEST MUSK REFUSES TO CALL VIOLENCE AGAINST CARS ‘DOMESTIC TERRORISM'

In this chart, more than half of left-leaning respondents said killing Donald Trump would be at least ""somewhat justified,"" according to NCRI's national survey. The study found that 55% of self-identified left-of-center participants justified Trump's assassination to some degree, while 48% did the same for Elon Musk. Researchers say the findings reflect a growing tolerance for political violence among ideological extremists. (Network Contagion Research Institute)

Last week, GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., introduced a resolution in the House of Representatives that attempts to get every Democrat on the record over whether they condemn the violent acts or not. 

While some Democrats have condemned acts of vandalism against Tesla, they have refrained from labeling it ""domestic terrorism."" Additionally, a forceful condemnation from Democrat leadership has yet to surface.

""My House Resolution will make clear where all members of Congress stand,"" Boebert said after she introduced the resolution. ""Do they condemn domestic terrorism against Tesla or do they endorse it completely? The American people deserve to know where their representatives stand when it comes to condemning domestic terrorism.""

Atlas robot by Boston Dynamics amazes tech expert Kurt Knutsson with its breakdancing moves.

Boston Dynamics is at it again, wowing us with some seriously cool robotic moves. Their latest video of Atlas, their bipedal robot, has blown up online with its mind-blowing human-like movements, including breakdancing. These impressive moves are the result of a collaboration between Boston Dynamics and the Robotics and AI Institute.

Breakdancing, including the famous ""coffee grinder"" move, is just one of the many impressive feats Atlas can perform. The robot now demonstrates an impressive range of movements that would make even the most seasoned breakdancers envious, such as crawling on all fours with surprising agility, executing forward rolls and cartwheels and performing handstands. It's clear that Atlas is no longer just a walking, talking machine. It's becoming a breakdancer.

CHINA'S TRON 1 ROBOT HURDLES OVER OBSTACLES LIKE IT'S NOTHING

The secret behind Atlas' slick moves lies in the combination of reinforcement learning and motion capture technology. Human dancers perform movements while wearing motion capture suits, and this data is fed into Atlas' learning model. Through reinforcement learning, Atlas practices and refines these movements, allowing it to mimic human actions with uncanny accuracy. The result is a robot that can bust a move like a pro.

SCARY AI-POWERED SWARM ROBOTS TEAM UP TO BUILD CARS FASTER THAN EVER

The latest fully electric version of Atlas features impressive specifications. Standing at 4 feet 11 inches tall and weighing 196 pounds, this agile robot can reach a top speed of 5.6 mph (approximately 8.2 feet per second). Atlas boasts 28 degrees of freedom, allowing for complex movements and maneuvers.

It's equipped with advanced lidar and stereo vision sensors for precise environmental awareness. Unlike its hydraulic predecessors, this version is powered by a fully electric system with all-electric actuators. At its core, Atlas runs on a custom control and computing system, enabling its remarkable performance and adaptability. This new generation of Atlas is stronger and more dexterous than its predecessors, with a broader range of motion that sometimes exceeds human capabilities.

CHINESE ROBOT'S KUNG FU MOVES WILL MAKE YOUR JAW DROP

While Boston Dynamics doesn't publicly disclose the exact cost of Atlas, industry experts estimate that each unit costs between $500,000 to $1 million to produce as of 2025. This high price tag reflects the cutting-edge technology, advanced materials and countless hours of research and development that go into creating such a sophisticated robot. However, as with most technologies, the cost is expected to decrease over time as production scales up and technologies mature.

It's worth noting that Atlas is primarily a research platform and is not currently available for commercial purchase. Instead, Boston Dynamics leases these robots to select partners for research and development purposes, with annual leasing costs estimated to be in the six-figure range.

While watching a robot breakdance is undeniably cool, the implications of this technology go far beyond entertainment. The agility and adaptability demonstrated by Atlas could have significant real-world applications, such as emergency response and search and rescue operations or assisting in environments designed for humans. In fact, Atlas has been trialed in Hyundai Motor Group's vehicle factory since late 2024, potentially revolutionizing manufacturing processes.

As we watch Atlas effortlessly spin and cartwheel, it's hard not to be amazed at how far robotics has come. From clunky, barely mobile machines to smooth operators that can outperform humans in certain tasks, the progress is nothing short of miraculous. While we may not see breakdancing robots on every street corner just yet, Atlas' latest performance gives us a glimpse into a future where the line between human and machine movement becomes increasingly blurred.

Fox News contributor Ben Domenech and founder of Rebelle Communications Laura Fink join 'MediaBuzz' to discuss the media's criticism of President Donald Trump's tariffs as the markets plunge. 

What's most striking about President Trump's tariff war is that he's being pressured by some of his closest advisers and supporters to end the crusade that has upended the world economy.

It's not just media conservatives like Ben Shapiro, Rich Lowry, Ben Domenech and the Wall Street Journal editorial page. It's longtime wealthy donors like Ken Langone, co-founder of Home Depot, who denounced the tariffs and cited the 46% levy on Vietnam as an example of ""bulls---,"" telling the Financial Times that ""right now what everybody's terrified of is a trade war."" 

Another billionaire, hedge fund investor Bill Ackman, said, ""The consequences for our country and the millions of citizens who have supported the president…are going to be severely negative."" Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan, said ""whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth.""

WHITE HOUSE SAYS BEIJING MISSED DEADLINE TO LIFT RETALIATORY TARIFFS, US TO HIKE CHINA TARIFFS TO 104%

The most famous defector is Elon Musk, who, according to the Washington Post, privately urged Trump not to go ahead with the sky-high tariffs. Now, he's gone public.

""Ideally, both Europe and the United States should move to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and North America."" Even the world's richest man and chief budget cutter couldn't convince the boss, and he is off the reservation.  

Musk is also taking shots at the strongest tariff booster in the White House, Peter Navarro, calling him ""truly a moron,"" ""dumber than a sack of bricks,"" and, in a particularly juvenile jab, ""Peter Navarrdo.""

In addition to sounding off against President Donald Trump's tariffs, Elon Musk, right, has thrown a few rhetorical punches at the staunchly pro-tariff Peter Navarro. (AP)

The aforementioned Navarro, you'll be happy to hear, went on Fox and guaranteed there will be no recession. So you can all resume regular breathing.

It doesn't help Trump that after the early rebound rally yesterday ran out of gas, the Dow dropped another 320 points, after a dramatic decline that has decimated people's stock holdings and 401-Ks. The Constitution, by the way, says Congress is in charge of tariffs.

Almost no one is safe, including Bibi Netanyahu, who came to the White House on Monday in a ring-kissing gesture, has imposed no levies on the U.S. but still got hit with a 17% tariff. Against Israel, our chief ally in the Middle East and the region's only democracy?

And the escalation with China, our biggest adversary, was predictable. Trump had hit Beijing with a 54% tariff (including an earlier 20% levy). Beijing hit back, as promised, with a 34% tariff on U.S. goods, battling what it calls blackmail. 

Wouldn't we have done the exact same thing if the roles were reversed?

But Trump acted as though he was personally insulted, and is now vowing an additional 50% tariff on the Chinese. This is how trade wars spiral out of control. And China has cut off negotiations on the sale of TikTok to an American owner.   

Media blunders also fueled the market's volatility. On Monday, Bloomberg – that is, someone identified as Walter Bloomberg, not connected to any news outlet – posted this: ""HASSETT: TRUMP IS CONSIDERING A 90-DAY PAUSE IN TARIFFS FOR ALL COUNTRIES EXCEPT CHINA.""

Media blunders – including one claiming Kevin Hassett, director of the White House economic council, said Trump was considering a 90-day tariff pause – only exacerbated market volatility. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images)

This goosed the stock market. Except that Kevin Hassett, director of the White House economic council, never said that. 

But CNBC morning anchor Carl Quintanilla told viewers, ""I think we can go with this headline. Apparently, Hassett's been saying that Trump will consider a 90-day pause in tariffs for all countries except for China.""

Reuters then ran with this headline: ""Wall Street reverses course after Hassett's comments on tariff pause.""

What Hassett actually said, when asked on Fox if Trump would consider a 90-day tariff pause, ""I think the president is gonna decide what the president is gonna decide."" Not exactly the same thing. But the market shot up.

The wire service later admitted the mistake. ""Reuters has withdrawn the incorrect report and regrets its error.""

TRUMP, EYEING 3RD TERM, KEEPS ATTACKING ELITE INSTITUTIONS – AND MANY ARE CAVING

A CNBC spokeswoman said later, ""As we were chasing the news of the market moves in real-time, we aired unconfirmed information in a banner. Our reporters quickly made a correction on air.""

Meghan McCain posted a broader swipe against the media. ""There are so many hypocritical talking heads on TV saying they don't care about losing money or being in financial pain for a while. Most of you are married to finance bros, come from rich families or have huge media contracts. You have a cushion…

""One of my best friends buys her groceries for her family based on what coupons each store has. I assure you a possible recession or huge rise in prices everywhere will be a different experience for her family than you.""

Is there an exit ramp? White House officials say 70 countries have been in touch, seeking a negotiated settlement. Some, of course, were doing that in the run-up to ""Liberation Day."" The president could reach many of the settlements, declare victory and credit his tariff war.

At the moment, he shows no inclination to do that, having pushed the tariff idea since the 1980s and repeatedly promising such an approach during last year's campaign.

Mark Longo, owner of Peanut the squirrel, and his attorney Nora Marino join ‘Fox News Live' to discuss their legal action against the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation after authorities raided Longo's home and seized his pet.

New York Republicans are pushing a new law to protect animals after a beloved pet squirrel and internet star named P'Nut was taken and killed by state environmental officers late last year.

The bill, called ""Peanut's Law: The Humane Animal Protection Act,"" would require a 72-hour waiting period before the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) can euthanize any seized animal. It would also give animal owners the chance for a hearing before the state takes or puts down their animals.

P'Nut and another pet squirrel named Fred were taken from Mark and Daniela Longo's upstate farm last October after someone filed an anonymous complaint. Both animals were killed and tested for rabies, and both tests came back negative. The squirrel had a huge following on social media, with P'Nut accruing nearly one million followers to watch content of the critter and his family.OWNERS OF BELOVED PEANUT THE SQUIRREL PLAN TO SUE NEW YORK STATE OVER SEIZURE AND KILLING BY AUTHORITIES

Once news spread on P'Nut's Instagram page, backlash over DEC's actions spread like wildfire online. At the time, everyone from Elon Musk to President Trump weighed in on the killing of the dear family pets.Musk referred to the killing back in November as ""the whole squirrel thing"" while on Joe Rogan's podcast.

Assemblyman Jake Blumencranz (R-Nassau), who is sponsoring the bill, said it's about fairness. ""This is about due process,"" he said, adding that animals should not be killed unless they're an immediate danger.

The Longos, who run an animal sanctuary, say they were never told why their pets were taken. They hope the new bill will stop similar cases from happening again. Mark Longo said of the new bill: ""I sit here trying not to cry, but passing this law will be a movement to make sure that animal rights are not overlooked anymore.""Peanut or ""P'Nut"" was only a baby when the Longos rescued him. The squirrel adapted to his adoptive human family after his real mother was run over by a car when he was just five weeks old.

""They were not dangerous. They were not sick. They were not wild threats roaming the streets,"" said Assemblyman Blumencranz. ""They were rescues — loved, nurtured, and safe."" 

Supporters of the legislation say it's a common-sense move to protect both animals and their owners.

""Here is the cold, hard truth. It is too little, too late. Words don't save P'Nut and Fred, and words won't save the next animal, or the next family, unless we change the law.""An attorney who represents the Longo family did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Fox News correspondent CB Cotton has the latest on the halting of research grants on 'America Reports.'

The Department of Commerce on Tuesday announced its decision to cut $4 million in funding related to climate research for Princeton University.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a news release the cuts were made ""after a detailed, careful, and thorough review of the Department's financial assistance programs against the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) current program objectives.""

The department added that the termination of these funds from Princeton, effective June 30, ""will streamline and reduce the cost and size of the Federal Government, consistent with President Trump's promise for his Administration. The Department of Commerce is delivering on that promise.""

Princeton received $455 million in federal funding during fiscal year 2024.

The department said the financial awards previously given to Princeton through NOAA, including the Cooperative Institute for Modeling the Earth System (CIMES), ""are no longer aligned with the program objectives of NOAA, a sub-agency of the Department of Commerce, and are no longer in keeping with the Trump administration's priorities.""

Princeton did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Fox News Digital.

The CIMES website states that the program ""has contributed to the development of oceanic and atmospheric models, performed research on climate and biogeochemical cycling and educated several generations of postdoctoral researchers and graduate students.""

The commerce department, however, said the CIMES agreement ""promotes exaggerated and implausible climate threats, contributing to a phenomenon known as ‘climate anxiety,' which has increased significantly among America's youth.""

The department further stated that the Climate Risks and Interactive Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Predictability agreement ""suggests that the Earth will have a significant fluctuation in its water availability as a result of global warming,"" and the Advancing Prediction agreement ""has used its resources to assess risks associated with climate change, including alleged changes to precipitation patterns and sea-level rise,"" according to the release.

""It also aims to address coastal inundation while other more targeted research efforts are addressing this issue,"" the release continues.

The department said the administration's goal in terminating these funds will save U.S. taxpayer dollars, and it will ""continue to review its outstanding cooperative agreements, grant awards, and other financial assistance on an individualized basis to avoid wasteful governmental spending — whether they be to Princeton or any other recipient.""

Colleges and universities across the country have been on edge since Trump began investigating schools for alleged antisemitic discrimination and harassment, cutting federal funds for certain schools that allowed anti-Israel protests on campus since the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday blasted some Republican members of Congress for trying to block his powers on instituting tariffs.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday blasted some Republican members of Congress for trying to limit his presidential powers on instituting tariffs so that Congress could retake control.

Trump delivered a speech to the National Republican Congressional Committee, calling out ""rebel"" Republicans while speaking about his trade policies.

""And then I see some rebel Republican, some guy who wants to grandstand, say, 'I think that Congress should take over negotiations.' Let me tell you, you don't negotiate like I negotiate,"" Trump said.

Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., is leading a bipartisan bill to block Trump from instituting tariffs and retake that power for Congress. Bacon told reporters earlier on Tuesday that he didn't like ""the thought of waging a trade war with the entire world.""

In the Senate, a bipartisan group led by Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., is also introducing a resolution to repeal Trump's global tariffs. 

Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., have already introduced a bipartisan bill that would require the president to notify Congress about any new tariffs within 48 hours of imposition and require Congress to approve new tariffs within 60 days or allow them to expire.

Trump chewed out the Republicans over the proposed bills.

Trump said that even the talk around Capitol Hill about limiting his tariff powers ""hurts your negotiation,"" adding, ""And then the fake news wants to build it up, and it has no chance anyway.""

Babydog, the English bulldog of Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., made a surprise appearance at the Senate Agriculture Committee hearing, charming attendees and senators. (@BabydogJustice via X)

It was supposed to be a routine Senate Agriculture Committee hearing to consider nominees for top USDA posts, but one visitor turned the event into a tail-wagging affair.​

Babydog Justice, the beloved English bulldog of Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., made a surprise and highly photogenic appearance Tuesday as the committee met to review the nominations of Judge Stephen Vaden for Deputy Secretary of Agriculture and Tyler Clarkson for USDA General Counsel.​

The hearing may have been serious business, but Babydog's presence brought smiles, laughter, and even a little bipartisan levity.​

Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., couldn't resist the moment, joking, ""Babydog is the key to the West Virginia Senator's success,"" as Justice and his pup settled in.​BABYDOG BRIDGES 'PAWTISAN' DIVIDE IN THE SENATE ON SOCIAL MEDIA: 'SHE KNOWS NO POLITICAL BIAS'

The English bulldog's X account playfully captioned this photo, ""Is this thing on?"" after stealing the show at Tuesday's Agriculture Committee hearing. (@BabydogJustice via X)

Justice, who recently joined the Senate after serving as West Virginia's governor, shared an exclusive comment with Fox News Digital about his pup's Capitol Hill cameo.​

""I am so pleased to see the warm reception of Babydog from folks in Congress. Today she came along with me to the Agriculture Committee hearing and knew if she participated, there would be a treat as a reward. Senator Boozman took the time to introduce her to the committee, and contrary to what Senator Hoeven said in the hearing, she is not livestock or up for auction — even though she may resemble a little brown cow!"" Justice told Fox News Digital.​

At one point during the hearing, a comment by Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., sparked laughter when he joked about Babydog possibly being livestock — a suggestion Justice playfully refuted.​After holding up the pooch to the microphone and sharing how Babydog ""humanizes all of us,"" Justice requested a staffer remove the dog from his lap, adding, ""She's heavy!""

The social media response was swift. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins, who was confirmed earlier this year, reposted footage of Babydog in action, writing: ""We love you Babydog! Senate Ag is never the same when you're around.""SENATOR-ELECT JIM JUSTICE'S TEAM CLARIFIES REPORT CLAIMING FAMOUS POOCH BABYDOG BANNED FROM SENATE FLOOR

Even the Senate Agriculture Committee's own social media accounts joined the fun, posting behind-the-scenes content of the pup's visit and noting she was ""making new friends and monitoring policy.""​​Following her eventful day on Capitol Hill, Babydog Justice took to her own social media account. Posting a photo from the Senate Agriculture Committee hearing, she humorously captioned it, ""Is this thing on?"" in reference to the microphone. 

​Babydog's charm extended beyond the committee room, capturing the attention of senators in the halls of Congress. Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., shared a photo with Babydog, tweeting, ""All in favor of making @babydogjustice our 101st senator, say AYE!""

Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., also joined in, posting a picture of himself petting Babydog with the caption, ""@BabydogJustice is America's favorite dog.""

Babydog is no stranger to the spotlight. Born in 2019, the 60-pound English bulldog has been a fixture in Justice's political life since she was gifted to him by his children. She gained national attention during the COVID-19 pandemic when Justice launched the ""Do It for Babydog"" vaccine lottery to encourage West Virginians to get vaccinated.

Babydog's most famous public appearance was at the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where she charmed attendees and the media alike from a bulldog-sized chair on the main stage.While Babydog may have captured the spotlight, Justice is focused on the work ahead as a newly appointed member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. The West Virginia Republican has long emphasized the importance of supporting rural communities and strengthening the agricultural economy — key concerns in his home state.

Justice, a former two-term governor and lifelong farmer and businessman, has frequently spoken about the need for practical, common-sense solutions to issues like food security, rural development, and infrastructure investment. His role on the Agriculture Committee positions him to advocate for policies aligned with West Virginia's agricultural and economic interests.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

As Babydog continues to turn heads on Capitol Hill, Justice is expected to use his platform to advance those priorities with his four-legged sidekick never too far behind.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Microsoft mulls more job cuts, this time focused on managers and non-coders, not just low-performers, sources say","https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-mulls-more-job-cuts-managers-non-coders-2025-4","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Microsoft is considering another round of job cuts that could come as soon as May, according to people familiar with the matter.

Leaders on some Microsoft teams are specifically discussing cuts to middle managers and how to increase the ratio of coders versus non-coders on projects, the sources told Business Insider.

Some Microsoft organizations want to increase their ""span of control,"" or the number of employees who report to each manager, these people said.

The sources, who hold senior positions at the company, asked not to be identified discussing sensitive topics that are still in the planning stages. It's unclear how many jobs will be cut, but one of the people said it could be a significant portion of their team. A spokesperson for Microsoft declined to comment.

In the tech industry, there's already a culling of middle managers underway. Amazon has been trying to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers. And in December, CEO Sundar Pichai told staff that Google cut vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of an efficiency drive.

Inside Microsoft, the discussions focus on decreasing the ""PM ratio"" on some teams, which is the ratio of product managers or program managers to engineers.

Charlie Bell, Microsoft's security boss, brought this concept from Amazon, where he was a cloud pioneer. There, it's called the ""builder ratio,"" and tracks the ratio of software engineers to ""non-builders,"" such as program managers and project managers.

Microsoft is considering increasing these targets in some organizations. For example, Bell's security organization currently has around 5½ engineers to one PM, and his goal is to reach a 10-to-1 ratio, according to a person familiar with Bell's plans.

One of the people familiar with the matter said this ratio is basically a proxy for how many people code. The company is discussing cuts that would require managers to meet a certain budget and a specific team-based ratio, the person said.

Earlier this year, Microsoft ousted about 2,000 employees it deemed to be low performers.

The potential cuts could come in a month or so and also include lower performers. One person said that at least some Microsoft leaders are considering terminating those who received an ""Impact 80"" or lower score in performance reviews for two consecutive years.

Microsoft evaluates employees on a scale of 0 to 200 called the ""ManageRewards slider."" Those ratings influence how much an employee receives in stock awards and cash bonuses.

The middle of the range is 100, while 0, 60, and 80 are lower performers and 120, 140, and 200 are higher performers. ""Impact 80"" gives employees 60% of their normal stock award and 80% of their maximum bonus.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Trump says he told Taiwan's TSMC he'd slap a 100% tax on it if it didn't make its chips in the US","https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-threatened-tsmc-100-percent-tax-make-chips-in-us-2025-4","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 06:00:00 GMT","

President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he threatened Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company with a ""big tax"" of up to 100% if the chipmaker didn't build its plants in America.

Trump was speaking at a dinner event organized by the National Republican Congressional Committee when he criticized the bipartisan CHIPS Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022.

""These chip companies are loaded. They give these companies billions of dollars to build a plant in the United States. They don't build them in the US,"" Trump said Tuesday.

The Biden administration said in November that it had awarded TSMC up to $6.6 billion in funding to build three chip factories in Phoenix. TSMC's first factory in Phoenix faced construction delays initially but started producing chips last year.

Last month, TSMC said it would invest $100 billion to build five new chip factories in the US. The company said the investment was on top of the $65 billion it announced in April 2024.

Trump said on Tuesday that he'd convinced TSMC to deepen its manufacturing footprint in the US without offering more funding.

""All I did is say, 'If you don't build your plant here, you are going to pay a big tax. Twenty-five, maybe 50, maybe 75, maybe 100%,'"" Trump said.

TSMC declined to comment when approached by Business Insider.

Trump has threatened companies with tariffs in the past. While on the campaign trail in September, Trump said he'd impose a 200% tariff on John Deere if the agriculture equipment company moved its manufacturing to Mexico.

Last week, Trump announced a slate of reciprocal tariffs on more than 180 countries. The tariffs, which start at a baseline rate of 10%, took effect on Wednesday.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Thursday that while the tariffs didn't apply to semiconductors, Trump was still thinking about how he could restore the US's foothold in chip making.

""Donald Trump's going to deeply study those. And those are going to come later on how to reshore from Taiwan all that semiconductor manufacturing,"" Lutnick said. ""We have to protect ourselves at some point. America has to be able to protect itself.""

Representatives for the White House didn't respond to a request for comment.

In the days since President Donald Trump unveiled his ""reciprocal"" tariffs on dozens of trading partners, affected nations have announced a range of reactions.

Some countries, like China, have already set countermeasures to Trump's tariffs, while others are looking to negotiate exemptions.

Here's how governments around the world are reacting to Trump's tariffs now that they've officially started.

Two days after Trump announced his tariffs, China struck back, announcing it would implement 34% retaliatory tariffs on all US imports.

China's Ministry of Commerce also placed 11 US companies on an ""unreliable entities"" list, effectively blocking them from conducting business in the country.

""China urges the United States to immediately lift its unilateral tariff measures and resolve its trade differences through consultations in an equal, respectful, and mutually beneficial manner,"" the ministry said in a statement.

On Monday, Trump said he'd impose an additional 50% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China's retaliatory tariffs.

Trump has so far imposed 104% tariffs on China since he took office.

And on Wednesday, China once again pushed back against the president by raising levies on US goods to 84%.

In February, China implemented a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, pickup trucks, and some large cars. China also imposed a 15% levy on coal and liquefied natural gas.

For months, Trump has threatened to annex Canada as part of his push to make it the 51st US state. He's threatened Canada with an array of tariffs, stunning government officials and residents who have long enjoyed a mostly conciliatory relationship with the US.

In March, Trump set 25% tariffs on Canadian goods that weren't compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, prompting an outcry from Canada, which retaliated by placing a 25% tariff on select US goods.

On April 3, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced his country would impose a 25% tariff on vehicles imported from the US that aren't USMCA-compliant.

Canada was spared further levies from the US last week.

Trump announced last week that Australia would be subject to the administration's 10% baseline tariff rate. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese responded swiftly.

""The [US] administration's tariffs have no basis in logic — and they go against the basis of our two nations' partnership,"" he told reporters on April 3. ""This is not the act of a friend.""

Albanese said Australia didn't plan to retaliate with reciprocal tariffs on US goods.

""We will not join a race to the bottom that leads to higher prices and slower growth,"" he said.

On Tuesday, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia forcefully pushed back against Trump's tariff on Australia during a hearing with US trade representative Jamieson Greer.

""We have a trade surplus with Australia,"" Warner said during the heated exchange. ""They are an incredibly important national security partner. Why were they whacked with a tariff?""

Trump imposed 20% tariffs on imports from the EU.

The EU on Wednesday responded to the administration by approving tariffs on roughly $23 billion worth of US goods.

""These countermeasures can be suspended at any time, should the US agree to a fair and balanced negotiated outcome,"" the European Commission said in a statement.

On April 5, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the face of the White House DOGE Office and a political ally of Trump, said he wanted to see a ""zero-tariff"" system between the United States and Europe.

Trump announced 32% tariffs on Southeast Asia's biggest economy.

Indonesia's chief economic minister said on Sunday that the country would focus on diplomacy and negotiations to find mutually beneficial solutions rather than retaliating against the tariffs.

""The approach was taken by considering the long-term interest of bilateral trade relation, as well as to maintain the investment climate and national economic stability,"" Airlangga Hartarto said.

He also said that Indonesia would support sectors likely to be hit by the tariffs, such as the apparel and footwear industries. Indonesia's main exports to the US include electronics, apparel and clothing, and footwear.

Japan has been hit with a 24% tariff on its exports to the US.

""We had been requesting that the US government review its unilateral tariff measures at various levels and we are extremely disappointed and regret that such measures have been implemented nonetheless,"" Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told reporters shortly after Trump's April 2 announcement.

Trade Minister Yoji Muto later said his ministry had created a task force to examine the impact of the tariffs.

When asked about the potential for retaliation, Muto replied: ""We need to decide what is best for Japan, and most effective, in a careful but bold and speedy manner.""

Malaysia will see its exports to the US get hit by a 24% tariff.

The country is not considering retaliatory tariffs and will ""seek solutions that will uphold the spirit of free and fair trade,"" its Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry said on Thursday.

In a Sunday night video address posted to social media, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Malaysia will ""prepare a coordinated ASEAN response"" toward Trump's tariffs.

Malaysia currently chairs the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a grouping of ten countries in the region, including Vietnam and Cambodia.

The prime minister also said the nation's response will be ""calm, firm, and guided by Malaysia's strategic interests.""

Mexico dodged a baseline tariff from Trump last week.

Trump came into office promising to slap a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico, but he later paused the levies on products that fell under the USMCA on free trade. Non-compliant USMCA products continue to be subject to a 25% tariff.

Trump had earlier threatened Mexico with tariffs over his concerns regarding fentanyl smuggling and illegal immigration. The White House said that for now, any USMCA-compliant imports can continue to enter the United States without added tariffs.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum lauded her ""good relationship"" with the Trump administration for avoiding any additional levies from the president last week.

Trump has imposed a 46% tariff on Vietnamese goods.

It's one of the highest tariff rates put into place by Trump against any country.

And it's prompted the country to take quick action.

Vietnam is ""ready"" to negotiate with the Trump administration to undo all tariffs on US imports, according to a senior official.

Thanks to new rules for real estate agents, Zillow is about to lose a lot of listings.

To anyone snooping on Zillow, it appears that the two-bedroom condo at 364 Arkansas Street, in San Francisco's sunny Potrero Hill neighborhood, is not for sale. The site can only offer a hazy estimate of the home's value, basic facts about the property, and some grainy, decade-old photos from the last time it traded hands. Other popular home-listing portals — Redfin, Realtor.com, Homes.com — deliver the same result. The house is ""off-market.""

The condo is for sale, though, with an asking price of $999,000. I know this because I visited the website of Compass, the country's largest real estate brokerage by sales volume and the firm representing the home's seller. There, 364 Arkansas Street is tucked away from the rest of the internet, along with a vast trove of other homes listed for sale by Compass agents.

This is no accident or failure on the part of the seller's broker. Zillow and its competitors made their names by compiling home listings in one place, helping regular homebuyers navigate a once opaque market. But a monthslong fight over control of these listings, led by Compass CEO Robert Reffkin, is fracturing the housing landscape. A growing number of agents, especially those affiliated with Compass, are advising sellers to opt for a more limited advertising campaign for their homes. In some cases, this means an early release on the broker's website before sharing the listing more widely across the internet, essentially testing the waters before it technically hits the market. In other instances, agents may push their sellers to hide their homes from public view entirely, marketing them exclusively among agents who belong to the same brokerage, or within select groups of brokers known as ""private listing networks."" This state of play has spawned weird situations like the one in San Francisco: A home may be publicly touted for sale on one brokerage's website while lying dormant everywhere else.

The new reality poses the greatest threat to Zillow and other portals that subsist on an unfettered flow of data. Instead of scrolling happily through Zillow or Redfin, you might have to bounce from site to site in search of a home or hire the agent who seems like they have access to the most listings. Even then, you may be stuck with the feeling that more hidden homes are on the market, lingering just out of view.

The day of reckoning for search portals like Zillow is a long way off. Still, there's no denying the shift underway — in February, Reffkin told analysts that more than half of new Compass sellers were opting to ""premarket"" their homes within the walls of the brokerage before sharing their listings in all the usual places. Exclusive listings aren't novel, but Compass' aggressive push in that direction has roiled the rest of the industry. And it's far from the only company employing this tactic. Even Redfin, which runs a brokerage business in addition to its search portal, has threatened to adopt the Compass playbook.

""Writing blog posts and being all high and mighty and idealistic about how a marketplace ought to work, that's one approach,"" Glenn Kelman, Redfin's CEO, tells me. ""And the other approach is a little more Hobbesian, which is, when you're punched in the face, punch back.""

The threat to real estate portals — not to mention the house hunters and casual lurkers who love to browse them — became clear late last month. For the past half-decade, the National Association of Realtors, an industry group that effectively sets the rules for buying and selling homes in America, has been trying to stem the rise of ""pocket listings,"" homes that are quietly advertised among a select group rather than shared widely. In 2019, NAR adopted the ""clear cooperation policy,"" which requires agents to contribute listings to local databases within one day of marketing them publicly. The databases, known as multiple listing services, feed that info to other brokerages and search sites like Zillow, ensuring everyone can get a clear view of the homes for sale in that area. Over the past year, though, Reffkin has led the charge to get rid of the clear cooperation rule, arguing home sellers should have control over where and how their homes are marketed.

After months of debate, NAR said in late March that it would hold firm — sort of. While clear cooperation remains intact, the group also unveiled a new policy that will allow sellers to list homes on the MLS but opt out of sending their data to sites like Zillow for a period of time. These so-called ""delayed marketing"" listings will be available for other agents to find in the MLS and may be publicly advertised on the listing broker's website, but they'll be missing from the data feeds that send listings to the rest of the internet. And because regular buyers rarely have access to their local MLSes, they could end up relying more on agents to show them what's out there. All of this may sound nonsensical (why not get your home in front of as many people as possible?), but sellers and their agents have various reasons for slow-rolling their listings.

To get an idea of how this works in practice, take a look at Compass' proposed ""three-phased marketing strategy"" for sellers. The first step is to debut the home in Compass' internal database as a Private Exclusive, available only to Compass' network 34,000 agents and their ""millions of clients."" Unlike the MLS or a search portal like Zillow, the Compass database doesn't show whether the price has been cut or how long the house has been on the market, details that Reffkin argues can harm a seller by giving buyers more negotiating power. The next phase is what's known as a Coming Soon: The house is listed in the MLS and launched publicly on Compass.com, but isn't sent anywhere else. (That San Francisco condo I mentioned earlier is at this stage.) Some agents outside the brokerage may see it in the MLS, but again, the Compass site doesn't show price drops or days on the market. It does, however, signal that ""increased competition for the listing will be coming soon when it's launched on all other sites,"" according to Compass. The third phase is the all-hands-on-deck approach: The listing goes live in all the typical online outlets.

Compass likens this road map to testing a product with a smaller audience before launch. A seller can tinker with the price, gauge the reception among Compass clients, and see if they can get a buyer to bite. A limited release may also appeal to sellers concerned about privacy. Reffkin and other Compass leaders have campaigned on a platform of ""seller choice,"" the idea that a homeowner should have full control over how their home is marketed rather than surrender it to other platforms like Zillow.

""With NAR introducing a new MLS policy to 'expand choice for consumers,' they acknowledged the clear cooperation policy restricted home seller choice,"" Reffkin said in a statement after NAR's announcement last month. ""Expanding choice means that NAR is still not letting homeowners choose precisely how to market their homes, but this is a small step in the right direction.""

Those on the opposite side of the debate say most sellers just want to sell quickly for top dollar, and they argue sharing homes everywhere is the best way to achieve that. Even if a buyer offers you a dream price during that first phase in Compass' playbook, who's to say that a Zillow-fueled bidding war wouldn't deliver an even greater sum? Bret Weinstein, the founder and CEO of the Denver brokerage Guide Real Estate, says he can already envision the lawsuits from aggrieved sellers claiming they were duped into this ""exclusive"" marketing strategy.

""You're a few phone calls away from someone saying, 'Hey, I would have paid X amount for this house if I had known about it,'"" Weinstein tells me.

Buyers, on the other hand, may miss out on their dream home if they choose the wrong agent or fail to scour every website. Buyers' agents may also be able to better justify their commissions if they can unlock a corner of the market for their clients, showing them homes they can't find anywhere else.

Both sides of the aisle may claim they're crusading on behalf of consumers, but you'll be hard-pressed to find anyone in the industry arriving at this debate with a neutral point of view.

""Everybody's got a financial bias,"" says Mike DelPrete, a real-estate tech strategist and scholar-in-residence at the University of Colorado Boulder. ""At the end of the day, everyone involved has a financial dog in this fight.""

The lifeblood of the real estate industry is inventory: the properties listed for sale every day by ordinary homeowners. ""Listings are fuel,"" says Stephen Capezza, a real estate consultant who's held executive roles at both Zillow and the brokerage firm Side. Search portals draw millions of visitors each month with home listings supplied by brokerages and the MLSes. The portals then make their money by turning leads — customers who signal their interest in finding an agent or getting a mortgage — into cash through a referral system. Let's say you find a home on Zillow and click the buttons to ""contact agent"" or ""request a tour."" In many cases, Zillow won't connect you with the listing agent who represents the seller. Instead, the company will pass your information along to another agent who pays for access to Zillow's user base, either by shelling out a monthly advertising fee or promising a percentage of their commission, sometimes as much as 40%. Last year, more than 70% of Zillow's revenue — about $1.6 billion — came from its referral programs and other services for real estate professionals, annual filings show. That dollar figure was up 10% from the year prior, which the company attributed to an increase in revenue per visit and the number of visits.

The free flow of listings doesn't just benefit the giant search portals. It also levels the playing field for smaller brokerages or independent agents, allowing those with limited inventory to compete with the big guys. If large brokerages exert greater control over listings, hoarding them on their own websites or shopping them around internally, they stand to gain a clear edge in the marketplace. They can convince agents to come into the fold and sway clients by touting their exclusive inventory. They can also monetize leads through their own websites rather than handing those opportunities to another search portal. Even if most of those homes eventually go public — Compass says 94% of its exclusive listings end up on the MLS — the company can still lure customers by offering them a first look. In a tight market where every day matters, that's a seductive sell.

Keeping listings in-house could lead to big bucks for mega brokers. DelPrete estimates that Compass stands to generate $3.5 million in revenue for every 100 agents recruited, $1.1 million for every 100 closed leads funneled through its website, and $570,000 for every 100 ""double-ended deals,"" sales in which Compass agents represent both the buyer and seller. And since brokerages typically take a cut of every commission, DelPrete says the companies could use their exclusive inventory to increase the percentage their agents hand over. If Compass could claim even 1% more of its agents' commissions, the company could haul in an extra $56 million in annual profit, according to DelPrete's analysis.

""A brokerage's job is to provide value to their agents,"" DelPrete tells me. ""Right now, Compass is providing value to agents.""

There is a chance that these changes will only register as a minor disruption for Zillow and the like. Perhaps Compass can sway some sellers to pursue their premarketing strategy, but most homeowners expect their homes to end up on the big search portals because that's where the buyers are.

""I mean, shoot, there are 'SNL' skits on Zillow,"" Capezza tells me. ""It's synonymous with real estate. It's going to take more than a great debate, a couple changes to clear cooperation, to change consumer behavior.""

Zillow makes a similar argument: Just follow the consumers. For now, they're scrolling through the search portals.

""It's clear what consumers want: open access to listings when they're searching for a home and exposure to the greatest number of buyers when they're selling,"" Errol Samuelson, Zillow's chief industry development officer, said in an emailed statement. ""Companies like Zillow that deliver for consumers — in partnership with great real estate industry professionals — will succeed, not the companies putting their own interests ahead of the needs of home buyers and sellers.""

But there are also clear reasons for concern for Zillow, Redfin, and their ilk. Four years ago, DelPrete wrote a blog post outlining the biggest threats to the search portals. Exclusive inventory was No. 1. He likened the situation to the fiercely competitive world of video streaming, in which companies like Netflix and Hulu have plowed billions of dollars into exclusive content. You may turn to Max on Sunday nights for your ""White Lotus"" fix, but only Netflix can satisfy your ""Love Is Blind"" cravings. We're stuck paying for all these different platforms because each offers its own private garden of movies and shows.

""When it comes to browsing for real estate, consumers want access to all of the available inventory,"" DelPrete wrote. ""If a certain portion of listings are held off-market, available exclusively on another platform, consumer eyeballs will naturally follow.""

Just shy of 10,000 Compass listings are currently in the premarketing phases, advertised as Coming Soon or held closely as Private Exclusives. On the one hand, that's a drop in the bucket compared to the hundreds of thousands of homes for sale on Zillow right now. But other large brokerages either have their own such programs or have promised to follow suit if this turns into an all-out battle for inventory. The 10 largest brands accounted for about 60% of US home sales volume last year, according to data from T3 Sixty, a consulting firm for residential real estate brokerages. If even a few lean heavily into exclusive listings, they could trigger a domino effect across the industry.

The online search portals ushered in what you might call a Golden Age of Home Search: Instead of relying on agents to guide them through the market's offerings, buyers could take matters into their own hands. It wasn't perfect. Pocket listings have always existed in some form or another, and rules encouraging cooperation among agents are notoriously difficult to enforce. But the behind-the-scenes plumbing of the MLSes gave homebuyers the ability to navigate the market with ease, comforted by the notion that they were seeing pretty much everything out there. That era may be fading.

""When you think about the future, you have to look at what's happening now,"" DelPrete tells me. ""This is happening. It has been happening. And it's turning into a significant competitive advantage for Compass.""

Analysts say the trade war will pile costs onto the fast-growing US energy storage industry — and slow it down. 

Power transmission lines connecting to the Crimson Battery Energy Storage Project in Blythe, California.

President Donald Trump's trade war threatens to slow down a fast-growing technology that's key to the clean-power transition and preventing blackouts — big batteries.

Energy storage devices large enough to feed the electric grid have been spreading across the US, with deployments surging 33% last year. Officials in California and Texas credit them with helping prevent blackouts during heat waves, when electricity demand soars, and integrating variable solar and wind power onto the grid. But despite efforts by former President Joe Biden to build a domestic supply chain, the US still relies heavily on imported lithium-ion batteries — with 69% of the imports made in China, according to the BloombergNEF research provider.

Trump's new tariffs will affect everything from chips to data centers to online ads. No American tech player will be spared. 

Define “help.”

The race to build artificial intelligence is supposedly a key priority for Donald Trump's administration, as emphasized by the president's enthusiasm when announcing the $500 billion “Stargate” infrastructure project in January. “I'm going to help a lot,” he said, flanked by Oracle Corp. chairman Larry Ellison and OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman.

But Trump's “Liberation Day” tariffs announcements sent a very different message. The news hammered Oracle's stock as the prospect of new duties loomed large over its ability to quickly build the data centers required for the AI revolution. Were OpenAI a public company, it would have likely experienced something similar; its demand for computing power is insatiable.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

President Donald Trump cast his tariffs as a political winner in an attempt to assuage fears from wealthy Republican benefactors about the fallout of his signature trade policy just hours before even more sweeping tariffs were due to take effect.

“We're going to win the midterm elections, and we're going to have a tremendous, thundering landslide. I really believe that,” Trump said Tuesday at a fundraising gala for House Republicans at the the National Building Museum in Washington.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

China retaliated against new tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump by announcing it would raise duties on US goods, roiling markets and deepening a trade war between the world's largest economies.

The Chinese government will impose an 84% tariff on all imports from the US starting April 10, the Finance Ministry said in a statement Wednesday. China's move came hours after the steepest American tariffs in a century went into force, taking Trump's duties on Beijing this year to 104%.

The European Union on Wednesday voted to approve its first set of retaliatory measures to counter tariffs imposed by the U.S. on steel and aluminum.

The European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, said duties would start being collected on a first tranche of tariffs on U.S. imports from April 15, with a second set of measures following on May 15. According to a draft document seen by CNBC in March, the tariffs target a wide range of goods, including poultry, grains, clothing and metals. The EU has not released a final list of impacted products, and declined to comment further on Wednesday.

The 27-nation bloc had warned it would act to protect European business and consumers after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed 25% duties on the metals.

""The EU considers US tariffs unjustified and damaging, causing economic harm to both sides, as well as the global economy. The EU has stated its clear preference to find negotiated outcomes with the US, which would be balanced and mutually beneficial,"" the European Commission said.

""These countermeasures can be suspended at any time, should the US agree to a fair and balanced negotiated outcome,"" the EC said in a statement.

The EU also faces tariffs of 20% on almost all its U.S. imports, as part of Trump's targeting of more than 180 countries and territories, as announced by the White House leader on April 2.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the time said the EU was ready to retaliate unless negotiations with the U.S. administration were successful.

""We are prepared to respond,"" she said, adding that the EU was preparing for further countermeasures to protect its interests and businesses. But, von der Leyen also called for talks with the U.S., saying it was ""not too late to address concerns through negotiations.""

Maros Sefcovic, the EU's commissioner for trade and economic security, said Monday that the U.S. tariffs are impacting 380 billion euros ($420.45 billion) worth of Europe's exports to the United States, amounting to around 70% of total exports.

""To put it in perspective, that's over 80 billion euros in duties, an eleven-fold jump from the 7 billion [euros] the U.S. currently collects,"" he added.

Countries around the world are scrambling to formulate their response to the duties, which have sparked global market chaos. China — slapped with a total tariff on its goods of 104% — on Wednesday announced tariffs on U.S. goods entering China would rise to 84% from 34% starting April 10.

In this article

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Wednesday he sees the U.S. economy likely headed to recession as President Donald Trump's tariffs roil financial markets.

With the trade war between the U.S. and China intensifying, stocks and bonds sold off aggressively again in morning trade. Stock market futures slumped and bond yields spiked amid concerns over financial and economic stability brought on by the tit-for-tat exchange between the two nations.

""I think probably [a recession is] s a likely outcome, because markets, I mean, when you see a 2,000-point decline [in the Dow Jones Industrial Average], it sort of feeds on itself, doesn't it,"" Dimon said on Fox Business' ""Mornings With Maria"" show. ""It makes you feel like you're losing money in your 401(k), you're losing money in your pension. You've got to cut back.""

Recession fears have been rising on Wall Street as the Trump tariffs spur uncertainty about how far the trade war will escalate.

In the latest development, China said it will slap an 84% tariff on all U.S. goods, up 50 percentage points from the previous level, as U.S. reciprocal duties take effect around the world. Dow futures were off more than 800 points while the 10-year Treasury yields soared nearly 20 basis points, or 0.2 percentage point.

JPMorgan economists expect U.S. gross domestic product to contract 0.3% this year, a mild recessionary call but coming after a strong year for growth.

""Markets aren't always right, but sometimes they are right,"" Dimon said. ""I think this time they are right because they're just pricing uncertainty [at] the macro level and uncertainty [at] the micro level, at the actual company level, and then how it affects consumer sentiment. It's hard to tell.""

In the past, Dimon has been a supporter of tariffs.

During a January interview with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the executive said people should ""get over it"" regarding tariffs and said a little inflation would be worth it to preserve national security.

On Wednesday, he encouraged the U.S. to make deals with its trading partners while cautioning that market reaction could get worse if that doesn't happen.

""Take a deep breath, negotiate some trade deals. That's the best thing they can do,"" he said. ""I'm taking a calm view. But I think it could get worse if we don't make some progress here.""

Separately, Dimon encouraged the Senate to confirm Fed Governor Michelle Bowman as vice chair for supervision, the chief overseer of the banking and finance system. Bowman is up for a confirmation hearing Thursday.

China has pushed back again on U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies by hiking its levies on U.S. imports to more than 80%.

Tariffs on U.S. goods entering China will rise to 84% from 34% starting April 10, according to a translation of a Office of the Tariff Commission of the State Council announcement. The hike comes in response to the latest U.S. tariff increase on Chinese goods to more than 100% that began at midnight.

The tit-for-tat escalation of tariffs threatens to crush trade between the world's two largest economies. According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the U.S. exported $143.5 billion of goods to China in 2024, while importing products worth $438.9 billion.

The Trump administration announced a sweeping new tariff policy last week, warning other countries not to retaliate. Some nations, including Japan, have seemed willing to negotiate on tariffs, but China appears to be taking a more hard-line stance and quickly announced a countertariff.

After China's initial response to the April 2 tariff rollout, Trump announced an additional 50% hike, putting the total level for import taxes on Chinese goods at 104%.

""It's unfortunate that the Chinese actually don't want to come and negotiate, because they are the worst offenders in the international trading system,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business on Wednesday after China's latest announcement. ""They have the most imbalanced economy in the history of the modern world, and I can tell you that this escalation is a loser for them.""

The U.S. had already imposed new tariffs on China before it rolled out its full trade policy in April. China, along with Canada and Mexico, was hit with new levies at the start of Trump's second term as part of what the administration said was an effort to stop fentanyl from entering the U.S.

The trade war has spooked investors around the world by increasing the odds of slower economic growth, higher inflation and lower corporate profits, sparking a sharp sell-off in April. 

The S&P 500 finished Tuesday down nearly 20% from its peak, putting the U.S. large-cap stock index in a bear market. South Korea's Kospi Index fell into a bear market of its own on Wednesday. Stocks in Shanghai and Hong Kong are also down sharply since the U.S. tariff announcement on April 2.

U.S. crude oil futures fell about 3% on Wednesday, as China announced retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. after President Donald Trump's sweeping levies took effect.

The U.S. benchmark dropped $1.83, or 3.07%, to $57.75 per barrel by 9:41 a.m. ET. Global benchmark Brent tumbled $1.93, or 3.07%, to $60.89.

The oil sell-off took a leg lower earlier in the session after Beijing announced tariffs of 84% on U.S. goods in response to Trump's levies. U.S. crude fell more than 7% to an intraday low of $55.12, while Brent tumbled to $58.40 at its lowest point during the session.

China's tariffs take effect on April 10.

Traders are worried the world is descending into a full-blown trade war that will trigger a recession, hitting crude oil demand. OPEC+, meanwhile, has agreed to accelerate output in May, which will bring more oil to a market that was already facing a surplus.

The collision of recession fears and growing oil supply is a ""toxic cocktail,"" Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC on Tuesday.

The U.S. and Iran are scheduled to hold talks in Oman on Saturday to discuss the Islamic Republic's nuclear program. Successful negotiations could result in more Iranian oil entering the global market.

Delta Air Lines won't expand flying in the second half of the year because of disappointing bookings amid President Donald Trump's shifting trade policies, which CEO Ed Bastian called ""the wrong approach.""

Delta on Wednesday forecast its second-quarter revenue to decline up to 2% or grow as much as 2% over last year, while Wall Street had been expecting growth of 1.9%. The airline expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.70 to $2.30, compared with analysts' estimates of $2.23 a share.

The carrier said it is too early to update its 2025 financial guidance, a month after it confirmed the targets at an investor conference, though Delta said Wednesday it still expects to be profitable this year. Last month, Delta cut its first-quarter earnings outlook, citing weaker-than-expected corporate and leisure travel demand.

It is a shift for Delta, the most profitable U.S. airline, which started 2025 upbeat about another year of strong travel demand, with Bastian predicting it would be the ""best financial year in our history.""

Bastian's new comments show growing concern among CEOs about consumers' souring appetites for spending and the impact of some of Trump's policies. In November, Bastian said the Trump administration's approach to industry regulation would likely be a ""breath of fresh air.""

Wall Street analysts have slashed their earnings estimates and price targets for airlines in recent weeks on fears of slowing demand.

""In the last six weeks, we've seen a corresponding reduction in broad consumer confidence and corporate confidence,"" Bastian told CNBC. He said that demand, overall, was ""quite good"" in January and that things ""really started to slow"" in mid-February.

Bastian said main cabin bookings are weaker than previously expected. He said that travel demand that was growing about 10% at the start of the year has since slowed because some companies are rethinking business trips, the Trump administration has cut the government workforce and markets are reeling. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Bastian said international and premium travel, which has been growing faster than sales from the coach cabin, have been relatively resilient.

Delta planned to expand flying capacity by about 3% to 4% in the second half of 2025, Bastian said in an interview. Now the carrier's capacity will be flat year over year.

""We expect this to be the first of many 2H25 capacity reduction announcements from the airlines this quarter,"" TD Cowen airline analysts Tom Fitzgerald and Helane Becker wrote after Delta released its outlook.

Some of the future capacity cuts could include Canada, where U.S.-bound travel has declined, and Mexico, Delta President Glen Hauenstein said. For Mexico, he said there is less demand for travelers visiting friends and family rather than a drop in business travel.

""With broad economic uncertainty around global trade, growth has largely stalled,"" Bastian said in Wednesday's earnings release. ""In this slower-growth environment, we are protecting margins and cash flow by focusing on what we can control.""

Delta is the first of the major U.S. carriers to report earnings. United, American, Southwest and others are scheduled to report later this month.

Tariffs and potential retaliatory duties could drive up the costs of imported components for the U.S. aerospace industry.

Delta's Bastian, however, said the company will defer any Airbus aircraft that is affected by tariffs. Airbus produces airplanes in Europe but also uses imported components in its Mobile, Alabama, factory.

Here's how the company performed in the three months ended March 31, compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on consensus estimates from LSEG:

In the first quarter, Delta's net income rose to $240 million, up from $37 million last year, with revenue up 2% year over year to $14.04 billion.

Stripping out Delta's refinery sales, Delta posted adjusted earnings per share of 46 cents, up 2% from last year and above analysts' expectations, and adjusted revenue of $12.98 billion, up 3% from last year and in line with Wall Street expectations.

Global bond markets were gripped by volatility on Wednesday, as the rollout of U.S. President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs left investors scrambling to find safety in new areas — including German debt.

U.S. Treasurys sold off as a new wave of duties came into force and China and the European Union announced fresh retaliatory action, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury last seen trading 9 basis points higher at 4.352%.



Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions, as investors demand a lower price on the bond and a higher return on their loan to lend to governments that they see as riskier holdings.

Across the Atlantic, longer-dated European government borrowing costs also rose. By 3:55 p.m. in London, the Italian 10-year yield was up 2 basis points and the yield on British 10-year government bonds, known as gilts, was up 12 basis points.

The 30-year gilt yield soared up to 30 basis points at one point, marking a fresh 27-year high, and was last up 25 basis points.

Gilt yields are suffering spillover effects from the moves in Treasurys, but the gilt market is also generally sensitive — relative to other high-grade bond markets — to catalysts that trigger yield rises given stretched margin calls from hedge funds, Diana Iovanel, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, told CNBC.

""It's not too surprising to see more volatility in gilts than in other [developed market] government bonds against the risk-negative and highly uncertain global backdrop. Beyond that, the U.K.'s stretched fiscal picture is arguably testing investors' tolerance already,"" she added.

The steepening of the U.K. yield curve ""highlights the twin challenges of heavy pressure on the U.K.'s fiscal framework, alongside likely negative economic fallout from tariffs,"" Alex Everett, senior investment manager at Aberdeen, told CNBC — adding that the Bank of England may need to cut interest rates faster than previously expected as a result.

Germany bucked a wider trend as its 10-year bund, seen as a benchmark for the euro zone, traded 7 basis points lower.

Shorter-dated bonds in Europe meanwhile rose in value. The yields on 2-year government bonds in France, Italy and Britain were 9, 6, and 4 basis points lower, respectively. The yield on Germany's 2-year bunds dropped 12 basis points.



""One factor people are speculating about on Treasurys is around the ongoing theme of a move away from the U.S. dollar, of it becoming less trusted,"" Ken Egan, senior director for sovereigns at credit rating analysis agency KBRA, told CNBC in a call on Wednesday. ""If you follow that through, one way that could manifest is structural holders of debt, reserve managers in China, could move away from Treasurys in response to policy moves from the U.S.""

Egan added that secondary investors also appeared to be taking a step back from U.S. Treasurys, typically seen as a traditional safe haven assets, given the volatile geopolitical climate.

""Various forces are at odds, because you have inflationary concerns and a rapid repricing of Treasurys on those, but on the other side you have weak demand and growth, and more rate cuts being priced in,"" he told CNBC.

German bonds were out of sync with the long-dated market on Wednesday because it is being seen as an alternative safe haven play, as investors — still stunned by the scale of Trump's actions — wait for more clarity, he said.

Egan also noted that European bonds with shorter maturity terms were rising in value as they are more policy-sensitive and traders want to lock in returns now, as more global interest rate cuts are being priced in.

""Traditionally you might have gone into the U.S. during a period of volatility, but this is a U.S. story. Germany is benefiting from a wider flight to quality. The country has already told the market what it's going to do, there's clarity about what its path will look like,"" Egan added, referencing Berlin's recent passing of a huge fiscal package across infrastructure, climate and defense.

In a note on Wednesday, Freya Beamish, chief economist at TS Lombard, likened the spike in U.S. government borrowing costs to the U.K.'s 2022 ""mini budget"" crisis, which rocked the country's pension funds and led to emergency market intervention by the Bank of England.

""The really worrisome thing about negative supply shocks is that they push up inflation and destroy demand at the same time, destroying the hedging capacity of bonds for equities. They are capital destroyers,"" she said.

""The issue here is not who is right or wrong about the long-term effects of tariffs. It is about investor perceptions over the probability of these types of shocks. And once this narrative starts to be priced in, the risk is of financial accelerators kicking in, as happened in the UK with the LDI crisis.""

Alex Brazier, global head of investment and portfolio solutions at BlackRock, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Wednesday that recent months had been a reminder for investors that ""we're in a new world.""

""This is not a situation where a classic broad stock index, broad bond index, set-and-forget portfolio is ideal,"" he said. ""Looking at the fundamentals of the U.S. bond market here, we've got some technicals going on, we've got early signs of stress in the swap market, that bears closely watching.""

Meanwhile, Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNBC via email on Wednesday that some European government bond yields had moved upward despite rising expectations of interest rate cuts in the region.

""This is likely to be because investors are selling out their positions in European bonds to buy U.S. Treasuries given that they are offering higher yields,"" she said. ""However, U.S. Treasury yields are falling back again, and the situation remains very fluid.""

The European Union on Wednesday presented a plan to boost its artificial intelligence industry and help it compete more aggressively with the U.S. and China, following criticisms from technology firms that its regulations are too cumbersome.

In a press release, the European Commission, the executive body of the EU, outlined its so-called ""AI Continent Action Plan,"" which aims to ""transform Europe's strong traditional industries and its exceptional talent pool into powerful engines of AI innovation and acceleration.""

Among the ways Europe plans to bolster regional AI developments are a commitment to build a network of AI factories and ""gigafactories"" and create specialized labs designed to improve the access of startups to high-quality training data.

The EU defines these ""factories"" as large facilities that house state-of-the-art chips needed to train and develop the most advanced AI models.

The bloc will also create a new AI Act Service Desk to help regional firms comply with its landmark AI law.

""The AI Act raises citizens' trust in technology and provides investors and entrepreneurs with the legal certainty they need to scale up and deploy AI throughout Europe,"" the Commission said, adding the AI Act Service Desk will ""serve as the central point of contact and hub for information and guidance"" on the rules.

The plan bears similarities to the U.K.'s AI Action Plan announced earlier this year. Like the EU, Britain committed to expand domestic AI infrastructure to aid developers.

The launch of the EU's AI plan arrives as the bloc is facing criticisms from tech leaders that its rules on everything from AI to taxation hinder innovation and make it harder for startups to operate across the region.

The bloc's landmark legislation known as the AI Act has proven particularly thorny for companies in the rapidly growing artificial intelligence industry.

The law regulates applications of AI based on the level of risk they pose to society — and in recent years it has been adapted to cover so-called ""foundational"" model makers such as OpenAI and French startup Mistral, much to the ire of some of the buzziest businesses in that space.

At a global AI summit in Paris earlier this year, OpenAI's Chief Global Affairs Officer Chris Lehane told CNBC that European political and business leaders increasingly fear missing out on AI's potential and want regulators to focus less on tackling risks associated with the technology.

""There's almost this fork in the road, maybe even a tension right now between Europe at the EU level ... and then some of the countries,"" Lehane told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal in February. ""They're looking to maybe go in a little bit of a different direction that actually wants to embrace the innovation.""

The U.S. administration has also been critical of Europe over its treatment of American tech giants and fast-growing AI startups.

At the Paris AI summit in February, U.S. Vice President JD Vance took aim at Europe's regulatory approach to AI, stressing that ""we need our European friends in particular to look to this new frontier with optimism rather than trepidation.""

""There is a real emphasis on easing the burden of regulation and removing barriers to innovation, which in part is likely to reflect some of the concerns that have been raised by the US government,"" John Buyers, global head of AI at law firm Osborne Clarke, told CNBC over email.

Europe's auto giants slipped on Wednesday, extending recent losses as U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries came into effect — including a whopping 104% levy on China.

Trump's latest trade measures, which came into force as of 5 a.m. London time, include a 20% tariff on the European Union, a 24% tariff on Japan and a 49% levy on Cambodia.

China responded to Trump's tariff policies by hiking its levies on U.S. imports to 84%, with the duties set to take effect from April 10. 

Shares of French car parts supplier Valeo traded down 7.1% on Wednesday, tumbling toward the bottom of the pan-European Stoxx 600 index.

Germany's Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz Group and BMW fell around 2%, with the latter notching a fresh 52-week low.

In Asia, Japan's Nissan and Toyota fell 7% and 2.6%, respectively.

Trump's ""reciprocal"" trade measures will be applied separately and not on top of existing U.S. auto tariffs, according to S&P Global.

The U.S. implemented a 25% charge on all foreign cars imported into the country last Thursday. The White House said it also intends to place tariffs on some auto parts no later than May 3.

Analysts warn that German car manufacturers are likely to be the most exposed to the U.S. trade measures.

""The tariffs are a blow for especially the German car makers which export hundreds of thousands of units to the US annually (749,000 in 2024) and produce many cars in the US itself which require European parts,"" Rico Luman, senior sector economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, told CNBC in emailed comments.

""It's hard to work around the tariffs, and they seem to stay at least a while, so they need to deal with it and will have to reconsider product offerings, pricing and manufacturing footprints,"" he added.

An escalating trade war is expected to have a profound impact on the global car industry, particularly given the high globalization of supply chains and the heavy reliance on manufacturing operations across North America.

In the days since Trump's auto tariffs came into effect, car giants have responded by announcing plans to raise prices, impose import fees, pause shipments, idle plants and even lay off staff.

ING's Luman said that, while a drop in U.S. unit sales will likely hurt German carmakers amid an already complex set of challenges, this picture ""doesn't look dramatic"" just yet.

""China is indeed even more important, and their home market require more attention,"" Luman said. ""I would say that bolstering competitive strength and selling more cars in the European home market (and perhaps develop other export markets across the world) will be the focus.""

""BMW and Mercedes are among the top exporters of cars by value from the US, thus the most exposed to retaliatory tariffs among the European automakers,"" Rella Suskin, equity analyst at Morningstar, told CNBC by email.

She added that both companies could face double tariffs on vehciles manufactured in Mexico and Canada.

""However, we think most of the models that these companies manufacture in Mexico or Canada can easily be substituted with vehicles imported from Europe, which attract only the worldwide 25% auto tariff,"" she added.

China's foreign ministry reiterated Wednesday that Beijing will take ""resolute and forceful"" measures to protect its own interests, after net total tariffs of 104% on Chinese imports into the U.S. took effect.

""If the U.S. genuinely wants to resolve the problem through dialogue and negotiation, it should show an attitude of equality, respect and mutual benefit,"" Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular press briefing.

Echoing the commerce ministry's comments on Tuesday, Lin said that ""if the U.S. insists on fighting a tariff war and a trade war, China will ""definitely fight to the end.""

Last Friday, China's Finance Ministry announced 34% in additional tariffs on all goods imported from the U.S. starting on April 10, in retaliation for Trump imposing new levies of 34% on China.

The across-the-board tariffs followed two previous rounds of 10%-15% tariffs, targeting mostly agricultural and energy products imported from the U.S. 

According to Dan Wang, China director at Eurasia Group, Trump's tariffs would effectively wipe out Chinese exporters' profits once U.S. import duties passed the 35% mark. After that, Chinese exporters will not sell to the U.S. at all, she said.

In a separate official white paper released by the State Council Information Office on Thursday, the Chinese authority said ""if the U.S. insists on further escalating its economic and trade restrictions, China will resolutely counter and fight the U.S. to the end,"" according to a CNBC translation.

""The U.S. uses tariffs as a weapon to exert extreme pressure and seek selfish interests. This is a typical act of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying,"" Beijing said in the white paper.

The Chinese administration added that raising tariffs would not help with U.S. trade surplus issues, but will instead prompt great volatility in financial markets, exacerbating inflationary pressure and undermining American industries.

Nonetheless, Beijing said it hoped the U.S. would ""meet halfway"" and immediately lift the unilateral trade barriers, while reiterating its openness to strengthen dialogue, manage difference and boost collaboration.

China alleged it fulfilled the terms under the ""Phase 1"" trade deal that Trump struck with Beijing during his first presidential term, while claiming the U.S. violated certain mandates in the agreement. CNBC has reached out to the White House for comment regarding these claims.

The deal required China to ramp up purchases of U.S. goods by $200 billion over a two-year period, but Beijing failed to meet its targets as the Covid-19 pandemic hit.

Oops, something went wrong

Dave Portnoy, the outspoken founder of Barstool Sports, posted a simple question on X  last week that hit a nerve in the crypto world: “If the point of Bitcoin is to be independent of the U.S. Dollar and nonregulated, why does it basically trade exactly like the U.S. stock market nowadays?”



Don't Miss:

Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm — invest pre-IPO from $0.55 per share now.

Are you rich? Here's what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.

That one line summed up what a lot of casual investors have been wondering, especially as Bitcoin and crypto stocks took a dive following President Donald Trump's new round of tariffs on Wednesday.

Bitcoin had been hovering near $88,000 before Trump's announcement. Not long after the tariff policy was unveiled, it slipped below $83,000. It wasn't alone. Stocks tanked in after-hours trading, with tech-heavy ETFs like Invesco QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ) falling 4%.

Crypto-linked stocks also followed the same trend. MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) dropped 7%, Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) fell 6%, and Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) lost 9%.

So much for being “independent.”

Trending: Have $200K saved? Here's how to turn it into lasting wealth

Plenty of people chimed in to answer Portnoy's question. Some pointed to institutional involvement, others blamed emotions, and a few leaned on technical analysis.

“Bitcoin trades like a risk asset short term because it's the most liquid, salable, 24/7 asset on Earth,” said MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor. “In times of panic, traders sell what they can, not what they want to.”



And then there's plain logic. “If you needed to pay rent what are you selling first? Apple stock or your crypto bags?” one user wrote.

Another replied, “Boom. When you realize big money has already hijacked bitcoin and it's no different than the stock market anymore.”

Others got sarcastic: “Day 1 of the bear market: Portnoy discovers what correlation means.” And: “It used to be a currency before it was hijacked and turned into a collectible.” Prominent analyst Benjamin Cowen also piled on, saying, “How can you be your age and write something like that?”

Some users defended Bitcoin's original intent. “Traders are the froth. Hodlers are the floor,” one said. Another added, “Bitcoin is the best-performing asset over the last 15 years.”

See Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

This latest Bitcoin drop didn't come out of nowhere. Wall Street was already reeling from inflation data and weak consumer sentiment. On Friday, a few days before “Liberation Day,” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 700 points, the S&P 500 slid 2%, and the Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ) lost nearly 3%.

Then came Trump's tariff announcement, renewing trade war fears. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecast now shows a 2.8% GDP decline for Q1, up from -3.7% on April 1.

While Bitcoin has shown some resilience compared to stocks, it's still moving in the same direction when fear hits.

Some still believe in one of Bitcoin's original promises: a decentralized hedge against economic chaos. But for now, most agree that Bitcoin is still a risk-on asset, and it trades like one.

As Portnoy pointed out, it looks more and more like just another part of the system it was meant to replace—”Market up, bitcoin up. Market down, bitcoin down.” Or, as Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki, said, “BTC price movements are related to sentiment. Risk on, up. Risk off, down.”

As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly central to the global digital economy, decentralized alternatives are beginning to challenge the dominance of corporate-led AI development.

Among the most promising is Bittensor, a blockchain-based machine learning network that allows anyone to contribute to and profit from AI innovation.

As reported by Coinbase, the network offers an estimated annual reward rate of 17.52%, making it a cutting-edge technological platform and an attractive economic opportunity.

Bittensor functions as both a blockchain and a peer-to-peer AI platform, enabling the creation, evaluation, and monetization of digital commodities such as AI inference, training, and storage.

A core innovation of Bittensor is its subnet architecture. Modular, independent communities within the network that focus on specific digital commodities.

Each subnet operates autonomously, establishing its unique incentive structures and performance benchmarks. Contributors, known as miners, compete to solve AI-related tasks ranging from translation to large language model inference. Their outputs are evaluated by validators, who rank the quality of each submission.

Seth Bloomberg, an investment partner at Crucible Labs, told Forbes, “Crucible acts as a validator—not a subnet—unlike inference-focused subnets such as Manifold or Chutes.”

While subnets ensure data accuracy and model performance, Bloomberg emphasized that harmful or illicit content must be moderated at the application layer.

He also noted that there is “no inherent advantage to being an early subnet,” especially following the Dynamic TAO upgrade, which allows the open market to determine the value of each subnet.

Previously, all rewards were distributed exclusively in TAO tokens. With the introduction of Dynamic TAO, each subnet now has its unique token, which miners receive as a reward.

Bloomberg says that today, Bittensor hosts over 80 subnets, from experimental projects refining their incentive mechanisms to mature systems actively generating revenue and serving end users.

This model redefines what it means to “mine” in the blockchain context.

Rather than validating blocks through cryptographic puzzles as seen in Bitcoin, miners in Bittensor produce tangible, valuable digital work.

The economic incentives are substantial. With TAO emitted daily, participants, which include miners, validators, and subnet creators, can earn real income based on their contributions.

Participation is merit-based.

Underperformers may be de-registered and required to re-enter the system. This ensures that performance, not capital or central authority, dictates success.

According to Bittensor's whitepaper, the system includes strong safeguards against collusion and manipulation. Rewards are distributed based on consensus-based rankings. This rewards only peers whose evaluations align with the broader network.

As decentralized AI gains momentum, Bittensor stands out for its transparency, openness, and potential to democratize access to machine learning.

In contrast to centralized platforms like OpenAI or Google, where access is gated, and development occurs behind closed doors, Bittensor enables global collaboration through an open-source protocol.

With growing concerns about centralized AI's ethical and regulatory pitfalls, ranging from data privacy to monopolistic control, Bittensor's model offers a compelling alternative.

As the protocol continues to evolve, it promises to scale intelligence in a decentralized manner and ensures that the ownership and benefits of AI remain in the hands of the many, not the few.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Pakistan reportedly announced plans to allocate excess power to Bitcoin mining and AI infrastructure, just days after appointing Binance founder Changpeng Zhao as strategic crypto advisor.

Pakistan will channel part of its surplus electricity into powering Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, a significant shift in energy and tech policy aimed at turning excess capacity into economic opportunity, according to a report from Reuters. The announcement was made Wednesday by Bilal Bin Saqib, head of Pakistan's Crypto Council and adviser to the finance minister, who also noted that talks have been held with several mining firms.

Pakistan's energy sector has long struggled with structural challenges, including high electricity tariffs and chronic overcapacity. Utilizing the surplus for digital infrastructure is seen as a way to both modernize the economy and improve returns on energy investments.

The announcement comes just two days after the government appointed Changpeng Zhao (CZ), founder of Binance, as Pakistan's new strategic advisor on crypto.

JUST IN: 🇵🇰 PAKISTAN APPOINTS BINANCE FORMER CEO CZ AS STRATEGIC ADVISOR ON CRYPTO pic.twitter.com/oWBoBDWjLg

The initiative is being led by Saqib, who in a March 25 interview with Bloomberg invited global firms to explore the country's potential for Bitcoin mining. “We welcome companies to visit Pakistan to evaluate for Bitcoin mining,” Saqib said. When asked why now is the right time to embrace Bitcoin, he replied, “Well, why not? Because if [not] now, then never.”

Saqib also praised recent developments in U.S. crypto policy under President Donald Trump, whom he described as the “biggest, bullish catalyst for crypto in history.” He added, “I think Trump is essentially flipping the script. Trump signed the executive order instructing regulatory bodies to accommodate digital assets, forming the White House crypto advisory team, creating a US strategic Bitcoin reserve.”

“We have to understand what that means,” Saqib continued. “That means that the largest economy in the world is creating the valuable national asset similar to how it stockpiles gold or oil for economic security and strength. I think the US sets the tone for the world. Trump is making crypto a national priority and every country including Pakistan will have to follow suit or will be at the risk of being left behind.”

COLUMBUS, Ohio, April  09, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — River, a leading US-based bitcoin exchange, announces the public release of its financial statements. This launch makes River the first Bitcoin-only exchange to provide its financials publicly.

Public Financials and Proof of ReservesSince its founding in 2019, River has encouraged clients to self-custody or take direct ownership of their bitcoin. However, the reality is some people prefer to trust an institution with their bitcoin. As such, River has taken proactive steps to give clients the transparency they need to feel confident in its financial strength and the security of its infrastructure.

Last fall, River launched Proof of Reserves to enable clients to verify that River holds their bitcoin in 100% full reserve. Now, River is sharing its 2024 financial statements so that clients can verify the company's financial strength and risk-managed, long-term approach to growth. River's founder and CEO Alex Leishman has also shared a video walking through the business' operations.

The Gold Standard for Financial Institutions

Bitcoin allows us to build better institutions. Through Proof of Reserves, clients can verify that all bitcoin on River is held in full reserve custody, and all of it can be withdrawn at any time.

However, Proof of Reserves doesn't provide insight into the overall health of the company, as it does not include all of the company's liabilities. It's the combination of Proof of Reserves and Public Financials that provides clients with a true overview of the health of their financial partner.

About River

River is a premier US-based, bitcoin-only financial services company dedicated to providing the most secure and transparent platform for investing in bitcoin. The company is fully licensed and regulated in the United States and adheres to strict compliance standards to ensure the security and transparency of its operations.

River was founded with a mission to build the world's most trusted institution to empower people to take ownership of their financial lives through Bitcoin, the world's only incorruptible digital currency. By combining robust security measures with a simple user experience, River empowers individuals and institutions to confidently manage their bitcoin investments.

Investors pulled $326 million from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds on Tuesday amid flaring tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners over President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Tuesday's drawdown was the sharpest single-day pullback for spot Bitcoin ETFs since the products bled $371 million on March 11, according to crypto data provider CoinGlass.

BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF, which has registered nearly $40 billion in net inflows since its launch last year, lost $253 million, representing the fund's third worst day on record.

The pullback came as investors braced for Trump's “reciprocal” tariffs to go into effect at midnight Eastern Time, which were poised to affect imports from over 180 countries when Trump unveiled his sweeping levies a week ago.

Since then, the U.S. and China have gone tit-for-tat. After the White House confirmed on Tuesday that Chinese imports will be subject to 104% duties, Beijing responded by slapping American goods with new 50% levies, yielding a total tariff rate of 84%.

The outflows registered on Tuesday were a “a clear signal of large-scale de-risking by institutions,” BRN analyst Valentin Fournier wrote in a Wednesday note, adding that a decline in volume from the prior day showed their “switch to a more defensive positioning.”

Spot Bitcoin ETFs are currently on a four-day losing streak, with only one positive day so far this month. On April 2, when Trump made his “Liberation Day” announcement, spot Bitcoin ETFs took in $218 million.

The price of Bitcoin was recently changing hands around $77,600 on Wednesday, down 2.5% over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. On Tuesday, the asset's price fell as low as $75,100, nearing a five-month low on Monday.

Investors meanwhile pulled $3.3 million from spot Ethereum ETFs on Tuesday, according to CoinGlass, with the outflows being led by Fidelity's Ethereum fund.

Teucrium's 2x Long Daily XRP ETF, the first leveraged XRP product in the U.S., also debuted on Tuesday. It generated $5 million in trading volume, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, said on X, formerly known as Twitter.

 Bitcoin's correlation with traditional stocks may be declining, but the fiat money supply remains BTC's main price catalyst. 

The evolving relationship between Bitcoin and traditional financial markets is under renewed pressure as global investors flee risk assets amid intensifying US trade tensions.

US-listed spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded their fourth consecutive day of outflows on April 8, with more than $326 million in net redemptions across products, according to data from Farside Investors.

BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) saw the largest sell-off of over $252 million, its biggest daily outflow since Feb. 26.

The selling pressure follows US President Donald Trump's April 2 announcement of sweeping reciprocal import tariffs, which triggered a historic $5 trillion wipeout in the S&P 500 over two days.

The delayed crypto market turbulence after the tariff-related sell-off in traditional markets highlights Bitcoin's “evolving relationship with traditional markets,” according to Lennix Lai, global chief commercial officer at OKX exchange.

Lai told Cointelegraph:

Bitcoin initially remained firmly above the $82,000 support level but plummeted below $75,000 on Sunday, April 6.

Some industry leaders attributed Sunday's sell-off to Bitcoin's 24/7 liquidity mechanics, which made BTC the only large liquid asset available for de-risking over the weekend.

While there is an “encouraging sign” of a weakening correlation between Bitcoin and equities, Bitcoin's price trajectory remains tied to global liquidity conditions, Lai said, adding:

“What's most significant here isn't just price action but Bitcoin's growing conceptual influence — people increasingly view it as a valid strategic reserve asset for diversification in chaotic traditional markets,” Lai added.

Other analysts also see the growing money supply as Bitcoin's main catalyst.

“Bitcoin trades solely based on the market expectation for the future supply of fiat,” according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and chief investment officer of Maelstrom.

Trump-backed World Liberty Financial appears to be offloading Ethereum following increasing losses as ETH plunges below $1,500.

According to data shared on X by Lookonchain, on Apr. 9, a wallet linked to WLFI reportedly sold 5,471 Ethereum (ETH) for around $8 million, at a price of $1,465 per coin. 

The sale represents a major loss. WLFI had previously spent around $210 million to acquire 67,498 ETH at an average price of $3,259. At current prices, the firm is sitting on an unrealized loss of roughly $125 million.

Despite the losses, the company has been actively expanding its product lineup. On Mar. 25, WLFI confirmed the launch of USD1, a stablecoin backed 1:1 by cash, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and equivalents. The token is currently live on Ethereum and BNB Chain, with more networks to come.

WLFI claims USD1 is built for institutions seeking transparency and compliance, with reserves audited by third parties and custody handled by BitGo. The stablecoin is promoted as a safe substitute for algorithmic or undercollateralized tokens.

WLFI was established in 2024 and positions itself as a decentralized finance platform that provides financial tools based on blockchain technology. Through its token sale, the project raised $550 million, including $75 million from Tron founder Justin Sun, who later joined the platform as an advisor. However, the firm has faced governance concerns and criticism over political influence due to its Trump connections.

As reported by crypto.news on Apr. 1, The Trump family gained majority control of the platform in January by acquiring a 60% share through a new holding company, WLF Holdco LLC. As a result, they will control 60% of the company's operating profits after the platform is fully operational, and they are also entitled to 75% of the token sales revenue under the new structure.

WLFI sells Ethereum at a loss amid tariff tensions and market volatility.

World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the DeFi project partly owned by US President Donald Trump‘s family, has begun offloading some Ethereum holdings amid the top asset's recent price struggles.

On April 9, blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain, citing data from Arkham Intelligence, reported that a wallet linked to the DeFi venture sold 5,471 ETH for approximately $8.01 million at an average price of $1,465.

The sale marks a significant setback for the firm, considering WLFI previously spent $210 million to accumulate 67,498 ETH at an average of $3,259 per coin.

Based on current prices, Lookonchain stated that the firm is staring at an unrealized loss of about $125 million.

World Liberty Financial has yet to comment publicly on these sales.

Meanwhile, the sell-off reflects broader concerns in the Ethereum market.

Over the past week, ETH dipped below the $1,500 mark amid a 56% year-to-date correction. ETH's current price now sits below its realized price, causing concerns for its investors

Market analysts have attributed the slump in part to geopolitical tensions, including the ongoing Trump tariff dispute, which has triggered uncertainty in traditional and crypto markets.

Despite ETH's downturn, WLFI secured a significant vote of confidence from DWF Labs.

Onchain data shared by the pseudonymous crypto analyst ai_9684xtpa revealed that the Web3 market maker subscribed to 250 million WLFI tokens for $25 million USDC.

According to the analyst, this valuation is nearly seven times higher than the original offering price of $0.015 and double the second-round rate of $0.05.

Notably, this comes a few days after Lookonchain reported that DWF Labs had received 1 million USD1, the stablecoin launched by the Trump-backed project, for market-making purposes.

USD1 is designed to be a fully collateralized stablecoin, maintaining a 1:1 peg with the US Dollar.

The digital asset has drawn considerable attention since its launch, with WLFI recently submitting a proposal to airdrop USD1 to its token holders. This initiative aims to test WLFI's distribution model and reward early adopters ahead of the stablecoin's public rollout.

The fallout from this month's trade policy from the White House continues to hound global markets, including crypto.

Bitcoin has dipped 4.1% to $76,550, while Ethereum is down 8.3% over the last 24 hours as President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods took effect past midnight Tuesday.

Ethereum has witnessed the steepest decline on the day among the top 10 largest tokens, trading at its lowest point since March 2023.

It comes as Bitcoin briefly fell below the $75,000 level late Tuesday, less than three hours before the tariffs took effect. Bitcoin is down roughly 30% since its January peak above $109,000, right before Trump's inauguration.

Major altcoins also posted losses. Dogecoin is down 16.3% on the day, while Solana and Cardano are down 18% and 23.7% over the past week, CoinGecko data shows.

""It's been a miserable run for investors since the start of February, with more than $1.2 trillion in value wiped from the crypto market,” Pav Hundal, lead market analyst at Swyftx, told Decrypt. “The markets need a circuit breaker on sentiment as much as anything else."" 

Liquidation data from CoinGlass shows significant market distress, with the total running to roughly $411 million over the last 24 hours.

""This has been a very emotional journey,"" Hundal said. ""Everyone's operating at extremes and there's no in-between.""

The crypto market's selloff mirrors broader financial market turmoil as Trump's tariff blitz over the past week has intensified the ""trade war"" between the world's two largest economies.

Asian markets opened sharply lower on Wednesday, with Japan's Nikkei 225 falling 2.6% by the midday break, and Australia's ASX 200 losing 2%.It follows a 1.5% decline in the S&P 500 on Tuesday, bringing its losses since mid-February to nearly 20%, where it is now approaching bear market territory.

""We've entered a new era of protectionism, and what's worrying is we still have no more clarity on where it's all going to settle,"" Hundal argued.  ""All eyes now will be on how quickly the U.S. can barter new trade and non-trade deals.""



The market turbulence coincides with key movements in bond and yield markets.

The 10-year Treasury yield jumped between 4.2% and 4.4% late Tuesday, representing one of its fastest intraday climbs since World War II. 

Also, on Tuesday, the first Treasury auction of three-year notes following Trump's Liberation Day witnessed the weakest demand since late 2023.

The drop-off for three-year notes has raised concerns about waning foreign investors' appetite for U.S. government debt as the trade tensions escalate to what some observers see as a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" breakdown.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Trump Dismantles Crypto Enforcement Uniy: Best Altcoins to Explode","https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-trump-crypto-enforcement-unit/","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 12:24:43 GMT","

Some of the best altcoins are ready to surge as the DOJ (Department of Justice) just announced the official dissolution of NCET (National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Unit).

The DOJ formed the unit in 2022 with the specific goal of regulating the crypto sector to prevent criminal misuse like money laundering and cybercriminal activities.

So, why did Trump shut it down?

The DOJ published a memo on April 7, officially announcing the termination of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Unit.

Trump's Deputy Attorney General, Todd Blanche, explained the decision as long overdue because:

In Todd Blanche's words, the crypto enforcement unit was unjustly going after the platforms that bad actors were using to commit crimes. This is set to change as the DOJ will no longer target crypto services providers like exchanges and wallets for the acts of their users.

Peter Van Vankelburgh, CEO of the advocacy group Coin Center, praised Blanche's decision in his X post, stating that the DOJ should prosecute criminals, not the platforms that criminals happen to use.



This is another win for the crypto sphere after the SEC's (Security and Exchange Commission) string of dropped lawsuits marking the beginning of 2025.

The most notorious cases involved XRP and Coinbase. The latter lawsuit was dropped in late February, with Brian Armstrong himself being the bearer of good news on X.



So, what does this all mean for the crypto market? It means that we should see the best altcoins surge as the new administration keeps making bullish decisions and puts an end to the ‘regulation by enforcement' approach.

The following are some of the best meme coins to keep an eye on in 2025.

Solaxy ($SOLX) upgrades Solana by addressing some of its most pressing problems: network congestion, slow transactions, and high fees during peak activity times.

The Layer-2 upgrade will improve scalability, boost chain performance, and lower transaction fees.



The project is under ongoing development, with the team posting regular updates on their work to record their progress. The latest update aimed to increase Solaxy's TPS (Transactions per Second) capacity and enhance system security.

Stakers get a 138% dynamic APY, which will drop as more people join the staking pool (currently at 8B tokens).

$SOLX is both a meme coin and a utility token, as it supports Solana's blockchain performance. This means that the token could be one of the best long-term crypto to hold.

BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is a meme coin that offers $BTC airdrops to holders for as long as Bitcoin keeps growing.

The project's core philosophy is that Bitcoin will eventually reach and even surpass the $1M price mark, so it aims to capitalize on that. To that end, BTC Bull Token offers $BTCBULL holders $BTC airdrops each time Bitcoin reaches key price points ($150K and $200K).



This motivates investors to buy $BTCBULL on presale and hold it over the long term, which, in turn, could drive the token's price action.

The presale has accumulated over $4.5M so far, with $BTCBULL now priced at $0.00245. Stakers enjoy a dynamic APY of 92%. Joining the staking pool now guarantees the highest possible returns before the APY drops again as new stakers enter the project.

Story ($IP) is a blockchain that tokenizes IP (Intellectual Property) and allows users to leverage it in the market.

The system relies on the agent-to-agent protocol (Agent TCP/IP) to allow the transfer of intangible assets (IP).



The Proof-of-Creativity protocol allows users to tokenize and program their IP, thus gaining perks like automated royalty payments and permissionless licensing.

The token is currently trending on Coinmarketcap with a 3% increase in trading volume over the past 24 hours.

This may sound like a broken record, but yes, we believe it will turn bullish, especially given recent events.

The dismantling of the NCET (National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Unit) translates to less pressure on exchanges and public crypto entities. In turn, this is bound to increase investor trust, which is the cornerstone of any bullish wave.

So, keep your ear to the news pipe and eyes on the charts, because good things are coming.

Whether you decide to invest in any of these projects or not, keep in mind that this isn't financial advice. You should always DYOR (Do Your Own Research) before putting your money in the market.

The odds of an emergency Federal Reserve interest rate cut have jumped sharply on Polymarket and Kalshi as Donald Trump's trade war intensifies.

A Polymarket poll with over $360,000 in assets shows that these odds have surged to 31%, up from 15% on April 1. A similar prediction market on Kalshi places the odds at 41%, the highest level since November last year. 

These expectations have climbed as multiple analysts downgraded their economic outlook for the U.S. amid the expanding trade war. Notably, the U.S. recently imposed a 104% tariff on all Chinese goods, a sweeping measure likely to significantly impact both economies. China exports roughly $432 billion worth of goods to the U.S. annually, out of a total trade volume of $582 billion between the two nations.

The U.S. has also enforced broad-based tariffs on several key trade partners, including the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam.

Top Wall Street firms like JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs have all raised their recession forecasts. for the year. As a result, an emergency interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve is increasingly viewed as a likely response to ease borrowing costs and inject liquidity into the economy.

Bitcoin (BTC), Cardano (ADA), and Ripple (XRP) have entered a bear market this year, mirroring the broader downturn in equities. The Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 indices have all fallen over 20% from their 2024 highs, officially entering bear territory.

History shows that risky assets like stocks and crypto do well whenever the Federal Reserve implements an emergency interest rate cut. A good example happened in March 2020 when the fear and greed index dropped to the extreme fear zone as the pandemic started. 

A series of interest rate cuts, quantitative easing, and fiscal stimulus helped to boost crypto and stock prices. Bitcoin soared from below $4,000 in March 2020 to over $69,000 a year later. Similarly, XRP price jumped from $0.12 to almost $2, while Cardano's meteoric rise pushed it to $3 and its market cap to $91 billion. 

Donald Trump has already started talking about fiscal stimulus. According to the Wall Street Journal, the administration is considering a bailout for farmers and a tax credit to help exporters navigate the new normal. 

Therefore, a combination of easy money policies by the Fed and more fiscal stimulus would help push Bitcoin, Cardano, and XRP prices higher.

Solana has faced intense selling pressure over the past week as the broader crypto market reels from the impact of US President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policies. Fears of a prolonged trade war and mounting macroeconomic tensions have triggered a wave of panic selling across risk assets, with Solana among the hardest hit. The altcoin has plunged over 60% from recent all-time highs, reflecting the brutal conditions gripping even the strongest large-cap tokens.

Despite the carnage, there are early signs that a short-term rebound could be on the horizon. Prominent analyst Bluntz shared his outlook on X, noting that he has started bidding on several oversold altcoins like Solana, showing bullish divergence. According to Bluntz, many of these tokens have fallen in a straight line, setting the stage for what he believes could be “sizeable bounces” in the near term.

While he doesn't believe this is the definitive market bottom, the presence of bullish divergence across multiple charts offers a glimmer of hope for traders seeking relief rallies. With Solana hovering at critical support levels, all eyes are on whether this bounce thesis plays out — or if further downside awaits.

Solana At A Critical Juncture As $100 Level Faces Pressure

Solana is now at a crucial technical and psychological crossroads as the $100 level remains a key price to hold. After a brutal selloff that intensified over the weekend, Solana dropped more than 20% in just a few hours, reflecting the panic and uncertainty dominating crypto markets. The breakdown below $120 signaled a major shift in sentiment, and the breach of $100 has left bulls scrambling to defend one of the last major supports before lower demand zones come into play.

Bulls initially lost control as price action turned sharply bearish last week, triggered by broader macroeconomic instability. US President Donald Trump's new wave of tariffs has intensified trade war fears, adding pressure to an already fragile global market. Risk assets like Solana have been hit especially hard, with many altcoins suffering from sharp drawdowns amid growing investor fear.

Still, there's a potential glimmer of hope. Bluntz contrarian view on X notes that he has begun bidding on several altcoins — including SOL and HYPE — that have dropped over 60% in near-vertical moves. He highlighted bullish divergences forming across multiple charts, which often precede relief bounces.

“I definitely don't subscribe to the idea this is ‘THE BOTTOM,'” he added, “but sizeable bounces are highly likely in my opinion.”

While the long-term trend remains under pressure, signs of oversold conditions and hidden strength could offer traders short-term opportunities. For Solana, the ability to reclaim and hold the $100 level could spark a recovery bounce. Otherwise, deeper losses may follow.

Price Action Details: Key Liquidity Levels

Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $108 after several volatile days attempting to hold above the critical $100 support level. This price range has become a major battleground for bulls and bears, as sentiment across the broader crypto market remains fragile. Macroeconomic instability, rising trade tensions, and ongoing selling pressure have pushed risk assets into uncertain territory — and Solana is no exception.

Bulls are now faced with a crucial challenge. To shift the momentum and signal the beginning of a recovery phase, SOL must not only defend the $100 mark but also reclaim the $120 level, which previously acted as support before turning into resistance. A breakout above this zone could open the door for further gains and a potential short-term trend reversal.

However, failure to hold the $100 level would likely lead to a deeper retracement. Analysts warn that a decisive breakdown below this support could send SOL plunging into the $80 range, where the next significant demand zone sits. With price action hanging in the balance, the coming days will be critical for Solana's trajectory — either triggering a recovery bounce or accelerating the current downtrend.

9th April 2025 – (New York) Cryptocurrency expert Joao, known for accurately predicting significant market movements, has turned his attention to XRP, suggesting that the altcoin may face further declines following its recent crash below the $2 mark. Joao's insights come as part of a broader examination of XRP's potential trajectory, warning that the price might slip below $1, inducing further pain for holders.

On his TradingView platform, Joao shared an ominous outlook, describing a potential long-term distribution phase that could be the most turbulent scenario for XRP. His accompanying chart detailed a “radical distribution scheme” that could extend into late 2025, demonstrating the analyst's concern about the altcoin's current market dynamics.

Joao explained that XRP could first exhibit signs of weakness, potentially dropping below levels last seen during the COVID-19 market plunge, with the price possibly approaching $0.10. He outlined two possible scenarios for this downward trend. In the first scenario, dubbed Scheme 1, Joao predicts that XRP could dip to $0.10 before staging a bounce back to around $0.40, which he identifies as the final point of significant selling pressure.

Conversely, in Scheme 2, Joao suggested a more dramatic outcome, where XRP could experience a rally between $5 and $6.80, with an average peak anticipated around $5.5 to $5.7. Such an outcome would likely incite a wave of euphoria among traders. However, Joao cautioned that this scenario is just one of several extreme possibilities, emphasising that XRP's future price movements will heavily depend on various factors, including Bitcoin's performance, the activities of market makers, overall supply and demand, public interest in digital assets, and broader macroeconomic conditions.

Adding to the chorus of caution, fellow crypto analyst John highlighted a bearish trend for XRP. He noted that the retracement of the altcoin's price could extend to levels not seen since mid-2024, predicting a drop to the Fibonacci price level of $0.3827. John pointed out a bearish engulfing pattern that appeared on XRP's weekly chart in late March, which has reinforced his outlook for a potential decline.

In a more nuanced assessment, Egrag Crypto, another prominent voice in the crypto analysis community, stated that an ascending broadening wedge formation suggests a 70% chance of a downside breakout for XRP. He indicated that should this scenario unfold, the predicted move for XRP could see it fall to approximately $0.65, further exacerbating current concerns among investors.

As the market grapples with these ominous forecasts, $1.90 has emerged as a critical resistance level for XRP. Analyst CasiTrades noted in a post on X that following the significant market downturn on Black Monday, April 7, where the price dipped to around $1.61, this level has become a formidable barrier. This drop not only established new extremes on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) but also narrowly missed major support levels, raising concerns among traders.

CasiTrades reported that although XRP has rebounded to test the $1.90 resistance, the next support level is identified at $1.55, coinciding with the golden .618 Fibonacci retracement level. She posited that this price action aligns with the development of a Wave 3 pattern, which could set the stage for a break through all-time highs (ATHs).

Interestingly, CasiTrades asserted that if XRP can manage to establish a bottom near the $1.55 mark, it could significantly strengthen the bullish case for a rally this month, potentially elevating the price to between $8 and $13. If the altcoin were to achieve such a rally, it would not only signify a critical breakthrough of its ATH resistance but could also propel XRP to unprecedented heights.

 Core's Rich Rines told Cointelegraph that the success of its staking model shows there's a way for Bitcoin to be more productive. 

Core, a proof-of-stake blockchain built on Bitcoin, has surpassed $260 million in dual-staked assets as institutional interest in Bitcoin-based decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to grow.

Core's initial contributor, Rich Rines, told Cointelegraph that as of April 7, over 44 million Core tokens have been dual-staked with 3,140 Bitcoin (BTC). At the time of writing, the assets are worth about $260 million. 

Core's dual-staking model lets Bitcoin holders earn higher yields with CORE tokens. While users can stake BTC at a lower rate, those who stake BTC with Core tokens get an enhanced yield. 

“Dual Staking can multiply base staking rewards over 15 times, depending on how many CORE tokens are staked,” Core said in a statement. 

The latest milestone was driven in part by institutional investors integrating Core's staking model into their platforms.

Core Foundation said that major custodians like BitGo, Copper and Hex Trust have enabled their clients to gain access to the protocol by integrating dual staking. Core added that it had partnered with Maple Finance for a structured asset that uses Core's dual-staking to generate yield. 

Rines told Cointelegraph that institutions have been crucial catalysts to the early success of its dual staking model. He said the model unlocks new opportunities for institutions.  

“This shift has broader implications for the Bitcoin ecosystem. Historically, institutional BTC holdings required paying custody fees without generating yield,” Rines told Cointelegraph.

He added that by integrating Core's staking model, institutions can turn Bitcoin into a yield-bearing asset that offsets costs and unlocks new capital efficiencies.

At the time of writing, Core holds the biggest total value locked (TVL) among Bitcoin sidechains. Footprint analytics puts Core's TVL above $400 million, with a market share of 28%.

The Core team said the increase in the number of dual-staked CORE tokens highlights how the product fulfills its design. Rines told Cointelegraph: 

Rines emphasized that Core's dual-staking system offers a sustainable utility for long-term Bitcoin holders without requiring them to relinquish custody.

“This is Bitcoin becoming productive, not by trusting third parties, but by participating in a system designed to reward real alignment and long-term engagement,” Rines said.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has signaled a major policy shift toward fostering innovation in financial technology, saying the Trump administration will ""take a close look at regulatory impediments to blockchain, stablecoins and new payment systems.""

What Happened: The remarks came during his keynote address at the American Bankers Association conference in Washington.

The statement marks the clearest indication yet that the U.S. Treasury is preparing to reassess the regulatory landscape around decentralized technologies and digital financial infrastructure.

""We will consider reforms to unleash the awesome power of the American capital markets,"" Bessent said. ""Americans deserve a financial services industry that works for all Americans, including and especially Main Street. Under President Trump's leadership, the Treasury Department and I will deliver that to you.""

The announcement comes at a time when the administration is recalibrating its stance on both domestic financial regulation and international trade strategy.

Why It Matters: In a Q&A session following his speech, Bessent shifted to trade policy, outlining a plan to coordinate with U.S. allies on a unified economic approach toward China.

He acknowledged that while America's military relationships with its allies have been strong, economic cooperation has not always kept pace.

""They've been good military allies, not perfect economic allies. But we can probably reach a deal with our allies,"" Bessent said. ""Then we can approach China as a group.""

He issued a sharp warning to the European Union, which recently announced tariffs on approximately €21 billion ($23.2 billion) of U.S. goods in response to metal-related disputes. 

In particular, Bessent criticized signs of an EU pivot toward Beijing, noting that such a move ""would be cutting your own throat.""

Bessent emphasized that China stands alone in escalating trade tensions with the U.S., while several Indo-Pacific countries, including Japan, Vietnam, South Korea, and India, have initiated or expressed interest in trade negotiations with Washington. 

A Vietnamese delegation is scheduled to arrive in D.C. this week, he noted.

Bessent also addressed recent moves by the People's Bank of China, which has allowed the yuan to weaken for five consecutive sessions, pushing the currency to its lowest offshore level since the market was established in 2010. 

In a Fox Business interview, Bessent labeled China as ""the worst offenders in the international trading system.""

""What Beijing should not do is try to devalue their way out of this,"" he said, warning that such a move could trigger a chain reaction. ""Any devaluation campaign would spur the rest of the world to keep raising their tariffs to offset the devaluation.""

Aavegotchi, the crypto game, will leave the Polygon blockchain after members voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to migrate to Coinbase's Base blockchain. 

The open source game involves players using so-called Aavegotchis, which are like digital customisable versions of the Japanese Tamagotchi toys, to earn valuable tokens. 

The Aavegotchi community, including the game's founder Daniel Mathieu, say they are unhappy with Polygon's lack of support for crypto games. 

“Polygon has not shipped any significant updates or features to PoS to enable better ecosystem coherence or discovery for gaming,” Mathieu, who proposed the migration to Base, said in an X post.

A whopping 93% of the game's community voted in favour of the move.

It's another vote of confidence in Base, which under Coinbase's stewardship has grown into the biggest Ethereum layer 2 with $3.6 billion in deposits, and the sixth biggest blockchain overall, since its 2023 launch.

But for Polygon, it's yet another setback as the blockchain struggles to stay relevant in an increasingly competitive industry. 

Polygon's DeFi deposits, which peaked at $12 billion in 2021, have shrunk 14 times to just $850 million as it loses ground to newer competitors like Base and Arbitrum.

A spokesperson for Polygon told DL News that it respected Aavegotchi's decision, and that the gaming venture may have received a $500,000 to $1 million grant from Base prior to announcing the migration.

DL News could not confirm the grant or its details. Mathieu did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Aavegotchi is a somewhat niche game, but it's loved by many DeFi diehards because of its connection to top DeFi lender Aave. Aside from riffing on Aave's branding, the game counts the lending protocol's founder Stani Kulechov among its advisors. 

Base wasn't the only blockchain Aavegotchi considered for its migration. Mathieu also looked at moving the game to the Arbitrum or Ronin blockchains. 

He said he ultimately decided on Base due to the Aavegotchi team's close relationship with the Base team, and the blockchain's strong ties to Coinbase and crypto social media platform Farcaster.

Now the Aavegotchi community has endorsed the move, work can begin on the migration. 

The plan is to permanently lock the Aavegotchi smart contracts on Polygon, then clone all contracts and assets and deploy them on Base, a process that should take four to six weeks.

Mathieu said much of the migration work has already been done due to a previous plan to move the game to its own dedicated layer 3 blockchain. 

It's not the first falling out between Aave's community and Polygon. 

In December, two major Aave DAO delegates told DL News they would vote to shutter the lending protocol's Polygon version over a proposal to invest $1 billion in idle crypto on the Polygon-Ethereum bridge with a competitor.

Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron told DL News at the time that the proposal was in a preliminary stage and many months from becoming a reality, and characterised the Aave delegates' proposed response as “anti-competitive.” 

Aave currently accounts for around 38% of all DeFi deposits on the Polygon blockchain.

Source Newsroom: 
Higher Education Press 

Newswise — Researchers from Shanghai Jiao Tong University have developed Dynamic-EC, a new blockchain storage method that significantly reduces storage overhead—by up to 42%—and increases data processing speeds by 25%.

Unlocking Blockchain's Potential Blockchain technology promises secure and transparent data storage for finance, healthcare, and logistics industries. However, high storage costs and slow processing speeds have limited its adoption. Dynamic-EC addresses these barriers, making blockchain systems more affordable, efficient, and scalable. This is especially important as the global blockchain market continues to expand into the billions of dollars.

Dynamic vs. Static Encoding Current blockchain storage methods such as BFT-Store and Partition Chain reduce storage costs compared to traditional full replication methods but rely on static encoding schemes. These static methods always assume the worst-case scenario, using unnecessary extra storage. Dynamic-EC, however, uses a unique approach: it dynamically adjusts the redundancy levels based on real-time network risk. By monitoring node reliability through an innovative reputation system, it allocates storage resources only when necessary.

Clear Advantages Over Existing Methods Dynamic-EC outperforms current blockchain storage methods. Compared to BFT-Store and Partition Chain, Dynamic-EC reduced blockchain storage overhead by up to 42%. Additionally, data writing latency—the time needed to process and store new information—was reduced by up to 25%, resulting in faster blockchain performance. Moreover, Dynamic-EC actively identifies and deters malicious nodes, enhancing overall network security and reliability.

Smart Adaptation to Real-Time Risks Dynamic-EC integrates an advanced node reputation evaluation system, classifying nodes into trustworthy, risky, or malicious categories based on past actions. It actively adapts data redundancy based on actual threats observed in the network. This real-time adaptability conserves storage resources and optimizes performance.

“Dynamic-EC is an important step forward because it demonstrates that blockchain systems can be both highly secure and highly efficient,” said Professor Minyi Guo, lead researcher from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. “By dynamically adapting storage redundancy according to real-time risks, we've created a smarter blockchain that minimizes waste and maximizes performance—critical factors for blockchain's widespread adoption.”

With substantial improvements over static encoding methods, Dynamic-EC represents an essential advancement in blockchain technology. This innovation moves blockchain closer to mainstream adoption by significantly improving its affordability, security, and operational efficiency.

The US Treasury will re-evaluate regulations that may be hindering innovation in blockchain, stablecoins, and emerging payment technologies, said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the American Bankers Association conference on Wednesday.

— Crypto Briefing (@Crypto_Briefing) April 9, 2025

The review potentially leads to removal or modification of the current measures as part of the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to encourage innovation, investment, and competitiveness, especially in fintech and crypto-related areas.

“We will take a close look at regulatory impediments to blockchain, stablecoins, and new payment systems,” Bessent asserted. “And we will consider reforms to unleash the awesome power of the American capital markets.”

One of the key priorities of the current administration is to stimulate economic growth through aggressive deregulation efforts aimed at reducing government oversight and regulatory burdens across industries.

The goal is to create a more balanced regulatory environment that fosters economic growth and benefits “Main Street,” not just Wall Street, according to the Treasury Secretary.

“Americans deserve a financial services industry that works for all Americans, including and especially Main Street,” Bessent added. “Under President Trump's leadership, the Treasury Department and I will deliver that to you.”

Mark Uyeda, the acting chair of the US SEC, has recently instructed staff to review regulatory statements concerning crypto, including digital asset investment contract analysis and Bitcoin futures under the Investment Company Act.

The move aligns with Executive Order 14192, which aims to reduce regulatory burdens and encourage economic growth by potentially modifying or rescinding certain SEC rules. These reviews could lead to more streamlined regulations for crypto companies.

AI cybersecurity startup Octane has emerged from stealth and announced it secured $6.75 million in a seed funding round.

Octane will use the funding to accelerate the development of its platform that uses machine learning to continuously analyze blockchain codebases, identify vulnerabilities and remediate them before they can be exploited, the company said in a Tuesday (April 8) press release.

“Flawed blockchain code enables billions in theft across crypto, with vulnerable smart contracts creating an ever-expanding attack surface as more value enters the ecosystem,” Octane CEO Giovanni Vignone said in the release.

Octane's platform helps developers catch bugs before deployment and throughout the software development cycle, according to the release. It will soon offer code analysis for off-chain codebases as well.

The company's seed funding round was co-led by Archetype and Winklevoss Capital, per the release.

“Securing smart contracts on the blockchain is one of the biggest challenges facing any crypto developer,” Tyler Winklevoss said in the release. “Octane allows devs to battle-test their smart contract code with AI-powered security testing before it hits production on the blockchain. This is huge for devs, companies and mainstream crypto adoption.”

A growing share of chief operating officers at organizations that generate more than $1 billion in annual revenue have implemented AI-powered automated cybersecurity management systems, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence report, “COOs Leverage GenAI to Reduce Data Security Losses.”

The report found that the share of these COOs who said their companies have implemented these systems leapt from about 17% in May to 55% in August.

This growth has been driven by COOs' demand for GenAI-driven solutions to improve cybersecurity management at a time when companies face the threat of cyberattacks that are growing more sophisticated, according to the report.

Dream, a company focused on AI-powered cybersecurity for nations and critical infrastructure, said in February that it raised $100 million in a Series B funding round to expand into additional markets in which cyber threats pose challenges to national security.

In September, Torq raised $70 million in a Series C funding round to expand its AI-first cybersecurity hyperautomation solutions that automate, manage and monitor critical security operations center (SOC) responses.

The chase for Alexander Ovechkin collectibles remains hot after his record-setting 895th goal Sunday, which moved him ahead of Wayne Gretzky as the NHL's all-time leading goal-scorer.

But it isn't all sticks, jerseys and pucks.

NHL Breakaway, the official digital collectible (NFT) platform of the NHL (much in the same vein as NBA TopShot), has created a 1/1 NFT in honor of Ovechkin's landmark goal and is selling it via auction at Heritage.

The pre-sale estimate for the NFT is $25,000, and bidding has topped $7,500 with two weeks remaining.

The platform launched in 2023 and is also selling digital packs dubbed “The Gr8 Chase” for $8.95.

As of early Wednesday, the platform had sold 3,000 of the 8,888 total packs created.

 A Florida federal court judge has signed off on an $11 million settlement between retired pro basketball star Shaquille O'Neal and buyers of the Astrals NFT collecton. 

Former NBA star Shaquille O'Neal has been granted final court approval to settle a class-action lawsuit for $11 million with Astrals non-fungible token (NFT) buyers.

Florida federal court judge Federico Moreno granted approval of the settlement between O'Neal and the class group led by Daniel Harper in an April 1 order made available on April 8.

The deal created a fund of up to $11 million for eligible class members and awarded $2.9 million in attorney fees and costs. All those who purchased Astrals NFTs from May 2022 to Jan. 15 and those who purchased the project's native GLXY tokens up until mid-January are eligible. 

“The fee sought by lead class counsel has been reviewed and approved as fair and reasonable by plaintiffs,” Moreno's order read.

O'Neal was hit with the lawsuit in May 2023 over his founding and promotion of the Solana-based Astrals NFT project, which the suit claimed was an “offer and sale of unregistered securities.”

The class group said they bought Astrals NFTs and “suffered investment losses” due to O'Neal's “conduct” in promoting the project.

In August, Judge Moreno recognized that the class suit had alleged that the former NBA player was a seller of the NFTs. O'Neal agreed to the settlement in November.

The Astrals NFT collection consisted of 10,000 unique 3D digital collectibles created in April 2022 by the artist Damien Guimoneau in a Solana-based project that promoted a virtual world where users could socialize and play with others, including the basketball star.

There has been no activity or sales from the collection for the past two years, according to NFT marketplace OpenSea. 

Overall, NFT sales are still in deep bear market territory, with just $27 million sold as of April 7, down from more than $2 billion per week at the end of 2021, according to CryptoSlam.

An NFT is a unique digital item—like a one-of-a-kind art piece, music track, meme, GIF, or even a tweet—that lives on a blockchain.

You ever scroll through social media and see someone post, “Just bought this digital monkey for $50,000!” And you're like, wait, what?! A picture? For that kind of money? You can't even touch it. You can't hang it on your wall without a screen. So, what gives?

To make sense of this, we need to understand what exactly these “digital monkeys” are—and no, it's not just about monkey pictures. They're part of something bigger, a trend that's been turning heads and digital files into high-priced collectibles known as NFTs.

NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token—but don't get too hung up on the term.

Here's the simplest way to think about it:

An NFT is a unique digital item—like a one-of-a-kind art piece, music track, meme, GIF, or even a tweet—that lives on a blockchain. That blockchain is what proves you own it. Kind of like a certificate of authenticity, but digital.

The word “non-fungible” just means it's not interchangeable. For example, one Bitcoin is always equal to another Bitcoin. But one NFT? It's one of a kind. It can't be swapped like-for-like.

Think of it as owning an exclusive collector's edition comic book or a rare baseball card. It's not just about the thing itself—it's about the rarity, the ownership, and the bragging rights.

Let's say you're a die-hard fan of superhero figures. Imagine getting a digital figurine that no one else in the world has—custom-made, signed, and verified. That's the appeal. But unlike physical collectibles that can get lost, stolen, or damaged, NFTs live in the digital world—unchangeable and forever recorded.

NFTs didn't suddenly appear out of nowhere. The concept was floating around as early as the 2010s, but it started catching attention in 2017 with the rise of projects like CryptoPunks and CryptoKitties. At first, it seemed like just another weird internet trend—people were buying pixelated characters and cartoon cats for thousands of dollars.

Then, in 2021, the game changed. Digital artist Beeple sold an NFT artwork for a jaw-dropping $69 million. Suddenly, NFTs were everywhere—artists, musicians, celebrities, sports teams, and even brands like Nike and Coca-Cola jumped on the bandwagon. What started as an online curiosity turned into a cultural and financial phenomenon.

At the core of NFTs is a process called minting—basically, the moment when a digital file becomes an official NFT and gets locked into the blockchain.

Here's how it plays out in simple terms:

You start with a digital creation—maybe a piece of art, a music file, or even a meme. When you mint it, you're turning that file into a unique token on the blockchain. That's where it becomes traceable, ownable, and sellable.

During this process, all the key information is permanently recorded: who made it, who currently owns it, and the full history of ownership and transfers. This makes NFTs incredibly secure and transparent.

To top it off, a smart contract—a bit of self-executing code—is attached. It handles things like resale rules and even royalties. So if your NFT is resold later, you (as the original creator) could automatically earn a percentage of that sale.

Once minted, the NFT is locked in. It can't be copied, tampered with, or forged. It's digital proof that this piece belongs to you—or to whoever buys it next.

NFTs aren't just about showing off digital art (although that's a huge part of it). They've started to shape the way we think about ownership, creativity, and value in the digital world.

Digital Art was the entry point. Artists who once relied on likes and shares to get recognition can now actually sell their work online—and not just once. Thanks to smart contracts, they can also earn royalties every time that piece is resold. It's a game-changer for creatives.

Gaming is another space that's buzzing. Imagine earning or buying a rare item in a video game—and then actually owning it, trading it, or selling it outside the game. Players are no longer just playing; they're collecting and investing, too.

Music and entertainment are catching on fast. Musicians have started releasing albums or exclusive content as NFTs. Fans get a collectible, and artists get a new revenue stream that cuts out middlemen.

Even events and memberships are being reimagined. NFTs can act as digital tickets to concerts or VIP access passes to private communities, both online and in real life. It's like turning a boring barcode into a collectible pass with perks.

And yes, people are even buying virtual real estate and fashion. From plots of land on metaverse platforms to digital sneakers, NFTs are pushing the boundaries of what we consider “ownable.”

As exciting as NFTs sound, the space is far from perfect. Users- especially newcomers- still need to be aware of a few bumps in the road.

First up is the environmental impact. Some blockchains, especially those using proof-of-work systems like Ethereum (before its big upgrade), have been criticized for their high energy consumption. The process of minting and validating transactions used to require massive amounts of computing power, which isn't exactly eco-friendly. Though things are improving—thanks to Ethereum's switch to a more energy-efficient model—this remains a concern for many.

Then, there's the problem of scams and fraud. Like anything new and booming, the NFT world has attracted its fair share of bad actors. People have been tricked into buying fake NFTs or sending crypto to phony sellers. In some cases, digital artists have even found their work stolen and minted as NFTs without permission. It's a space that still demands a lot of caution and research before diving in.

Another issue is price volatility. One week, an NFT might sell for tens of thousands of dollars, and the next week, it isn't worth very much. The market is still highly speculative, with prices driven more by hype than by any clear formula for value. This makes NFTs a risky investment if you're in it for profit.

Finally, there's the legal grey area. A big question that still looms is: What do you actually own when you buy an NFT? In many cases, you don't own the underlying content itself—just a record saying you own a digital version of it. That brings up tricky questions around copyright, reproduction rights, and what happens if a hosting platform goes offline. Legal frameworks are still catching up to this rapidly evolving space.

So, are NFTs here to stay? Or are they just another internet fad that'll fizzle out?

The truth is, we're still figuring that out. On one hand, they've opened up incredible opportunities for artists, creators, and collectors. They've introduced a new way to think about ownership in a world that's increasingly digital. But on the other hand, it's still a wild west—filled with risks, speculation, and lots of unanswered questions.

What's clear, though, is that NFTs have sparked a conversation. About value. About creativity. About how we interact with digital things in a very real way.

Whether you end up owning one or not, NFTs have already changed the game. And who knows? That next digital monkey you scroll past might just be worth a fortune—or at least make you think twice.

        Share    

A Florida federal court judge has approved an $11 million settlement between Shaquille O'Neal and Astrals NFT buyers, ending a class-action lawsuit over an alleged promotion of unregistered securities.

According to a court order made public on April 8, Judge Federico Moreno gave the green light to the deal, which sets aside up to $11 million for eligible buyers and includes $2.9 million in attorney fees. 

The case, led by plaintiff Daniel Harper, covered anyone who bought Astrals NFTs between May 2022 and Jan. 15 or picked up the project's GLXY tokens during that time.

The lawsuit, first filed in May 2023, accused O'Neal of using his celebrity status to promote the Astrals NFT project, a Solana-based collection of 10,000 digital collectibles tied to a virtual world concept, where users could socialize and play with others, including the basketball star.

Per the complaint, during the height of the NFT boom, O'Neal was active in the Astrals Discord, even posting the infamous “I'm not f***ing leaving” meme to rally holders, a moment also cited in court documents. 

But as the market soured in 2022 and 2023, the hype died down, and O'Neal allegedly distanced himself from the project, leaving many investors frustrated and stuck with sharply devalued assets.

The plaintiffs claimed they suffered financial losses as a result of his involvement and public endorsements, which they argued amounted to selling unregistered securities.

O'Neal reached a settlement agreement in November, following months of legal back-and-forth. The court acknowledged last year that the suit had a viable claim, suggesting the NBA Hall of Famer was a direct seller of the tokens.

This isn't the first time Shaq has faced heat in the crypto world. He's also part of an ongoing lawsuit related to his promotional work for FTX, the now-defunct crypto exchange. 

At the time, lawyers reportedly struggled to serve him court papers for months, eventually catching up with him during a Miami Heat playoff game in May 2023, held at the former FTX Arena.

 Charles Hoskinson says crypto must adopt cooperative tokenomics to compete with tech giants as US regulation opens the door to Apple, Amazon and others. 

The next generation of cryptocurrency projects must embrace a more collaborative approach to compete with major centralized tech companies entering the Web3 space, according to Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson.

Speaking at Paris Blockchain Week 2025, Hoskinson said one of the main criticisms of the crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) space is its “circular economy,” which often means that the rally of a specific cryptocurrency is bolstered by funds exiting another token, limiting the growth of the industry.

Hoskinsin said that to have a chance against the centralized technology giants joining the Web3 industry, cryptocurrency projects need more collaborative tokenomics and market structure.

“The problem right now, with the way we've done things in the cryptocurrency space, is the tokenomics and the market structure are intrinsically adversarial. It's sum 0,” said Hoskinson. “Instead of picking a fight, what you have to do is you have to find tokenomics and market structure that allows you to be in a cooperative equilibrium.”

He argued that the current environment often sees one crypto project's growth come at the expense of another rather than contributing to the sector's overall health. He added that this is not sustainable in the face of trillion-dollar firms like Apple, Google, and Microsoft, which may soon join the Web3 race amid clearer US regulations.

“You can't build a global ecosystem this way, and you can't win this way,” he said. “Because here's the thing. The incumbents are much larger.”

Hoskinson's comments came as the industry awaits progress on US stablecoin legislation, which may come in the next two months.

A secondary bill, the GENIUS Act — an acronym for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins — would establish collateralization guidelines for stablecoin issuers while requiring full compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws.

More participation from tech giants is likely after the stablecoin bill is passed. The markets structure bill may pass by September, Hoskinson said, adding:

“So if those barriers are removed, how do we, as an industry, compete against the wallet that Apple built in bundles with the iPhone,” he said, adding that crypto also needs to build infrastructure that the incoming tech giants can leverage.

Aiming to align blockchain network incentives, Cardano has been working on “Minotaur,” a multi-resource consensus protocol that combines multiple consensus mechanisms and networks to pay a unified block reward to multiple networks at the same time.

“You pay in the currency you want, and multiple networks are involved in securing the system and have a financial incentive to keep the system around,” Hoskinson said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","US DOJ Disbands NCET Crypto Scam Unit, Opts For Trump's Blockchain-Friendly Focus","https://www.techtimes.com/articles/309927/20250408/us-doj-disbands-ncet-crypto-scam-unit-opts-trumps-blockchain-friendly-focus.htm","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 02:20:24 GMT","

Four years after the US Department of Justice has established its cryptocurrency scam unit and watchdog, it is now disbanding the team as it tries to align with what the Trump administration wants for blockchain.

Over the past years, this specific unit has focused on going against the use of crypto for different crimes, including fraud, theft, and more.

Moreover, the unit has been successful in several high-profile cases against crypto exchange platforms for their different malpractices in the use of the decentralized finance for nefarious activities.

Reuters reported that a new memo from the DOJ has confirmed that it is disbanding the four-year-old National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET). The news was shared by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, with the Justice department now shifting its focus to a more crypto-friendly direction as is what the Trump administration wants.

Previously, the NCET focused on prosecuting cryptocurrency scams, which includes fraud, money laundering, and theft, with the team able to win several cases against crypto platforms like Binance, Bitfinex, and Tornado Cash.

This also goes alongside the newfound direction of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has stepped back on its crypto regulations focus, for a more welcoming experience for blockchain.

Blanche revealed in the memo that the Justice Department will focus on new ways to enforce against illegal crypto operations, which centers on individuals who are victimizing digital asset investors or those that use crypto for crimes. These acts of crime include terrorism, human trafficking, narcotics, hacking, organized crime, gang financing, and more.

It was revealed by the Deputy Attorney General that anything that is outside of the said scope ""should be closed.""

That being said, there are still massive risks tied to the cryptocurrency industry, particularly crypto scam activities that happen daily, in both domestic and foreign levels, according to Engadget.

One of the most significant promises of Trump's campaign for presidency is his fostering of the cryptocurrency industry for America and its citizens, expressing his desire to make the country the ""capital"" of the blockchain market.

During his rise to power, the market saw an exponential growth towards new all-time highs, and last month, President Trump unveiled the US ""Strategic Reserve"" initiative, which also helped prices to skyrocket.

There has been scrutiny against the cryptocurrency industry over the past years, and many companies like Coinbase and more have complained that the lack of regulatory clarity is implicating them for alleged crimes. Thanks to Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dropped the lawsuit against Coinbase regarding alleged illegal securities exchanges.

Apart from transforming the United States as the crypto capital of the world, Trump has also focused on making Bitcoin, the world's top grossing cryptocurrency, as a ""superpower,"" but he has not yet revealed the plans for it.

Furthermore, Trump has already mobilized certain advancements for crypto, such as his previous executive order for a working committee towards regulations.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","New York opens up to blockchain: study for the security of electronic voting","https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2025/04/09/new-york-opens-up-to-blockchain-study-for-the-security-of-electronic-voting/","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 14:04:10 GMT","

A new bill introduced in the State of New York could mark a significant turning point for the integration of blockchain technology in democratic processes. 

On April 8, State Representative Clyde Vanel introduced bill A07716, a legislative initiative that pushes to explore the use of blockchain to enhance the security of registri elettorali and risultati delle elezioni. 

This is a decisive step that could redefine the relationship between technology and democracy in the United States.

Summary

The heart of the proposal is the task assigned to the New York State Election Commission, which will have to initiate an in-depth study on the applicability of blockchain in the electoral context. 

Objective: understand if, and to what extent, this technology can improve the reliability and security of the State's voting system.

The blockchain, known for its decentralized structure and the ability to make data immutable entered within the ledger, brings evident advantages in terms of cybersecurity. 

The bill requires that, within a year, a rapporto conclusivo be drafted on the possible benefits of its application to the electoral system. 

The study, furthermore, must be supported by the contribution of experts in blockchain, cybersecurity, electoral fraud, and vote recording: a multidisciplinary approach that aims to accurately assess the potential of the technology.

The interest in blockchain applications for voting is not an absolute novelty. In the past, systems capable of using decentralized networks have already been experimented with to ensure transparency, traceability, and trust in the entire electoral process. 

A recent example comes from Williamson County, Tennessee, where the results of the Republican Party Convention elections were securely stored through the Bitcoin network.

Even overseas, the topic has sparked debate. About a year ago, Brian Rose, former independent mayoral candidate of London, stated that voting on blockchain could represent a true revolution for modern democracy.

His idea is based on the possibility of verifiably associating the identity of the voter with the vote cast, authorizing the creation of an immutable register that is accessible at any time: 

“Wouldn't we all sleep better at night if that identity and that vote could really be proven?”

However, experts warn against excessive enthusiasm. On one hand, the introduction of blockchain in electoral processes promises greater reliability, but on the other hand, there is a fundamental limitation. 

That is, the blockchain is only as efficient as the data that is entered into it. A concept summarized in the English phrase “garbage in, garbage out,” meaning “if you input garbage, you get garbage.”

In other words, technology can protect data from tampering after recording, but it cannot guarantee that the original data, once entered, is correct, authentic, or free from human or digital manipulations.

Deputy Clyde Vanel has now built a reputation as one of the most active supporters of regulation and technological promotion in the State of New York.

He is not new to legislative proposals regarding cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and protection of digital investors. 

Last March, Vanel proposed another bill to establish criminal penalties against fraud in the crypto field. Like the famous “rug pull”, where the creators of a project digitalize funds and then disappear with the investments.

The deputy's vision has also been felt in public policies. In fact, as early as January of the same year, Vanel recalled how New York had become the first state to establish a task force dedicated to criptovalute. 

This is aimed at delving into the use, regulation, and definitions related to the world of digital finance.

According to Vanel, who in the past has urged for greater participation of the blockchain industry in discussions with legislators, the sector needs to educate the regulators to promote a greater balance between technological innovation and public interest.

An idea that today is reflected in its latest proposal on electronic voting, in search of a more secure, transparent, and futuristic model.

If the bill is approved, New York could become the pioneer state of a digital transformation in American electoral systems. 

The adoption of blockchain would offer a new way to ensure the integrity of elections. Consequently making any attempts at fraud more difficult and increasing citizens' trust in democratic mechanisms.

However, in-depth analyses, rigorous testing, and expert opinions will be needed to transform a technological promise into a solid and widely adoptable solution.

The report expected from the Electoral Commission in the next 12 months will be decisive in understanding whether blockchain will truly represent the future of electronic voting. 

Or if it will remain, for a little while longer, a technology waiting for its opportunity. One thing is certain: the path towards the modernization of electoral processes is now set. And New York seems intent on leading the way.

Biden's crackdown led to a predictable embrace by Republicans

If you'd asked me five years ago which American party would champion crypto, I would have picked the Democrats. Economic inclusion, censorship resistance and sticking it to Jamie Dimon were the kinds of things they care about. Or used to.

Crypto has attracted its share of hucksters and psychopaths, but it's potentially a fundamentally different and a better way of organizing society. Blockchain can provide services similar to those from Big Banks, Big Tech and Big Government, but without the corruption and grift that has compromised them all.

If you'd asked me five years ago which American party would champion crypto, I would have picked the Democrats. Economic inclusion, censorship resistance and sticking it to Jamie Dimon were the kinds of things they care about. Or used to.

Crypto has attracted its share of hucksters and psychopaths, but it's potentially a fundamentally different and a better way of organizing society. Blockchain can provide services similar to those from Big Banks, Big Tech and Big Government, but without the corruption and grift that has compromised them all.

Crypto could – and should – be the great Democratic project. If you disagree, consider this: the too-big-to-fail banks are bigger than ever, but can't manage to pay a decent rate of interest, operate on weekends, or not mistakenly give someone $81 trillion (this actually happened). Also, they keep firing clients they don't like, possibly for political reasons. Global banks have paid more than$350 billion in fines since the 2008 financial crises, larger than the GDP of Pakistan.

Not to be outdone, Big Tech is also flailing. Bots, spam and political censorship have ruined social media, and Google's image-generating AI is more woke than a Hollywood airhead. Mark Zuckerberg may be sporting a new look, and Facebook may have gotten rid of its notorious fact-checkers, but this is still the same company that courted the Chinese Communist party and played a key role in the suppression of dissent over Covid policy. Consider me skeptical.

As for global governments, what is there to say? Public trust in all institutions of the state is fading, everywhere. Bitcoin, by contrast, has run for 15 years without ever going down, making a mistake, or needing a bailout. It has never censored anyone –American or Chinese, conservative or liberal. And its much-maligned volatility has mostly resolved to the upside. Since its inception, bitcoin has been both the most accessible investment on Earth and the highest returning – an unlikely combination. There are blockchain-based dollars providing hard currency to ordinary people in hyperinflationary countries and decentralized banks that provide credit to the types of people Wall Street doesn't want.

Instead of realizing its potential, the Biden administration tried to kill crypto in America. It misapplied dated regulations written for other assets, floated constitutionally dubious restrictions and tried to prevent crypto companies from getting bank accounts. There's a chance that the 2023 regional banking crisis started with the targeted assassination of several crypto-friendly banks – call it the “lab-leak theory” of bank runs. All of this had a chilling effect on the industry. Capital fled offshore and my American students couldn't get jobs without relocating.

Biden's crackdown led to a predictable embrace by Republicans – though some of the pro-crypto members of the GOP seemed to also arrive at their position due to principles of hard money and free markets. Trump was relatively late to embrace the technology, but as is his tendency, went all in once he did. He promised to make crypto a priority, pass sensible legislation and fire antagonistic regulators. He even spoke at a bitcoin conference. The official Republican platform included a section on digital assets.

Critics of crypto, along with sufferers of Trump Derangement Syndrome, explained all this by way of the strong fundraising and intense lobbying the industry conducted before the election to fight for its survival. But Trump's embrace struck me as authentic. Bitcoin is a populist type of money, and other applications of blockchain are fundamentally anti-elite. As a victim of social media censorship, Trump has personal reasons to appreciate a censorship-resistant technology. At a recent White House crypto summit, an industry attendee reportedly observed how remarkable it was that “a year ago we didn't know if we were going to jail, and now we are in the White House,” to which Trump replied, “Me too.”

On election night, the first sign of Trump's impending victory was a surge in his odds on a widely followed crypto-based decision market. The second was the price of bitcoin jumping to an all-time high. Both seemed apropos, for Trump and crypto seemed to be on the right side of history at the right time. But there is no free lunch, and the partnership has had a dark side.

Days before the election, the Trump family announced a multi-million dollar fundraising for their own crypto project. It was unclear why the world needed such a thing or why the Trumps were qualified to offer it. This was foreshadowing, for the project raised tens of millions anyway.

Then shortly before his inauguration, Trump launched a memecoin. This was on a Friday night when most of the crypto industry was celebrating him at an inaugural ball – many attendees didn't find out until the next morning. The whole thing felt both monumental and catastrophic, a sensation I fear I'll experience often over the next four years.

Memecoins are cryptocurrencies that don't really have a point. A cross between gambling and a joke, they are akin to a themed slot machine, but with billions potentially at stake. They are controversial even within the crypto industry. To the purists, they are a misapplication of a technology meant for a higher purpose. But they've always been popular, perhaps because they aren't so serious. You may have heard of the original, Dogecoin – its biggest fan being Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency. But there are countless others, and now there's $TRUMP.

There are problems with the President of the United States issuing such a coin. There's a possibility of insider trading and backdoor bribery. What if Vladimir Putin buys a bunch right before a ceasefire negotiation? Or what if the President bases policy decisions on whatever benefits his coin? But my biggest issue with $TRUMP is that it's not even a good memecoin. Part of the appeal of a true memecoin is that the distribution is fair: there are no insiders. A coin that has no point can just be given away. This stands in contrast to more serious crypto projects that need to raise money first, so they favor insiders and venture capital funds for early coin distributions.

Indeed, one reason the industry came to loathe the Biden administration was that restricting access to any new project's coin was the only way to be compliant – unless it was a memecoin.

The $TRUMP coin was the worst of all worlds: a highly touted coin that had no point, most of the supply of which was kept by Trump and his affiliates. This didn't stop buyers, many of whom were new to crypto, from bidding the price from less than one dollar to more than $70. The coin represented the vast majority of Trump's net worth, at least on paper. The mania only abated when Melania launched her own memecoin – revealing a more selfish intent. At the time of writing, $TRUMP trades near $12 and $MELANIA is almost worthless.

The response from leaders in the crypto industry was a deafening silence. Only a few brave souls dared to call it what it was: a money grab and a poor representation of the tech. Many confided concern in private, but didn't want to upset an incoming president. Joe Biden tried to kill their livelihood; Trump was going to make crypto great again.

This pattern of excitement, outrage and dissonance has repeated several times since then. At the time of writing, Trump has signed two executive orders on crypto and the vast majority of their provisions are great: an embrace of the technology, sensible regulations and a coherent federal approach. But some of it is controversial, such as establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, something that I strongly oppose.

Bitcoin is fine on its own. Government ownership imports government influence and threatens its free-market ethos. You'd think that all the other outspoken capitalists in my industry would agree, but they've apparently been bought off, either by the prospect of better regulations, or simply making money. I've long believed that bitcoin will eventually become a geopolitical asset. It's scarcer than gold but easier to store. Most importantly, it comes with its own censorship-resistant payment system. Such an asset is desirable at a time of global fracturing. But not for the dominant superpower and issuer of the reserve currency. America doesn't need reserves, it needs to shore up its finances and maybe not try to reverse decades of globalization all at once.

Crony capitalism has arrived on the shores of crypto, and the experience is bittersweet. Bitcoin is big enough to matter, but the industry around it will inevitably divert resources from private enterprise to government lobbying. I remain excited about all that blockchain and crypto can achieve – with sensible regulations.

But I'm also concerned by the motives of those who embrace it in Washington. To add injury to insult, Trump's aggressive tariff policies have now tanked crypto prices – along with everything else. All of which reminds me of the line from a Stealers Wheel song: “Clowns to the left of me / Jokers to the right / Here I am, stuck in the middle with you.”

World Liberty Financial, the Donald Trump family-backed DeFi project, reportedly started to sell its ether (ETH) stash at $1,465 a token despite purchasing the asset for $3,259 at the start of the year.

On-chain data from Arkham shows that a wallet closely tied to World Liberty Financial sold 5,471 ETH for around $8 million on Wednesday after racking up a $125 million loss.

The sale comes just two months after Eric Trump, the U.S. president's son, said it was a great time to buy ETH, which was trading at $2,880.

The main World Liberty Financial wallet still holds $98 million worth of crypto, $11.7 million of which is in ether.

Donald Trump wrote on Wednesday that it is a ""great time to buy"" on Truth Social while global markets tumbled on the escalating risks of a trade war.

Since Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20 the Nasdaq is down by 20%, S&P 500 by 17% and bitcoin (BTC) by 24%.

The TRUMP and MELANIA memecoins have fared worse, losing 83% and 95%, respectively, since Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. 

World Liberty Financial did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.

In a dramatic escalation of trade tensions, China has announced an 84% tariff on all imports from the United States, effective from April 10, 2025, according to the Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China. 

The move comes in direct response to the U.S. increasing its own tariffs on Chinese exports from 34% to 84% just a day earlier.

The State Council Tariff Commission, under China's finance ministry, described the U.S. actions as “unilateralism” and “economic bullying,” accusing Washington of violating international trade rules and undermining global economic stability. 

Citing national laws and international principles, China emphasized its legal basis for the retaliation, urging the U.S. to cancel what it called “wrong practices” and return to the negotiation table.

This tariff war marks a new low in U.S.-China trade relations, with both sides now imposing near-prohibitive tariffs on each other's goods.

This Bitcoin-focused hedge fund outperformed bitcoin last year.



210k Capital, the hedge fund for UTXO Management, was the fifth best performing single major hedge fund in 2024 according to HFR. It returned 164% net of fees in 2024. UTXO Management is the investing arm of BTC Inc., of Bitcoin Magazine and Bitcoin Conference fame.



This article first appeared on Blockspace Media, the leading Bitcoin industry publication dedicated to covering Bitcoin tech, markets, mining, and ordinals. Get Blockspace articles directly in your inbox by clicking here.



Single manager hedge funds are run by one entity, versus multi-manager or fund-to-fund hedge funds, which have multiple portfolio managers.



In HFR's recap of its 2024 Global Hedge Fund Industry Report Q4 2024, the research firm revealed that cryptocurrency-focused hedge funds were “the leading area of overall [hedge fund] industry performance.” HFR's index for cryptocurrency funds returned 59.81% in 2024.



UTXO Management's banner 2024 performance puts it in conversation with leading hedge funds that focus on traditional assets and industries. And it has bitcoin to thank for that – or, more directly, bitcoin companies.



UTXO Management's Co-founder and Chief Investment Officer, Tyler Evans, said that the fund's 2024 returns chiefly stemmed from its investment in bitcoin strategy companies, principally Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and Metaplanet.



“Over the last 12 months, we went very hard into the bitcoin treasury-play thesis as as we really saw it play out with what Saylor is doing, and the opportunity to really globalize it…So we did that pretty heavily in 2024, with both Strategy as well as Metaplanet out of Japan, where we were the first bitcoin investors in the company,” Evans told Blockspace.



He said that the hedge fund holds 80% of its portfolio in bitcoin equities, which were a “big factor that drove [210k Capital's] out-performance in 2024. A portion of that 80% includes public bitcoin miners, but the real money makers have been Metaplanet and Strategy, the latter of which 210k Capital held since the early days of its bitcoin strategy.



These companies, Evans explained, offer a novel form of securitized bitcoin exposure that makes it easier for everything from institutional firms to IRAs to pension funds to hold bitcoin-adjacent assets. As a result, “the investable landscape has grown significantly over the last few years,” he said, opening the door to “registered investment advisors, wealth managers, funds, and sophisticated family offices.”



This marks a shift from the fund's early days when it courted self-made, high-net worth individuals who were typically more active investors managing their own portfolio to more passive investors whom manage pools of capital.



“We saw the demand for institutional capital to get exposure to Bitcoin and the role that these Treasury companies can serve is securitizing bitcoins for fixed income investors, the insurance funds, or the mutual funds,” said Evans.



“These institutional allocators have very defined mandates of what types of instruments that they can invest in. And that's really the beauty of the whole playbook is securitizing bitcoin in these different formats that make it so that institutional allocators can invest into it.”



Bitcoin ETFs, first approved in January 2024, offer liquidity as well. With BlackRock on board – not to mention it recommending a 5% allocation to bitcoin – Evans said the Overton Window for how investors view bitcoin is shifting. So much so that the Wisconsin Teacher's pension now holds bitcoin ETFs, as does the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund.



The only thing harder than winning the championship is defending your title. And with bitcoin down year-to-date, it raises the question: can 210k Capital top 2024?



Evans said that the fund hedges its positions with a number of auctions, but it's also still “very bullish” on bitcoin in 2025. It's even more bullish on exporting Michael Saylor's corporate bitcoin treasury Strategy strategy to other financial markets.



“We think that there's an opportunity for a bitcoin treasury company in every tier-one financial market globally,” he said.



UTXO Management had a large hand in standing up Metaplanet's bitcoin treasury in Japan. Tyler Evans served as an independent director and UTXO Management partner Dylan Leclair acting as Metaplanet's head of bitcoin strategy. Another UTXO portfolio company, The Smarter Web Company, is set to IPO on the Aquis Exchange in the U.K. this week.

Public bitcoin treasury companies like Metaplanet give traditional investors access to bitcoin where other vehicles are limited. In Japan, for example, there are no native bitcoin ETFs, and access to American ones is limited. This – plus Japan's low interest rates and a lower capital gains tax on equities cryptocurrencies – make it ripe for Metaplanet to reap market share, Evans believes.



UTXO has its eye on multiple markets to incubate bitcoin treasury companies, including Latin America, Central America, the Middle East, Australia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Some of these are already in the works “at various stages of maturity,” Evans teased, with some in the IPO planning stage and others raising capital.



“Our inbound deal flow of seasoned entrepreneurs who want to bring it to their own local market is growing massively,” he said.

Binance Futures will soon introduce LDUSDT, a reward-bearing margin asset that accrues rewards to holders.

Traders can swap their tether (USDT) on Binance's Simple Earn Flexible Product for LDUSDT, which can then be utilized as margin for stablecoin-margined futures trading.

Binance said LDUSDT builds on the success of BFUSD, its inaugural reward-bearing margin asset, which debuted earlier and enabled users to earn annual percentage yields (APY) through the exchange's hedging and investment strategies.“After the launch of our first reward-bearing margin asset, BFUSD, was positively received by users, we are pleased to introduce yet another product to bring more utility to our users,"" Jeff Li, VP of Product at Binance said in a statement. ""LDUSDT increases capital efficiency for users and lets users put their assets to work for them as both a reward-earning and liquid trading margin asset, all while retaining flexibility to redeploy their capital at any time. 

As such, LDUSDT is not a stablecoin but a crypto token designed specifically for use as futures trading margin while simultaneously offering reward-earning potential. As of Wednesday, annualized yields for holding the token are around 1.5%, per The Block, and will be updated on a minute-by-minute basis.

This week's tariff-inspired market meltdown has led to a rapid sell-off across crypto-assets, with BTC trading below $80K and ETH hitting a two-year low of $1,432. The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector was not entirely immune to the chaos as total value locked (TVL) slumped to its lowest point since November at $95 billion. 

But it wasn't all bad news for DeFi.

Amidst plunging asset prices, DeFi showed resilience with muted outflows with key usage metrics faring far better than the price of ETH, the asset that underpins much of Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem.

TVL on Aave, the largest DeFi protocol, rose in ETH terms this week as deposits hit a record high of 11.02 million ($17.32 billion). Deposits have been steadily increasing since the turn of the year when it stood at 3 million ETH.

What this shows is that whilst the recent bull market was focused on hype-fueled meme coins, the real-world use case of DeFi is still very much alive. In previous cycles DeFi has suffered due to centralized exchange dominance and a lack of liquidity, now capital is flooding in as traders deploy delta-neutral strategies, which increases liquidity on the long-term health of DeFi. 

As the market edges closer to bearish territory, DeFi may well be one of the pillars keeping crypto afloat.

Aave was not the only protocol to experience inflows this week. TVL on Sky - formerly MakerDAO –  increased from 1.85M ETH to 4.63M ETH. Lending protocol Spark also had a 1 million ETH boost in deposits earlier this month, according to DefiLlama.

The rush to DeFi during a market sell-off can be attributed to traders looking to de-risk, moving to stablecoins to acquire a delta-neutral yield through lending and borrowing instead of holding spot exposure during a volatile market.

Decentralized exchange volumes have also remained steady, hitting $11.8 billion on Monday and $9.8 billion halfway through Tuesday compared to last week when volumes failed to top $7 billion on any single day.

 Bitcoin's correlation with traditional stocks may be declining, but the fiat money supply remains BTC's main price catalyst. 

The evolving relationship between Bitcoin and traditional financial markets is under renewed pressure as global investors flee risk assets amid intensifying US trade tensions.

US-listed spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded their fourth consecutive day of outflows on April 8, with more than $326 million in net redemptions across products, according to data from Farside Investors.

BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) saw the largest sell-off of over $252 million, its biggest daily outflow since Feb. 26.

The selling pressure follows US President Donald Trump's April 2 announcement of sweeping reciprocal import tariffs, which triggered a historic $5 trillion wipeout in the S&P 500 over two days.

The delayed crypto market turbulence after the tariff-related sell-off in traditional markets highlights Bitcoin's “evolving relationship with traditional markets,” according to Lennix Lai, global chief commercial officer at OKX exchange.

Lai told Cointelegraph:

Some industry leaders attributed Sunday's sell-off to Bitcoin's 24/7 liquidity mechanics, which made BTC the only large liquid asset available for de-risking over the weekend.

While there is an “encouraging sign” of a weakening correlation between Bitcoin and equities, Bitcoin's price trajectory remains tied to global liquidity conditions, Lai said, adding:

“What's most significant here isn't just price action but Bitcoin's growing conceptual influence — people increasingly view it as a valid strategic reserve asset for diversification in chaotic traditional markets,” Lai added.

Other analysts also see the growing money supply as Bitcoin's main catalyst.

“Bitcoin trades solely based on the market expectation for the future supply of fiat,” according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and chief investment officer of Maelstrom.

 Bitcoin overtaking the US dollar is “an actual truth to grapple with,” says a crypto analyst. 

The lingering fears triggered by US President Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs have analysts increasingly convinced that Bitcoin is now more likely than ever to challenge the US dollar in the years ahead.

“Higher chance Bitcoin survives over the dollar in our lifetime after today,” Bitwise Invest head of alpha strategies Jeff Parks said in an April 9 X post.

“First time the thought hit me and didn't feel like theory but an actual truth to grapple with,” Parks added. 

Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley shared a similar view, noting that with trust in the US dollar waning and other foreign currencies seen as “even weaker,” investors are left with fewer choices. 

He argued that gold, typically seen as a safe harbor amid uncertainty, also has drawbacks around shipping and storage and implied that Bitcoin may be the only option left. “You wind up buying Bitcoin,” Horsley said.

The US Dollar Index — which tracks its strength against a basket of major currencies —  is trading at 102.193, down 5.84% since Jan. 1, according to TradingView. However, Wall Street analysts were mistaken in thinking that the tariffs would bolster the US dollar, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report.

On April 2, Trump signed an executive order establishing a 10% baseline tariff on all imports from all countries, which took effect on April 5. Harsher reciprocal tariffs on trading partners with which the US has the largest trade deficits then kicked in on April 9.

Uncertainty around the tariffs and fears of a broader recession have been major catalysts for a wide traditional and crypto market decline.

Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $76,301, down 18.37% since Jan. 1, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Bitcoin author Saifedean Ammous said in an April 8 X post that America's issue isn't with one specific country's deficit but with aggregate deficits worldwide due to having a “fiat money printer.”

Related: Bitcoin weekly RSI hits bull market low as trader sees $70K BTC price bottom

“An ever-increasing number of Americans can live off the money printer as long as the rest of the world is using the dollar,” Ammous said.

He argued that the real solution is to stop printing “fake money” and move to a hard store of value, naming Bitcoin or gold as examples.

“Another way to solve this problem would be for the world to move to a hard money standard and stop using America's shitcoin, and give Trump the trade surpluses he thinks he wants.”

 The ETH/BTC ratio has fallen to a five-year low as Ethereum has dropped to $1,400 amid a broader crypto market slump. 

Ethereum has only outperformed Bitcoin for 15% of all trading days since its launch almost a decade ago, according to analysts.

Since Ether (ETH) began trading in mid-2015, it has underperformed against Bitcoin (BTC) 85% of the time, analyst James Check said in an April 8 X post.

Data shared by Check shows that Ether significantly outperformed Bitcoin in its early years from mid-2015 to around mid-2017, and it had two short periods in late 2019 and early 2020 when the ETH to BTC ratio was in Ether's favor.

However, Bitcoin has outperformed Ether for the past five years.

The ETH/BTC ratio, which shows the price of Ether in terms of Bitcoin, fell to a five-year low of 0.018 on April 9, according to TradingView. 

The last time the ratio fell below its current level was December 2019, when ETH crashed to $125 while Bitcoin was trading at around $7,000. 

Ether has wiped out seven years of gains, plummeting a further 10% over the past 24 hours to under $1,450, below its 2018 market cycle peak.

ETH fell to $1,400 in early trading on April 9, according to CoinGecko. Comparatively, Bitcoin lost 6% on the day in a fall to $75,000, which is still 275% higher than its peak during the bull market seven years ago.

Ethereum advocates have aired concerns about the network's growth as the token struggled to gain traction earlier this year when Bitcoin hit a new price peak.

“I love Ethereum. However, it's time to face reality: Ethereum has had [around] the same number of active addresses for the past 4 years.” Web3 researcher Stacy Muur posted to X on April 8.

However, other researchers noted that most of the new addresses are on Ethereum layer-2 scaling networks, which have surged in terms of value locked onchain over the past couple of years, according to L2beat. 

While most long-term ETH investors are now holding at a loss, technical indicators such as fractal patterns seen in 2018 and 2022 suggest that the asset is approaching oversold levels and a bottom could be near the $1,000 level, according to Cointelegraph analysis.

 The Trump administration's global “reciprocal tariffs” could see cheaper crypto mining rigs for non-US miners as manufacturers look to offload stock initially intended for the US. 

The Trump administration's sweeping tariffs could collapse US demand for Bitcoin mining rigs, which would benefit mining operations outside the country as manufacturers will look outside the US to sell their surplus inventory for cheaper, says Hashlabs Mining CEO Jaran Mellerud.

“As machine prices rise in the U.S., they could paradoxically decrease in the rest of the world,” Mellerud said in an April 8 report. “The demand for shipping machines to the U.S. is set to plummet, likely nearing zero.

“Manufacturers will be left with excess stock originally intended for the US market. To offload this surplus, they'll likely need to lower prices to attract buyers in other regions,” he added.

Falling mining rig prices could see non-US mining operations scale up and take a larger slice of Bitcoin's total hashrate, Mellerud said.

US President Donald Trump unveiled his administration's “reciprocal tariffs” on nearly every country on April 2. Some of the largest crypto mining machine makers are based in countries hardest hit by the tariffs, including Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, which saw tariffs of 36%, 32% and 24%, respectively.

Crypto mining rig makers Bitmain, MicroBT and Canaan moved to some of these countries to circumvent a 25% tariff that Trump imposed on China in 2018 during his last administration.

Mellerud noted that Trump's latest tariffs would mean a mining rig that initially costs $1,000 would be priced at $1,240 in the US.

“In an industry as cost-sensitive as Bitcoin mining, a 22% price increase on machines can make operations financially unsustainable,” he added.

Mellerud believes a future reversal of the Trump administration's tariffs wouldn't restore US crypto mining operators' confidence.

“Even if these tariffs are rolled back within a few months, the damage is done — confidence in long-term planning has been shaken,” Mellerud said. “Few will feel comfortable making major investments when critical variables can change overnight.”

He said US miners felt reassured when Trump returned to the White House, expecting a more stable regulatory environment.

“But they are now experiencing the flip side of his unpredictable policy shifts,” Mellerud said.

The US accounts for nearly 40% of the network's hashrate. Mellerud said there's no reason for US miners to unplug their machines and doesn't expect the total Bitcoin hashrate coming from the US to drop.

However, the path to expansion is now “steep and uncertain,” he said, and as a result, the US could lose a considerable share of hashrate. 

Trump's tariffs have shaken up almost every market, including the crypto markets and Bitcoin (BTC), which is down 4% over the last 24 hours to $76,470, CoinGecko data shows.

Bitcoin is now 30% off the $108,786 all-time high it set on Jan. 20 — the same day that Trump re-entered the White House.

 Charles Hoskinson says crypto must adopt cooperative tokenomics to compete with tech giants as US regulation opens the door to Apple, Amazon and others. 

The next generation of cryptocurrency projects must embrace a more collaborative approach to compete with major centralized tech companies entering the Web3 space, according to Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson.

Speaking at Paris Blockchain Week 2025, Hoskinson said one of the main criticisms of the crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) space is its “circular economy,” which often means that the rally of a specific cryptocurrency is bolstered by funds exiting another token, limiting the growth of the industry.

Hoskinsin said that to have a chance against the centralized technology giants joining the Web3 industry, cryptocurrency projects need more collaborative tokenomics and market structure.

“The problem right now, with the way we've done things in the cryptocurrency space, is the tokenomics and the market structure are intrinsically adversarial. It's sum 0,” said Hoskinson. “Instead of picking a fight, what you have to do is you have to find tokenomics and market structure that allows you to be in a cooperative equilibrium.”

He argued that the current environment often sees one crypto project's growth come at the expense of another rather than contributing to the sector's overall health. He added that this is not sustainable in the face of trillion-dollar firms like Apple, Google, and Microsoft, which may soon join the Web3 race amid clearer US regulations.

“You can't build a global ecosystem this way, and you can't win this way,” he said. “Because here's the thing. The incumbents are much larger.”

Hoskinson's comments came as the industry awaits progress on US stablecoin legislation, which may come in the next two months.

A secondary bill, the GENIUS Act — an acronym for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins — would establish collateralization guidelines for stablecoin issuers while requiring full compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws.

More participation from tech giants is likely after the stablecoin bill is passed. The markets structure bill may pass by September, Hoskinson said, adding:

“So if those barriers are removed, how do we, as an industry, compete against the wallet that Apple built in bundles with the iPhone,” he said, adding that crypto also needs to build infrastructure that the incoming tech giants can leverage.

Aiming to align blockchain network incentives, Cardano has been working on “Minotaur,” a multi-resource consensus protocol that combines multiple consensus mechanisms and networks to pay a unified block reward to multiple networks at the same time.

“You pay in the currency you want, and multiple networks are involved in securing the system and have a financial incentive to keep the system around,” Hoskinson said.

Scientists May Have Finally Found the Mysterious Animal Hosts of Mpox

A team of researchers traced the wild animal source of the mpox virus to the fire-footed rope squirrel

One of the great mysteries of the monkeypox virus has been pinpointing its ‘reservoir' hosts—the animals that carry and spread the virus without becoming sick from it.

Now, an international team of scientists suggests that it has an answer: the fire-footed rope squirrel (Funisciurus pyrropus), a forest-dwelling rodent found in West and Central Africa.

Although the name ‘monkeypox' comes from the virus's discovery in laboratory monkeys in 1958, researchers have long suspected rodents and other small mammals in Africa of being reservoir hosts. And studies published in the past year have demonstrated that African outbreaks of mpox, the disease caused by the virus, have been fueled by several transmission events from animals to humans.

Pinpointing viral reservoirs is crucial to breaking the vicious cycle of transmission, says Placide Mbala, an epidemiologist at the National Institute of Biomedical Research in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. By identifying the sources, scientists could work with local communities to design strategies to shield people from infection—for instance, safe handling of wild-animal meat.

The identification of the squirrel is “exceptional” detective work and provides compelling evidence, says Alexandre Hassanin, who studies the evolution of monkeypox at Sorbonne University in Paris. He and others who spoke to Nature, however, aren't sure that the study definitively establishes F. pyrropus as a monkeypox reservoir, but they applaud the long-term wildlife-surveillance work.

The report was posted as a preprint, ahead of peer review, to the Research Square server on 8 April. (Research Square is owned by Springer Nature, Nature's publisher.)

Although mpox has affected Africa for decades, it captured headlines worldwide in 2022 when the virus sparked a global outbreak, fueled by human-to-human transmission. Last August, the World Health Organization declared another global emergency after a worrisome strain of the virus spread to previously unaffected African countries.

As these outbreaks have become more common, one question on researchers' minds has been their animal sources. A clue emerged in 2023 in Taï National Park in Côte d'Ivoire, where a team of researchers has been monitoring a group of sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys) for many years. In late January that year, Carme Riutord-Fe, a disease ecologist at the Swiss Centre of Scientific Research in Abidjan, noticed an infant mangabey with red skin lesions on its forehead, chest and legs. The fluid-filled lesions, characteristic of mpox, quickly spread across its body, and it died two days later.

Within two months, the disease had spread to nearly one-third of the group of 80 mangabeys; 4 of them died. The team identified the monkeypox virus as causing the outbreak and successfully sequenced the full viral genome from two of the infected animals. They were identical, suggesting that the outbreak originated from a single source, says Livia Patrono, a disease ecologist at the Helmholtz Institute for One Health in Greifswald, Germany, and a study author.

But what was the source?

For most outbreak investigations, scientists begin collecting animal samples weeks or months after the first reported cases. Animals don't always carry detectable levels of the virus, and those responsible for the outbreak might have left the “crime scene” by the time researchers arrive, says Fabian Leendertz, leader of the work and founding director of the Helmholtz Institute. This makes it difficult to pinpoint disease origins, he says.

In the case of the mangabey outbreak, however, “we were there when it happened,” Leendertz says. His team has been monitoring several populations of free-living, non-human primates in the Taï forest on a daily basis since 2001 to better understand pathogens relevant to humans.

When mpox struck in 2023, archived samples of the mangabeys' urine and faeces, as well as tissues and swabs from dead animals found in the forest, proved invaluable. Monkeypox virus showed up in faecal samples collected as early as 6 December 2022 from a mangabey called Bako—the mother of the infant that first drew researchers' attention.

Three pieces of evidence then led the researchers to conclude that Bako, who survived the infection without developing symptoms, had caught the virus after eating a fire-footed rope squirrel. The first was that they observed mangabeys hunt and eat F. pyrropus. The second was that they found an F. pyrropus carcass teeming with a virus identical to the one infecting the mangabeys one month before Bako's faecal samples turned positive. And finally, they identified F. pyrropus DNA in the earliest positive faecal sample from Bako.

“It's unbelievable how well things fit together,” Leendertz says.

Although scientists had occasionally found monkeypox virus in squirrels, this was the first evidence for cross-species transmission.

However, Délia Doreen Djuicy, a disease ecologist at Centre Pasteur of Cameroon in Yaoundé, says that the jury is still out on whether fire-footed rope squirrels are a reservoir host, or whether they are merely a susceptible species that occasionally contracts monkeypox and transmits it.

To prove that a species is a reservoir host, Djuicy says, there must be evidence that most of the animals can maintain and shed the virus without getting sick. But there is not yet proof of this for F. pyrropus, she adds.

Other rodent species, such as pouched rats (Cricetomys spp.), have been implicated in monkeypox transmission, too, Mbala says. So fire-footed rope squirrels might be part of a network of animal species responsible for sustaining the virus.

Leendertz says his team will next investigate both ongoing and past monkeypox infections in small mammals, including squirrels, in the national forest. They will study how these animals use the forest habitat and interact with humans.

Consuming wild animals is popular in many parts of Africa for complex reasons, including tradition, subsistence, civil unrest and commercial demand, Leendertz says. Those factors, he adds, along with waning immunity in people after vaccination against smallpox stopped in 1980, might be driving the acceleration of mpox emergence in humans in the past two decades.

This More Than 380-Year-Old Trick Can Crack Some Modern Encryption

A little math from the 1600s can make what people send to a printer more vulnerable

By Manon Bischoff edited by Daisy Yuhas

Hardly anyone is interested in my tax return—there's not much to it. And that's a good thing, given that an attacker might have fairly easily intercepted the encrypted communication between my laptop and printer when I printed the return in recent years.

In early 2022 information technology security researcher Hanno Böck discovered that some of these encryptions could be cracked in a process that he went on to describe in a 2023 preprint paperposted to the International Association for Cryptologic Research's Cryptology ePrint Archive. His method can be traced back to one developed by the French scholar Pierre de Fermat in the 17th century.

Fermat—most famous for his mysterious “last theorem,” which vexed experts for decades—contributed all kinds of useful things to the world of science in his lifetime. For example, he laid the foundations for the theory of probability and also worked a lot on prime numbers—those values that are only divisible by 1 and themselves.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

Mathematicians suspected they could use Fermat's work to break encryption—and Böck demonstrated that case.

Modern encryption systems are based on difficult math problems. They work like a padlock: the problem (the lock) cannot be solved without additional information (the key). A common procedure is so-called RSA cryptography, which is related to prime numbers. Decomposing large numbers into a product of prime numbers is difficult, making them useful keys.

Prime numbers are often referred to as the atoms of number theory—indivisible building blocks from which the natural numbers are constructed. Any other number can be written as a unique product of primes, for example 15 = 3 × 5 or 20 = 2 × 2 × 5. For small values, it is easy to determine the prime divisors. But what about, say, 7,327,328,314? So far, no computer program can quickly calculate the prime divisors of arbitrarily large numbers.

This limitation is precisely what RSA cryptography exploits. To understand how that kind of protocol works, consider a simplified example, where RSA is used to encrypts data with the help of large numbers. Suppose a person wants to send the word SCIENCE, which consists of seven letters, to a recipient in encrypted form. To do this, they use a large seven-digit number such as 6,743,214 and shift each letter of SCIENCE by the respective digit—so S shifts six letters over to become Y, C shifts seven letters to become J, and so on. The end result is the encrypted word CJMHPDI. A sender can now dispatch this to another person without a listener being able to decode the message.

The recipient, however, should be able to determine the original word SCIENCE, either with the key itself (6,743,214) or a clue for calculating the key. As the former always carries a risk—an attacker could eavesdrop on the communication between the two parties and thus intercept the key—RSA cryptography offers a way of reconstructing the key securely. The basic idea is that before sending the secret message, the sender and receiver jointly generate a key from publicly available information. Security is guaranteed by the fact that the sender and recipient each secretly use large prime numbers, which they multiply together, and only send each other the results of this calculation. An eavesdropper needs the prime numbers to generate the key. But because that person can only intercept the products and cannot factorize them, the eavesdropper is helpless. (The actual RSA protocol for the key generation is a bit more complicated, but that is the general idea behind it).

Nearly four centuries ago, Fermat was working on related problems. He wanted to know how to factorize numbers into their prime number components. He did this purely out of mathematical curiosity—at the time, no cryptographic methods for secure key exchange were known.

And indeed, Fermat found a way to factorize even large numbers that are the product of two prime numbers. His method is not complicated; you can do it with a calculator (though Fermat, incidentally, did not have one). To impress his contemporaries, Fermat demonstrated the method using the example number n = 2,027,651,281.

Fermat factorization works as follows: You take the number n, in this case 2,027,651,281, and take the root of it. As a rule, this will result in an odd value, as is the case here: √2,027,651,281 ≈ 45,029.45. You round up to get 45,030. This number is squared, and the original value n is subtracted from the result: 45,0302 – 2,027,651,281 = 49,619. Now you have to check whether the result is a square number. As it happens, 49,619 is not square.

So you continue. Start again with the rounded root 45,030, add 1 and then square the result in order to subtract the original value n from it—that is, 45,0312 – 2,027,651,281 = 139,680—and check again whether the result is a square number. Once more, this is not the case.

So you repeat the whole thing. This time you add 2 to 45,030 and square the result, from which you subtract the original value n: 45,0322 – 2,027,651,281 = 229,743. Again, this is not a square number.

Fermat must have had a lot of patience. In his example, you have to carry out the procedure a total of 12 times until you find a square number: 45,0412 – 2,027,651,281 = 1,040,400 = 1,0202.

And how does this help? In the above equation, a squared number y2 (in this case 45,0412) minus n equals another squared number x2 (in this case, 10,202). The equation y2 – n = x2 can be rearranged as y2 – x2 = n. The left-hand side corresponds to an equation known as the third binomial formula, (y – x)·(y + x) = n. This automatically factorizes the number n into two numbers y – x and y + x. For the example with n = 2,027,651,281, the two factors are therefore 45,041 – 1,020 = 44,021 and 45,041 + 1,020 = 46,061. Both are prime numbers.

In fact, this factorization method always works for odd n. But computers can only perform it fast enough if the two prime factors of n are not too far apart. And this was precisely the problem that Böck discovered in a program library used by various companies at the time. The prime numbers generated for encryption were not random enough, and the program often selected two prime numbers that were close to each other. This means that Fermat's factorization method can be used to circumvent the encryption.

Böck realized that the printers of certain companies used such inadequate encryption. They used RSA cryptography, for example, to protect confidential documents that were sent to the printer via a network. After his finding in 2022, these companies issued alerts and fixes to address the problem. We can only hope that other companies have closed such security gaps.

In any case, many companies will have to rethink their encryption standards in the coming years. Even if ordinary computers fail to factorize large numbers, it will be different with powerful quantum computers. Fermat would never have dreamed that more than 380 years after his discovery, computers that rely on complicated principles of quantum mechanics for their calculations might make use of it.

JWST Spots Giant Spiral Galaxy Shockingly Early in Cosmic History

Nicknamed the “Big Wheel,” a giant, spiral-shaped disk galaxy was spotted in an unusually crowded part of the early universe just two billion years after the big bang

By Gayoung Lee edited by Lee Billings

A giant spiral galaxy, nicknamed “Big Wheel,” as seen by the James Webb Space Telescope from some two billion years after the big bang. Big Wheel's starry disk stretches across more than 100,000 light-years, making it larger than any other galaxy disk confirmed from this cosmic epoch.

A newfound object uncovered in the early universe by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is challenging long-held ideas about how galaxies form. Dubbed the “Big Wheel,” it's a galaxy much like our own Milky Way—a humongous, spiraling disk of stars, gas and cosmic dust. But Big Wheel is even bigger than our home galaxy; it's some five times more massive and covers twice as much area.

And the weirdest thing of all about Big Wheel isn't even its size but rather its age. JWST has seen it from when the universe was only about two billion years old, which is remarkably young for a galaxy of such grandeur.

Typically it should have taken the whole age of the universe for a galaxy to have grown so large, says Sebastiano Cantalupo, an astronomer at the University of Milan-Bicocca in Italy, who co-authored a recent Nature Astronomy paper about the discovery. Compared with its much smaller, more nascent contemporaries in that bygone era, “you can clearly see Big Wheel is a true outlier,” he says.

The discovery is part of a broader trend in astronomy, as ever-larger and more capable telescopes look deeper into the universe, gathering light from cosmic vistas further and further back in time. Using JWST and other powerful facilities, observers have been able to glimpse some early galaxies just a few hundred million years after the big bang, says Vadim Semenov, a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian. Semenov, who was not involved in the new study, notes that Big Wheel is “one of the most extreme examples” of galaxy formation in the early universe, when that process was expected to be “far more vigorous and chaotic, driven by frequent galaxy mergers and the rapid accretion of material from intergalactic space.”

All that primordial intensity comes from the small size of the early universe, which had a higher density of the raw materials from which galaxies coalesce. But the neighborhood where Big Wheel lives is packed with an exceptional overabundance of matter even for that already-enriched cosmic epoch. That's probably where it got to indulge in a “heavy breakfast,” says Chuck Steidel, study co-author and an astronomer at the California Institute of Technology. According to Steidel, Big Wheel is somewhat like “a child that started off as the biggest on the block and ate everybody else's breakfast.... It looks like an adult galaxy at a time when there were only supposed to be children around.”

The study's lead author Weichen Wang, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Milan-Bicocca, was the first to notice Big Wheel in JWST's data. He initially thought the galaxy was an unhelpful distraction to his other, unrelated studies of this particular patch of the early universe. The giant spiral didn't look like it belonged there, so Wang assumed it was an interloper from much later in cosmic time that just happened to be in JWST's field of view. Upon further analysis, however, Wang and his colleagues were able to gauge Big Wheel's true cosmic distance, and they suddenly realized that the object they were seeing was in fact a faraway galaxy “that has grown really, really fast since the beginning of the universe,” he says.

But it's still unclear how exactly Big Wheel got so big so quickly. Matter pouring into growing galaxies tends to spark intense outbursts of radiation from rapid bouts of star formation and the voracious feeding of accompanying central black holes; such outbursts can cut off the flow of infalling matter, pushing material away from the forming galaxy and stifling further growth. “At the moment, I have to say it's a mystery—a complete mystery,” Cantalupo admits. Perhaps, he says, Big Wheel's crowded environment may have allowed for “some previously unknown physical mechanisms that [help] galaxies to grow.”

Semenov offers a gardening analogy: “It is like entering a garden in spring and discovering a perfectly ripe fruit you would expect in late summer,” he says. “To determine whether existing models can explain such galaxies, we need detailed theoretical and numerical studies that capture both the extreme galaxies and the extreme environments they inhabit.”

So, given that we've seen Big Wheel as it was some 12 billion years ago, what can we say about its status today, in our current cosmic era? Not very much of certainty, Steidel says—but its heavyweight status and population-dense environs hint that the outsized object may have eventually morphed into another, more familiar cosmic form. It may have become a giant elliptical galaxy, an egg-shaped collection of trillions of stars. When multiple large galactic mergers occur, this type of galaxy usually forms as a result.

“When we look at galaxies in a cluster of galaxies, they're almost all elliptical, so they look old, and they look like fuzz balls of stars,” he says. “They don't look like disks, but we don't really know exactly what their history has been. So there could be [known galaxies] lurking there that are descendants of things like Big Wheel.”

“One of the really fun things about astronomy is that you often find things that you were not looking for, and they turn out to be sometimes even more interesting than what you were trying to do,” Steidel says. “It's not a straight path all the time, and [Big Wheel] is what I would call a serendipitous discovery. Now that we know what to look for..., that, I think, will turn out to be quite interesting.”

Why People Feel ‘Tired but Wired' after Little Sleep

People on TikTok and other social media say they feel more alert when they have had fewer hours of sleep—but sleep scientists warn this is a false sense of energy

By Jocelyn Solis-Moreira edited by Lauren J. Young

A full night's rest is key for waking up alert and energized for the day. But a wave of social media habitués, across platforms from TikTok to Reddit, have recently boasted a contrarian-tinted trend: avoiding sleep to feel more awake. Many report feeling weirdly wired—and paradoxically more productive—despite snoozing for three to four hours instead of the seven to nine hours most experts recommend for adults.

But sleep scientists say the energy jolt some people claim to experience after acute sleep deprivation stems from a natural but fleeting sense of alertness that the brain uses to temporarily cope with insufficient rest. “I can't deny that, subjectively, people are feeling kind of wired,” says Jamie Zeitzer, a sleep medicine researcher at Stanford Medicine. “Physiologically speaking, that's not happening. They're not actually more alert.”

Still, social media and grind culture continue to romanticize the practice. And famous and infamous entrepreneurs have long attributed their success to prioritizing work over sleep. In his early years building Microsoft, Bill Gates often competed with co-workers to see who could run on the least amount of sleep. Elon Musk frequently pulled all-nighters and slept on the Tesla factory floor. That company's namesake, Nikola Tesla reportedly slept no more than two hours a night while working on an invention.

Sleep scientists, however, want to make the matter clear: no type of sleep deprivation is ultimately good for you. “Our biology requires sleep, and there is no way around it,” says Eti Ben Simon, a neuroscientist and sleep researcher at the University of California, Berkeley.

Scientific American spoke further with sleep experts about what happens in the brain when it runs on limited sleep and how this can affect health.

When the brain senses sleep disruption, it protectively acts as if something might be very wrong, and survival instincts kick in. The body produces a physiological reaction to keep the brain alert and energized, Ben Simon explains. The network of our sympathetic nervous system produces the fight-or-flight response, which uses stored energy to react against approaching predators.

A single night of sleep deprivation is a stressor, which acts via the central nervous system to activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This circuit between the brain and the adrenal glands triggers the stress response, and the adrenal glands secrete the wakefulness-promoting hormones cortisol and adrenaline. This in turn prompts the liver to release sugar into the blood, creating an immediate energy supply during the fight-or-flight response.

“That level of energy people might feel after a short sleep might actually be the stress response the body and brain are provoking to fight off sleep loss,” Ben Simon says. Zeitzer adds that the rise in cortisol from insufficient sleep is only a small bump, just enough to hide fatigue for a few hours after waking.

The energy boost from the sympathetic nervous system is temporary, and it does not mean people's brains are fully functional, however. Ben Simon says sleep loss experiments show people's memory and attention are immediately impaired after a single night of sleep deprivation.

Researchers generally describe five stages of the sleep cycle: wakefulness, three phases of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and one phase of rapid eye movement (REM). Clinical psychologist Michael Breus, who now works with commercial approaches to improving sleep, says the stage at which a sleeper wakes up can affect how they react to being abruptly roused and subjectively refreshed.

“The disconnect from the environment is so profound that if you wake up someone from deep sleep, it takes them longer to realize where they are and what has happened versus if you wake them up from light sleep,” Ben Simon says. And the longer a person sleeps, the greater the chance they'll experience sleep inertia—a temporary period of grogginess and mental fog after waking up.

Breus says it's possible people feel more “awake” if they're roused during the first or second stage of shallower NREM sleep. Waking up during these shallower sleep stages could decrease sleep inertia and make a person feel more energized during a deprivation period—but Ben Simon says the first half hour can be misleading. She advises people to take stock of their daytime activity levels and emotional responses to see how shortened sleep affects them.

Caffeine blocks a brain chemical called adenosine, which increases sleep pressure, or the biological urge to rest. But the world's most popular drug has a mean half-life of just five hours before it wears off in the body. Ben Simon emphasizes that caffeine does not get rid of the fatigue caused by sleep deprivation; it simply masks it. “Adenosine is still building up, but the brain doesn't sense it. So when caffeine wears off, you suddenly get this rush of adenosine—and that's when you realize how exhausted you are,” she explains.

“Many times, people who believe they can get by without sleep are masking that sleep pressure by ingesting more and more caffeine,” Zeitzer adds. Trying to compensate for this by consuming more caffeine—by chugging multiple cups of coffee or energy drinks, for example—can only help so much: one study found caffeine no longer affected people's alertness after the fourth day of partial sleep deprivation.

A single night of shortened sleep might seem harmless, but putting your body under the resulting stress has drawbacks. Losing just two hours of sleep can make people more impulsive and prone to making mistakes. Additionally, the energy from elevated cortisol and adrenaline levels fades over the day. “None of these things will be particularly sustained for a long time,” Zeitzer explains.

And accruing lost hours of sleep can have long-term consequences. Chronically losing sleep increases the risk of several health issues, such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. It's also associated with a decline in cognitive performance.

For a better way to reduce grogginess, Ben Simon advises people to sleep as much as possible for two to three days with no alarm clocks to catch up on rest. Lately, even some high-profile people have seemed to change their mindset when it comes to sleep. Gates, who once claimed sleep was unnecessary, now reportedly rests a minimum of seven hours every night.

The bottom line: You can't cheat sleep. There is no shortcut to being ready to seize the day—not when sleep is already the greatest life hack. As Ben Simon puts it, “It took Mother Nature millions of years to perfect sleep—to give us optimal performance and mental health.”

When construction workers started churning up skeletal remains, a project to renovate a soccer field outside Vienna, Austria, morphed into an archaeological dig, and it wasn't long before experts realized this field was actually a major discovery in Roman warfare history. 

They dug up the remains of potentially 150 males aged between 20 and 30 years, hinting that a “catastrophic event in a military context” happening at the site at the end of the first century A.D. 

The discovery of a Roman mass grave—noteworthy in and of itself because the Romans practiced cremation in Europe until the third century A.D.—could be “evidence from the immediate history of the founding of Vienna,” according to a translated statement from the Wien Museum, which announced the discovery. 

The archaeologists, brought in by the Federal Monuments Office after the soccer field renovation project started unearthing human bones, discovered that an oval pit roughly 16 feet in diameter and less than two feet deep contained the remains of around 150 peoples—the team discovered 129 individuals, but due to the damage done by the excavation, experts believe the total number could be over 150. 

“The individuals were buried without any recognizable order or orientation,” museum officials wrote in the statement. “Many lay on their stomachs or sides, some adapted to the shape of the pit. The limbs were intertwined with those of other individuals. This indicates a hasty covering of the dead with earth, i.e. not an orderly burial.” 

With every individual examined a male, most between the age of 20 and 30 years, and in good health combined with the causes of death due to injuries from blunt and sharp weapons, including spears, daggers, swords, and iron bolts, “the variety of injuries indicates a battle and not an execution site.” 

With cremation burial common in the European Roman Empire, finds of Roman skeletons from this period are considered rare, leading to this being one of the most significant Roman war discoveries in Central Europe. 

“The creation of a mass grave without cremation of the dead suggests a large number of casualties in combination with a lack of time and resources,” the museum wrote. “The battle wounds, on the other hand, rule out the possibility of executions, such as a punishment for military cowardice. Instead, everything points to the catastrophic end of a military operation.”

Experts dated both the bones and the grave goods to more precisely pinpoint the find to the end of the first century A.D. While most of the dead were robbed of their weapons and equipment, the team still discovered a Roman iron dagger with inlays of silver wire, several scales of armor that show distinct differences from known varieties, the metal cheek piece of a Roman helmet, two iron spearheads (one stuck in a hip bone, mind you), and hobnails from shoes that were made with leather and studded with nails, a type of footwear used by Roman soldiers. 

The museum wrote that the dagger was instrumental in the dating because its style was in use from the middle of the first century A.D. to the beginning of the second century A.D. 

According to the museum statement, historical sources indicate that Germanic tribes had repeated battles with the Roman Empire near the end of the first century A.D., and some of these skirmishes were extremely costly for the Romans. On the opposing side, the evident victory may have led to the founding of Austria's capital city.

“The mass grave in Simmering is the first physical evidence of fighting form this period and indicates this location of a battle in the area of present-day Vienna,” the museum wrote. “The defeat attested here could therefore have been the immediate reason for the expansion of the formerly small military base into the legionary camp of Vindobona—less than seven kilometers [4.3 miles] from the site of the find. Hasenleitengasse may therefore mark the beginning of Vienna's urban history.”

Jackpot.

A ceramic pot turned into a jackpot for a woman on a walk in the Kutnohorsk Region of the Czech Republic. While out on a stroll, the woman happened upon a roughly 900-year-old stash of more than 2,150 medieval silver coins known as denarii.

While the ceramic pot holding the coins was mostly demolished, the coins themselves remain a rich collection. According to a translated statement, they are now being processed by experts from the Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, and the Czech Silver Museum in Kutná Hora.

Dubbed one of the greatest finds of the last decade, institute archaeologist Filip Velímský believes the discovery is like winning a prize in the lottery—even if someone else was the loser. “It was probably placed in its place during the first quarter of the 12th century, at a time of internal political instability,” he said. “At that time, there were disputes in the country between the members of the Přemysl dynasty about the princely throne of Prague.” 

Stashing coins in a ceramic container was meant to be a way of keeping them safe. And the container certainly did it's job, even if the owner was never able to return for them—the coins weren't recovered for another 900 years. 

According to the experts, that owner couldn't have been just anyone.“Unfortunately, for the turn of the 11th and 12th centuries, we lack data on the purchasing power of the contemporary coin,” Velímský said. “But it was a huge amount, unimaginable for an ordinary person and at the same time unaffordable. It can be compared to winning a million in the jackpot.” 

The Kutnohorsk Region was known for frequent battles for the Prague princely throne, with the armies of individual rival princes repeatedly marching through the area, according to the institute. The experts claim that a large collection of coins found in such a place could mean that they were originally meant to pay wages for soldiers, or were some sort of “war booty.” 

Early analysis of the haul shows both that the coins were minted in several places throughout the Kutnohorsk Region, and that they were likely created under the rule of three different Přemysl leaders (likely between 1085 and 1107): King Vratislav II and princes Břetislav II and Bořivoje II. 

“The coins were most likely minted in the Prague mint from silver that was imported to Bohemia at the time,” Lenka Mazačová, director of the Czech Silver Museum in Kutná Hora, said in a statement. The coins are made from an silver alloy that included copper, lead, and trace amounts of other metals. The experts hope to figure out the exact composition of the coins to help determine the origin of the silver. 

While we may never know the true intentions—or provenance—of the coin collection, experts still plan to puzzle out as much as possible. Mazačová said that museum staff will now register all the pieces of the collection, clean and restore the coins, and subject them to X-ray imaging and spectral analysis to determine their specific material composition. The goal is to publicly display the collection in 2025, highlighting the 12th century history of the Czech Republic.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Decoding Animal Minds Could Reveal the Purpose of Consciousness, Scientists Say","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/a64420596/understanding-animal-consciousness/","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 13:01:00 GMT","

Early evolutionary pressures likely generated our shared, fundamental nature of mind.

Zebrafish enjoy exploring new objects. Garter snakes know their own scents. Octopuses will seek out pain relief, and fruit flies sleep best around other fruit flies.

Scientists say these are all markers of animal consciousness, a sign that animals, from Labrador retrievers to cuttlefish to jumping spiders, have far more sophisticated feelings than we've ever given them credit for. And they also say animals' lives revolve around more than just responding to pain. Non-human creatures also find joy in everyday experiences.

“Animals learn things, they're socially engaged with us, they see things and smell things and react to them,” says Kristin Andrews, Ph.D., a professor and animal minds researcher at York University in Toronto, Ontario. “They want food or cuddles or to chase a ball, and they communicate those wants to us by picking up an empty dog bowl and dropping it or even pushing buttons.”

Andrews worked with Jonathan Birch, a philosophy professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and philosophy and ethics researcher Jeff Sebo on a recent Science essay arguing for increased recognition of animal consciousness. It was published on the heels of a 2024 New York Declaration on Animal Consciousness signed by more than 500 scientists and researchers. Both documents argue that animals aren't just non-thinking drones, but rather they have rich lives we're only beginning to understand. That knowledge, they contend, could help us not only improve our relationship with and treatment of nonhuman creatures but help us understand our own human consciousness on a more fundamental level.

But first, what does it mean for an animal to have a consciousness? At its most basic, consciousness could mean being awake versus being asleep, or being self-conscious or self-aware.

“What we mean in this context is phenomenal consciousness. You could have feelings and sensory perceptions like you can see color or hear sound,” says Sebo, Ph.D., a professor in New York University's Department of Environmental Studies. “Or you have effective experiences like you can feel pleasure or pain or happiness or suffering.”

So researchers point to examples from across the animal kingdom of animals seeking joy, avoiding pain, and showing curiosity. A 2022 study of commercial bumblebees, for example, showed that the bees rolled wooden balls around in a form of play. They rolled the balls not because they were practicing a behavior that would be useful in the future, or as a way to attract a mate. They played with the wooden balls in “stress-free conditions,” researchers with the School of Biological and Behavioral Sciences at Queen Mary University in London explained. The ball rolling itself was a joyful experience, rewarding in and of itself.

A series of studies on crayfish, on the other hand, examined anxieties. Crayfish generally enjoy exploring dark places and are wary of brighter ones. That wariness increased when researchers shocked them. Scientists then gave the creatures benzodiazepines—an anti-anxiety drug used often in humans—and crayfish were suddenly much more willing to wander through the bright areas. The drug brought their anxiety levels down, in effect altering their perceptions of what was and wasn't safe.

Understanding that animals have consciousness matters—in part because it forces us to rethink what constitutes ethical treatment of animals, says Sebo. This thoughtfulness could ultimately lead to “some consideration and welfare protections on animals.”

For Andrews, this goes beyond the basic idea of should we, or should we not eat animals. It points to a more fundamental idea of how we treat conscious life. “Buddhist frameworks recognize the animal sacrificed its life for you, and Islamic tradition recognizes when you kill an animal you should kill them in a way that minimizes harm,” she says. “We have ways around the globe that recognize animals are broadly conscious and allow us to live our lives in a way we feel good about.”

But studying the ways animals experience feelings like joy and pain also allows us to take a deeper look at our own consciousness, Andrews says. She starts first by examining what consciousness is for. Why would, say, a jumping spider evolve with a consciousness?

The answer traces back much farther than those jumping spiders, because if consciousness exists in them, then it must have existed in some of the earliest forms of life.

Go back far enough, and you reach the trilobites, a now-extinct marine arthropod that lived for hundreds of millions of years. “If we then infer trilobites were conscious, what did they need?” Andrews asks. “What would make consciousness valuable?”

At the time of the Cambrian explosion, trilobites needed to be able to figure out how to stay together. Alone, they died quickly. Together, they had a greater chance of survival. So they may have developed some early sense of awareness of keeping groups together.

“The first way you solve that is to think about other beings. You feel bad when you're alone and feel good when you're together and that will make individuals clump back together,” Andrews hypothesizes.

What this teaches us is that the evolutionary root of consciousness—even ours—is about being together in community. “Love and concern for others is at the bottom of what consciousness gives us,” she says. “For humans, it emphasizes how important we are to each other, and pets, too.”

Andrews stresses that this is a hypothesis. As with any discussions of consciousness, especially in animals, it's impossible to know an answer with certainty. But strong evidence, she and the other authors say, points to animals having significantly more concern for themselves and others than we realize.

Japan's Ryukyu Islands, which includes Okinawa, are the exclusive home to two rare mammals, the Amami rabbit and Ryukyu long-furred rat. These animals are hard to observe, but conservationists wish to find out specific details about their diets. So researchers, including those from the University of Tokyo, inspected the teeth from deceased specimens to find out what the animals were eating, and at different times. Their findings show the rabbits have consistent diets, whereas the rats' change with the seasons.

When you think about Japanese islands such as Okinawa, part of the Ryukyu chain in the southwest of the country, you may picture sun and surf, but hiding deep within the shady forests on these islands are plenty of small mammals who have been living there for millennia. Some, such as the Amami rabbit, are considered ""living fossils,"" given their closest continental ancestors are long since extinct. They and another local resident, the Ryukyu long-furred rat, are both extremely rare. Given the increasingly complex and severe problem of climate change, and potentially other human impacts in the region, there are efforts to conserve these species.

""Climate change and human activity can adversely affect animals' environments. And this could be detrimental to their feeding patterns and food sources,"" said Associate Professor Mugino Kubo from the Department of Natural Environmental Studies. ""Because of this, and to build a better picture of the lives of these rare animals, we aim to clarify the feeding habits of these species and gain insights into their ecology to inform conservation strategies. Our latest research was to explore the diets of the Amami rabbit and Ryukyu long-furred rat, specifically their seasonal variations.""

Kubo and her team analyzed microscopic wear patterns, or microwear, on the surface of the teeth of both species, using three-dimensional texture analysis to determine what they eat throughout the year. The teeth came from wild specimens who had been killed on roads, and they compared those to teeth from laboratory-raised rodents who had known feeding histories. This comparison revealed what the wild populations were eating without the insurmountable effort of trying to monitor them, which would have been essentially impossible.

""Our results showed that Amami rabbits consume tough plants like ferns year-round due to consistent microwear; whereas the Ryukyu long-furred rats change their diet seasonally, feeding on soft foods like fruit, slugs and eggs in summer, and hard foods like seeds and acorns in winter, according to varying microwear,"" said Kubo. ""This research demonstrates that dental microwear texture analysis can reveal feeding habits of rare species difficult to observe directly in the wild. Moreover, our findings suggest ecosystem management should consider seasonal dietary differences more carefully.""

The team plans to expand on this research by comparing populations of these same species across different islands within the Ryukyu chain. They also intend to use DNA analysis and other methods to gain an even deeper understanding of the dietary habits of these species.

""While this study did not directly address the impact of human activity, previous research has shown that the unique ecosystems of the Ryukyu Islands are threatened by human activity, leading to population decline,"" said Kubo. ""Future comparisons with older museum specimens may reveal changes in diet or ecology caused by recent human activity.""

Wear and tear on plastic products releases small to nearly invisible plastic particles, which could impact people's health when consumed or inhaled. To make these particles biodegradable, researchers created plastics from plant starch instead of petroleum. An initial study published in ACS' Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry shows how animals consuming particles from this alternative material developed health problems such as liver damage and gut microbiome imbalances.

""Biodegradable starch-based plastics may not be as safe and health-promoting as originally assumed,"" says Yongfeng Deng, the corresponding author of the study.

Microplastics (plastic pieces less than 5 millimeters wide) are entering human bodies through contaminated water supplies, foods and drinks -- and even IV infusions. Scientists have linked plastic particles in the bloodstream and tissues to various health risks. For example, a study found that people with inflammatory bowel disease have more microplastics in their feces. Biodegradable plastics have been presented as a safer, more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional petroleum-based plastics. One of the most common types comes from starch, a carbohydrate found in potatoes, rice and wheat. However, there is a lack of information on how starch-based biodegradable plastics affect the body. A team of researchers led by Deng tackled this issue by exploring these effects in animal trials.

The researchers compared three groups of five mice: one group consuming normal chow and two groups consuming food infused with starch-based microplastics. The doses (low and high) were calculated and scaled from what an average human is expected to consume daily. They fed the mice for 3 months and then assessed the animals' organ tissues, metabolic functions and gut microbiota diversity. Mice exposed to the starch-based plastic particles had:

""Prolonged low-dose exposure to starch-based microplastics can lead to a broad spectrum of health impacts, particularly perturbing circadian rhythms and disrupting glucose and lipid metabolism,"" says Deng. However, the researchers acknowledge that because this is one of the first studies examining the impacts of consuming starch-based microplastics, further research is needed to understand how these biodegradable particles break down in the body.

The authors acknowledge funding from the Natural Science Foundation of China, the Jiangsu Province Young Science and Technology Talent Support Program, the Joint Fund of Departments and Schools, the Start-up Research Fund, and the Zhishan Young Scholars Fund of Southeast University by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A comprehensive map of the human cell","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/04/250409114658.htm","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 16:29:41 GMT","

Scientists have attempted to map the human cell since the first microscope was invented more than 400 years ago. But many components of the cell still remain uncharted.

""We know each of the proteins that exist in our cells, but how they fit together to then carry out the function of a cell still remains largely unknown across cell types,"" said Leah Schaffer, Ph.D., a postdoctoral research scholar at UC San Diego School of Medicine.

Now, Schaffer and her colleagues at UC San Diego -- in collaboration with researchers at Stanford University, Harvard Medical School and the University of British Columbia -- have created a comprehensive, interactive map of U2OS cells, which are associated with pediatric bone tumors. They combined high-resolution microscope imaging and biophysical interactions of proteins to map the subcellular architecture and protein assemblies in the cell. The map revealed previously unknown protein functions and will help the researchers understand how mutated proteins contribute to diseases such as childhood cancers. It will also serve as a reference for developing maps of other cell types. The study will be published on April 9, 2025 in Nature.

""Based on cell biology 101 and textbook pictures of cells, you might think that we understand everything about a cell. But what's remarkable is that for no human cell type do we really have a proper parts catalog and assembly manual,"" said co-senior author Trey Ideker, Ph.D., a professor of medicine, adjunct professor in Jacobs School of Engineering and member of Moores Cancer Center at UC San Diego.

The researchers used a technique called affinity purification to isolate individual proteins and document their interactions with other proteins. In addition, they analyzed more than 20,000 images of the interior of cells marked with fluorescent dye to light up the location of proteins of interest from the Human Protein Atlas. Combining these data for more than 5,100 proteins revealed 275 distinct protein assemblies of different sizes within U2OS cells.

""Historically, scientists have been biased by the notion that one gene codes for one protein that has one function,"" said co-senior author Emma Lundberg, Ph.D., associate professor of bioengineering and of pathology at Stanford University. ""However, there is now an increasing number of known multifunctional proteins, and while we're probably still underestimating how many there are, this study demonstrates the importance of multimodal data integration to reveal these multifunctional properties.""

The researchers discovered 975 previously unknown functions for proteins in the map. For example, C18orf21 -- a recently discovered protein whose function was previously unknown -- appears to be involved with RNA processing, according to the study, and the DPP9 protein, known to cut proteins at specific regions, is implicated in interferon signaling, which is important for fighting infection.

The model drew upon a huge knowledge base it absorbed from the scientific literature on proteins, according to co-first author Clara Hu, a biomedical sciences doctoral candidate in Ideker's lab. The researchers asked GPT-4 -- a large language model artificial intelligence tool similar to ChatGPT -- for the function of individual proteins and how they worked together in protein assemblies. This took a fraction of the time it would take a human researcher, says Hu. This GPT-4-based analysis tool, recently published in Nature Methods, summarized the common theme of each protein assembly and proposed names for them, which were used in the cell map.

""We're able to, in an unbiased manner, really look at how these parts fit together and how to look at them in the context of disease,"" said Schaffer.

In fact, by locating mutated proteins on the cell map, the researchers were able to identify 21 assemblies frequently mutated in childhood cancer. Within these groups, 102 mutated proteins were found to be strongly linked to cancer development, thanks to the study. The findings have implications for how cancer research is conducted at the molecular and cellular level.

""We need to stop looking at the level of individual mutations, which are very rare, sporadic, and almost never recur in the same way twice, and start looking at the common machinery inside of cells that is disrupted or hijacked by these mutations,"" said Ideker.

Schaffer says browsing the U2OS cell map is similar to navigating an online geographical map.

""You're able to really explore, zoom in, and see what proteins are part of these different communities, and then see where those communities are located,"" she said.

""As you increase resolution, you can see even more detail-level information,"" said Hu. The team is currently working on resolving the map even further so that users can zoom in as much as they want at a high resolution.

The researchers think the U2OS cell atlas will not only facilitate a better understanding of childhood cancers, but will also provide a blueprint for scientists who want to map other cell types, use artificial intelligence tools to uncover the function of poorly-understand proteins and protein complexes, and decipher the mechanisms behind a wide variety of disease processes.

Metrics details

Understanding the brain requires understanding neurons' functional responses to the circuit architecture shaping them. Here we introduce the MICrONS functional connectomics dataset with dense calcium imaging of around 75,000 neurons in primary visual cortex (VISp) and higher visual areas (VISrl, VISal and VISlm) in an awake mouse that is viewing natural and synthetic stimuli. These data are co-registered with an electron microscopy reconstruction containing more than 200,000 cells and 0.5 billion synapses. Proofreading of a subset of neurons yielded reconstructions that include complete dendritic trees as well the local and inter-areal axonal projections that map up to thousands of cell-to-cell connections per neuron. Released as an open-access resource, this dataset includes the tools for data retrieval and analysis1,2. Accompanying studies describe its use for comprehensive characterization of cell types3,4,5,6, a synaptic level connectivity diagram of a cortical column4, and uncovering cell-type-specific inhibitory connectivity that can be linked to gene expression data4,7. Functionally, we identify new computational principles of how information is integrated across visual space8, characterize novel types of neuronal invariances9 and bring structure and function together to uncover a general principle for connectivity between excitatory neurons within and across areas10,11.

Francis Crick wrote in 197912 that “It is no use asking for the impossible, such as, say, the exact wiring diagram for a cubic millimetre of brain tissue and the way all its neurons are firing”. Crick's request was presumably motivated by the idea that the function of every neuron depends on its synaptic connections13, and such dataset would allow the rigorous test and refinement of hypotheses about network anatomy. For decades, these relationships were studied through challenging single-cell experiments14,15,16,17 or electrophysiology recordings18,19. Later, by combining calcium imaging with in vitro electrophysiological20 and viral tracing methods21 it was possible to link the functional recordings to the underlying connectivity. Much has been learned from these experiments, but they provide fragmentary information.

To realize Crick's vision, volumetric electron microscopy (EM) can be combined with calcium imaging22,23, as demonstrated at smaller scales in the visual cortex24,25,26, retina27,28,29 and other systems30,31. Here we present a dataset (Fig. 1) that bridges neuronal function and connectivity at the cubic millimetre scale in mouse visual cortex (in vivo dimensions 1.3 × 0.87 × 0.82 mm3). To measure visual responses, we performed calcium imaging of excitatory neurons across cortical layers in response to visual stimuli. To map connectivity, we imaged the same cubic millimetre with serial section transmission EM (TEM). Using scalable convolutional networks and custom computational systems, we reconstructed neurons and their synaptic connections in 3D, with extensive proofreading to ensure accuracy. Finally, we co-registered the calcium-imaging and TEM data to match neuronal responses to neurons and their connectivity.

The primary in vivo data resource consists of 2P calcium images, 2P structural images, natural and parametric video stimuli used as visual input, and behavioural measurements. The secondary (derived) in vivo data resource includes the responses of approximately 75,909 pyramidal cells from cortical layer 2 to 5 segmented from the calcium videos, along with the pupil position and diameter extracted from the video of eye movements and locomotion measured on a single-axis treadmill. The primary anatomical data are composed of ex vivo serial section transmission EM images registered with the in vivo 2P structural stack. The volume includes a portion of VISp and three higher visual areas—VISlm, VISrl and VISal—for all cortical layers except extremes of layer 1. The secondary anatomical data is derived from the serial section EM image stack, and consists of semi-automated segmentation of cells, automated segmentation of nuclei, and automatically detected synapses. The tertiary anatomical data consists of assignments of the synapses to presynaptic and postsynaptic cells, triangle meshes for these segments, classification of nuclei as neuronal versus non-neuronal, and classification of neurons into excitatory and inhibitory cell classes. Secondary data for co-registration of in vivo and ex vivo images consists of manually chosen correspondence points between 2P structural images and EM images. Tertiary co-registration data are a transformation derived from these correspondence points. The transformation is then used to facilitate the matching of cell indices between the 2P calcium cell segmentation masks and the EM segmentation cells. MicroCT, micro-computed tomography.

As proofreading of the automated reconstruction continues, the dataset is becoming increasingly accurate. It includes pyramidal neurons from all layers (the following examples link to public data in Neuroglancer, our data visualization tool (https://www.microns-explorer.org/ngl-instructions), such as cortical layer 5 thick tufted (https://go.nature.com/L5tt), layer 5 near-projecting (https://go.nature.com/l5np), layer 4 (https://go.nature.com/l4) and layer 2/3 (https://go.nature.com/l2-3) neurons. It includes inhibitory neurons from many classes, such as bipolar cells (https://go.nature.com/bip), basket cells (https://go.nature.com/bkt) a chandelier cell (https://go.nature.com/cdl) and Martinotti cells (https://go.nature.com/mar). It also includes non-neuronal cells, such as astrocytes (https://go.nature.com/asc) and microglia (https://go.nature.com/mg) and the network of blood vessels (https://go.nature.com/bv). Using the interactive tools, one can visualize the input and output synapses of a single cell (https://go.nature.com/io). The database of functional recordings (https://www.microns-explorer.org/cortical-mm3#f-data) is also available for download to explore how cells responded to visual stimuli.

The first set of scientific findings emerging from the data are described in the accompanying studies. Detailed morphological and synaptic data enabled novel approaches to characterize cell types3,4,5,6,7 and show that connectivity can be used to identify cell types that are difficult to identify by morphology alone4, a recurring theme in connectomic cell typing. We also began to establish correspondences between connectivity and transcriptomics-defined cell types7. The combination of structural connectivity and functional similarity across thousands of pairs of individual neurons enabled a new examination of ‘like-to-like' connectivity25,32 and shows that this principle generalizes across cortical layers and visual areas10. This work relied on a novel approach using an artificial neural network that was trained to predict neural activities from visual stimuli10,11. Further linked Articles utilize this model to point the way to experimental studies of the mechanisms supporting contextual interactions8,9,10 and invariances9 in visual cortical computations.

The potential of the dataset extends far beyond these initial findings. To maximize its impact, we have made the data publicly available as a resource (https://www.microns-explorer.org/) with tools for interactive exploration and programmatic analysis. Finally, the accompanying studies highlight the tools that we developed to scale up connectomics to a cubic millimetre1,2,11,33. These technologies are enabling broader applications, such as reconstruction of the entire wiring diagram of a whole fly brain34,35,36, the first adult connectome to be completed since that of Caenorhabditis elegans.

The data were collected from a single mouse and involved a pipeline spanning three primary sites. First, two-photon (2P) in vivo calcium imaging under various visual stimulation conditions was performed at Baylor College of Medicine. Then the mouse was shipped to the Allen Institute, where the imaged tissue volume was extracted, prepared for EM imaging, sectioned and imaged over a period of six months of continuous imaging. The EM data were then montaged, roughly aligned and delivered to Princeton University, where fine alignment was performed and the volume was densely segmented. Finally, extensive proofreading was performed on a subset of neurons to correct errors of automated segmentation, and cell types and various other structural features were annotated (Fig. 2).

Outline of the major sequential steps used to generate the MICrONS dataset. First, in vivo measurements of neuronal functional properties are acquired from a region of interest (ROI) in the mouse visual cortex. In addition, a spatial overlapping in vivo structural image stack is collected to facilitate later registration with postmortem data. Following fixation of the brain, the tissue encompassing the functional ROI is processed for histology and sectioned. These sections are then imaged by TEM, and the resulting images are assembled into a 3D volume. Automated methods subsequently reconstruct the cellular processes and synapses within this volume, and the automated reconstructions are proofread as needed to ensure accuracy for further analysis.

The calcium-imaging data include the responses to visual stimuli of an estimated 75,909 excitatory neurons spanning cortical layers 2 to 5 across 4 visual areas in a transgenic mouse that expressed GCaMP6s in excitatory neurons via Slc17a7-Cre and Ai162. The dataset contains 14 individual scans, collected between postnatal day 75 (P75) and P81, spanning a volume of approximately 1,200 × 1,100 × 500 µm3 (anteroposterior × mediolateral × radial depth; Fig. 3a). The centre of the volume was placed at the junction of primary visual cortex (VISp) and three higher visual areas—lateromedial area (VISlm), rostrolateral area (VISrl) and anterolateral area (VISal)—in order to image retinotopically matched neurons that were potentially connected via inter-areal feedforward and feedback connections.

Rasters for high (top), medium (middle) and low (bottom) oracle scores with the percentile shown on the right. g, Trial-averaged raster (central 500 ms of trial-average raster for each direction, out of 937 ms) of deconvolved calcium activity for 80 neurons in 40 Monet2 trials (16 randomly ordered directions) grouped by preferred direction (5 neurons per direction; alternating blue shading) and sorted according to the stimulus directions.

Each scan consisted of two adjacent overlapping 620-µm-wide fields at multiple imaging planes, imaged with the wide field of view (FOV) of the 2P random access mesoscope (2P-RAM). The scans ranged up to approximately 500 µm in depth, with a target spacing of 10–15 µm to maximize the coverage of imaged cells in the volume (Fig. 3b,c). For 11 of the 14 scans, 4 imaging planes were distributed widely in depth using the mesoscope remote focus, spanning roughly 300–400 µm with an average spacing of approximately 125 µm between planes for near-simultaneous recording across multiple cortical layers. In the remaining 3 scans, fewer planes were imaged at 10–20 µm spacing to achieve a higher effective pixel density (Extended Data Table 1). These higher-resolution scans were designed to be amenable to future efforts to extract signals from large apical dendrites from deeper layer 5 and layer 6 neurons. However, for this release, imaging data were automatically segmented only from somas using a constrained non-negative matrix factorization approach and fluorescence traces were extracted and deconvolved to yield activity traces. In total, 125,413 masks were generated across 14 scans, of which 115,372 were automatically classified as somatic masks by a trained classifier (Fig. 3d).

The functional data collection relied on newly established technologies, especially the 2P-RAM mesoscope. In addition, we developed an imaging workflow with the goal of full coverage within the target volume. This required several optimizations—for example, to densely target scan planes across multiple days, we needed a common reference frame to assess the coverage of scans within the volume. Therefore, in addition to the functional scans, high-resolution (0.5–1.0 pixels per µm) structural volumes were acquired for registration with the subsequent EM data. At the end of each imaging day, individual imaging fields of the functional scans were independently registered into a structural stack (Fig. 3b,c). This enabled us to target scans in subsequent sessions to optimize coverage across depth. On the last day of imaging, a 2-channel (green, red) 1,412 × 1,322 × 670 μm3 (anteroposterior × mediolateral × radial depth) structural stack was collected at 0.5 pixels per μm after injection of fluorescent dye (Texas Red) to label vasculature, enhancing fiducial labelling for co-registration with the EM volume (Fig. 3a).

After registration of the functional imaging field with the structural stack, 2D centroids from the segmentation were assigned 3D centroids in the shared structural stack coordinate space, on the basis of a greedy assignment of 3D proximity. Based on this analysis, we estimate the functional imaging volume contains 75,909 unique functionally imaged neurons consolidated from 115,372 segmented somatic masks, with many neurons imaged in 2 or more scans.

During imaging, the mouse was head-restrained, and the stimulus was presented to the left visual field. Treadmill rotation (single axis) and video of the left eye were captured throughout the scan, yielding locomotion velocity, eye movements and pupil diameter data.

The stimulus for each scan lasted approximately 84 min, and consisted of naturalistic (complex scenes with real-world statistics) and parametric (simpler, artificially generated) video stimuli. The majority of the stimulus (64 min) was made up of 10 s clips drawn from films, the Sports-1M dataset37 or rendered first-person point of view (POV) movement through a virtual environment (Fig. 3e). Our goal was to approximate natural statistical complexity to cover a sufficiently large feature space. These data can support multiple lines of investigation, including applying deep learning-based systems identification methods to build highly accurate models that predict neural responses to arbitrary visual stimuli11,38. These models enable a systematic characterization of tuning functions with minimal assumptions relative to classical methods using parametric stimuli38.

The stimulus composition included a mixture of unique stimuli for each scan, some that were repeated across every scan, and some that were repeated within each scan. In particular, 6 natural film stimuli clips totalling 1 min (oracle natural videos) were repeated in the same order 10 times per scan, and were used to evaluate the reliability of the neural responses to repeated visual stimuli (Fig. 3f). Variations in this ‘oracle score' from scan to scan serve as an important indicator of scan quality, since reliable responses are not observed when imaging conditions are poor or the mouse is not engaged with the stimulus.

To relate our findings to previous work, we also included a battery of parametric stimuli (Monet2 and Trippy, 10 min each; Methods, ‘Stimulus composition') that were generated to produce spatially decorrelated stimuli that were suitable for characterizing receptive fields while also containing local or global directional and orientation components for extracting basic tuning properties such as orientation selectivity (Fig. 3e,g).

After the in vivo neurophysiology data collection, we imaged the same volume of cortex ex vivo using TEM, which enabled us to map the connectivity of neurons for which we measured functional properties. These required considerable scaling from previous state-of-the-art datasets, with particular emphasis on automation and on reducing rare but potentially catastrophic events that could incur loss of multiple serial sections.

The tissue sample was trimmed and sectioned into 27,972 serial sections (nominal thickness 40 nm) onto grid tape to facilitate automated imaging. Although the cutting was automated, it was supervised by humans who worked in shifts around the clock for 12 days. They were ready to stop and restart the ultramicrotome immediately if there was a risk of multiple section loss. As will be described later, the EM dataset is subdivided into two subvolumes owing to sectioning and imaging events (details of sectioning timeline and artefacts are presented in Methods).

A total of 26,652 sections were imaged by 5 customized automated TEMs (autoTEMs), which took approximately 6 months to complete and produced a dataset composed of 2 Pb of raw data at a resolution of approximately 4 nm (Fig. 4d–h).

An 800-µm region (sections 7,931–27,904) (Fig. 4a) was selected for further processing, as it had no consecutive section loss and an overall section loss of around 0.1%. This region contains approximately 95 million individual tiles that were stitched into 2D montages per section and then aligned in 3D. Owing to the re-trimming of the block and the requirement for a knife change (Methods), the EM data are divided into two subvolumes (Fig. 4a). One subvolume contains approximately 35% of the sections (sections 7,931–14,815) and the other contains 65% of the sections (sections 14,816–27,904). The two subvolumes were processed individually and later aligned to each other in the same global coordinate frame, enabling the tracing of axons and dendrites across their border (Fig. 5). To facilitate the reconstruction process across the division between the two subvolumes, a composite image of the partial sections was created at the interface. However, the two subvolumes were reconstructed separately and each has a distinct representation in the analysis infrastructure and database.

Accurate reconstruction requires extremely accurate stitching and alignment of images with hundreds of thousands of pixels on a side. To achieve this at petabyte scale, we split the process into distinct coarse and fine pipelines. For the coarse pipeline, sections were initially stitched using a per image affine transformation, and a polynomial transformation model was applied to a subset of sections whose stitching quality had a local misalignment error of more than five pixels. Down-sampled 2D stitched sections were then roughly aligned in 3D. The rough alignment process ensured global consistency within the dataset and accounted for images from multiple autoTEMs with varied image sizes and resolutions. It is also corrected for locally varying misalignments such as scale differences and deformations between sections and aids the fine alignment process.

To further refine image alignment, we developed a set of convolutional networks to estimate pixel-wise displacement fields between pairs of neighbouring sections33. This process was able to correct nonlinear misalignments around cracks and folds that occurred during sectioning. Although this fine alignment does not restore the missing data inside a fold, it was still effective in correcting the distortions caused by large folds (Fig. 4b,c), which caused large displacements between sections and were the main cause of reconstruction errors. Although imaging was performed with 4 nm resolution, the aligned imagery volume was generated at 8 nm resolution to decrease data size for subsequent processing.

We densely segmented cellular processes across the volume using affinity-predicting convolutional neural networks and mean affinity agglomeration (Fig. 5a) Segmentation was not attempted where the alignment accuracy was deemed insufficient or tissue was missing or occluded over multiple sections.

The automatic segmentation produced highly accurate dendritic arbors before proofreading, enabling morphological identification of broad cell types. Most dendritic spines are properly associated with their dendritic trunk. Recovery of larger-caliber axons, those of inhibitory neurons, and the initial portions of excitatory neurons was also typically successful. Owing to the high frequency of imaging defects in the shallower and deeper portions of the dataset, processes near the pia and white matter often contain errors. Many non-neuronal objects are also well-segmented, including astrocytes, microglia and blood vessels. The two subvolumes of the dataset were segmented separately, but the alignment between the two is sufficient for manually tracing between them (Fig. 5b).

Nuclei were also automatically segmented (n = 144,120) within subvolume 65 using a distinct convolutional network33. To use nucleus shape to map cell classes across the dataset, we manually labelled a subset of the 2,751 nuclei in a 100-µm-square column of the dataset as non-neuronal, excitatory or inhibitory. We then developed machine learning models to automate distinguishing neurons from non-neuronal cells such as glia, as well as to classify cells at different levels of resolution2,6 within the subvolume with high accuracy (Methods). The results of this nucleus segmentation, manual cell classification and model building are provided as part of this data resource.

Synaptic contacts were automatically segmented in the aligned EM image, and the presynaptic and postsynaptic partners from the cell segmentation were automatically assigned to identify each synapse (Fig. 5d). We automatically detected and associated a total of 524 million synaptic clefts across both subvolumes (subvolume 35: 186 million, subvolume 65: 337 million). We manually identified synapses in 70 small subvolumes (n = 8,611 synapses) distributed across the dataset, giving the automated detection an estimated precision of 96% and recall of 89% (Extended Data Fig. 1). We estimated partner assignment accuracy at 98% from a separate dataset of manually annotated synapses (n = 191) that were held-out from training.

Although the automated segmentation creates impressive reconstructions, proofreading is required to make those reconstructions more complete and accurate. The proofreading process involves merging additional segments of the neurons that were missing in the reconstruction, and splitting segments that were incorrectly associated with a neuron. To perform real-time collaborative proofreading in a petascale dataset, we developed the ChunkedGraph proofreading system1 that can be used with Neuroglancer as a user interface or a REST (representational state transfer) application programming interface (API) for computationally driven edits. This flexibility enabled the proofreading methods to be tailored to different scientific needs, including manual, semi-automated and automated proofreading. Note that all proofreading was performed in subvolume 65.

The released segmentation now contains all 1,046,656 edits of the proofreading that had occurred as of 16 September 2024 and is being updated quarterly. Proofreading was performed by individual scientists and focused teams of proofreaders to both support targeted scientific discovery for companion studies3,4,5,6,7,10 and correct errors that most affected general connectivity. Because of this, the level of completeness differs across these cells (Fig. 5), as neurons have been proofread as part of multiple Machine Intelligence from Cortical Networks (MICrONS) data analysis projects. For example, in the functional connectomics study, we proofread the full extent of axonal and dendritic arbors of 85 excitatory neurons within subvolume 65 (Fig. 5c), whereas for a broad columnar sample only the dendrites of 1,188 excitatory neurons were proofread. The result is a wide variation in edits per neuron with more edits generally corresponding to more extensive axons (100–1,000 edits per axon) (Extended Data Fig. 2). The most time-consuming task is extending axons, and thus this is where the data varies most across cells and studies. In total, the released dataset includes 1,433 neurons that have proofread axons with varying levels of extension, where all incorrect mergers have been removed and many false splits corrected. From the proofread dendrites, we determined that 99% of inputs were correct when assigned to a postsynaptic soma in the automated segmentation. As a result, for the neurons with proofread axons all synapses—both input and output—are now correctly associated. A full-time proofreader can generate between 400–600 axon extension edits in a work week. The proofread excitatory neurons contain some of the most extensive axonal arbors reconstructed in the neocortex at EM resolution, with the longest excitatory axon measuring 18.9 mm with 2,483 synaptic outputs and inhibitory axons ranging from in length from 1.1 to 32.3 mm with a mean of 2,754 synaptic outputs (range 99–14,019) (Fig. 5f). In general, inhibitory axons were more complete in the automated reconstruction, probably because their axons are slightly thicker than those of most excitatory axons.

In addition to proofreading axons and dendrites, we made widespread edits to enhance the general dataset quality. Following the automated segmentation, there were 7,050 segmented objects consisting of a total of 17,753 neurons that were merged together (based on nucleus segmentation), preventing analysis of these cells. Using a combination of manual and automated error-detection workflows, we have split almost all neurons into single-soma objects, bringing the total number of individually segmented neurons to 84,035 (Extended Data Fig. 3). To work through such dataset-wide tasks more quickly, we developed and validated an automated error-detection and correction workflow using graph and morphological analysis to identify merge error locations and generate edits that could be executed using PyChunkedGraph (PCG)1. This automated approach (NEURD) was also used to remove false axon merges onto dendritic segments and split axon branches with abnormally high degree across the dataset2, totalling more than 164,000 edits.

Proofreading is ongoing in the dataset with regular public updates, and there is now a project called the Virtual Observatory of the Cortex (https://www.microns-explorer.org/vortex) funded by the National Insitutes of Health (NIH), to which individual researchers can submit scientific requests to steer proofreading and annotation of the dataset in directions that will move their research questions forward.

Functional connectomics requires that cells are matched between the 2P calcium-imaging and EM coordinate frames. We achieved this using a three-phase approach combining expert annotations and automatic methods. In the first step, we generated a co-registration transform using a set of 2,934 expert-matched fiducials between the EM volume and the 2P structural dataset (1,994 somata and 942 blood vessels, mostly branch points, which are available as part of the resource; Methods). To evaluate the error of the transform we evaluated the distance in micrometres between the location of a fiducial after co-registration and its original location; a perfect co-registration would have residuals of 0 μm. The average residual was 3.8 μm.

For the second step we used the results of the transform to guide a group of experts to manually match 19,181 functional ROIs from 14 scans to 15,439 individual EM neurons (multiple functional ROIs can match to a single EM neuron if it was present in multiple scans). The results of manual matching provide both high-confidence matches for analysis and ‘ground truth' for fully automated approaches. These results help to validate the first phase, as most matched ROIs have low residuals and high separation scores (Extended Data Fig. 4). Furthermore, as expected for successful matches, ROIs with at least moderate visual responses that are independently matched to the same neuron across multiple scans have higher signal correlations than adjacent neurons (Extended Data Fig. 4).

In the third and final step, we used two automated approaches to match the entire set of functional ROIs. The first approach used the EM-to-2P co-registration transform to move the centroids of all EM neurons (predicted from nucleus detections) to the 2P coordinate space, and then used minimum weight matching for bipartite graphs to assign functional ROIs to EM neurons. This method (referred to as the fiducial-based automatch table) resulted in 84,198 functional ROIs matched to 37,364 EM neurons. Considering all matches, this method achieved 83% precision relative to manual matchers, but filtering out matches in the bottom 30% of separation scores yields 90% precision, while still including 59,934 functional ROIs and 31,042 EM neurons. (Extended Data Fig. 5). The second automated approach used only the EM and 2P blood vessel segmentations to generate a novel co-registration between the two volumes, using a fine-scale deformable B-spline-based registration. Then, minimum weight matching for bipartite graphs was used to assign functional ROIs to EM neurons. This table (referred to as the vessel-based automatch table) contains 75,856 functional ROIs matched to 34,712 EM neurons. Remarkably, this fiducial-free method performed as well as the fiducial-based method, achieving 84% precision with manual matches. Filtering out matches in the bottom 30% of separation scores yielded 90% precision, while including 53,248 functional ROIs and 28,233 EM neurons (Extended Data Fig. 5). Finally, we tested whether taking only the matches for which both automated methods agree would increase the performance relative to manual matches. Indeed, this hybrid automated table achieves 89% agreement with no additional filtering, yielding 60,091 functional ROIs and 29,620 EM neurons (Extended Data Fig. 5).

To create a resource for the neuroscience community, we have made the data from each of the steps described above—functional imaging, the EM subvolumes, segmentation and a variety of annotations—publicly available on the MICrONS Explorer website (https://www.microns-explorer.org/). From the site, users can browse through the large-scale EM imagery and segmentation results using Neuroglancer (https://github.com/google/neuroglancer); several example visualizations are provided to get started. All data are served from publicly readable cloud buckets hosted through Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Storage.

To enable systematic analysis without downloading hundreds of gigabytes of data, users can selectively access cloud-based data programmatically through a collection of open source Python clients (Extended Data Table 2). The functional data, including calcium traces, stimuli, behavioural measures and more, are available in a DataJoint database that can be accessed using DataJoint's Python API (https://datajoint.com/docs/), or is available as neurodata without borders (NWB) files on the Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration (DANDI) Archive (https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000402). EM imagery and segmentation volumes can also be selectively accessed using cloud-volume (https://github.com/seung-lab/cloud-volume), a Python API that simplifies interacting with large-scale image data. Mesh files describing the shape of cells can be downloaded with cloud-volume, which also provides features for convenient mesh analysis, skeletonization and visualization. These meshes can be decomposed and richly annotated for automated proofreading and morphological analysis of processes and spines using NEURD2 (https://github.com/reimerlab/NEURD). Annotations on the structural data, such as synapses and cell body locations, can be queried via CAVE client, a Python interface to the Connectome Annotation Versioning Engine (CAVE) APIs (Fig. 6a,b). CAVE encompasses a set of microservices for collaborative proofreading and analysis of large-scale volumetric data.

The first collection of annotation tables available through CAVE client focus on the larger subvolume of the dataset, which we refer to within the infrastructure as Minnie65, and which has been the current focus of proofreading and ongoing analysis (Extended Data Table 3). The largest table describes connectivity, contains all 337.3 million synapses and is searchable by presynaptic ID, postsynaptic ID and spatial location. In addition, there are several tables that describe the soma location of key cells, predictions for which cells are different non-neuronal (Fig. 6a), excitatory (Fig. 6b) and inhibitory (Fig. 6c) types. There are also annotations that denote which cells have been functional co-registered (Fig. 6d) and which cells have been proofread to different degrees of completion (Fig. 6e). In this release, the only table available for Minnie35 contains synapses, as its segmentation and alignment occurred later and little proofreading, annotation or analysis has been conducted within it. We expect that continued proofreading and analysis of the data will lead to updated and additional tables for both portions of the data in future data releases.

This collection of tools and public data enables analyses that integrate questions of connectivity, morphology and functional properties of neurons. Here, we provide an example to suggest how the data might be used together. The power of the dataset lies in the fact that when an axon is proofread, it contains hundreds to more than ten thousand output synapses (Fig. 6f). Furthermore, between 60 and 95% of those outputs can be accurately mapped onto their postsynaptic targets with a known soma location, depending on the cell type and its spatial location in the volume (Fig. 6f). This is because the segmentation is highly accurate for dendritic inputs, with a 99% input precision based on comparing proofread with non-proofread dendrites. To seed an analysis with an as-complete-as-possible cell, one might begin by using the proofreading table to identify a neuron with complete axons and dendrites and querying for all the synaptic inputs and outputs for the cell, in this case a L2/3 cell in VISp (Fig. 6g). For this particular proofread neuron, 74.5% (1,053 out of 1,412 synapses) are onto objects with a single nucleus (as determined from automated detection), with 275 synapses onto cells classified as inhibitory, 662 synapses onto cells classified as excitatory, and 116 synapses onto cells whose soma did not pass classification quality control (Fig. 6h). The remainder (25.4% 359 out of 1.412 synapses) are onto orphan fragments, composed of a mix of disconnected spine heads and stretches of dendrite. By filtering the synaptic targets with functionally matched neurons (Fig. 6k), one can further identify which targets have been matched to the functional experiments (365 out of 1,412) and use DataJoint to query the functional data or read NWB files deposited in the DANDI data archive (Fig. 6i–k). In this case, the targets include pyramidal cells in both L2/3 and L5. Subsequent investigation could examine the morphology of such cells in detail, or consider functional responses of their targets. We have provided example notebooks that walk through the above examples and more to help users get started. Together, these data provide a platform for analysis of the relationship between the synaptic structure, neuronal morphology and functional tuning of mouse visual circuits.

Connectivity and morphology are key properties of cell types, and the scale of this dataset enables an unprecedented exploration of the anatomical diversity of cortical neurons as well as a need to relate known cell types to EM data. We have taken multiple approaches to addressing these challenges in the accompanying studies. Two projects3,4 applied data-driven methods to dendritic reconstructions to characterize excitatory neurons across cortical depth and visual areas, revealing intralaminar subtypes and inter-areal differences in populations. Another study linked transcriptomic types of inhibitory neurons to EM reconstructions, establishing a proof of concept for linking molecular cell types to anatomical cell types that use morphology and synapse connectivity7. Although these studies used proofread or post-processed neuronal reconstructions, not all segmented neurons in the dataset were amenable to such analysis due to truncation by dataset boundaries or segmentation quality. To push cell typing even in such difficult cases, a fourth study showed that key features of the soma and nucleus of a cell alone was sufficient to predict cell classes such as glia, excitatory neuron or inhibitory neuron, as well as subclasses such as basket cells versus bipolar cells or microglia versus oligodendrocytes, or identify similar cells to a cell of interest6. Together, these approaches enable matching known cell types with EM neurons and using the EM data to discover new cell types.

The integration of cell-type classifications with additional modalities enables a powerful set of tools for discovery. Examining the output of proofread neurons, which includes more than 900,000 synaptic connections between neurons, reveals key differences in the interlaminar communication between excitatory and inhibitory neurons (Fig. 7a–c). The size of the dataset also allows for a comprehensive analysis of cell-type connectivity, including tracing across one or more steps along the synaptic network. A major finding from multiple studies of the MICrONS dataset is the widespread specificity of connectivity exhibited by various inhibitory4,7 and excitatory5 cell types. As an example of such analysis, we can follow a collection of layer 3 pyramidal neurons and compare their first-order (direct) connectivity onto excitatory cell types and inhibitory neurons as well as the second-order (two-hop) connectivity of those inhibitory neurons that are targeted by the layer 3 cells (Fig. 7d).

EM is widely recognized as the gold standard for identifying structural features of synapses, and most datasets, including the output of the MICrONS project, were primarily created to answer questions related to circuit-level connectivity. Regardless of the original intent, the scale and high resolution of the MICrONS dataset offers information that is far richer and of broader interest than just connectivity. For example, the imagery also reveals the intracellular machinery of cells, including the morphology of subcellular structures such as the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules. Furthermore, the segmentation includes non-neuronal cells such as microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells and oligodendrocytes, as well the fine morphology of the cortical vasculature.

The scale of large functional and EM datasets presents a wealth of opportunities for analysis and discovery. With advances in microscopy and computing power, it is now possible to work with datasets that are orders of magnitude larger than just a few years ago with millions of synapses and tens of thousands of recorded neurons. Among the key opportunities presented by this data is the ability to identify patterns and trends that may be hidden in smaller datasets, the ability to identify and validate general principles at a larger scale, and the ability to perform more sophisticated analyses—since with more data, it is possible to use more complex algorithms and models including machine learning techniques. The accessibility of these datasets also enhances hypothesis-driven approaches by enabling scientists to investigate whether specific types of connectivity exist among different cell types of interest. Additionally, the scale of the data and the availability of exploration tools to facilitate the discovery of anomalies or contradictions to current hypotheses and provide opportunities to address and resolve them effectively. Both of these approaches can help to identify patterns and trends that would be difficult to observe using smaller datasets.

However, larger datasets have limitations and challenges associated with them. When analysing the connectivity graph, it is essential to keep in mind that although, as shown by our results, the automatic segmentation of dendritic inputs is highly accurate, the automatic segmentation of axons is not as accurate. Therefore, it is essential to be aware of which processes have been proofread and to what extent. Additionally, it is worth considering that although each neuron in the dataset receives thousands of inputs, a percentage of synapses in the dataset are on detached spines. Depending on the scientific question being asked, it is worth considering whether these detached spines may create bias in the conclusions drawn, such as distinguishing between excitatory and inhibitory inputs5.

In the functional data, it is important to recognize that photon scattering and out-of-plane fluorescence may cause signal degradation and contamination with increasing depth from the pia surface, especially given the dense GCaMP6s expression in excitatory somas and neurites39. Caution should be taken to disentangle true biological variation in neuronal tuning across layers from these optical artefacts, by either matching controls at the same depth, or validating the finding with a method that is less prone to these artefacts (such as electrophysiology or 2P microscopy with more sparse or targeted labelling). Furthermore, although all functional imaging was done in the same volume, it was done across several distinct imaging sessions. Technical factors as well as changes in the physiological state of the mouse should be taken into account when analysing functional recordings that were taken at different times. The simultaneous recordings of treadmill activity and pupillometry can be used to help account for variability due to state.

Developing and executing this pipeline took a large team effort, and so it is worth reflecting on the practical limitations and bottlenecks in generating datasets of this scale. Proofreading and analysis remains the largest overall expense in terms of person hours, although it can be distributed across diverse scientific interests. Improvements in data quality, such as folds, membrane clarity and errors in computational image alignment are the most pressing technical issues that appear to limit the quality of the automated segmentation. The present dataset has already collected more than a million manual corrections to the automated segmentation, which are available for querying via CAVE1. We hope that these edits can be leveraged in the future to make more accurate automated segmentation, or a more extensively automated edit approach that can further increase the efficiency of proofreading. Analysis questions are often diverse in nature, so it is difficult to predict all the computational steps that are required, but having a more general framework and scalable technique of identifying specific features (such as cell types, spines and organelles) within the dataset would help increase efficiency, rather than using the specialized pipelines we used here. Some research in this direction has been applied to this dataset40. In terms of marginal costs of data generation, human labour remains the largest, followed by computational costs of automated segmentation and then the material costs of grid tape. Beyond these, there are no fundamental technical limitations to producing more data at this scale for other individual animals, species or brain regions.

The importance of high-resolution structural data was recognized early in invertebrate systems, particularly in the worm41,42. However, it is in the fly that connectomics as the pursuit of complete connectivity diagrams has had the strongest renaissance. EM volumes now describe the Drosophila nervous system at both larval43 and adult34,44 life stages and in both central brain34,44 and nerve cord45. The size of the volume required to capture most central neurons and their synaptic connections in the fly is well-suited to EM. The whole fly brain fills about one-third of a 750 × 350 × 250 µm3 bounding box, and the nerve cord fills about one-quarter of a 950 × 320 × 200 µm3 bounding box45, well within the bounds of contemporary EM methods. The creation of these datasets has spurred investment in both manual skeletonized reconstruction and automated dense reconstructions33,44,46, with both centralized and community-minded efforts to proofread and mine them for biological insight26,44,47,48,49. In addition to the many targeted reconstructions in these datasets, large-scale proofread reconstructions from these datasets now include a manually traced full larval brain, a densely segmented and extensively proofread partial central brain and a densely segmented and proofread complete adult brain. These datasets collectively span nearly the entire fly nervous system and are driving a revolution in how fly systems neuroscience is being studied.

In the mammalian system, there is currently no EM dataset that contains a complete area, let alone a complete brain. There is however, as mentioned above, an established culture of making data open and publicly available24,26,50,51,52. In the past 10 years, there have been only three other rodent EM datasets with publicly available reconstructions that are at least 5% the size of the MICrONS multi-area dataset presented in this Article. One dataset is a 424 × 429 × 274 µm3 volume from P26 rat entorhinal cortex53, with skeleton reconstructions of incomplete dendrites of 667 neurons, and skeleton reconstructions of local axons of 22 excitatory neurons averaging 550 µm in length. A dataset from mouse lateral geniculate nucleus that is 500 × 400 × 280 µm3 in size and contains around 3,000 neuronal cell bodies is publicly available54. This dataset is large enough that dendritic reconstructions from the centre of the volume are nearly complete, and it has a sparse manual segmentation, covering around 1% of the volume, which includes 304 thalamocortical cells and 162 axon fragments. The third dataset is a 424 × 453 × 360 µm volume covering layer 4 of mouse primary somatosensory cortex, with manual reconstruction of 52 interneuronal dendrites and many axons55.

It is critically important to compare circuit architectures across regions and species. The neocortex is of particular interest as it is expanded in human compared to mouse. There is already a large body of literature on the comparative aspects between the cortex of humans and of other species. This research includes morphological and electrical properties of neurons, density of spines, synapses and neurons, as well as biophysical properties and morphology of synaptic connections56,57,58. Of note, a recent EM connectomics dataset of the human medial temporal gyrus59 vastly expands the possibilities of this comparison. This is a cubic millimetre scale volume, with a maximum extent of 3 × 2 mm and a thickness of 150 µm. This human dataset is publicly available, including a dense automated reconstruction of all objects, with around 16,000 neurons, 130 million synapses and an initial release of 104 proofread cells. These human connectomics data will doubtless yield critical insights. One practical difference from the volume described here is the aspect ratio of the human data, which is matched to the greater thickness of human cortex compared to mouse. To some extent, the wide and thin dimensions of the human dataset trades off completeness of local neurons and circuits in order to sample all layers, whereas the nearly cubic volume described here is more suitable for studying local circuits and long-range connections across areas. With the exception of the study by Hua et al.55, the other studies mentioned above do not have corresponding functional characterizations of the neurons reconstructed in EM. By contrast, the functional connectomics data we have released includes both anatomy and activity of the same cells.

In the mammalian nervous system, transcriptomics has been the most scalable approach for cell-type taxonomies. In smaller organisms such as the fly, for which we have both extensive gene expression maps, whole-brain neuronal reconstructions and nearly complete connectomes, integration across modalities has been a powerful engine of discovery. Moreover, the availability of connectomes in the fly have enabled a much higher resolution of cell types, with novel taxonomies and new cell types being discovered44. The accompanying studies4,5,6,7 suggest that a similar path to cell-type discovery will be enabled by large-scale EM in the mammalian system with novel cell types and novel patterns of connectivity.

This wealth of structural data on cell types and circuits provides strong constraints on the nature of the computations that the brain performs, whereas genes provide constraints on how this structure is built and operates. Linking connectomics to transcriptomics is a first step for merging connectivity with molecular information and building cell-type-specific tools that are informed by how neurons connect. In one of the accompanying studies7, we offer a proof of concept on how to achieve this link for Martinotti cells, using morphology as a common feature to integrate PatchSeq and EM datasets, suggesting a broader pathway for multimodal integration.

In this respect, our work parallels another milestone of connectomics, the completion of the Drosophila connectome34,35,44,46; only 20% of the neuron types described in the EM connectome of the central brain were previously described in the literature44. There is however an important difference to be drawn with Drosophila, in which a cell type often consists of just a few neurons that share similar functional properties that are reproducible across individuals. Owing to this stereotypy, a connectome mapped in one fly can usually be used by researchers studying neuronal function in other flies. Rules of connectivity based on cell types have proved sufficient for understanding and modelling many functions of increasingly complex neural circuits60,61. Conversely, a single cell type in a mammalian brain encompasses a huge number of cells, which generally exhibit different tuning preferences. This is why it is important to combine cortical connectomics with functional studies of the same neurons in the same brain. This is also why the mapping of cortical connectivity must go beyond rules that depend solely on cell types.

Almost 50 years after Crick described his “impossible” experiment, we have provided a first draft, but its full promise will take some time to achieve. Most importantly, complete segmentation still requires an extensive amount of proofreading for the largest datasets, such as the millimetre scale cortical reconstruction reported here. Similarly, simultaneously recording single action potentials from tens of thousands of neurons is constrained by sensor dynamics and optical sampling constraints.

Nonetheless, there has been steady progress. The first structure–function studies that combined 2P microscopy and EM examined how the wiring of mouse retina27,28,29,30,31 and mouse visual cortex24 related to functional properties. Lee et al.25 related visual tuning properties of 50 functionally characterized neurons in primary visual cortex to their connectivity measured via EM reconstruction of a 450 × 450 × 150 µm volume. One thousand synapses were mapped by hand, yielding a graph of connectivity between 29 orientation-tuned cells (a subset of the characterized cells, as in the current dataset). Subsequently, our consortium used dense segmentation plus proofreading of a 250 × 140 × 90 µm dataset26 from mouse layer 2/3 visual cortex, yielding many more overall connections, but still only twice the number of functionally characterized cells. Perhaps most impressively, In the olfactory bulb of the zebrafish, Wanner et al.62 manually reconstructed almost all neurons (n = 1,003) within a 72 × 108 × 119 µm3 volume, in which responses to odours were measured in vivo. Their analysis of the 18,483 measured connections revealed how this structural network mediated de-correlation and variance normalization of the functional responses and demonstrates how larger measurements of network structure and function can provide mechanistic insights.

By contrast, the data released here contains tens of thousands of neurons with functionally characterized responses to visual stimuli and, because it is densely segmented and contains complete dendritic and local axonal arbors of centrally located cells, the opportunities to study connected neurons are orders of magnitude greater. As an example, from just 94 proofread excitatory axons, one can query 69,962 output synapses, which map to 20,112 distinct neuron soma in the volume.

Moreover, inspired by recent advancements in artificial intelligence, we also created a functional digital twin of the MICrONS mouse that can enable a more comprehensive analysis of function10,11. Specifically, we developed a ‘foundation model'11 for the mouse visual cortex using deep learning that was trained using large-scale datasets from multiple visual cortical areas and mice, recorded while they viewed ecological videos. The model demonstrated its generalization abilities by accurately predicting neuronal responses, not only to natural videos, but also to various new stimulus domains, such as coherent moving dots and noise patterns, as confirmed through in vivo testing10,11. By applying the foundation model to the MICrONS mouse data, we created a functional digital twin of this mouse, paving the way for a systematic exploration of the relationship between circuit structure and function for tens of thousands of neurons connected with millions of synapses. Combined with the anatomical data from this mouse, we can investigate the structure–function relationships for specific visual computations8,9 and decipher the principles that determine the synaptic network in the cortex10,11.

The most important goal of connectomics is to map the connections between cells, from cell body to axon to synapse, and back to cell body. In a large volume with complete and segmented dendrites and local axons, this can be achieved. Currently, the dendrites are nearly completely segmented (Fig. 6), but many axons require proofreading. A goal in future years will be to complete the segmentation through a combination of additional machine learning and improved proofreading. This echoes the successful strategy in the reconstruction of the fly adult brain, which started with the TEM volume34, then added the tools developed by the MICrONS programme for segmentation and proofreading and led to the complete connectome35. If, in addition, most cell bodies have physiology with single-spike resolution, then Crick's experimental challenge will be met. These remaining hurdles may take some time to clear, but the next steps are becoming apparent.

All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Baylor College of Medicine. All results described here are from a single male mouse, age 65 days at onset of experiments, expressing GCaMP6s in excitatory neurons via Slc17a7-Cre65 and Ai16266 heterozygous transgenic lines (recommended and generously shared by H. Zeng at Allen Institute for Brain Science; JAX stock 023527 and 031562, respectively). In order to select this animal, 31 (12 female, 19 male) GCaMP6-expressing animals underwent surgery as described below. Of these, eight animals were chosen based on a variety of criteria including surgical success and animal recovery, the accessibility of lateral higher visual areas in the cranial window, the degree of vascular occlusion, and the success of cortical tissue block extraction and staining. Of these 8 animals, one was chosen for 40-nm slicing and EM imaging based on overall quality using these criteria.

Anaesthesia was induced with 3% isoflurane and maintained with 1.5–2% isoflurane during the surgical procedure. Mice were injected with 5–10 mg kg−1 ketoprofen subcutaneously at the start of the surgery. Anaesthetized mice were placed in a stereotaxic head holder (Kopf Instruments) and their body temperature was maintained at 37 °C throughout the surgery using a homeothermic blanket system (Harvard Instruments). After shaving the scalp, bupivicane (0.05 ml, 0.5%, Marcaine) was applied subcutaneously, and after 10–20 min an approximately 1 cm2 area of skin was removed above the skull and the underlying fascia was scraped and removed. The wound margins were sealed with a thin layer of surgical glue (VetBond, 3 M), and a 13-mm stainless steel washer clamped in the headbar was attached with dental cement (Dentsply Grip Cement). At this point, the mouse was removed from the stereotax and the skull was held stationary on a small platform by means of the newly attached headbar. Using a surgical drill and HP 1/2 burr, a 4-mm-diameter circular craniotomy was made centred on the border between primary visual cortex and lateromedial visual cortex (V1, lateral–medial; 3.5 mm lateral of the midline, ~1 mm anterior to the lambda suture), followed by a durotomy. The exposed cortex was washed with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (25 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgSO4) with 0.3 mg ml−1 gentamicin sulfate (Aspen Veterinary Resources). The cortical window was then sealed with a 4-mm coverslip (Warner Instruments), using cyanoacrylate glue (VetBond). The mouse was allowed to recover for 1 day prior to imaging. After imaging, the washer was released from the headbar and the mouse was returned to the home cage. Prior to surgery and throughout the imaging period, mice were singly housed and maintained on a reverse 12-h light cycle (off at 11:00, on at 23:00).

Mice were head-mounted above a cylindrical treadmill and calcium imaging was performed using Chameleon Ti-Sapphire laser (Coherent) tuned to 920 nm and a large FOV mesoscope67 equipped with a custom objective (excitation NA 0.6, collection NA 1.0, 21 mm focal length). Laser power after the objective was increased exponentially as a function of depth from the surface according to: 

Here P is the laser power used at target depth z, P0 is the power used at the surface (not exceeding 10 mW), and Lz is the depth constant (not less than 150 μm). Maximum laser output of 115 mW was used for scans approximately 450–500 μm from the surface and below.

Visual stimuli were presented to the left eye with a 31.8 × 56.5 cm (height × width) monitor (ASUS PB258Q) with a resolution of 1,080 × 1,920 pixels positioned 15 cm away from the eye. When the monitor is centred on and perpendicular to the surface of the eye at the closest point, this corresponds to a visual angle of ~3.8° cm−1 at the nearest point and 0.7° cm−1 at the most remote corner of the monitor. As the craniotomy coverslip placement during surgery and the resulting mouse positioning relative to the objective is optimized for imaging quality and stability, uncontrolled variance in animal skull position relative to the washer used for head-mounting was compensated with tailored monitor positioning on a six-dimensional monitor arm. The pitch of the monitor was kept in the vertical position for all animals, while the roll was visually matched to the roll of the animal's head beneath the headbar by the experimenter. In order to optimize the translational monitor position for centred visual cortex stimulation with respect to the imaging FOV, we used a dot stimulus with a bright background (maximum pixel intensity) and a single dark square dot (minimum pixel intensity). Dot locations were randomly ordered from a 5 × 8 grid to tile the screen, with 15 repetitions of 200 ms presentation at each location. The final monitor position for each animal was chosen in order to centre the population receptive field of the scan field ROI on the monitor, with the yaw of the monitor visually matched to be perpendicular to and 15 cm from the nearest surface of the eye at that position. An L-bracket on a six-dimensional arm was fitted to the corner of the monitor at this location and locked in position, so that the monitor could be returned to the chosen position between scans and across days.

The craniotomy window was leveled with regards to the objective with six degrees of freedom, five of which were locked between days to allow us to return to the same imaging site using the z axis. Pixel-wise responses from a 3,000 × 3,000 μm ROI spanning the cortical window (150 μm from surface, five 600 × 3,000 μm fields, 0.2 pixels per μm) to drifting bar stimuli were used to generate a sign map for delineating visual areas68. Our target imaging site was a 1,200 × 1,100 × 500 μm volume (anteroposterior × mediolateral × radial depth) spanning layer 2 to layer 6 at the conjunction of VISp and three higher visual areas: VISlm, VISrl and VISal69. This resulted in an imaging volume that was roughly 50% VISp and 50% higher visual area (HVA). This target was chosen to maximize the number of visual areas within the reconstructed cortical volume, as well as maximizing the overlap in represented visual space. The imaging site was further optimized to minimize vascular occlusion and to minimize motion artefact, especially where the brain curves away from the skull/coverslip towards the lateral aspect.

Once the imaging volume was chosen, a second retinotopic mapping scan with the same stimulus was collected at 12.6 Hz and matching the imaging volume FOV with four 600 × 1,100 μm fields per frame at 0.4 pixels per μm xy resolution to tile a 1,200 × 1,100 μm FOV at 2 depths (2 planes per depth, with no overlap between coplanar fields). Area boundaries on the sign map were manually annotated.

Of 19 completed scans over 6 days of imaging, 14 are described here (Extended Data Table 1). Scan placement targeted 10–15 μm increments in depth to maximize coverage of the volume in depth.

For 11 scans, imaging was performed at 6.3 Hz, collecting eight 620 × 1,100 μm fields per frame at 0.4 pixel per μm xy resolution to tile a 1,200 × 1,100 μm (width × height) FOV at four depths (two planes per depth, 40 μm overlap between coplanar fields).

For 2 scans, imaging was performed at 8.6 Hz, collecting six 620 × 1,100 μm fields per frame at 0.4 pixels per μm xy resolution to tile a 1,200 × 1,100 μm (width × height) FOV at 3 depths (2 planes per depth, 40 μm overlap between coplanar fields).

For 1 scan, imaging was performed at 9.6 Hz, collecting four 620 × 1,000 μm fields per frame at 0.6 pixels per μm xy resolution to tile a 1,200 × 1,000 μm (width × height) FOV at 2 depths (2 planes per depth, 40 μm overlap between coplanar fields).

The higher-resolution scans were designed to enable future analysis efforts to extract signals from large apical dendrites for example using EM-Assisted Source Extraction (EASE70). In addition to locking the craniotomy window mount between days, the target imaging site was manually matched each day to preceding scans within several micrometres using structural features including horizontal blood vessels (which have a distinctive z-profile) and patterns of somata (identifiable by GCaMP6s exclusion as dark spots).

The full 2P imaging processing pipeline is available at (https://github.com/cajal/pipeline). Raster correction for bidirectional scanning phase row misalignment was performed by iterative greedy search at increasing resolution for the raster phase resulting in the maximum cross-correlation between odd and even rows. Motion correction for global tissue movement was performed by shifting each frame in x and y to maximize the correlation between the cross-power spectra of a single scan frame and a template image, generated from the Gaussian-smoothed average of the Anscombe transform from the middle 2,000 frames of the scan. Neurons were automatically segmented using constrained non-negative matrix factorization, then deconvolved to extract estimates of spiking activity, within the CaImAn pipeline71. Cells were further selected by a classifier trained to separate somata versus artefacts based on segmented cell masks, resulting in exclusion of 8.1% of masks. The functional data is available in a DataJoint72 database and can also be read as NWB files deposited in the DANDI data archive73.

Approximately 55 min prior to collecting the stack, the mouse was injected subcutaneously with 60 μl of 8.3 mM Dextran Texas Red fluorescent dye (Invitrogen, D3329). The stack was composed of 30 repeats of three 620 × 1,300 μm (width × height) fields per depth in 2 channels (green and red, respectively), tiling a 1,400 × 1,300 μm FOV (460 μm total overlap in width) at 335 depths from 21 μm above the surface to 649 μm below the surface. The green channel average image across repetitions for each field was enhanced with local contrast normalization using a Gaussian filter to calculate the local pixel means and standard deviations. The resulting image was then Gaussian smoothed and sharpened using a Laplacian filter. Enhanced and sharpened fields were independently stitched at each depth. The resulting stitched planes were independently horizontally and vertically aligned by maximizing the correlation of the cross-power spectrum of their Fourier transformations. Finally, the resulting alignment was detrended in z using a Hann filter with a size of 60 μm to remove the influence of vessels passing through the fields. The resulting transform was applied to the original average images resulting in a structural 2P 1,412 × 1,322 × 670 μm (width × height × depth) volume at 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 pixels per μm resolution in both red and green channels.

Owing to tissue deformation from day to day across such a wide FOV, some cells are recorded in more than one scan. To assure we count cells only once, we subsample our recorded cells based on proximity in 3D space. Functional scan fields were independently registered using an affine transformation matrix with 9 parameters estimated via gradient ascent on the correlation between the sharpened average scanning plane and the extracted plane from the sharpened stack. Using the 3D centroids of all segmented cells, we iteratively group the closest 2 cells from different scans until all pairs of cells are at least 10 μm apart or a further join produces an unrealistically tall mask (20 μm in z). Sequential registration of sections of each functional scan into the structural stack was performed to assess the level of drift in the z dimension. All scans had less than 10-μm drift over the 1.5-h recording, and for most of them drift was limited to <5 μm.

Fields from the FOV-matched retinotopy scan described above were registered into the stack using the same approach, and the manually annotated area masks were transformed into the stack. These area masks were extended vertically across all depths, and functional units inherit their area membership from their stack xy coordinates.

Video images of the eye and face of the mouse were captured throughout the experiment. A hot mirror (Thorlabs FM02) positioned between the animal's left eye and the stimulus monitor was used to reflect an IR image onto a camera (Genie Nano C1920M, Teledyne Dalsa) without obscuring the visual stimulus. An infrared 940 nm LED (Thorlabs M940L2) illuminated the right side of the animal, backlighting the silhouette of the face. The position of the mirror and camera were manually calibrated per session and focused on the pupil. FOV was manually cropped for each session (ranging from 828 × 1,217 pixels to 1,080 × 1920 pixels at ~20 Hz), such that the FOV contained the superior, frontal, and inferior portions of the facial silhouette as well as the left eye in its entirety. Frame times were time stamped in the behavioural clock for alignment to the stimulus and scan frame times. Video was compressed using Labview's MJPEG codec with quality constant of 600 and stored the frames in AVI file.

Light diffusing from the laser during scanning through the pupil was used to capture pupil diameter and eye movements. Notably, scans using wide ranges in laser power to scan both superficial and deep planes resulted in a variable pupil intensity between frames. A custom semi-automated user interface in Python was built for dynamic adaptation of fitting parameters throughout the scan to maximize pupil tracking accuracy and coverage. The video was manually cropped to a rectangular region that includes the entirety of the eye at all time points. The video was further manually masked to exclude high intensity regions in the surrounding eyelids and fur. In cases where a whisker is present and occluding the pupil at some time points, a merge mask was drawn to bridge ROIs drawn on both sides of the whisker into a single ROI. For each frame, the original and filtered image was visible to the user. The filtered image was an exponentially weighted temporal running average, which undergoes exponentiation, Gaussian blur, automatic Otsu thresholding into a binary image, and finally pixel-wise erosion/dilation. In cases where only one ROI was present, the contour of the binary ROI was fit with an ellipse by minimizing least squares error, and for ellipses greater than the minimum contour length the xy centre and major and minor radii were stored. In cases where more than one ROI was present, the tracking was automatically halted until the user either resolved the ambiguity, or the frame was not tracked (a NaN (Not a Number) is stored). Processing parameters were under dynamic control of the user, with instructions to use the minimally sufficient parameters that result in reliably and continuous tracing of the pupil, as evidenced by plotting of the fitted ROI over the original image. Users could also return to previous points in the trace for re-tracking with modified processing parameters, as well as manually exclude periods of the trace in which insufficient reliable pupil boundary was visible for tracking.

The mouse was head-restrained during imaging but could walk on a treadmill. Rostro-caudal treadmill movement was measured using a rotary optical encoder (Accu-Coder 15T-01SF-2000NV1ROC-F03-S1) with a resolution of 8,000 pulses per revolution, and was recorded at ~57–100 Hz in order to extract locomotion velocity.

The stimulus was designed to cover a sufficiently large feature space to support training highly accurate models that predict neural responses to arbitrary visual stimuli11,38,74,75. Each scan stimulus was approximately 84 min in duration and comprised:

Oracle natural videos: 6 natural video clips, 2 from each category. 10 s each, 10 repeats per scan, 10 min total. Conserved across all scans.

Unique natural videos: 144 natural videos, 48 from each category. 10 s each, 1 repeat per scan, 24 min total. Unique to each scan.

2× repeat natural videos: 90 natural videos, 30 from each category. 10 s each, 2 repeats (one in each half of the scan), 30 min total. Conserved across all scans.

Local directional parametric stimulus (Trippy): 20 seeds, 15 s each, 2 repeats (one in each half of the scan), 10 min total. 10 seeds conserved across all scans, 10 unique to each scan.

Global directional parametric stimulus (Monet2): 20 seeds, 15 s each, 2 repeats (one in each half of the scan), 10 min total. 10 seeds conserved across all scans, 10 unique to each scan.

Each scan was also preceded by 0.15–5.5 min with the monitor on, and followed by 8.3–21.2 min with the monitor off, in order to collect spontaneous neural activity.

The visual stimulus was composed of dynamic stimuli, primarily including natural video but also including generated parametric stimuli with strong local or global directional component. Natural video clips were 10 s clips from one of three categories:

Cinematic, from the following sources: Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), Star Wars: Episode VII—The Force Awakens (2015), The Matrix (1999), The Matrix Reloaded (2003), The Matrix Revolutions (2003), Koyaanisqatsi: Life Out of Balance (1982), Powaqqatsi: Life in Transformation (1988) and Naqoyqatsi: Life as War (2002).

Rendered 3D video of first-person POV random exploration of a virtual environment with moving objects, produced in a customized version of Unreal Engine 4 with modifications that enable precise control and logging of frame timing and camera positions to ensure repeatability across multiple rendering runs. Environments and assets were purchased from Unreal Engine Marketplace. Assets chosen for diversity of appearance were translated along a piecewise linear trajectory, and rotated with a piecewise constant angular velocity. Intervals between change points were drawn from a uniform distribution from 1 to 5 s. If a moving object encountered an environmental object, it bounced off and continued along a linear trajectory reflected across the surface normal. The first-person POV camera followed the same trajectory process as the moving objects. Light sources were the default for the environment. Latent variable images were generated by re-generating the scenes and trajectories, rendering different properties, including absolute depth, object identification number and surface normals.

All natural videos were temporally resampled to 30 frames per second, and were converted to greyscale with 256 × 144 pixel resolution with FFmpeg (ibx264 at YUV4:2:0 8 bit). Stimuli were automatically filtered for upper 50th percentile Lucas–Kanade optical flow and temporal contrast of the central region of each clip. All natural videos included in these experiments were further manually screened for unsuitable characteristics (for example, fragments of rendered videos in which the first-person perspective would enter a corner and become ‘trapped' or follow an unnatural camera trajectory, or fragments of cinematic or Sports-1M containing screen text or other post-processing editing).

To probe neuronal tuning to orientation and direction of motion, a visual stimulus (Monet2) was designed in the form of smoothened Gaussian noise with coherent orientation and motion. In brief, an independently identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian noise video was passed through a temporal low-pass Hamming filter (4 Hz) and a 2D Gaussian spatial filter (σ = 3.0° at the nearest point on the monitor to the mouse). Each 15-s block consisted of 16 equal periods of motion along one of 16 unique directions of motion between 0–360° with a velocity of 42.8° s−1 at the nearest point on the monitor. The video was spatial filtered to introduce a spatial orientation bias perpendicular to the direction of movement by applying a bandpass Hanning filter G(ω; c) in the polar coordinates in the frequency domain for \(\omega =\phi -\theta \) where \(\phi \) is the polar angle coordinate and \(\theta \) is the movement direction θ. Then:

and

Here, c = 2.5 is an orientation selectivity coefficient. At this value, the resulting orientation kernel's size is 72° full width at half maximum in spatial coordinates.

To probe the tuning of neurons to local spatial features including orientation, direction, spatial and temporal frequency, the Trippy stimulus was synthesized by applying the cosine function to a smoothened noise video. In brief, a phase movie was generated as an i.i.d. uniform noise video with 4 Hz temporal bandwidth. The video was up-sampled to 60 Hz with the Hanning temporal kernel. An increasing trend of 8π s−1 was added to the video to produce drifting grating movements whereas the noise component added local variations of the spatial features. The video was spatially up-sampled to the full screen with a 2D Gaussian kernel with a sigma of 5.97 cm or 22.5° at the nearest point. The resulting stimulus yielded the local phase video of the gratings, from which all visual features are derived analytically.

A photodiode (TAOS TSL253) was sealed to the top left corner of the monitor, where stimulus sequence information was encoded in a three-level signal according to the binary encoding of the flip number assigned in order. This signal was recorded at 10 MHz on the behaviour clock (MasterClock PCIe-OSC-HSO-2 card). The signal underwent a sine convolution, allowing for local peak detection to recover the binary signal. The encoded binary signal was reconstructed for 89% of trials. A linear fit was applied to the trial timestamps in the behavioural and stimulus clocks, and the offset of that fit was applied to the data to align the two clocks, allowing linear interpolation between them.

We used six natural video conditions that were present in all scans and repeated ten times per scan to calculate an oracle score representing the reliability of the trace response to repeated visual stimuli. This score was computed as the jackknife mean of correlations between the leave-one-out mean across repeated stimuli with the remaining trial.

After optical imaging at Baylor College of Medicine, candidate mice were shipped via overnight air freight to the Allen Institute. All procedures were carried out in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. All mice were housed in individually ventilated cages, 20–26 °C, 30–70% relative humidity, with a 12-h light:dark cycle. Mice were transcardially perfused with a fixative mixture of 2.5% paraformaldehyde, 1.25% glutaraldehyde, and 2 mM calcium chloride, in 0.08 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. After dissection, the neurophysiological recording site was identified by mapping the brain surface vasculature. A thick (1,200-μm) slice was cut with a vibratome and post-fixed in perfusate solution for 12–48 h. Slices were extensively washed and prepared for reduced osmium treatment based on the protocol of Hua et al.76. All steps were performed at room temperature, unless indicated otherwise. Osmium tetroxide (2%, 78 mM) with 8% v/v formamide (1.77 M) in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 180 min, was the first osmication step. Potassium ferricyanide 2.5% (76 mM) in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, 90 min, was then used to reduce the osmium. The second osmium step was at a concentration of 2% in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, for 150 min. Samples were washed with water, then immersed in thiocarbohydrazide (TCH) for further intensification of the staining (1% TCH (94 mM) in water, 40 °C, for 50 min). After washing with water, samples were immersed in a third osmium immersion of 2% in water for 90 min. After extensive washing in water, lead aspartate (Walton's (20 mM lead nitrate in 30 mM aspartate buffer, pH 5.5), 50 °C, 120 min) was used to enhance contrast. After two rounds of water wash steps, samples proceeded through a graded ethanol dehydration series (50%, 70%, 90% w/v in water, 30 min each at 4 °C, then 3× 100%, 30 min each at room temperature). Two rounds of 100% acetonitrile (30 min each) served as a transitional solvent step before proceeding to epoxy resin (EMS Hard Plus). A progressive resin infiltration series (1:2 resin:acetonitrile (33% v/v), 1:1 resin:acetonitrile (50% v/v), 2:1 resin acetonitrile (66% v/v), then 2× 100% resin, each step for 24 h or more, on a gyrotary shaker) was done before final embedding in 100% resin in small coffin molds. Epoxy was cured at 60 °C for 96 h before unmolding and mounting on microtome sample stubs for trimming.

The surface of the brain in the neurophysiology ROI was highly irregular, with depressions and elevations that made it impossible to trim all the resin from the surface of the cortex without removing layer 1 (L1) and some portions of layer 2 (L2). Though empty resin increases the number of folds in resulting sections, we left some resin so as to keep the upper layers (L1 and L2) intact to preserve inter-areal connectivity and the apical tufts of pyramidal neurons. Similarly, white matter was also maintained in the block to preserve inter-areal connections despite the risk of increased sectioning artefacts that then have to be corrected through proofreading.

The sections were then collected at a nominal thickness of 40 nm using a modified ATUMtome63 (RMC/Boeckeler) onto 6 reels of grid tape45. The knife was cleaned every 100–500 sections, occasionally leading to the loss of a very thin partial section (≪40 nm). Thermal expansion of the block as sectioning resumed post-cleaning resulted in a short series of sections substantially thicker than the nominal cutting thickness. The sectioning took place in two sessions, the first session took 8 consecutive days on a 24 h a day schedule and contained sections 1 to 14773. The loss rate on this initial session was low, but before section 7931 there were two events that led to consecutive section loss (due to these consecutive section losses we decided to not reconstruct the region containing sections 1 to 7931 even though the imagery was collected). The first event that led to consecutive section loss was due to sections being collected onto apertures with damaged films. To prevent this from happening again, we installed a camera that monitors the aperture before collection. The second event was due to an accident where the knife bumped the block and nicked a region near the edge of the ROI. At the end of this session we started seeing differential compression between the resin and the surface of the cortex. Because this could lead to severe section artefacts, we paused to trim additional empty resin from the block and also replaced the knife. The second session lasted five consecutive days and an additional 13,199 sections were cut. Due to the interruption, block shape changes and knife replacement, there are approximately 45 partial sections at the start of this session; importantly, these do not represent tissue loss (see stitching and alignment section). As will be described later, the EM dataset is subdivided into two subvolumes due to sectioning and imaging events that resulted in loss of a series of sections.

The parallel imaging pipeline described here63 converts a fleet of TEMs into high-throughput automated image systems capable of 24/7 continuous operation. It is built upon a standard JEOL 1200EXII 120 kV TEM that has been modified with customized hardware and software. The key hardware modifications include an extended column and a custom electron-sensitive scintillator. A single large-format CMOS camera outfitted with a low distortion lens is used to grab image frames at an average speed of 100 ms. The autoTEM is also equipped with a nano-positioning sample stage that offers fast, high-fidelity montaging of large tissue sections and an advanced reel-to-reel tape translation system that accurately locates each section using index barcodes for random access on the GridTape. In order for the autoTEM system to control the state of the microscope without human intervention and ensure consistent data quality, we also developed customized software infrastructure piTEAM that provides a convenient GUI-based operating system for image acquisition, TEM image database, real-time image processing and quality control, and closed-loop feedback for error-detection and system protection etc. During imaging, the reel-to-reel GridStage moves the tape and locates targeting aperture through its barcode. The 2D montage is then acquired through raster scanning the ROI area of tissue. Images along with metadata files are transferred to the data storage server. We perform image quality control on all the data and reimage sections that fail the screening. Pixel sizes for all systems were calibrated within the range between 3.95 and 4.05 nm per pixel and the montages had a typical size of 1.2 mm × 0.82 mm. The EM dataset contains raw tile images with two different sizes because two cameras with two different resolutions were used during acquisition. The most commonly used was a 20-megapixel camera that required 5,000 individual tiles to capture the 1 mm2 montage of each section. During the dataset acquisition, three autoTEMs were upgraded with 50-megapixel camera sensors, which increased the frame size and reduced the total number of tiles required per montage to ~2,600

The images in the serial section are first corrected for lens distortion effects. A nonlinear transformation of higher order is computed for each section using a set of 10 × 10 highly overlapping images collected at regular intervals during imaging64. The lens distortion correction transformations should represent the dynamic distortion effects from the TEM lens system and hence require an acquisition of highly overlapping calibration montages at regular intervals. Overlapping image pairs are identified within each section and point correspondences are extracted for every pair using a feature based approach. In our stitching and alignment pipeline, we use SIFT (scale invariant feature transform) feature descriptors to identify and extract these point correspondences. Per image transformation parameters are estimated by a regularized solver algorithm. The algorithm minimizes the sum of squared distances between the point correspondences between these tile images. Deforming the tiles within a section based on these transformations results in a seamless registration of the section. A down-sampled version of these stitched sections are produced for estimating a per section transformation that roughly aligns these sections in 3D. A process similar to 2D stitching is followed here, where the point correspondences are computed between pairs of sections that are within a desired distance in z direction. The per section transformation is then applied to all the tile images within the section to obtain a rough aligned volume. MIPmaps are utilized throughout the stitching process for faster processing without compromise in stitching quality.

The rough aligned volume is rendered to disk for further fine alignment. The software tools used to stitch and align the dataset are available in our github repository (https://github.com/AllenInstitute/asap-modules). The volume assembly process is entirely based on image metadata and transformations manipulations and is supported by the Render service (https://github.com/saalfeldlab/render).

Cracks larger than 30 μm in 34 sections were corrected by manually defining transforms. The smaller and more numerous cracks and folds in the dataset were automatically identified using convolutional networks trained on manually labelled samples using 64 × 64 × 40 nm3 resolution image. The same was done to identify voxels which were considered tissue. The rough alignment was iteratively refined in a coarse-to-fine hierarchy77, using an approach based on a convolutional network to estimate displacements between a pair of images78. Displacement fields were estimated between pairs of neighbouring sections, then combined to produce a final displacement field for each image to further transform the image stack. Alignment was first refined using 1,024 × 1,024 × 40 nm3 images, then 64 × 64 × 40 nm3 images.

The composite image of the partial sections was created using the tissue mask previously computed. Pixels in a partial section which were not included in the tissue mask were set to the value of the nearest pixel in a higher-indexed section that was considered tissue. This composite image was used for downstream processing, but not included with the released images.

Remaining misalignments were detected by cross-correlating patches of image in the same location between two sections, after transforming into the frequency domain and applying a high-pass filter. Combining with the tissue map previously computed, a mask was generated that sets the output of later processing steps to zero in locations with poor alignment. This is called the segmentation output mask.

Using the outlined method79, a convolutional network was trained to estimate inter-voxel affinities that represent the potential for neuronal boundaries between adjacent image voxels. A convolutional network was also trained to perform a semantic segmentation of the image for neurite classifications, including: (1) soma plus nucleus; (2) axon; (3) dendrite; (4) glia; and (5) blood vessel. Following the described methods80, both networks were applied to the entire dataset at 8 × 8 × 40 nm3 in overlapping chunks to produce a consistent prediction of the affinity and neurite classification maps. The segmentation output mask was applied to the predictions.

The affinity map was processed with a distributed watershed and clustering algorithm to produce an over-segmented image, where the watershed domains are agglomerated using single-linkage clustering with size thresholds81,82. The over-segmentation was then processed by a distributed mean affinity clustering algorithm81,82 to create the final segmentation. We augmented the standard mean affinity criterion with constraints based on segment sizes and neurite classification maps during the agglomeration process to prevent neuron-glia mergers as well as axon–dendrite and axon–soma mergers.

A convolutional network was trained to predict whether a given voxel participated in a synaptic cleft. Inference on the entire dataset was processed using the methods described previously80 (using 8 × 8 × 40 nm3 images). These synaptic cleft predictions were segmented using connected components, and components smaller than 40 voxels were removed.

A separate network was trained to perform synaptic partner assignment by predicting the voxels of the synaptic partners given the synaptic cleft as an attentional signal83. This assignment network was run for each detected cleft, and coordinates of both the presynaptic and postsynaptic partner predictions were logged along with each cleft prediction.

To evaluate precision and recall, we manually identified synapses within 70 small subvolumes (n = 8,611 synapses) spread throughout the dataset84.

A convolutional network was trained to predict whether a voxel participated in a cell nucleus. Following the methods described previously80, a nucleus prediction map was produced on the entire dataset at 64 × 64 × 40 nm3. The nucleus prediction was thresholded at 0.5, and segmented using connected components.

Extensive manual, semi-automated, and fully automated proofreading of the segmentation data was performed by multiple teams to improve the accuracy of the neural circuit reconstruction.

Critical to enabling these coordinated proofreading activities is the central ChunkedGraph system1,85,86, which maintains a dynamic segmentation dataset, and supports real-time collaborative proofreading on petascale datasets though scalable software interfaces to receive edit requests from various proofreading platforms and support querying and analysis on edit history.

Multiple proofreading platforms and interfaces were developed and leveraged to support the large-scale proofreading activities performed by various teams at Princeton University, the Allen Institute for Brain Science, Baylor College of Medicine, the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, and ariadne.ai (individual proofreaders are listed in Acknowledgements). Below we outline the methods for these major proofreading activities focused on improving the completeness of neurons within and proximal to the main cortical column, splitting of merged multi-soma objects distributed throughout the image volume, and distributed application of automated proofreading edits to split erroneously merged neuron segments.

Following the methods described previously26,85,87 proofreaders from Princeton University, the Allen Institute for Brain Science, Baylor College of Medicine, and ariadne.ai used a modified version of Neuroglancer with annotation capabilities as a user interface to make manual split and merge edits to neurons with somata spatially located throughout the dataset. The choice of which neurons to proofread was based on the scientific needs of different projects, which are described in the accompanying studies4,5,7,10.

Proofreading was aided by on-demand highlighting of branch points and tips on user-defined regions of a neuron based on rapid skeletonization (https://github.com/AllenInstitute/Guidebook). This approach quickly directed proofreader attention to potential false merges and locations for extension, as well as allowed a clear record of regions of an arbor that had been evaluated.

For dendrites, we checked all branch points for correctness and all tips to see if they could be extended. False merges of simple axon fragments onto dendrites were often not corrected in the raw data, since they could be computationally filtered for analysis after skeletonization (see next section). Detached spine heads were not comprehensively proofread. Dendrites that were proofread are identified in CAVE table proofreading_status_and_strategy as status_dendrite = “true”.

For axons, we began by ‘cleaning' axons of false merges by looking at all branch points. We then performed an extension of axonal tips, the degree of this extension depended on the scientific goals of the different project. The different proofreading strategies were as follows:

Comprehensive extension: each axon end and branch point was visited and checked to see if it was possible to extend until either their biological completion or reached an incomplete end (incomplete ends were due to either the axon reaching the borders of the volume or an artefact that curtailed its continuation). Label: axon_fully_extended.

Substantial extension: each axon branch point was visited and checked, many but not all ends were visited and many but not all ends were done. Label: axon_partially_extended.

Inter_areal_extension: a subset of axons that projected either from a HVA to V1, or from V1 to a HVA were preferentially extended to look specifically at inter-areal connections. Label: axon_interareal

Local cylinder cutting: a subset of pyramidal cells were proofread in a local cylinder which had a 300-μm radius centred around the column featured in Schneider-Mizell et al.4. For layer 2/3 cells the cylinder had a a floor at the layer 4/5 border, for layer 4 cells it had a floor at the layer 5/6 border. Any axon leaving the cylinder was cut and

At least 100 synapses: axons were extended until at least 100 synapses were present on the axon to get a sampling of their output connectivity profile. Label: also axon_partially_extended.

Axons that were proofread are identified in CAVE table proofreading_status_and_strategy as status_axon=‘true' and the proofreading strategy label associated with each axon is described in the column ‘strategy_axon'.

Proofreading was also performed to correctively split multi-soma objects containing more than one neuronal soma, which had been incorrectly merged from the agglomeration step in the reconstruction process. This proofreading was performed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Princeton University, the Allen Institute for Brain Science, and Baylor College of Medicine. These erroneously merged multi-soma objects were specifically targeted given their number, distribution throughout the volume, and subsequent impact on global neural connectivity88 (Extended Data Fig. 3). As an example, multi-soma objects comprised up to 20% of the synaptic targets for 78 excitatory cells that with proofreading status ‘comprehensive extension'. Although the majority of multi-soma objects contained 2 to 25 nuclei (Extended Data Fig. 3a), one large multi-soma object contained 172 neuronal nuclei due to proximity to a major blood vessel present in a substantial portion of the image volume.

Different Neuroglancer web-based applications1,85,86,88 were used to perform this proofreading, but most edits were performed using NeuVue88. NeuVue enables scalable task management across dozens of concurrent users, as well as provide efficient queuing, review, and execution of proofreading edits by integrating with primary data management APIs such as CAVE and PCG. Multi-soma objects used to generate proofreading tasks were originally identified using the nucleus detection table available through CAVE. Additionally, algorithms were employed in a semi-automated workflow to detect the presence of incorrect merges and proposed potential corrective split locations in the segmentation for proofreaders to review and apply2.

Following methods described elsewhere2 automated error-detection and error-correction methods were utilized using the Neural De-composition (NEURD) framework to apply edits to split incorrectly merged axonal and dendritic segments distributed across the image volume. These automated methods leveraged graph filter and graph analysis algorithms to accurately identify errors in the reconstruction and generate corrective solutions. Validation and refinement of these methods were performed through manual review of proposed automated edits through the NeuVue platform88.

We initially manually matched 2,934 fiducials between the EM volume and the 2P structural dataset (1,994 somata and 942 blood vessels, mostly branch points, which are available as part of the resource). Though the fiducials cover the total volume of the dataset it is worth noting that below 400 µm from the surface there is much lower signal to noise in the 2P structural dataset requiring more effort to identify somata, therefore we made use of more vascular fiducials. The fiducial annotation was done using a down-sampled EM dataset with pixel sizes 256 nm (x), 256 nm (y) and 940 nm (z).

Using the fiducials, a transform between the EM dataset and the 2P structural stack was calculated (Methods). To evaluate the error of the transform we evaluated the distance in micrometres between the location of a fiducial after co-registration and its original location; a perfect co-registration would have residuals of 0 μm. The average residual was 3.8 μm.

For calculating the transform we introduced a staged approach to separate the gross transformation between the EM volume and the 2P space from the finer nonlinear deformations needed to get good residuals. This was done by taking advantage of the infrastructure created for the alignment of the EM dataset described above.

The full 3D transform is a list of eight transforms that fall into four groups with different purposes:

The first group is a single transform that is a second-order polynomial transform between the two datasets. This first group serves to scale and rotate the optical dataset into EM space, followed by a single global nonlinear term, leaving an average residual of ~10 µm.

The second group of transforms addresses an issue we saw in the residuals: there were systematic trends in the residuals, both positive and negative, that aligned well with the EM z axis. These trends are spaced in a way that is indicative of changing shape of the EM data on approximately the length scale between knife cleanings or tape changes. We addressed this with a transform that binned the data into z ranges and applied a further second-order polynomial to each bin. We did this in a 2-step hierarchical fashion, first with 5 z bins, followed by a second with 21 z bins. These steps removed the systematic trends in the residuals versus z and the average residuals dropped to 5.6 µm and 4.6 µm respectively.

The third group is a set of hierarchical thin plate spline transforms. We used successively finer grids of control points of even n × n × n spacing in the volume. We used 4 steps with n = [3, 5, 10, 12]. The idea here is to account for deformations on larger length scales first, so that the highest order transforms introduce smaller changes in position. The average residuals in these steps were 3.9, 3.5, 3.1 and 2.9 µm accomplished with average control point motions of 12.5, 7.5, 3.8 and 1.6 µm.

The final group is a single thin plate spline transform. The control points for this transform are no longer an evenly spaced grid. Instead, each fiducial point is assigned to be a control point. This transform minimizes the residuals almost perfectly (as it should for the control points which are identical to the fiducials; 0.003 µm on average; Fig. 3) and accomplishes this final step by moving each data point on average another 2.9 µm. This last transform is very sensitive to error in fiducial location but provides the co-registration with minimal residuals. This last transform is also more likely to create errors in regions with strong distortions, as for example the edges of the dataset.

Since the nature of transform 4 is to effectively set the residuals to zero for the control points, we used a new measure to evaluate the error of the transform. We created 2,933 3D transforms, each time leaving out one fiducial and then evaluated the residual of the left-out point. We call this measure ‘leave-one-out' residuals and it evaluates how well the transform does with a new point.

A custom user interface was used to visualize images from both the functional data and EM data side-by-side to manually associate functional ROIs to their matching EM cell counterpart and vice versa. To visualize the functional scans, summary images were generated by averaging the scan over time (average image) and correlating pixels with neighbour pixels over time (correlation image). The product of the average and correlation images were used to clearly visualize cell body locations. Using the per field affine registration into the 2P structural stack (Fig. 3b), a representative image of labelled vasculature corresponding to the registered field was extracted from the red channel of the stack. EM imagery and EM nucleus segmentation was resized to 1 μm3 resolution, and transformed into the 2P structural stack coordinates using the co-registration transform, allowing an EM image corresponding to the registered field to be extracted. The overlay of the extracted vessel field and extracted EM image were used to confirm local alignment of the vasculature visible in both domains. Soma identity was assessed by comparing the spatial structure of the target soma and nearby somas in the functional image to soma locations from the EM cell nuclei image. Using the tool, matchers generated a hypothesis for which EM cell nucleus matched to a given functional unit or vice versa. A custom version of Neuroglancer (Seung laboratory; https://github.com/seung-lab/neuroglancer) was used to visualize the region of interest in the ground truth EM data for match confirmation. The breakdown in the number of unique neuron matches per 2P scan is shown in Extended Data Fig. 4a. The resulting matches are uploaded to CAVE table coregistration_manual_v4. The latest recommended manual match table can be found at https://www.microns-explorer.org/cortical-mm3#f-coreg.

In addition to the matches, the manual co-registration table includes two metrics that help assess confidence. The first, residual, measures the distance between the matched 2P functional unit centroid and EM neuron soma centroid, after transformation with the EM to 2P fiducial-based transform (Extended Data Fig. 4b, top). The second metric, separation score, measures the difference in residuals between the match and the nearest non-matched EM neuron. (Extended Data Fig. 4b, bottom) Negative separation indicates that the nearest EM neuron to the functional unit after transformation was not chosen by the matchers. Smaller residuals and larger separation scores indicate higher confidence matches, as is the case for a majority of matches (Extended Data Fig. 4c). To help validate the manual matches, for every EM neuron that was independently matched to at least two scans, the in vivo signal correlation (correlation between trial-averaged responses to oracle stimuli) was computed between the matched unit in scan A to the matched unit in scan B. In addition, for each neuron, two control correlations were computed, the matched unit in scan A to the nearest unit not matched to the neuron in scan B, and vice versa (Extended Data Fig. 4d). As expected, the distribution of oracle scores between the matched neurons and control neurons are qualitatively similar, with a slight right-shift towards higher oracle scores for matches, as higher oracle scores were prioritized for matching (Extended Data Fig. 4e). The comparison of signal correlation between matched neurons and their control counterparts exhibits a strong trend, with a clustering in the upper left quadrant and most data points positioned above the diagonal. This indicates that the matched neurons consistently have stronger signal correlations compared to their nearest counterparts, and high signal correlation overall, especially when the oracle score is larger (Extended Data Fig. 4f). Filtering by oracle score further refines the trend, highlighting that high oracle score neurons (score >0.2) show even more distinct separation, with matched neurons maintaining superior signal correlation values compared to the nearest-neighbour matches (Extended Data Fig. 4g,h).

To generate the fiducial-based automatch, we utilized the EM-to-2P co-registration transform to map all EM neuron nucleus centroids (retrieved from the CAVE table nucleus_neuron_svm) into the 2P functional space. Next, we applied the minimum weight matching algorithm for bipartite graphs89 using the linear_sum_assignment function from the scipy.optimize module90 to perform the matching. The resulting automatch table is stored in the CAVE table coregistration_auto_phase3_fwd, which also includes the associated residual and separation scores. The latest recommended fiducial-based automatch table can be found at https://www.microns-explorer.org/cortical-mm3#f-coreg.

To achieve co-registration starting with the 2P structural stacks and EM segmentation and without the use of fiducials, we employed a multi-scale B-spline registration91 using only vasculature data. This non-rigid transformation method corrects the extreme nonlinear tissue distortions caused by shrinkage from 2P to EM. Both the EM segmentation and the 2P structural stack volumes were subsampled to match 1-μm voxel resolution, ensuring consistent scaling and indexing between the volumes.

Pre-processing on the vessels was necessary to address inconsistent signal quality in the 2P data, especially for vessels located deeper in the cortex, which emit lower fluorescence. A Meijering neurite filter92 was applied to the vessels, using the eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix to detect vessels effectively.

An additional filtering step mitigated discrepancies in z resolution and errors from false splits in the EM segmentation. To address the z direction smearing in 2P due to anisotropy, both the 2P and EM volumes were binarized, skeletonized and further processed by removing small isolated segments. A Gaussian filter was convolved over the skeletons, forming tubes of constant radius for co-registration. Another round of skeletonization and Gaussian filtering was applied to correct for false splits in thicker vessels.

The final co-registration was computed using SimpleITK's B-spline algorithm93, treating the EM volume as the ‘moving' volume. Initially, centroid alignment was achieved via template matching within a small subvolume. Despite tissue shrinkage, the volumes were locally aligned well enough to yield good correlations. The B-spline transformation was performed across multiple scales, progressing from coarse grids with strong smoothing to finer grids with minimal smoothing. The Limited-Memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) optimizer with 600 iterations was used, sampling 1% of the points to handle large matrices. The resulting flow field and its inverse defined how each voxel mapped between spaces.

For the final step, the flow field was applied to both the EM nuclear segmentation and the 2P unit centroids. Minimum weight matching was performed (as described in ‘Generating the fiducial-based automatch') to establish match assignments, using excitatory neuron centroids from the CAVE table aibs_metamodel_mtypes_v661_v2. The final table is uploaded to apl_functional_coreg_vess_fwd with the associated residual and separation scores. The latest recommended vessel-based automatch table can be found at https://www.microns-explorer.org/cortical-mm3#f-coreg.

To generate the fiducial-vessel agreement automatch table, first, for each table described above (coregistration_auto_phase3_fwd, apl_functional_coreg_vess_fwd), the residual and separation scores were transformed into percentiles. Then, the two tables were merged on keys: ‘session', ‘scan_idx', ‘field', ‘unit_id' and ‘target_id'.

To evaluate the automatch tables, we computed precision and recall using manual matches as ground truth. To ensure a fair comparison, we first restricted both the automatch and manual match tables to only contain rows where the functional unit or EM neuron was commonly attempted. For calculating precision and recall, true positives were rows common to both tables, false positives were rows only in the automatch table, and false negatives were rows only in the manual match table. The precision-recall curves can be used to select an automatch, and/ or a metric with which to threshold matches (Extended Data Fig. 5a). In addition, heat maps are provided indicating precision levels (Extended Data Fig. 5b) and number of automatches remaining (Extended Data Fig. 5c) for jointly applied residual and separation percentile thresholds. To apply a threshold, first convert the residual and separation (named ‘score' in the table) to percentiles. Then for residual, apply the threshold as a maximum, taking the matches below the threshold. Conversely, for separation, apply the threshold as a minimum.

We analysed the nucleus segmentations for features such as volume, surface area, fraction of membrane within folds and depth in cortex. We trained a support vector machine (SVM) machine classifier to use these features to detect which nucleus detections were likely neurons within the volume, with 96.9% precision and 99.6% recall. This model was trained based upon data from an independent dataset, and the performance numbers are based upon evaluating the concordance of the model with the manual cell-type calls within the volume. This model predicted 82,247 neurons detected within the larger subvolume. For the neurons, we extracted additional features from the somatic region of the cell, including its volume, surface area, and density of synapses. Dimensionality reduction on this feature space revealed a clear separation between neurons with well-segmented somatic regions (n = 69,957) from those with fragmented segmentations or sizable merges with other objects (n = 12,290). Combining those features with the nucleus features, we trained a multi-layer perceptron classifier to distinguish excitatory from inhibitory neurons among the well-segmented subset, using the 80% of the manual labelled data as a training set, and 20% as a validation set to choose hyper-parameters. After running the classifier across the entire dataset, we then tested the performance by sampling an additional 350 cells (250 excitatory and 100 inhibitory). We estimate from this test that the classifier had an overall accuracy of 97% with an estimated 96% precision and 94% recall for inhibitory calls.

Location and distribution of test subvolumes (x = 5.5 µm, y = 5.5 µm, z = 5.5 µm) throughout the whole subvolume 65 that were used for validation of automated synaptic contact segmentation. Identification and annotation of synaptic contacts (n = 8,611 synapses) were performed manually within each subvolume and compared with automated results to calculate subvolume and combined precision (96%), recall (89%), and F1 scores (92%), with test subvolume F1 scores visualized by color within each plot. The two panels show a coronal (a) and top (b) view of the location of the sampling sites. In (a) the vertical axis represents the pia to white matter direction and the horizontal axis represents the medial-lateral direction. In (b) the vertical axis represents the anterior-posterior direction and the horizontal axis represents the medial-lateral direction.

(A) Histogram of number of edits across all the objects associated with nuclei. Distribution of neurons with complete dendritic proofreading highlighted in blue, and neurons with clean axons in orange. Cells with complete dendritic proofreading have often had some axon edits as well, so this is an upper bound on the number of edits required to fully extend dendrites. Most cells have had very little proofreading and have been mostly touched by automated methods. Note plot is on a log-log scale. (B) Number of edits compared to number of output synapses in reconstruction. For all the clean axons for which we have cell type annotations, the number of edits versus the number of outputs is plotted on a log log scale. Data points are colored with respect to their broad cell class. Generally, more extensively reconstructed axons have more edits, but there are also strong cell and cell-type specific effects. This reflects systematic differences in the thickness of axons of different cell types, as well as variation in how much of the axon is contained within the volume and the quality of the segmentation in different locations in the dataset.

(A) Distribution of multi-soma IDs by number of neuronal nuclei was monitored throughout proofreading. Difference in multi-neuron root IDs before APL proofreading (dark blue) and after (light blue). Note that this shows the number of neurons per ID, which means that non-neuron somas are not counted. This figure was derived using the soma classification table: nucleus_ref_neuron_svm. Note that a small number of multi-soma IDs were skipped during APL proofreading because they contain low quality neurons merged to myelinated axons or they were falsely classified as neuronal (e.g. blood vessels); (B) Spatial distribution of multi-neuron ID soma centers (soma locations of merged cells containing ≥ 2 neuronal nuclei) before APL proofreading and after. Both are a lateral view of the volume that shows distribution across layers, from pia (top) to white matter (bottom). Color-bar represents depth.

a) The number of matched neuronal EM nuclei by session/ scan b) Schematic of the residual and separation score metric. Residual: For a matched EM nucleus to a functional ROI (unit), the residual is computed as the euclidean distance between the nucleus centroid and unit centroid after transforming the nucleus centroid from EM to 2P space with the spline-based co-registration. Separation score: For a matched EM nucleus to a functional unit the separation score is computed as the difference between the residual of the matched pair and the residual of the nearest EM neuronal nucleus that was not matched to the unit. c) 2D histogram of separation score and residual. d) Schematic of in vivo signal correlation analysis (see Methods). e) The distribution of oracle scores for matched units and the nearest unit controls. f) Scatter plot of signal correlations for all matched units (y-axis) vs the signal correlations for the nearest unit controls (x-axis) and colored by oracle score. Note that each matched unit pair has two data points on the plot for each of the two control correlations. g) Same as in f) restricted to matched units with oracle >0.2. h) same as in f) restricted to matched units and control units with oracle > 0.2.

a) Precision-recall curves showing performance relative to manual matches (used as the ground truth) across residual (left) and separation percentiles (right) for fiducial-based, vessel-based, and fiducial-vessel agreement automatch methods. b) Heatmaps of max residual percentile and min separation percentile colored by precision relative to manual matches, for the fiducial-based (left), vessel-based (middle) and fiducial-vessel agreement (right) automatches. Max residual percentile represents the threshold below which matches were included, while min separation percentile represents the threshold above which matches were included. c) Heatmaps of max residual percentile and min separation percentile colored by the number of neurons remaining after thresholds were applied, for the fiducial-based (left), vessel-based (middle) and fiducial-vessel agreement (right) automatches.

Metrics details

The Maltese archipelago is a small island chain that is among the most remote in the Mediterranean. Humans were not thought to have reached and inhabited such small and isolated islands until the regional shift to Neolithic lifeways, around 7.5 thousand years ago (ka)1. In the standard view, the limited resources and ecological vulnerabilities of small islands, coupled with the technological challenges of long-distance seafaring, meant that hunter-gatherers were either unable or unwilling to make these journeys2,3,4. Here we describe chronological, archaeological, faunal and botanical data that support the presence of Holocene hunter-gatherers on the Maltese islands. At this time, Malta's geographical configuration and sea levels approximated those of the present day, necessitating seafaring distances of around 100 km from Sicily, the closest landmass. Occupations began at around 8.5 ka and are likely to have lasted until around 7.5 ka. These hunter-gatherers exploited land animals, but were also able to take advantage of marine resources and avifauna, helping to sustain these groups on a small island. Our discoveries document the longest yet-known hunter-gatherer sea crossings in the Mediterranean, raising the possibility of unknown, precocious connections across the wider region.

The emergence of long-distance seafaring varies considerably around the globe, with an early appearance in Southeast Asia and Sahul seemingly not replicated until later in other regions, such as the islands off the African coast5,6,7,8,9. With a sea crossing of around 100 km from Sicily, and around three times as far to the Maghreb, the Maltese Archipelago is among the most remote groups of islands in the Mediterranean, the world's largest inland sea (Fig. 1). Sea-level rise rapidly submerged the low-lying, now around 95 m deep, hypothesized land bridge from Malta to Sicily around 13 ka. Over the next few thousand years, both Sicily and the Maltese islands reached their current configurations, with Malta now having a combined landmass of just 316 km2 (ref. 10). Like other small Mediterranean islands, and particularly given its semi-arid climate, Malta was inferred to have been too small and remote to support human populations before the adoption of farming and more advanced seafaring technology (see Supplementary Information 1 for discussion). The general consensus has been that hunter-gatherers only journeyed to Mediterranean islands that were large, and/or easy to reach, such as through chains of connecting islands, proximity to the mainland or favourable currents1,2,11 (Supplementary Information 1).

Previous research has supported this view, with the evidence suggesting that the first people to reach Malta were Neolithic farmers, associated with impressed ware pottery, stemming from the Sicilian ‘Stentinello' phase of the Neolithic12,13,14. These farmers were assumed to have introduced crops and domesticated and commensal fauna into a pristine island ecosystem14. The directly dated and secure evidence for the start of the Neolithic in Malta indicates an age of around 7.4 ka (ref. 15), which is consistent with the regional chronology of the spread of the Neolithic from southern Italy16. It is also consistent with our own chronological model (Methods, Supplementary Information 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1) based on an extensive database of radiocarbon dates with good contextual information, indicating that the earliest Neolithic in southern Italy and Sicily dates to around 7.9–7.5 ka, and later in Malta at around 7.4–7.1 ka. Although occasional claims for an earlier Neolithic in both Sicily and Malta have been suggested, they are problematic because of radiocarbon dates and age models with high levels of uncertainty, in addition to being inconsistent with the regional chronology mentioned above (Supplementary Information 1 and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3). Although claims of a far earlier Pleistocene human presence on Malta have also been made17,18, they have so far failed to stand up to scrutiny on morphological and chronological grounds (Supplementary Information 1).

Here we provide decisive evidence for a pre-Neolithic human presence on the Maltese islands, in the form of a previously unknown Mesolithic phase characterized by the presence of Holocene hunter-gatherers. This discovery casts new light on the age and extent of Mesolithic sea crossings in the Mediterranean, and on hunter-gatherer interactions with endemic island fauna. Joint investigations led by the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology and the University of Malta have unravelled a deep archaeological sequence at the site of Latnija (Lat-nee-yuh). The site is located in a large doline in the Mellieħa area of northern Malta (Fig. 1), in the vicinity of several fresh water sources and close to a coastline that has both sandy beaches and rocky shorelines19. Detailed excavations between 2021 and 2023 revealed early-to-mid-Holocene-aged sediments that contain stone tools, hearths, ash-tips and a range of wild flora and fauna, including marine gastropods, fish and marine mammals. These findings reveal the cultural and ecological context of the final stages of the Mesolithic, before the Neolithic transition in the region. Crucially, they also reveal the longest sea crossing yet documented in the Mediterranean by hunter-gatherers, highlighting the considerable seafaring abilities of late European hunter-gatherers. Even in the subsequent Neolithic, there are only occasional indications of such long sea crossings in the Mediterranean20. Our findings upend the established notions that small and remote islands were beyond reach in the Mesolithic world.

We excavated a 5 × 5-m trench (designated Trench 4) beneath an overhang on the north-western edge of the doline, in the lee of the prevailing northwesterly wind (Methods). We divided the trench plan into an alphanumeric grid of 1-m2 squares (J–N, 2–6; Fig. 1) and recorded the position of all artefacts and bones larger than 20 mm in three dimensions using a total station. We describe the excavated sequence in six phases (labelled Phase I–VI from top to bottom), combining distinct differences in depositional processes (Supplementary Information 2) and material culture. The base of our excavated sequence (Phase VI; Fig. 2, Beds 15–13) comprises a naturally formed fine-grained cave sediment, pale orange to pink in colour (dominated by fine sands and silts), on top of sloping boulders. The character of the deposits in Phase VI is in stark contrast to that of the deposits that overlie them in Phases V–III, in which the presence of ash, fauna and shell-rich sediments presents conspicuous evidence for anthropic activity, which we refer to as the Mesolithic Horizon (Fig. 2).

Top, illustration of the key stratigraphic sequence (numbered Beds are described in Supplementary Information 2) highlighting a thick bed of ash (A; bottom left), and a hearth deposit or combustion structure (B; bottom right), with combustion residue (ash on top), thermal impact zone and a natural substrate (Supplementary Information 3), at the base of the Mesolithic Horizon. Note also the Phorcus turbinatus tip line, starting in the mid-right of box A.

The earliest Mesolithic deposit in Phase V (Fig. 2, Beds 12–10) is marked by discrete hearth features, overlain by a bed of grey ash-rich sediment of varying thickness, a rich faunal assemblage and stone tools. The lowest hearth, from N2 (Phase V; Fig. 2 (B)), comprises two superimposed differentiated layers, as described from other sites and identified through experimental archaeology21,22 (Supplementary Information 2 and 3 and Fig. 2). This includes a heterogeneous light-grey ashy combustion residue of varying thickness (typically 6–12 cm) overlying a homogeneous brown-to-black thermally impacted sediment, which are distinct from the underlying Phase VI substrate (Fig. 2). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses confirmed that combustion residues are composed mainly of pyrogenic calcite (ash), with some thermally altered clay, which might have been introduced between burning episodes; more limited pyrogenic alteration is evident in the thermal impact zone (Supplementary Information 3). Analyses showed that higher concentrations of phytoliths were present in the same samples in which ash has been documented, compared with other parts of the combustion structure (thermal impact) and control samples (Supplementary Information 3). This indicates that the phytoliths (described below) reached the site as a result of an anthropic contribution in the form of fuel or related to use of the combustion structure. Micromorphological analysis of the sediments directly below the hearth feature in N2 show evidence for enhanced reddening and enrichment in iron oxides relative to the natural cave floor sediments (Methods and Supplementary Information 2). This is consistent with this combustion feature being in situ. In L2 and M2, micromorphology and detailed sediment analysis indicate a more complex relationship between deposits that are rich in combustion products and the sediments that underlie them; some show evidence for in situ burning, whereas others indicate erosion or cutting into the underlying sediments and the localized remobilization and redistribution of ash-rich materials (Supplementary Information 2).

The onset of episodes of cave-wall collapse is observed at the top of this ash-rich deposit, marked by a clast-dominant layer closer to the cave wall, grading to finer sediments beyond the dripline, also containing fauna and artefacts (Phase IV; Fig. 2, Bed 3b). A subcircular pit (Phase III; Fig. 2, Beds 9–5) has been dug through this layer, truncating the top of Phase V deposits; this pit contains discrete dumps of marine shells and ashes (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Information 2), as well as stone tools. The Mesolithic Horizon is sealed by more conspicuous episodes of cave-wall collapse, including both clast- and matrix-dominated cave sedimentation that contains artefacts attesting to later prehistoric, historic (Phase II; Fig. 2, Beds 4–1) and modern (Phase I) occupations.

We selected samples for chronometric dating to constrain the age range of key sedimentary deposits, the boundaries of major sediment phases and the shells of edible marine gastropods (Phorcus turbinatus; n = 49) accumulated by humans. A total of 32 dates (obtained using accelerator mass spectrometry) on charcoal were used to constrain the different phases at the site. One additional date was also recovered on bone, whereas insufficient collagen meant that all other attempts to date bone failed (Supplementary Information 4). These dates were then calibrated to estimate the boundaries between depositional phases with a Bayesian phase model (Fig. 3, Methods and Supplementary Information 4). The results show that occupation of the site began by around 8.5 ka, well before the earliest-known dates for the arrival of Neolithic farmers in Malta and the wider region—attesting to the presence of Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. The end of the Mesolithic is more difficult to determine without precise dates for the beginning of the Neolithic at the site, but it seems to end with the arrival or establishment of the first farmers (Supplementary Information 4). The P. turbinatus shells were corrected for the marine reservoir effect (MRE) and calibrated ages were calculated (Methods and Supplementary Information 4). The P. turbinatus shells range from around 8.6 ka to 7.5 ka, supporting the charcoal age model. Crucially, the limited variability of these shell ages supports the intact stratigraphic character of the Mesolithic Horizon, a feature particularly visible in the conspicuous tip lines in Phase III (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Information 2). Overall, the consistent chronological data and highly resolved stratigraphy support the integrity and well-dated character of the Latnija sequence.

Model (OxCal 4.4; IntCal20) shows the phase boundaries in the Mesolithic Horizon, Phases III–V. The model indicates that the mean start date of the Mesolithic Horizon is 8.5 ka. Laboratory codes are included in the left box.

A total of 64 lithics (knapped stone tools) were recovered from the Mesolithic Horizon (Phase V–III) deposits (Supplementary Information 5). Except for one chert artefact, all stone tools were made of limestone, much of which was clearly procured in the form of beach cobbles or pebbles, with the remainder sourced from terrestrial outcrops. This contrasts with younger, Neolithic, assemblages from Malta, which are made from chert (both local and imported) and small amounts of imported obsidian14,23,24. Cores, blades and bladelets and retouched tools are rare in the Latnija Mesolithic assemblage, which is instead focused on simple flakes produced by hard hammer percussion. The main reduction products were squat and often cortical flakes, with generally unidirectional dorsal scar patterns. In contrast to penecontemporaneous assemblages from Sicily and other adjacent areas, which generally exhibit complex technologies and geometric forms (for example, trapezes), the lithic material from Latnija most resembles relatively expedient Mesolithic lithic technology from Sardinia25 (Supplementary Information 1 and 5). The simple character of the Latnija lithic assemblage might reflect the poor quality of the limestone used and expediency, but could also reflect other factors, including demographic aspects, such as small population size and isolation.

A total of 955 piece-plotted specimens (larger than 20 mm) from the Mesolithic Horizon were recorded during the 2021 and 2022 seasons, in addition to many smaller fragments recovered during sieving and flotation (Supplementary Information 6). The fauna is all wild, and overall is dominated by red deer (Cervus elaphus), birds and marine gastropods (P. turbinatus in particular, but also limpets), with the latter so far comprising some 10,000 shells (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Information 6). Small numbers of reptiles (for example, turtles and tortoises), fish (for example, groupers), crustaceans (crabs), echinoderms (sea urchins) and marine mammals (seals) were also found (Fig. 4). In line with the extensive evidence for anthropic combustion, around 25% of taphonomically studied faunal remains, including those of red deer, birds and tortoises, as well as the marine gastropods, had evidence of burning or charring (Supplementary Information 6). Although a detailed taphonomic analysis is ongoing, other traces of anthropogenic activity can also be observed, including probable percussion notches and green fracturing.

The use of marine resources, including not only small gastropods and crustaceans, but also large marine mammals, matches well with subsistence behaviours observed at other Mesolithic sites in the Mediterranean26,27,28. Notably, studies of Neolithic and younger sites in Malta have uncovered little evidence for marine resource exploitation—and archaeological and isotopic studies suggest that people had diets that were focused mostly on terrestrial resources, including livestock and wild and domesticated plants15,29. The Mesolithic deposits at Latnija therefore represent a unique level of marine resource engagement in Malta and a substantially different diet to that of later, farming communities.

Archaeobotanical analyses were further used to understand the environmental context of the Mesolithic Horizon. Grasses were abundant and are represented by many different phytolith morphologies (Supplementary Information 3). Most of the grasses correspond to C3 types, although phytolith morphologies ascribed to C4 plants are also present. Pollen analysis of two samples from Phase V provides evidence of an open shrub vegetation consisting of Erica multiflora and Euphorbia melitensis, with patches of Pistacia lentiscus shrub communities occupying areas in which higher moisture levels were present and soil development occurred.

Macrobotanical samples were recovered from the systematic flotation of sediments (Methods). Seeds of a few small, wild herbaceous plants were identified, including a small-seeded grass (Poaceae), small-seeded legumes and seeds of a member of the Chenopodioideae, as well as Mercurialis cf. annua and Vaccaria hispanica. All of these plants grow wild on Malta today and might have been introduced to the site either by the burning of brush or through natural processes, such as the activity of rodents or birds, and inadvertently burned with cave sediments. Complementing the phytolith and macrobotanical data, the charcoal analyses reflect a shrubby vegetation adapted to the island environment, and characterized by an open scrubland dominated by Pistacia cf. lentiscus, Juniperus and Tetraclinis among other shrubs, similar to the present day. These data together indicate the presence of vegetative communities typical of the Early to Middle Holocene in the Central Mediterranean region, which have been linked to the onset of more humid climate conditions30,31,32. These observations were further complemented by isotopic analyses of ungulate and rodent teeth from the site (Methods and Supplementary Information 3), which indicate a fairly stable mixture of dry C3 grassland, scrubland and woodland. In terms of plant use, the presence of the spheroid echinate phytolith morphotype in the hearth is noteworthy. This probably corresponds to the indigenous Chamaerops humilis (Mediterranean fan palm)33. Chamaerops humilis and other palms have a wide range of uses, ranging from textiles to construction materials and food, among others. However, the greater presence of these morphotypes in the samples related to the combustion residue seems to indicate that they were also used as fuel. Anthracological analyses revealed that the most common fuel was Pistacia cf. lentiscus wood, which still grows in the vicinity of the site today. Wild seeds of grasses, and a few other low-growing herbaceous plants, were recovered in a carbonized state, either representing the burning of vegetation around the site or the construction of a hearth on top of seed-laden sediments.

The evidence from Latnija confirms a Mesolithic occupation of the Maltese islands spanning from around 8.5 ka to 7.5 ka, which differs markedly from younger, agro-pastoral societies in technology, raw materials, diet and subsistence practices. The earliest Mesolithic arrivals on what we presume were dugout canoes, date to a time when Malta had almost reached its current configuration, which today has a minimum straight-line distance of around 85 km to Sicily34,35. However, sea surface currents and prevailing winds, as well as the use of landmarks, stars and other wayfinding practices, mean that the distances traversed by hunter-gatherers to Malta could have been considerably longer, and a crossing of about 100 km has been proposed for the Neolithic36,37,38,39 (Supplementary Information 1). In particular, any crossing from Sicily to Malta would have had to contend with the ocean current dynamics in the Malta Channel40. Experimental voyages on a replica of an Early Neolithic dug-out canoe from La Marmotta (Italy) suggest that crossings of 50 km could be accomplished at a speed of about 4 km h−1 (just over 2 knots)41, implying an outward summer sea journey that would have necessitated all daylight hours and an additional 8 h of darkness. In the summer, the drift caused by a southeasterly current that goes up to as much as 2 knots would have extended this outward journey even further42. In antiquity, as well as more historic periods, these conditions seem to have led sailboats to prioritize ports along the Gulf of Gela as a point of departure from Sicily, rather than the closest point to Malta43. These findings therefore provide evidence of long-distance, open-water sea journeys that were far longer than any previously documented in the Mediterranean, before the Neolithic and Bronze Age, when developments such as the invention of the sail occurred1. Such inter-island crossings fall into the category of ‘difficult routes'; evidence from elsewhere suggests that canoers would avoid the dangers of voyaging at night altogether44.

The motivation for these long sea crossings remains ambiguous. It might be that movement to Malta was driven by the availability of (perhaps seasonal) subsistence resources, catalysed by the slightly improved climate of the Early Holocene. It is also possible that the Maltese Mesolithic reflects social rather than environmental factors; namely, the potential regional demographic shockwaves through hunter-gatherer societies associated with the transition to the Neolithic in the Mediterranean (Supplementary Information 1).

The story of Mesolithic Malta is part of a set of broader demographic and behavioural changes in the dynamic epoch of the final hunter-gatherer societies of the Mediterranean. These are both important in their own right, and also set the cultural and ecological scene for the transition to the Neolithic. The ability of Mesolithic hunter-gatherers to reach small and remote Mediterranean islands forces a re-evaluation of the capabilities and strategies of the last hunter-gatherers of the region. It also shows that Neolithic arrivals did not enter a pristine insular landscape on Malta, but rather an ecosystem that had been shaped by humans for centuries. Finally, the presence of Mesolithic hunter-gatherers on Malta raises the possibility of other long-distance connections. For example, the technological similarities between contemporary Mesolithic and Epipaleolithic communities on the African and European sides of the Mediterranean have been noted45,46,47. The combination of several islands, and their proximity to indented mainland shorelines, has also suggested that the south-central Mediterranean and eastern Maghreb could have been a hub for early maritime activity in the region48. The evidence we present for early long-distance seafaring from the heart of the Mediterranean adds another layer to this emerging narrative.

Our multidisciplinary study combines archaeobotany (Supplementary Table 1), chronological modelling (Supplementary Tables 2–6), isotopes (Supplementary Table 7), contextual research and broad regional chronological modelling (Supplementary Tables 8 and 9) with anthracology and phytoliths (Supplementary Tables 10–13), lithics (Supplementary Table 14) and the study of faunal remains (Supplementary Tables 15 and 16). The methods used are described below, with further contextual information in the Supplementary Information and Extended Data Figs. 1–11.

Here, we describe the excavation of a 5 × 5-m trench, designated Trench 4, at Latnija between 2021 and 2023, expanding on a 1 ×1-m test trench excavated in 2019. We set up an alphanumeric grid system in the doline to label each individual 1 ×1-m square, aligned in orientation with the 2019 test trench and with the nearby cave wall, with letters running on a SW–NE axis and numbers increasing on a NW–SE axis. The 2019 test excavation targeted square M2, with the expanded Trench 4 spanning squares J–N and 2–6, located at the northern edge of the doline spanning the dripline (Fig. 1).

Excavation was performed using a single-context recording methodology to resolve between discrete sediment units, with arbitrary subdivisions within a single deposit as 5–10-cm spits where necessary to aid control of find recovery and sediment sampling. Features of post-depositional disturbance, such as animal burrows, were readily differentiated from undisturbed sediments owing to their mixed character and friable texture and the presence of sediment voids, and were excavated in their entirety and excluded from our analyses. Finer-scale post-depositional disturbance occurs as limited fine rooting and is restricted to the uppermost deposits. The natural deposition of clasts from the shelter wall presents an alternate form of potential post-depositional disturbance that might have led to localized soft-sediment deformation. The three-dimensional position of all artefacts larger than 20 mm, bones larger than 20 mm and charcoal, and the geometry of excavation context boundaries, were recorded using a total station. Bulk sediment sampling retained a minimum of 60 l per context (predominantly in the uppermost deposits) up to 100% sampling of sediments, which were processed by bucket flotation using 250-µm mesh for macrobotanical recovery, followed by wet sieving through 5-mm screens for artefact recovery; sediments that were not retained for flotation and wet sieving were dry sieved through 5-mm screens. Additional sediment samples were recovered from each context for ancillary analyses.

So far, we have identified 309 discrete sedimentary contexts, reaching a maximum depth of 1.48 m from the surface. We have grouped contexts into six phases (Phases I to VI) on the basis of major changes in sediment colour, texture, composition and structure, alongside patterns evident in material culture. The stratigraphic matrix for the Mesolithic Horizon and immediately underlying deposits is presented in Extended Data Fig. 3.

Micromorphological samples for thin-section production were collected by cutting in situ, orientated blocks of sediment into Kubiena tins (90 mm × 70 mm × 50 mm). The location of Kubiena samples was dictated by the architecture of the sediment sequence and representative sediment deposits, and the contacts between deposits were targeted. The laboratory samples were air-dried for two weeks and placed in labelled plastic pots. The samples were immersed in a mixture of clear casting resin (four parts) to acetone (one part). To accelerate curing, a catalyst of methylethylketone peroxide was added (3 ml catalyst to 2,000 ml resin). The resin mixture was poured around the side of the sample to allow the larger pore spaces to be filled from adhesion and cohesion, and then completely immersed in the resin. The samples were impregnated under a stepped-vacuum regime to a maximum vacuum pressure of −25 in Hg for eight hours. The samples were left to cure for around six weeks until the resin was hardened, followed by a final cure at 65 °C for 15 h. The blocks were removed from the sample frame, split along their long axes and one surface polished on fixed diamond abrasives with successively finer grades (70 µm, 45 µm and 20 µm). The polished sample was stuck to a labelled slide using an epoxy resin that cures overnight. The slide and sample were cut down to around 1 mm and then excess sample was removed using a Jones and Shipman surface grinder. The sample was hand-polished to finish off the surface before coverslipping the sample again by bonding with an epoxy resin. Analysis of the thin sections was performed on a Leica M205C petrological stereo zoom microscope and image capture was done using the Image Pro-Express software.

Studies of plants in the Mesolithic Horizon at Latnija were performed in the form of pollen analyses, anthracology, hearth phytolith analyses and macrobotanical identifications from remains recovered through flotation. These analyses were performed to reconstruct the vegetation of the site, determine whether any domesticated plants were present, investigate the use of different fuels at the site and unravel mineral composition to identify combustion structures.

For pollen analysis, we collected sedimentary samples to perform palynological analyses focused on the reconstruction of past vegetation at and near Latnija. Sampling was performed in Phase V contexts (034) and (048), both of which are characterized by the presence of thick ash and combustion residue deposits. This approach was adopted to correlate the palaeobotanical remains preserved in the sediment with human activities during Phase V, which is characterized by the oldest Mesolithic.

Samples were treated following pollen concentration techniques52. This included sediment deflocculation with sodium pyrophosphate, Lycopodium tablets with known content to calculate palynomorph concentration values53 and 7-µm nylon sieve to discard clay-sized particles. Carbonates were removed with 10% HCl and concentrated at 2,500 rpm for three minutes. Heavy liquid separation using sodium metatungstate with a specific gravity of 2.0 and centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for 20 min was done to separate organic and mineral fractions. After recovering the upper supernatant fraction, this step was repeated to increase the concentration. The remaining fraction was treated with cold 40% HF for one night to eliminate remaining silicates. The residue was washed in 98% ethanol, glycerol was added and the remaining ethanol was evaporated. The solution was kept in glycerol, mounted on slides and identified at 400× magnification under a light-transmitted microscope by referring to established literature54,55. Pollen counts were done up to 250 identifiable grains. A pollen diagram (Extended Data Fig. 4a) indicating values for each taxon as percentages of the total pollen sum was plotted with the help of C2 software56.

For anthracological analyses, bucket flotation was used to recover charcoal and other carbonized archaeobotanical remains from the sediments, all of which were collected. Charcoal was also handpicked to provide a larger number to select for dating purposes and anthracology.

A total of 165 charcoal fragments were observed under reflected light microscopy (Motic PANTHERA) with dark and bright fields and ×50, ×100, ×200 and ×500 magnifications. Images were taken with an environmental scanning electron microscope (FEI Quanta 600) coating charcoal with gold. Each charcoal piece was manually fragmented into the three wood anatomy sections (transverse, tangential and radial). Observing the three anatomy sections allowed us to identify taxonomic characters. Different wood anatomy atlases and a comparative collection at the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution were used to support the identifications57,58. The assemblage is characterized by a number of indeterminable fragments related to wood anatomy alterations (cracks and vitrification) and/or size of the fragments.

To study the pyroarchaeological record of the Mesolithic Horizon at Latnija, we combined the study of phytoliths and the mineralogical composition of sediments by FTIR. We analysed 24 samples that were collected during the 2022 fieldwork from a large combustion structure identified in square N2 at the base of Phase V (Fig. 2). Sampling was performed on the basis of visual identification of the internal structure of the hearth, distinguishing between samples coming from the possible combustion residue (n = 10), samples coming from the thermal impact zone (n = 8) and control samples from below the hearth (n = 6).

Phytoliths were extracted following the fast extraction method59. Phytolith quantification and identification was done using a Zeiss Axioscope transmitted light microscope at ×200 and ×400 magnifications. Phytolith morphological identification followed the standard literature and modern plant reference collections33,60,61,62. We followed the terminology of the International Code for Phytolith Nomenclature (ICPN 2.0) for phytolith descriptions63.

The mineral composition of the samples was identified using a Jasco FT/IR-6700 spectrometer. Infrared spectra were collected in the 4,000–400 cm−1 wavelength range at a resolution of 4 cm−1 using the conventional KBr pellets method. The spectra were interpreted using the position of the main peaks described on reference collections64. Thermally altered clay was identified on the basis of specific absorption peaks in the clay spectrum65, and the presence of anthropogenic or geogenic calcite was determined following previous studies66,67.

The archaeobotanical samples from Latnija's Mesolithic Horizon were recovered from the 2021 and 2022 excavation seasons. Although we engaged in a 100% sediment collection strategy, after flotation, not all samples from these phases contained plant macrofossils. The assemblage suitable for study consists of 28 samples in total—19 from the 2021 field season and 9 from the 2022 season. Each sample was processed in the field using a basic bucket flotation method, as described previously68,69. The samples were then sent to the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Jena, Germany, for analysis. Once in the laboratory, samples were passed through nested U.S. Geological sieves to ease sorting. Material smaller than 0.50 mm was not sorted. Carbonized wood fragments larger than 2 mm were counted, although wood identification was done as a separate analysis and is reported above. Seeds and seed fragments were separated from all sieved contexts, and charred seeds were systematically collected. The identified taxa are presented in Supplementary Table 1.

Except for the bone samples, radiocarbon dating was performed at the Curt-Engelhorn-Centre Archaeometry (CEZA) in Mannheim, Germany. Samples included charcoal, seeds and marine shells. Bone samples were analysed at the University of Georgia Centre for Applied Isotope Studies (CAIS). We used a multistep chronological study to clearly constrain the Mesolithic Horizon at Latnija. First, we constructed a chronological framework for the site, which involved 31 charcoal samples and the one bone (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Charcoal samples were selected from contexts directly underlying the Mesolithic Horizon to help constrain the onset of Mesolithic occupation, excluding samples from burrows that appear at the interface of major divides in sediment depositional processes (Phases VI–V) (see Extended Data Fig. 5 for illustrated sample locations). In addition, charcoal samples were selected from contexts throughout the Mesolithic Horizon (Phases V–III), including direct sampling from hearths that appear at the base of Phase V (Fig. 2, Supplementary Information 2 and Extended Data Fig. 6). The model was divided into the major phases recorded during the excavation (Supplementary Information 2).

To obtain independent verification of the integrity of the age model, we also targeted marine gastropods (P. turbinatus in particular) because they formed clear in situ tip lines identified in Phase III. Forty-nine samples of P. turbinatus were dated for this purpose. The number of samples was chosen to reflect the fact that: (i) marine calibration is more complex than terrestrial calibration, thus a larger sample size was required to account for the natural spread in the data; and (ii) these shells are a direct measure of human presence, because they have been imported to the site by people.

Charcoal samples were prepared using a standard ABA pretreatment. This covers an acid step with diluted hydrochloric acid to remove calcite and lime attached to the sample. A base step with diluted sodium hydroxite follows to remove soluble humic acids. As the base attracts fresh CO2, another acid step finalizes the pretreatment and removes any modern contamination. The samples are then combusted in an elemental analyser (MicroCube, Elementar) and the CO2 is collected and graphitized to elemental carbon. The carbon is pressed into a target and measured in a MICADAS mass spectrometer70.

The shell samples only undergo a treatment with diluted acid to remove adjacent carbon contamination from limestone or calcite. For shell samples, the CO2 is extracted using phosphoric acid in an autosampler before graphitization, and measurements are the same as for the charcoal samples described in a previous study71.

The bone sample was cleaned by wire brush and washed using an ultrasonic bath. After cleaning, the sample was then reacted under vacuum with 1 M HCl to dissolve the bone mineral and release CO2 from bioapatite. The residue was filtered, rinsed with deionized water and, under slightly acid conditions (pH 3), heated at 80 °C for six hours to dissolve collagen and leave humic substances in the precipitate. The collagen solution was then filtered to isolate pure collagen and dried out. The dried collagen was combusted at 575 °C in evacuated and sealed Pyrex ampoules in the present CuO. The resulting CO2 was cryogenically purified from the other reaction products and catalytically converted to graphite. Graphite 14C/13C ratios were measured using the CAIS 0.5 MeV accelerator mass spectrometer. The sample ratios were compared with the ratio measured from the Oxalic Acid I (NBS SRM 4990). The uncalibrated dates were then given in radiocarbon years before 1950 (years bp), using the 14C half-life of 5,568 years. The error is quoted as one standard deviation and reflects both statistical and experimental errors. The date has been corrected for isotope fractionation. As with other terrestrial radiocarbon dates in this study, calibration was performed with OxCal 4.4 using IntCal20 and as part of a phase model for the site. Modelled and unmodelled calibrated dates and model diagnostics are presented in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3.

To correct for the MRE, we compared the ages of P. turbinatus shells with the ages of charcoal from the same stratigraphic contexts. The reservoir effect ΔR was modelled in OxCal 4.4. with the latest datasets of IntCal20 for the charcoal samples and Marine20 for the shells. It was modelled using a phase model and choosing a wide restriction for ΔR. Samples marked by OxCal as outliers are presented in the table but are not included in the next modelling step if the model cannot deal with them leading to an A of less than 60%. These outliers might reflect processes such as bioturbation. The results of the MRE calculations are shown in Supplementary Table 4, and the corrected dates for each P. turbinatus age are shown in Supplementary Table 5 (see also Supplementary Information 4).

Models involving radiocarbon dates were used to address the key question of whether there is evidence of occupation in the Latnija cave excavation sequence that securely relates to human activity predating the available evidence for Neolithic habitation elsewhere on Malta and in the surrounding Mediterranean archaeological record. This was done by: (1) establishing the age of the Mesolithic deposits at Latnija; (2) determining when the wider regional Mesolithic-to-Neolithic transition is most likely to have occurred; and (3) determining whether there is evidence for an early Neolithic occupation of Malta in in a sediment core extracted from Salina Bay in northeast Malta, while accounting for the high-energy depositional environment and chronological uncertainty associated with radiocarbon dates used to produce associated age–depth models. Each of the analyses was conducted in R and is fully replicable, with scripts, data and outputs contained in a GitHub repository along with further replication instructions (https://github.com/wccarleton/mesoneomalta).

First, we used a standard archaeological phase model to determine start and end boundaries for major depositional phases identified at Latnija. For this model, the excavation team constructed a general Harris matrix relating different contexts to major phases of sediment deposition and artefact accumulation. Thirty-three radiocarbon samples—charcoal from short-lived local shrubs and one bone—recovered from these units were then dated and the dates were placed into an OxCal phase model to estimate phase boundary distributions. All phase boundaries were of the ‘sigma' type. This boundary allows the tails of the distribution of events (dates) making up abutting phases to overlap. The flexibility reflects the sedimentary fuzziness inherent in the physical boundaries between depositional units. Following previously published guidance72, we included a general outlier model along with the phases, allowing for the model to identify potential outliers (events with extreme dates relative to both their phases and the structure of the model as a whole). The modelling identified no significant outliers among the radiocarbon-dated samples given the boundaries we used, as indicated by the posterior probabilities associated with the outlier model that indicate the probability that a given sample is an outlier in the model context (all were 8% or less; most were 4%; Supplementary Table 6).

Next, we used a cleaned regional database of radiocarbon dates associated with securely identified Mesolithic and Neolithic sites or site components from Italy, Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia and Malta. We divided the dates by region and cultural association. Then, we used a simple OxCal phase model to estimate when the Mesolithic phase ended and the Neolithic phase began in each of the regions (details in Supplementary Information 4). We used a single phase for the Mesolithic and one for the Neolithic within each region bookended by flexible ‘sigma' boundaries, meaning that events at the end of the Mesolithic phase could occur after the estimated start-date boundary for the Neolithic. This flexibility reflects the fact that both phases refer to cultural traditions or packages that are known to have overlapped in space and time throughout the Mediterranean and that have well-established spatio-temporal trends.

Finally, we re-examined the published age–depth model for the Salina Deep sediment core. The core was argued to contain evidence for an early Neolithic in Malta, because it contains findings such as the pollen of domesticated cereals, which was estimated to date to around 8 ka on the basis of an age–depth model. However, the age–depth model used (Bchron), like many sophisticated sedimentation models, assumes monotonicity in the age–depth relationship, which we argue does not apply in the Salina Deep case. Although monotonicity is typically a good working assumption in low-energy depositional environments without evidence of disturbance, Salina Bay in the past and present is a high-energy littoral and fluvial environment that is subject to frequent storms. The core itself contains evidence of marine ingression and many of the radiocarbon dates indicate substantial sediment redeposition, with very old dates near the surface and segments showing a wide radiocarbon temporal spread. Together, this evidence suggests that monotonicity is a poor assumption for Salina Deep and, consequently, that the published age–depth model is overly (unduly) precise because it cannot account for the wide variance in radiocarbon sample dates for many of the core's segments. To account for this, and produce a model that is more representative of the empirical temporal variance, we used a linear Bayesian regression to model the age–depth relationship. The model recognizes a general relationship in the available age–depth observations indicating a trend toward older dates correlated with depth. However, it also does not assume strict monotonicity, instead focusing on the broad age–depth relationship. We used a custom distribution (based on standard radiocarbon-date calibration) to add a measurement uncertainty component to the model, representing radiocarbon dating and calibration uncertainties. We also used Bayesian imputation to model dates with full posterior uncertainty for a sequence of undated sediment depths (see Supplementary Information 1 for further details).

During the 2021 and 2022 field seasons, faunal remains greater than 20 mm in length were piece plotted using a total station, given a unique identifier and bagged. Smaller bone fragments, shells and other faunal remains were recovered through various methods, including an exhaustive programme of wet sieving, flotation and manual inspection of 8-mm, 4-mm, 2-mm, 1-mm and 0.5-mm sieved sinks under microscopy. Here we present a preliminary taxonomic and taphonomic analysis of this faunal material, but note that a full detailed analysis is currently underway that comprises all remains recovered during excavation.

Bones were identified to skeletal element and, for the most part, to broad taxonomic categories (for example, fish and birds), facilitated by relevant literature73,74,75,76, online resources and comparative material housed at the University of Malta. The taphonomic analysis focused on identifying bone fractures and surface modifications, such as burning, butchery marks (such as cut marks) and carnivore damage (for example, gnawing) following standard protocols77,78,79,80. Remains are reported as the number of specimens (NRSP) and number of identified specimens (NISP), following a previous report81. NRSP includes all skeletal remains (bones and teeth) included in this study, whereas NISP is defined as all skeletal elements (bones and teeth) identified minimally to class.

In addition to the piece-plotted bone, we also report here the complete counts of marine fauna for two excavation squares (L2 and N2), reflecting material that was directly recovered and bagged during excavation and material from wet sieving and flotation. Given the very different sediment volumes exposed for the different phases, we chose here to focus at first on these two squares, which offer a good sequence through the phases, to showcase the marine component at the site.

Nineteen samples, comprising 12 wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) and 7 red deer (Cervus elaphus), were selected for δ13C and δ18O isotope analysis of tooth enamel (Supplementary Table 7). For red deer, molar teeth were targeted for analysis, although the sample set does include one red deer premolar tooth. It should also be noted that because some of these samples are non-overlapping teeth, it is possible that some pseudo-sampling (sampling from the same individual) took place. For wood mouse, whole molar and incisor teeth were used to ensure that the minimum sample size for stable isotope analysis was met.

Before sampling, red deer were cleaned through gentle abrasion with a diamond-tipped drill to remove any adhering material. After cleaning, the same approach was used to sample the tooth enamel along the full length of the buccal surface to ensure a representative measurement for the period of tooth formation. For wood mouse, as much of the dentine was removed as possible using a drill before the remaining whole teeth were crushed using a mortar and pestle, with cleaning of the mortar and pestle using 70% ethanol between samples.

To remove organic or secondary carbonate contaminates, all samples underwent pretreatment, which involved soaking in 0.1 M acetic acid for 10 min followed by three rinses in purified water82,83. After reaction with 100% phosphoric acid, gasses were analysed using a Thermo GasBench II connected to a Thermo Delta V Advantage mass spectrometer housed at the Department of Archaeology at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology. Carbon and oxygen isotopes are reported as the ratio of heavier to lighter isotopes (13C/12C or 18O/16O) in parts per million (‰) relative to international standards (Vienna Peedee Belemnite, VPDB). δ13C and δ18O values were normalized using a three-point calibration against the international standards IAEA-603 (δ13C = 2.5‰, δ18O = −2.4‰), IAEA-CO-8 (δ13C = −5.8‰, δ18O = −22.7‰) and IAEA NBS 18 (δ13C = −5.014‰, δ18O = 23.2‰), as well as the in-house standard of USGS44 (δ13C = −42.2‰).

OxCal phase modelling of the estimated start and end dates for the Mesolithic and Neolithic phases in and around Malta125 using the IntCal20 terrestrial calibration curve55. Results indicate a general geographical cline in the spread of the Neolithic in mainland Italy from north to south, to Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica, and then finally to Malta. See the OxCal script in https://github.com/wccarleton/mesoneomalta for specifics.

a, Plotted radiocarbon dates available for the sequence from the Salina Deep record in Malta, along with the pollen sequence reported by Farrell and colleagues48, using the Bchron R package52, one of the methods used by Hunt and colleagues47. Results show many potentially intrusive samples used to date the sediments and very few sequences of dates in strict stratigraphic order. b, Our Bayesian regression model to relate depth to age in the Salina Deep core using the IntCal20 calibration curve55 to calibrate the dates. The results suggest that the first Neolithic evidence in the Salina Deep record has a date with a broad error range of around two thousand years. Depth shown = cm.

See Extended Data Fig. 6 and sediment section (Supplementary Information 2) for the location of thin-section samples. a, MM2 is taken from the unaltered sediments at the base of the sequence. This sample presents the key characteristics of patterns of sedimentation prior to the Mesolithic occupation. These can be summarized as consisting of: 1) rare limestones clasts (frequently showing evidence for in situ decay), 2) intraclasts of reworked sediment and 3) fragments of terrestrial mollusc shell. Limited materials that are indicative of burning or burning products are present. b, MM3 is taken from the ash-rich sediments of the sequence, a factor that can be seen in the colour difference between the brown matrix of MM2 and the grey matrix of MM3. MM3 is rich in >1 mm sized charcoal fragments and limestone clasts, some of which show evidence for a strong degree of burning. c, MM5 is taken from the contact between the ash-rich sediment (MM3) and the underlying cave floor sediment (MM2). The sediment of MM5 is, consequently, characterized by a mixture of both sediment types. Charcoal fragments are abundant (but only rarely >1 mm) but the matrix overall is more typical of MM2. Bones fragments are present as are circular features that are characteristics of deformation which could be either biological or physical in origin. The sediments have formed in association with cutting into pre-existing sediments prior to the deposition of the ash-rich sediments. d, MM6 is taken from below darkened sediment believed to be in situ burning. The sediments of MM6 are more reddened than any other sampled sediments and occur directly below sediments the colour of which are more typical of the unaltered cave sediments of MM2. This unit is interpreted as being thermally altered as a direct result of in situ burning directly above these deposits.

Metrics details

Somatosensory pathways convey crucial information about pain, touch, itch and body part movement from peripheral organs to the central nervous system1,2. Despite substantial needs to understand how these pathways assemble and to develop pain therapeutics, clinical translation remains challenging. This is probably related to species-specific features and the lack of in vitro models of the polysynaptic pathway. Here we established a human ascending somatosensory assembloid (hASA), a four-part assembloid generated from human pluripotent stem cells that integrates somatosensory, spinal, thalamic and cortical organoids to model the spinothalamic pathway. Transcriptomic profiling confirmed the presence of key cell types of this circuit. Rabies tracing and calcium imaging showed that sensory neurons connect to dorsal spinal cord neurons, which further connect to thalamic neurons. Following noxious chemical stimulation, calcium imaging of hASA demonstrated a coordinated response. In addition, extracellular recordings and imaging revealed synchronized activity across the assembloid. Notably, loss of the sodium channel NaV1.7, which causes pain insensitivity, disrupted synchrony across hASA. By contrast, a gain-of-function SCN9A variant associated with extreme pain disorder induced hypersynchrony. These experiments demonstrated the ability to functionally assemble the essential components of the human sensory pathway, which could accelerate our understanding of sensory circuits and facilitate therapeutic development.

The ascending somatosensory pathways are responsible for conveying environmental and bodily sensory information from the peripheral organs to the central nervous system. Somatosensory neurons, whose cell bodies are located in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia (TG), are pseudo-unipolar cells that innervate peripheral organs, including the skin, to detect somatosensory signals and transmit them to the spinal cord and hindbrain. Neurons in the dorsal spinal cord or hindbrain monosynaptically transmit this information to various brain structures, including the thalamus, that further relay these signals to the cerebral cortex1,2. Genetic or environmental disruptions to these pathways can lead or contribute to various neurological disorders, including chronic pain and autism spectrum disorder, and cause both heightened and diminished sensory functions3,4,5,6. Despite the clinical significance, how ascending sensory pathways form during human development and how functional defects arise in pathological conditions during development are still poorly understood. Challenges in bench to bedside translation of pain and sensory research are thought to be related, at least in part, to differences across species. Crucially, the discovery of new treatments and their translation is hindered by the lack of reliable human experimental models that reconstitute the ascending sensory pathway7. In fact, concomitant probing of all components of these circuits through imaging or recording has not yet been achieved in animal models, which limits our understanding of the consequences of various sensory manipulations at the circuit level.

Recent advances in organoid and assembloid technologies hold promise for generating self-organizing stem-cell-based models to study and manipulate human neural circuits ex vivo in the context of development and disease states. We previously developed three-part assembloids to recapitulate the descending cortico-spino-muscle pathway connecting deep layer cortical glutamatergic neurons to cholinergic spinal cord motor neurons to muscle8. The generation of functional circuits in assembloids with more than three components, which would enable the assembly of the ascending sensory pathway from sensory neurons to the cerebral cortex, has not yet been achieved.

Here we focus on the spinothalamic and trigeminothalamic pathways, which are particularly prominent in humans9 and are crucial for conveying pain and other somatosensory information through the spinal cord and thalamus1. In this circuit, sensory neurons in the DRG or TG connect with neurons in the dorsal spinal cord or hindbrain. These neurons relay information to the thalamus through monosynaptic connections and subsequently to the somatosensory cortex and other cortical areas (Fig. 1a). To reconstitute these pathways from their components, we separately generated somatosensory organoids, dorsal spinal cord organoids, diencephalic (thalamic) organoids and cerebral cortical organoids from pluripotent stem cells and then functionally assembled them to create four-part human ascending somatosensory assembloids (hASAs). We demonstrated that chemical stimulation or glutamate uncaging of sensory neurons elicited responses within hASA. Calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings of the assembloid revealed synchronized activity across the ascending pathway. Finally, we applied this platform to study circuit-level consequences of loss- and gain-of-function pathogenic variants in the NaV1.7 sodium channel encoded by the SCN9A gene, which have been associated with congenital insensitivity to pain and extreme pain disorder, respectively. We discovered that the loss of NaV1.7 disrupted synchronized activity across the four-part hASA, whereas the gain-of-function mutation resulted in hypersynchrony throughout the sensory pathway in hASA.

Source data

To derive the key parts of the ascending sensory pathway in vitro, we generated regionalized neural organoids from human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells using guided differentiation with small molecules and growth factors (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1). We first generated human cortical organoids (hCO) and human diencephalic organoids (hDiO) using previously described and validated methods10,11. To generate human dorsal spinal cord (and hindbrain) organoids (hdSpO), where the soma of spinothalamic (or trigeminothalamic) projection neurons resides, we modified a protocol we have previously reported for deriving the ventral part of cervical spinal cord organoids8 by excluding ventralizing cues (Extended Data Fig. 1). Finally, to derive human somatosensory (also referred to as sensory) organoids (hSeO), which contain somatosensory neurons of the DRG or TG, we developed a protocol that leveraged cues identified in two-dimensional-based methods12 (Extended Data Fig. 1). To verify that we have all key cellular components in the ascending sensory pathway, we combined the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of hCO and hDiO that we generated in previous studies11,13 with our newly obtained transcriptional datasets of hdSpO and hSeO (Fig. 1c–e). We found distinct clusters for key cell types in the ascending circuit: cortical glutamatergic neurons (FOXG1+ (ref. 14) and SLC17A7+), thalamic excitatory neurons (TCF7L2+ (ref. 15) and SLC17A6+), dorsal spinal cord and hindbrain projection neurons (HOXB4+ (ref. 16) and PHOX2A+ (ref. 17)) and primary afferent somatosensory neurons (POU4F1+ (ref. 18) and PPP1R1C+ (ref. 19)) (Fig. 1f). We used immunostaining to confirm the protein expression of key region-specific markers in the regionalized organoids (Fig. 1g). To further investigate cell identity in regionalized neural organoids, we performed label transfer analysis20 from a human primary tissue atlas of the whole brain (PCW7–14)21. Given the paucity of publicly available scRNA-seq datasets of developing human DRG22, we procured human primary tissue (at PCW15) and freshly dissected DRG and performed scRNA-seq (Fig. 1h,i and Extended Data Fig. 2a–d). Overall, we found that cells derived from each regionalized organoid resembled the transcriptomic profiles of their corresponding in vivo counterparts (Fig. 1j and Extended Data Fig. 2e).

To further characterize the cellular identity within hSeO, we inspected the pattern of expression of several canonical markers using scRNA-seq data (Fig. 2a,b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). We found that approximately 30–40% of the neurons (STMN2+ (ref. 23)) expressed the peripheral neuron-specific markers POU4F1 and SIX1 (ref. 24) (Fig. 2c), which we independently confirmed in other batches of organoids by reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT–qPCR) (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Co-localization of VGLUT2 and NeuN in immunostaining experiments demonstrated the excitatory neuronal identity of hSeO neurons (Extended Data Fig. 3d). We found a substantial proportion of cells expressing neural crest cell markers, such as SOX10 and FOXD3, which is consistent with the neural crest origin of peripheral sensory neurons25 (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 3b,e). We also examined the expression levels of several key sensory receptors26,27,28 (P2RX3, TRPV1, TRPM8, TRPA1, PIEZO1 and PIEZO2) (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3f). To further characterize the cellular composition of hSeO, we compared the single-cell transcriptome of hSeO with the scRNA-seq data of the human DRG. Integrated uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and cell composition proportions revealed similar cellular compositions, except for endothelial cells, macrophages and blood cells, which were absent in hSeO (Extended Data Fig. 3g–k).

A unique feature of the sensory neurons is their ability to respond to environmental stimuli. To verify whether neurons in hSeO respond to sensory stimuli, we established a live imaging system of intact three-dimensional (3D) organoids expressing a genetically encoded calcium indicator using a chamber equipped to inject chemicals. Consistent with the high abundance of mRNA encoding calcium-permeable P2X purinoceptor 3 (P2RX3) and capsaicin receptor TRPV1 (Fig. 2d), bath application of their agonists, α,β-methyleneATP (αβ-MeATP)26 and capsaicin29, respectively, induced calcium transients (Fig. 2e–h). Interestingly, the dynamics of the responses were similar between hSeO and intact ex vivo primary mouse DRG (Extended Data Fig. 4a–d); αβ-MeATP induced a fast calcium spike, whereas capsaicin induced a slow and prolonged calcium transient, which is consistent with previous pharmacological studies using DRG neurons isolated from rat30,31 or mouse32,33, as well as induced nociceptors in two-dimensional culture34.

There are species-specific differences in the expression and function of some receptors on sensory DRG neurons, which may be responsible for sensory processing differences and challenges in translation from animal models to humans7. For instance, 2′,3′-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) adenosine 5′-triphosphate (TNP–ATP) is a potent antagonist of the rodent P2X3 receptor35; however, primate-specific amino acid substitutions in the P2X3 receptor are thought to modify sensitivity to TNP–ATP in the macaque DRG36. Consistent with previous reports36, we found that TNP–ATP successfully blocked calcium responses in ex vivo mouse DRG in a dose-dependent manner. However, when applied to human sensory neurons in hSeO, TNP–ATP had no significant effect (Fig. 2i–m), which suggests differences in responsiveness across species. These results are consistent with a previous report showing the importance of primate-specific amino acid changes at two residues of the P2X3 receptor (A197 and T202), which influence the TNP–ATP antagonism36.

We further investigated the cellular identity of neurons in hdSpO using scRNA-seq data (Fig. 2n,o and Extended Data Fig. 5a). Similar to the ventral part of the spinal cord organoids8, hdSpO displayed high neuronal diversity (Fig. 2o,p and Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). Relevant to the ascending somatosensory pathway, we found clusters expressing the projection neuronal markers PHOX2A17, LBX1 (ref. 17) and TACR1 (encoding NK1R)37 (Fig. 2p and Extended Data Fig. 5b). We also confirmed the expression of TACR1 and LBX1 by RT–qPCR in hdSpO (Extended Data Fig. 5d). We next annotated the dorsoventral neuronal clusters in hdSpO using combinatorial marker expression, as described previously38,39 (Extended Data Fig. 5e). We found overlap of PHOX2A+ neurons with dI5 cluster, which is consistent with previous reports17,40 (Fig. 2q). We also performed label transfer analysis of scRNA-seq data from the developing human spinal cord dI5 cells38 onto the hdSpO scRNA-seq dataset. We found that the SLC17A6+PHOX2A+TACR1+ neuron cluster demonstrated the highest prediction score values for the developing human dI5 cells, indicating that hdSpO contains a neuronal cluster resembling the transcriptomic identity of human dI5 cells (Fig. 2r). These cells also express another dI5 marker gene, LMX1B40, but not the dI4/6 marker gene PAX2 (ref. 41) (Extended Data Fig. 5b,e). Immunostaining for PAX2 and PHOX2A indicated that the distinct types of spinal neurons in hdSpO were intermingled without a clear spatial organization (Extended Data Fig. 5f). Taken together, these transcriptomic and functional studies indicate that these regionalized organoids contain key cellular components of the developing human ascending sensory pathway.

We next examined the specificity of projections between pairs of regionalized organoids. First, we investigated whether the sensory neurons in hSeO could send projections to spinal neurons in hSeO–hdSpO assembloids. We virally labelled hSeO with hSYN1::EYFP and integrated them with hdSpO to form hSeO–hdSpO assembloids (Fig. 3a). We found that the area of EYFP fluorescence on the hdSpO side, corresponding to projections from hSeO neurons, increased progressively over 28 days after fusion (daf) (Fig. 3b,c). These EYFP+ sensory projections co-localized with the axonal marker NF-H (Extended Data Fig. 6a). We next used rabies virus-mediated retrograde tracing combined with Cre recombination in hSeO–hdSpO assembloids (Fig. 3d). On daf 21, we observed tdTomato+GFP+ cells on the hSeO side, indicating successful retrograde tracing of rabies–Cre–GFP resulting in the recombination and expression of DIO-tdTomato (Fig. 3e). These tdTomato+GFP+ cells were not detected in unassembled organoids, which were kept in the same cell culture well and media, confirming projection-dependent retrograde transmission (Extended Data Fig. 6b–d). To investigate the specificity of these projections, we co-immunostained for the sensory neuronal marker BRN3A and found that nearly 80% of tdTomato+ cells were also BRN3A+ (Fig. 3f,g). To further verify functional connectivity between hSeO and hdSpO, we combined optogenetic stimulation with whole-cell electrophysiological recordings. Upon 460-nm light stimulation of channelrhodopsin 2-expressing hSeO, we observed optically evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (oEPSCs), with a success rate of eight of 30 recorded cells (Fig. 3h,i and Extended Data Fig. 6e,f). Responsive neurons exhibited an average oEPSC amplitude of 52 pA and an onset delay of 32 ms (Extended Data Fig. 6f). These results demonstrate that hSeO sensory neurons can form functional connections with neurons in hdSpO. By contrast, when we generated assembloids by integrating hSeO with hCO, we observed only minimal projections from hSeO that did not increase over time (Extended Data Fig. 6g–i).

We took a similar approach to investigate spinothalamic projections in hdSpO–hDiO assembloids (Fig. 3j). We observed a significant increase in spinothalamic projections on daf 28 (Fig. 3k,l). Using rabies virus-mediated retrograde tracing (Fig. 3m,n), we found that approximately 40% of tdTomato+ cells co-expressed the spinal cord projection neuronal marker NK1R+ (Fig. 3p). We also observed co-localization of tdTomato and PHOX2A (Extended Data Fig. 6l). In addition, we examined whether hdSpO neurons preferentially project to hDiO compared to hSeO by using three-part hSeO–hdSpO–hDiO assembloids. Quantification of EYFP+ spinal projections within the same assembloid, in both the hDiO and hSeO regions, revealed more projections in hDiO, indicating a preferential for hdSpO targeting the hDiO (Extended Data Fig. 6k–m). These studies, in combination with our previous experiments on thalamocortical projections in hCO–hDiO assembloids11, confirmed that the three pairs of assembloids (hCO–hDiO, hDiO–hdSpO and hdSpO–hSeO) built from the four regionalized neural organoids intrinsically recapitulate some of the basic inter-regional projections.

We next investigated the functionality of these connections in three-part hSeO–hdSpO–hDiO assembloids by combining rabies virus-mediated retrograde tracing, recombinase Flpo-dependent expression of GCaMP6f and live calcium imaging following αβ-MeATP treatment (Fig. 3q). We assembled AAV-EF1α::fDIO-GCaMP6f-infected hdSpO with hSeO to generate hSeO–hdSpO. On daf 43, we infected hDiO with rabies–Flpo–dsRedExpress and AAV-G and fused these onto the hdSpO side of the hSeO–hdSpO assembloid. On daf 70, we detected expression of fDIO-GCaMP6f, which is suggestive of transmission of rabies–Flpo–dsRedExpress from hDiO into hdSpO (Fig. 3r). These GCaMP6f+ neurons demonstrated increased calcium activity after αβ-MeATP exposure, thereby indicating signal transmission from sensory neurons to spinal neurons (Fig. 3s,t). These calcium transients were blocked by the glutamate receptor antagonists 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo[f]quinoxaline (NBQX) and 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) (Fig. 3s,t). These results imply that chemical stimulation of sensory neurons in hSeO elicited calcium activity that was transmitted to and induced calcium increase in connected rabies–Flpo-labelled spinothalamic projection neurons in hdSpO. Moreover, hdSpO neurons projected axons into hDiO, as evidenced by rabies tracing.

Next, we generated hASA by linearly placing the four key neural regionalized organoids in a tilted cell culture plate (Fig. 4a,b). We measured success assembly rate and evaluated the shapes of assembloids. All samples were successfully assembled, with 87.7% forming linear or curved shapes, which are suitable for functional assays (Extended Data Fig. 7a). We performed viral labelling of each organoid with distinct hSYN1 promoter-driven fluorescent proteins before fusion and confirmed maintenance of distinct domains of these assembloids (Fig. 4c). To verify cellular composition after assembly, we performed scRNA-seq from hASAs and stage- and cell line-matched individual organoids on days 162–229 and found that the composition was comparable between individual organoids and four-part assembloids (Extended Data Fig. 7e,f).

We examined functional connectivity within hASA. In one continuous imaging session, we serially treated hASA with either vehicle or αβ-MeATP while recording jGCaMP8s signal at single-cell resolution (Fig. 4d). We calculated the adjusted ΔF/Fbase by subtracting the response to vehicle from the response to αβ-MeATP. We found that αβ-MeATP exposure significantly elevated the calcium levels in hASA neurons in all four regions on daf 74–78 (Fig. 4e,f and Supplementary Video 1). By contrast, in non-assembled organoids, only neurons in hSeO had a significant increase in calcium after the application of αβ-MeATP, whereas neurons in other organoids did not (Fig. 4e,f). To further verify whether specific stimulation of sensory neurons in hSeO elicited responses in other regions of the assembloid, we used 405-nm photostimulation in the presence of 4-methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl (MNI) caged glutamate to trigger rapid and localized release of glutamate in a specific area (Fig. 4g). We performed photostimulation of hSeO within hASA and detected a robust increase in calcium levels, not only in hSeO but also in all other regions, on daf 74–99 (Fig. 4h,i). These experiments suggest transmission of somatosensory signals within the assembloid from sensory neurons through spinal and thalamic neurons to cortical neurons.

We next explored whether the four-part assembly is associated with emergent network properties. We recorded baseline calcium activity at single-cell resolution and compared hASA with four non-assembled organoids placed in close proximity just before imaging (Fig. 4j–l). Notably, we found that neurons in assembloids exhibited synchronous activity across all four regions (Fig. 4l and Supplementary Video 2). We applied scaled correlation analysis (SCA) to minimize the effects of low-frequency noise signals42, which was established in our recent study to quantify synchronous activity across neural circuits43. Representative SCA correlograms from all possible pairs between hSeO and hCO neurons in an assembloid showed that the correlation peaks were distributed around 0 s, whereas representative SCA correlograms from unfused organoids had equal distribution of correlation peaks (Fig. 4k,l). The peak correlation for all combinations of the four regions was significantly higher in assembloids than that in individual non-assembled neural organoids (Fig. 4m).

We further investigated activity patterns through concomitant extracellular recordings with 32 electrodes in each of the four hASA parts (Fig. 4n). We found spontaneous and synchronous activity across the entire assembloid (Fig. 4o). We calculated the co-activation indexes based on cross-correlograms44 (Fig. 4p). When we compared the co-activation index aligned with the activity of hSeO, we found significantly higher values than alignment to random time points (Fig. 4q). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the assembly of intact 3D human regionalized neural organoids resembling the human sensory ganglia, dorsal spinal cord, thalamus and cerebral cortex enables the formation of connections capable of synchronized activity across the pathway and in response to somatosensory like (chemical sensory) stimuli.

Finally, we studied whether hASA could be used to identify functional defects in models of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Pathogenic variants in the gene SCN9A, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7, cause pain insensitivity if the variant leads to loss of channel function, or hyperalgesia if the variant causes gain of function6 (Fig. 5a,i). Although defects in channel conductance and excitability of sensory neurons have been proposed as disease mechanisms in cellular and animal models6,45,46,47, the circuit-level consequences have not yet been explored in a human model.

We first verified the expression of SCN9A and found high levels in hSeO (Fig. 5b). We then applied CRISPR-mediated gene editing to induce one or more frameshift variants in the SCN9A gene (Fig. 5c). We confirmed that hSeO derived from pooled SCN9A knockout (KO) iPS cell lines exhibited decreased SCN9A mRNA and NaV1.7 protein levels (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 8a). The expression of the sensory neuron marker POU4F1 (BRN3A) was not affected by SCN9A KO (Extended Data Fig. 8b–d). Consistent with previous reports of hypo-excitability of sensory neurons in the absence of this key sodium channel45, we found that SCN9A KO hSeO displayed reduced frequency of spontaneous calcium activity (Extended Data Fig. 8e,f). We then generated hASA from isogenic control and SCN9A KO hiPS cells to explore the circuit-level consequences. We recorded spontaneous activity patterns using jGCaMP8s in all regions from control and SCN9A KO hASA (Fig. 5e). We discovered that the synchronous pattern of activity across hASA was reduced in SCN9A KO, although non-synchronized events were found in all regions (Fig. 5f,g and Supplementary Videos 3 and 4). We then performed SCA analysis and found a significant reduction in correlation, indicating that SCN9A KO impaired the emergent synchronization across the assembloid (Fig. 5h and Extended Data Fig. 8g).

In addition, we investigated the circuit-level consequences of the T1464I SCN9A gain-of-function variant, which is associated with paroxysmal extreme pain disorder47 (Fig. 5i). We applied CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing to introduce the heterozygous SCN9A T1464I into a hiPS cell line (Fig. 5j). We confirmed mixed gDNA of control and T1464I SCN9A by Sanger sequencing (Fig. 5k). We then generated hSeO from control and SCN9A T1464I hiPS cells and confirmed that POU4F1 expression level was not altered by genetic engineering (Extended Data Fig. 8h). Calcium activity imaging of control and SCN9A T1464I hSeO demonstrated that the gain-of-function mutation produced hyperexcitability of sensory neurons, which is consistent with previous reports6,47 (Extended Data Fig. 8i,j). To investigate the effects of SCN9A T1464I variant on the emergent synchronized activity of the sensory ascending pathway, we derived hASA from control and SCN9A T1464I hiPS cell lines and imaged spontaneous calcium activity (Fig. 5l). Interestingly, SCA analysis revealed higher peak correlation values across the pairs in hASA, suggesting that SCN9A T1464I resulted in hypersynchrony (Fig. 5m–o and Extended Data Fig. 8k). These results highlight the capability of hASA to capture circuit-level dysfunction associated with the pathogenetic variants of SCN9A and thus its utility to model aberrations in emergent properties within human sensory circuits.

Reconstructing the ascending sensory pathway and circuits ex vivo holds significant promise for understanding the mechanisms involved in human sensory system development and thereby unravelling the pathophysiology of sensory-related disorders. We previously demonstrated the potential of assembloids composed of regionalized neural organoids derived from hiPS cells to model circuits in vitro8,48,49. Despite previous efforts to derive neural organoids containing sensory neurons22,50,51, a multiregional assembloid model recapitulating the human somatosensory ascending pathway has not yet been achieved. Here we leveraged this assembloid approach to generate a four-component ascending sensory circuit going from peripheral sensory neurons to cortical neurons. This hASA is an in vitro model encompassing the major components of the human sensory ascending pathway, and includes peripheral sensory neurons, dorsal spinal cord (and hindbrain) projection neurons, thalamic neurons and glutamatergic cortical neurons. This allowed us to visualize transmission of chemically triggered calcium signals through the network following sensory stimulus application and to capture emergent properties of the sensory pathway that cannot be seen in individual organoids, such as synchronous activity across the four parts of the assembloid. We also discovered that SCN9A loss resulted in reduced synchronous activity, whereas gain-of-function SCN9A variant induced increased synchrony across the pathway. Therefore, hASA holds great promise for addressing disease pathophysiology and testing therapeutic approaches. A recent study identified that spontaneous synchronized activity has a crucial role for fine-scaling circuit assembly in neonatal mice, highlighting the importance of synchronized activity during circuit development52. Notably, hASA can also capture human-specific aspects of the sensory system, such as reduced responsiveness to TNP–ATP. Going forward, this multicellular platform can be applied to model a wide range of disorders, including sensory dysfunction in neurodevelopmental disorders or hyperalgesia, and could be helpful for drug screening.

Improvements at several levels would enhance the utility of hASA. First, hiPS cell-derived sensory neurons are still limited in receptor expression and thus in the repertoire of responses to sensory stimulation, which is partially attributable to their developmental stage53. Future studies could improve the specification and maturation of sensory neurons, include other neurons in this pathway and functionally advance this model to study postnatal stages. Future efforts to develop comprehensive transcriptomic atlases of TG and DRG in the developing human will help with further elucidating the molecular identity of sensory neurons. Second, there are several neural pathways involved in sensory perception in addition to the anterolateral spinothalamic tract, which our current hASA models. We envision that these other pathways can be built in parallel with hASA or within the same system. Further studies should be conducted to investigate in detail the specificity of connectivity in these assembloids, including within individual organoids, and the role of activity-dependent processes in establishing and refining these neural networks. These efforts could ultimately be used to dissect the intrinsic rules for establishing connectivity in early human circuits, as well as suggest strategies for accelerating maturation in these in vitro models.

Overall, this new platform holds potential to yield insights into how the human sensory pathways assemble and therefore to develop and screen therapeutics for pain and other sensory system-related disorders.

The hiPS cell lines used in this study were validated using methods described in previous studies. Genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) genotyping was performed using the Illumina genome-wide GSAMD-24v2-0 SNP microarray at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Cultures were tested for and maintained Mycoplasma free. A total of five control hiPS cell lines derived from fibroblasts collected from five healthy participants were used for experiments13 (Supplementary Table 1). Two of the control hiPS cell lines were used to generate SCN9A KO hiPS cell lines, and one control hiPS cell line was used to generate the SCN9A gain-of-function hiPS cell line. Approval for experiments was obtained from the Institutional Review Board panel of Stanford University. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Human brain tissue samples were obtained under a protocol approved by the Research Compliance Office of Stanford University. PCW15 tissue was delivered on ice, and DRG were dissected immediately after arrival.

For neural differentiation, hiPS cells were cultured on vitronectin-coated plates (A14700; Life Technologies) in Essential 8 Medium (A1517001; Life Technologies). Cells were passaged every 4–5 days with UltraPure 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 (15575; Thermo Fisher Scientific). For the generation of regionalized neural organoids, hiPS cells were incubated with Accutase (AT104; Innovative Cell Technologies) at 37 °C for 7 min and dissociated into single cells. Optionally, 1–2 days before organoid formation, hiPS cells were exposed to 1% dimethylsulfoxide (472301; Sigma-Aldrich) in Essential 8 Medium. For aggregation into organoids, about 3 × 106 single hiPS cells were seeded per AggreWell 800 plate well in Essential 8 Medium supplemented with the Rho-associated coiled-coil containing kinases (ROCK) inhibitor Y27632 (10 µM; S1049; Selleckchem), centrifuged at 100g for 3 min and then incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. On the next day (day 1), organoids consisting of approximately 10,000 cells were collected and transferred into ultra-low attachment plastic dishes (3262; Corning) in Essential 6 Medium (A1516401; Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with patterning molecules, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1.

The hCO were generated as described previously10,55. For days 1–6, Essential 6 Medium was changed every day and supplemented with dorsomorphin (2.5 µM; P5499; Sigma-Aldrich) and SB-431542 (10 µM; 1614; R&D Systems), and was changed every day. On day 7, the organoids were transferred to neural medium containing Neurobasal-A Medium (10888022; Thermo Fisher Scientific), B-27 Supplement, minus vitamin A (12587010; Thermo Fisher Scientific), GlutaMAX Supplement (1:100; 35050079; Thermo Fisher Scientific), penicillin–streptomycin (1:100; 15070063; Thermo Fisher Scientific), supplemented with FGF2 (20 ng ml−1; 233-FB; R&D Systems) and EGF (20 ng ml−1; 236-EG; R&D Systems) until day 22. From days 23 to 46, the neural medium was supplemented with BDNF (20 ng ml−1; 450-02; PeproTech), NT3 (20 ng ml−1; 450-03; PeproTech), l-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate trisodium salt (200 µM; 323-44822; Wako), N6, 2′-O-dibutyryladenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate sodium salt (cAMP; 50 μM; D0627; MilliporeSigma) and cis-4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19-docosahexaenoic acid (10 μM; D2534; MilliporeSigma). From day 47, a neural medium containing Neurobasal-A Medium was used for changes in the medium (every 4 days).

The hDiO were generated as described previously11. For days 1–6, Essential 6 Medium was changed every day and supplemented with dorsomorphin and SB-431542. On day 5, the medium was additionally supplemented with 1 μM CHIR (S1263; Selleckchem). On day 7, organoids were maintained in a neural medium supplemented with CHIR. On day 9 of differentiation, the neural medium was supplemented with 100 nM SAG (days 9–15; 566660-1MG; MilliporeSigma), in addition to the CHIR. Furthermore, on days 12–18 of differentiation, organoids were supplemented with 30 ng ml−1 of BMP7 (120-03P; PeproTech), in addition to the compounds described above. From days 19 to 46, the neural medium was supplemented with BDNF, NT3, l-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate trisodium salt, cAMP and cis-4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19-docosahexaenoic acid. For days 19–25, DAPT (2.5 μM, 72082; STEMCELL Technologies) was added. From day 47, a neural medium containing Neurobasal-A Medium was used for changes in the medium (every 4 days).

To generate hdSpO, from days 1 to 6, organoids were maintained in Essential 6 Medium supplemented with SB-431542 and dorsomorphin. From days 5 to 6, CHIR (3 μM) was added. On day 7, organoids were transferred to a neural medium supplemented with EGF, retinoic acid (0.1 μM; R2625; Sigma-Aldrich) and CHIR (3 μM; S1263; Selleckchem). On day 22, the medium was supplemented with BDNF, cAMP, l-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate trisodium salt, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (10 ng ml−1; 100-11; PeproTech) until the end of experiments. From days 22 to 28, DAPT was added.

To generate hSeO, from days 1 to 6 in suspension, organoids were maintained in Essential 6 Medium supplemented with SB-431542. From days 1 to 4, BMP4 (5 ng ml; 120-05ET; PeproTech) was added. From days 3 to 5, CHIR (600 nM) was added. On day 6 in suspension, the organoids were transferred to a neural medium supplemented with SB-431542. From day 9, BDNF, GDNF (25 ng ml−1; 450-10; PeproTech) and NGF (25 ng ml−1; 450-01; PeproTech) were supplemented until the end of the experiment. From days 9 to 14, the medium was supplemented with SB-431542. From days 15 to 20, DAPT was included.

Organoids and assembloids were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4 °C. They were then washed in PBS and transferred to 30% sucrose/PBS for 2–3 days until the organoids/assembloids sank into the solution. Subsequently, they were rinsed in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Tissue-Tek OCT Compound 4583; Sakura Finetek) and 30% sucrose/PBS (1:1), embedded and snap-frozen using dry ice. For immunofluorescence staining, 30-µm-thick sections were cut using a Leica CM1860 cryostat. Cryosections were washed with PBS to remove excess OCT compound from the sections and blocked in 10% normal donkey serum (NDS, S30-100ML; MilliporeSigma), 0.3% Triton X-100 (T9284-100ML; MilliporeSigma) and 1% BSA diluted in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 2% NDS and 0.1% Triton X-100. PBS was used to wash the primary antibodies, and the cryosections were incubated with secondary antibodies in PBS with the PBS containing 2% NDS and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h. The following primary antibodies were used for staining: anti-FOXG1 (rabbit; M227; 1:400 dilution; Takara), anti-TCF7L2 (rabbit; 2569S; 1:200 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-PHOX2A (rabbit; ab155084; 1:200 dilution; Abcam), anti-BRN3A (mouse; MAB1585; 1:200 dilution; Sigma), anti-mCherry (goat; orb153320; 1:1,000 dilution; Biorbyt), anti-NK1R (rabbit; S8305; 1:200 dilution; Sigma), anti-VGLUT2 (mouse; MAB5504; 1:200 dilution; Millipore), anti-NF-H (mouse; NE1023; 1:200 dilution; Millipore) and anti-PAX2 (goat; AF3364; 1:200 dilution; R&D). The following secondary antibodies were used for staining: Alexa Fluor 647 AffiniPure donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H&L) (711-605-152; 1:1,000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch), Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-goat IgG (H&L) (A11057; 1:1,000 dilution; Thermo Fisher Scientific), Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H&L) (A10042; 1:200 dilution; Thermo Fisher Scientific), Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-mouse IgG (H&L) (A31571; 1:200 dilution; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-mouse IgG (H&L) (A10037; 1:1,000 dilution; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Nuclei were visualized with the Hoechst 33258 dye (H3549; 1:10,000 dilution; Life Technologies). Cryosections were mounted for microscopy on glass slides using Aqua-Poly/Mount (18606; Polysciences) or VECTASHIELD (H-1000; Vector Laboratories) and imaged on a confocal microscope. Images were processed and analysed using Fiji (v.2.14.0) and Imaris (Oxford Instruments).

Three to five organoids were collected in the same tube and considered as one sample. The RNA from samples was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini kit (74136; QIAGEN). Template cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR (11752250; Thermo Fisher Scientific). qPCR was performed using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (4312704; Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System (4485689; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

Dissociation of organoids, assembloids and human DRG was performed, as described previously10,49,56,57. For the organoid dissociation, four to five randomly selected organoids were pooled to obtain a single-cell suspension. For assembloids, one to two assembloids were pooled for dissociation. To match the relative cell numbers across different regions, one to two organoids from each of the four regions, totalling four to eight organoids, were pooled for dissociation only when comparing organoids to assembloids. For human primary tissue, one to two DRG were pooled for dissociation. Samples were incubated in 30 U ml−1 of papain enzyme solution (LS003126, Worthington Biochemical) and 0.4% DNase (12,500 U ml−1; LS2007, Worthington Biochemical) at 37 °C for 45 min. After enzymatic dissociation, organoids were washed with a solution containing protease inhibitor and gently triturated to obtain a single-cell suspension. Cells were resuspended in 0.04% BSA/PBS (B6917-25MG, MilliporeSigma) and filtered through a 70-μm Flowmi Cell Strainer (H13680-0070, Bel-Art), and the number of cells were counted. To target 7,000 cells after recovery, approximately 11,600 were loaded per lane on a Chromium Single Cell 3′ chip (Chromium Next GEM Chip G Single Cell Kit; PN-1000127, 10x Genomics), and cDNA libraries were generated with the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v.3.1 (PN-1000128 and PN-1000269, 10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each library was sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq S4 2 × 150 bp (Admera Health) and NovaSeq X 28 + 90 bp (CZ Biohub). Unique molecular identifier (UMI) counting was performed using the ‘count' function (–include-introns=TRUE) in Cell Ranger (v.7.0.1 and 7.1.0 for organoids; v.7.2.0 for the human DRG and organoid versus assembloid comparison) with GRCh38/Ensembl 98 reference (available at https://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020-A.tar.gz). Further downstream analyses were performed using the R package Seurat (v.4.3.0). Genes on the X or Y chromosome were removed from the count matrix to avoid biases in clustering due to the sex of the hiPS cell lines.

For comparison across four region organoids, hSeO samples (n = 4) and hdSpO samples (n = 5) from this study, along with hDiO samples11 (n = 3; GSE224766) and hCO samples13 (n = 2; GSE145122), were aggregated using the ‘aggr' function (–normalize=mapped) in Cell Ranger. Cells with more than 7,500 or less than 2,000 detected genes, with less than 2,000 UMI counts or with mitochondrial content higher than 15% were excluded. Genes that were not expressed in at least three cells were not included in the analysis. Gene expression was normalized using a global-scaling normalization method (normalization method; ‘LogNormalize'; scale factor 10,000), and the 2,000 most variable genes were selected (selection method; ‘vst') and scaled (mean = 0 and variance = 1 for each gene). The top 50 principal components (PCs) were used for clustering (resolution of 1.0) using the ‘FindNeighbors' and ‘FindClusters' functions and for visualization with UMAP. Clusters were annotated based on the expression of known marker genes.

For the analysis of hSeO and hdSpO, cells with more than 10,000 or less than 2,500 detected genes, with less than 2,000 UMI counts or cells with mitochondrial content higher than 15% were excluded. Genes that were not expressed in at least three cells in each library were not included. Normalization and variable gene detection were performed, as described above. The hSeO samples (n = 4) and hdSpO samples (n = 5) were each separately integrated using ‘FindIntegrationAnchors' and ‘IntegrateData' functions with the default parameter. The top 10 PCs were used for clustering (resolution of 1.0) using the ‘FindNeighbors' and ‘FindClusters' functions and for visualization with UMAP. The classification of dorsoventral neuronal cell types of hdSpO was performed based on the combinatorial expression of known markers, as described previously38,39, by using ‘doCellPartition' function (cell_level_min_step1 = 2, cell_level_min_step2 = 1; available at github.com/juliendelile/MouseSpinalCordAtlas).

For the organoid versus assembloid comparison, cells with more than 10,000 or less than 1,000 detected genes or cells with mitochondrial content higher than 15% were excluded. Genes that were not expressed in at least three cells in each library were not included. After normalization and variable gene detection, individual organoid samples (n = 4) and assembloid samples (n = 4) were integrated and clustered (30 PCs; resolution = 1).

For human DRG data, cells with more than 10,000 or less than 500 detected genes or cells with mitochondrial content higher than 10% were excluded. Genes that were not expressed in at least three cells in each library were not included. After normalization and variable gene detection, human DRG samples (n = 7) were integrated. UMAP visualization and clustering (30 PCs; resolution = 1) were performed. Human DRG samples (n = 7) and hSeO samples (n = 4) were also integrated. After removing putative stressed cells using Gruffi58, an additional round of integration, UMAP visualization and clustering (30 PCs; resolution = 2) were performed.

As a reference for label transfer from the human tissue datasets to four region-specific organoid datasets, the Braun et al.21 reference (available at https://github.com/linnarsson-lab/developing-human-brain) was downsampled, as described in our previous study59, and integrated with human DRG data using each donor as a batch. In the Braun et al. data, subregion labelling of hindbrain, pons and medulla was grouped into one as hindbrain. For label transfer of the dorsoventral subdomain information onto hdSpO, the Rayon et al. developing spinal cord data38 (GSE171892) were quality control (QC) filtered with the same criteria, as described in the original paper, and integrated using each donor as a batch. The prediction scores for each subregion were computed with the ‘FindTransferAnchors' and ‘TransferData' functions with 50 PCs. For each cell, the subregion with the highest prediction score was assigned as its predicted subregion. If the highest score was less than 0.5, the predicted subregion was marked as uncertain. Prediction proportions were calculated by dividing the number of cells in each organoid condition with a given subregion prediction by the total number of cells with that subregion prediction.

To generate assembloids, regionalized organoids were differentiated separately and later assembled by positioning them in close proximity. For two-part assembloids, the organoids of interest were fused by placing them in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes for 2–3 days inside an incubator. For three- or four-part assembloids, the organoids of interest were integrated by placing them in tilted six-well ultra-low attachment plates (no. 3471; Corning) for 1 week in an incubator. After assembly, the assembloids were maintained in ultra-low attachment plates (24-well or six-well plates) with medium change every 4–7 days. For three- or four-part assembloids, the six-well ultra-low attachment plates were kept tilted in the incubator. The neural medium used for four-part assembloids was supplemented with BDNF (20 ng ml−1; 450-02; PeproTech), GDNF (25 ng ml−1; 450-10; PeproTech), NGF (25 ng ml; 450-01; PeproTech), l-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate trisodium salt (200 µM; 323-44822; Wako), IGF-1 (10 ng ml−1; 100-11; PeproTech) and cAMP (50 μM; D0627; MilliporeSigma). In the course of in vitro development, the timing of neuronal maturation differs along the rostro-caudal axis. This gradient has been taken into consideration especially when generating assembloids composed of organoids resembling spatially separated brain regions, such as hCO and hSpO8. Along the same line, we generally integrated more advanced hCO and hDiO (days 90–120) with earlier-stage hdSpO and hSeO (days 40–70).

Viral infection of organoids was performed, as described previously60. In brief, two or three organoids were placed in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube containing a 200-μl medium with 0.5 μl of the virus and incubated overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The next day, 800 µl of fresh culture medium was added. The following day, neural organoids were transferred into the fresh culture medium in ultra-low attachment plates. For rabies virus retrograde tracing, organoids representing the ‘presynaptic' part were labelled with AAV-DIO-tdTomato, and organoids representing the ‘postsynaptic' part were separately labelled with Rabies-ΔG-Cre-GFP and AAV-EF1α::CVS-G. Two days after viral infection, the organoids were assembled. After 3 weeks of integration, assembloids were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for immunocytochemistry. For rabies virus tracing and calcium imaging experiments, hdSpO were labelled with AAV-EF1α::fDIO-GCaMP6f, and hDiO were separately labelled with both Rabies-ΔG-Flpo-dsRedExpress and AAV-EF1α::CVS-G. For GCaMP virus infection of four-part assembloids, one single assembloid was cultured overnight in 200-μl medium containing 0.5 μl of the virus of interest, at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The next day, 4 ml of the fresh culture medium was added.

The viruses used in this study were AAV-DJ-hSYN1::EYFP (GVVC-AAV-16; Stanford University Neuroscience Gene Vector and Virus Core), AAV-DJ-EF1α::CVS-G (produced by Stanford University Neuroscience Gene Vector and Virus Core using Addgene plasmid no. 67528), AAV-DJ-EF1-DIO-tdTomato (GVVC-AAV-169; Stanford University Neuroscience Gene Vector and Virus Core), AAV-DJ-hSYN1::mTurquoise2 (produced by Stanford University Neuroscience Gene Vector and Virus Core using Addgene plasmid no. 99125), AAV-DJ-hSYN1::mCherry (GVVC-AAV-17; Stanford University Neuroscience Gene Vector and Virus Core), Rabies-ΔG-Cre-GFP (Salk), Rabies-ΔG-Flpo-dsRedExpress (Salk using Addgene plasmid no. 32650), AAV1-EF1α::fDIO-GCaMP6f (no. 128315-AAV1; Addgene), Lenti-hSYN1::jGCaMP8s61 (produced by VectorBuilder), AAV1-hSYN1::Cre (no. 105553; Addgene) and AAV-DJ-EF1α::DIO-GCaMP6s (GVVC-AAV-91; Stanford University Neuroscience Gene Vector and Virus Core).

To achieve single-cell-resolution live calcium imaging in intact 3D organoids or assembloids without significant sample movement during chemical injection, we acutely attached samples to ethyleneimine polymer (PEI)-coated coverslips before imaging. Autoclaved 12-mm coverslips were coated with 0.01875% PEI (no. 03880; Sigma) in water for at least 1 h at 37 °C and then washed three times with water before use. An organoid or assembloid was carefully positioned on top of a PEI-coated coverslip, and an L-shaped tubing-type Chamlide CMB chamber (CM-B12-1PB; Live Cell Instrument) was assembled. This chamber was connected to a peristaltic pump (no. 702027; Harvard Apparatus) to establish continuous suction through the outlet hole. To prevent sample drying, a vehicle solution was applied immediately after assembly. Organoids and assembloids with detectable expression of genetically encoded calcium indicators and displaying baseline activity were imaged.

The live imaging chamber was transferred to the confocal microscope stage (Leica STELLARIS 5 or SP8), and the samples were imaged using LAS X software (Leica) under controlled environmental conditions (37 °C and 5% CO2) using a ×5 or ×10 objective. We waited for 5–10 min and then started time-lapse live imaging at approximately 0.436 s per frame, with adjustments for each sample. For imaging spontaneous activity patterns, calcium activity was recorded for 3–5 min. To capture calcium responses after chemical injection, we recorded 60-s baseline activity. Following this, αβ-MeATP (no. 3209; Tocris) or capsaicin (no. 0462; Tocris) dissolved in vehicle was injected over 30 s at a slow speed (approximately 2 ml min−1) to minimize any potential movement of the samples.

For analysis, regions of interest (ROI) were manually drawn, and raw fluorescent intensities were exported using Fiji (v.2.14.0). Using MATLAB (v.R2023a), raw fluorescent intensities were transformed into relative changes in fluorescence: ΔF/Fbase = (F(t) − Fbase)/Fbase, where Fbase is the lower fifth percentile value of the session. The mean amplitudes of ΔF/Fbase from each cell for 60 s were compared before and after chemical injection.

As shown in Fig. 2g,h, a neural medium supplemented with BDNF (20 ng ml−1), GDNF (25 ng ml−1) and NGF (25 ng ml−1) was used as the vehicle solution. After 1 min of baseline imaging, 30 μM of αβ-MeATP or 3 μM of capsaicin was injected into the chamber.

As shown in Fig. 2k,l, a neural medium supplemented with BDNF (20 ng ml−1), GDNF (25 ng ml−1) and NGF (25 ng ml−1) was used as the vehicle solution. The hSeO were incubated with various concentrations of TNP–ATP (10, 100 or 100,000 nM) dissolved in the vehicle solution. After 1 min of baseline imaging, 30 μM of αβ-MeATP was injected into the chamber.

As shown in Fig. 3q,r, assembloids were acutely attached to a PEI-coated 12-well cell culture plate before the imaging. The plate was moved onto the microscope stage, and the imaging was done as the lid of the plate was open. A neural medium supplemented with BDNF, GDNF and NGF was used as the vehicle solution. After 1 min of baseline imaging in 1 ml of the vehicle solution, 500 μl of αβ-MeATP (90 μM) was added during imaging to make 30 μΜ of αβ-MeATP. After 6 min of imaging, the samples were incubated with NBQX (50 μM; no. 0373; Tocris) and APV (50 μM; no. 0106; Tocris) for 30 min in the incubator. Calcium response by αβ-MeATP in the presence of NBQX and APV was performed, as described above.

As shown in Fig. 4e,f, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) with calcium, magnesium (SH30264.01; Cytiva) or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; containing 124 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 26 mM NaHCO3 and 10 mM d-(+)-glucose) with the addition of GlutaMAX (35050061; Gibco) was used as the vehicle solution. After 1 min of baseline imaging, 3 μM of αβ-MeATP was injected into the chamber.

As shown in Figs. 4k,l and 5f,g, aCSF was used as the vehicle solution.

The correlation between calcium traces was quantified using SCA42. Traces were first averaged over 1-s intervals and partitioned into 20-s-long segments. Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was computed between corresponding segments and averaged across all segments. This analysis was repeated for multiple time lags within the range of [−20, 20] s for each pair of calcium traces, with 1-s shift step. The peak correlation value across time lags was taken as a measure of synchrony between the calcium signals. This approach yields an accurate correlation estimate between signals on a short timescale, irrespective of common activations over longer periods of time.

Αssembloids were imaged under environmentally controlled conditions (37 °C) using a ×5 objective in a confocal microscope (Leica SP8). For glutamate uncaging experiments, MNI-caged-l-glutamate (1490; Tocris) was used at a final concentration of 2.5 mM in aCSF. The FRAP software module of the Leica SP8 confocal microscope was used to uncage glutamate using ultraviolet light (405 nm). At a frame rate of 2.3 frames per second, one trial consisted of 50 frames for pre-stimulation, three frames of ultraviolet stimulation (in specified ROI) and 100 frames for post-stimulation; three trials were applied for one sample. Calcium responses were calculated by comparing the mean of ΔF/Fbase during 50 frames (21.8 s) before and after ultraviolet illumination, as described above, and averaged values of three trials were used for each sample.

Three to five organoids were collected in the same tube and considered as one sample. Whole-cell protein lysates for samples were prepared using the RIPA buffer system (sc-24948; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein concentration was quantified using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce; catalogue no. 23225; Thermo Fisher Scientific). For electrophoresis, 30 µg of protein per lane was loaded and run on a 4–12% Bis-Tris PAGE gel (Bolt 4–12% Bis-Tris Protein Gel; catalogue no. NW04122BOX; Invitrogen) and transferred onto a polyvinyl difluoride membrane (Immobilon-FL; EMD Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in tris-buffered saline with Tween (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies: anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mouse; 1:5,000; GTX627408; GeneTex) for 1 day and anti-NaV1.7 (rabbit; 1:1,000, ASC-008; Alomone Labs) for 6 days. Membranes were washed three times with TBST and then incubated with near-infrared fluorophore-conjugated species-specific secondary antibodies (Goat Anti-Mouse IgG Polyclonal Antibody (IRDye 680RD; 1:10,000; 926-68070; LI-COR Biosciences) or Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG Polyclonal Antibody (IRDye 800CW; 1:10,000; 926-32211; LI-COR Biosciences)) for 1 h at room temperature. Following secondary antibody application, membranes were washed three times with TBST and once with TBS and then imaged using a LI-COR Odyssey CLx imaging system with Image Studio Software (v.5.2; LI-COR). Western blots were analysed using the Image Studio Software or Fiji (v.2.14.0) (see Source data for full blots).

EYFP+ projections in target regions were imaged under environmentally controlled conditions in intact assembloids using a Leica TCS SP8 or Leica STELLARIS 5 confocal microscope with a motorized stage. Assembloids were transferred to a well in a 24-well glass bottom plate (P24-0-N; Cellvis) in a cell culture medium and incubated in an environmentally controlled chamber for 15–30 min before imaging. Images were taken using a ×10 objective to capture the entire target area at a depth of 100 μm. Projections were quantified using Fiji (v.2.14.0). ROI were manually drawn to cover the target area to be measured in max projection confocal stacks. The percentage of fluorescence-positive pixels over the target region area was calculated in binary images.

Mouse tissue samples were obtained using protocols approved by Stanford University's Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care. Timed pregnant CD1 mice with 11 days of gestation were obtained from Charles River Laboratories and maintained on a 12-h light–dark cycle, an ambient temperature of 20–26 °C and a humidity of 30–70%. We anaesthetized pregnant mice with isoflurane on day 13 of gestation, and E13.5 embryos were used in this study without knowing their sex. DRG were dissected from E13.5 embryos, placed en bloc onto PEI-coated 12-well plates and cultured in DRG culture medium (neural medium supplemented with BDNF, GDNF, NGF and 10% FBS). Calcium imaging was performed the next day after dissection.

As shown in Extended Data Fig. 3a–d, mouse DRG were incubated with Calbryte 520 AM (10 µM; no. 20653; AAT Bioquest). After 45 min, the medium was changed to 1 ml of the DRG culture medium. To image the calcium activity of mouse DRG, a whole-cell culture plate containing mouse DRG was moved to an environment-controlled confocal microscope stage. Imaging was performed when the lid of the plate was opened. After 1 min of baseline line imaging, 500 μl of αβ-MeATP (90 μM) or capsaicin (10 μM) dissolved in the DRG culture medium was added into the well by pipetting without touching the cell culture plate (to prevent XYZ movement). Imaging was performed for 6 min. The final concentrations of the agonists were 30 μM (αβ-MeATP) and 3.3 μM (capsaicin).

As shown in Fig. 2l,m, mouse DRG were incubated with Calbryte 520 AM, as described above, and additionally incubated with various concentrations of TNP–ATP (10, 100 or 100,000 nM; no. 2464; Tocris) dissolved into DRG culture medium for 30 min in the incubator. After 1 min of baseline imaging with TNP–ATP, 500 μl of αβ-MeATP (90 μM) in the DRG culture medium was added into the well. Imaging was performed for 6 min.

Extracellular recordings were performed, as described previously11. Assembloids were embedded into 3% low-melting gel agarose (IB70056; IBI Scientific). Embedded samples were placed on a Brain Slice Chamber-2 (S-BSC2; Scientific Systems Design) and perfused with aCSF (bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2) at 37 °C. The temperature was controlled and retained at 37 °C by connecting to a Proportional Temperature Controller PTC03 (S-PTC03; AutoMate Scientific). Acute 32-channel P-1 probes with two shanks (ASSY-37 P-1; Cambridge NeuroTech) were connected to an Acute probe adaptor; 32-channel Samtec to Omnetics (ADPT A32-Om32; Cambridge NeuroTech). Baseline activities were acquired using the Intan 1024ch recording controller (Intan Technologies) at 30,000 Hz for 5 min using RHX software (v.3.1.0). Raw recording data were processed using Intan Technologies code and analysed using MATLAB (v.R2022a; MathWorks).

To analyse extracellular recording data, band-pass filtering (350–2,000 Hz) was performed followed by common median referencing. A threshold (six times multiplied by s.d.) for each channel was used to count neuronal activities. Activity from hdSpO, hDiO or hCO was counted ± 500 ms of each activity of hSeO channels. Activity counts around the peak area (P) − activity counts in the base area (B)/(P + B) were used as co-activation index44. Parameters (bin size, 5 ms; plot size, ±500 ms) were used to draw the representative cross-correlograms.

For generating SCN9A KO cells, three single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed and synthesized by Synthego to induce one or more fragment deletions. The sgRNA sequences are as follows: 5′-AGCUCGUGUAGCCAUAAUCA-3′, 5′-CGUGUGUAGUCAGUGUCCAG-3′ and 5′-UUCUCUUGGUACUCACCUGU-3′. The hiPS cells were dissociated with Accutase, and 0.5 million cells were mixed with 300 pmol sgRNAs and 40 pmol Cas9 protein (SpCas9 2NLS Nuclease (1,000 pmol); Synthego). Nucleofection was performed using the P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X Kit S (V4XP-3032; Lonza), a 4D-Nucleofector Core Unit and the X unit (program CA-137; Lonza). Cells were then seeded onto vitronectin-coated six-well plates in Essential 8 Medium supplemented with the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (10 µM). Essential 8 Medium was used for daily medium change. The genotype of pooled cells was determined by PCR with the primer set Fw, 5′-CGAGAACTACCCATATTATTAGTGATGG-3′; Rv, 5′-CCAAGAACTATCACAAAACGTCTGT-3′, and Sanger sequencing (GENEWIZ) was performed with the reverse primer.

SCN9A gain-of-function cells were generated by Bayspair using two-step scarless genome editing62. Genotyping was performed using PCR with the primer set Fw, 5′-GTGTTTGGAGACCCATGTTTC-3′; Rv, 5′-GAAGTAGTAGTGTCTGAGGGAGATC-3′, and Sanger sequencing (GENEWIZ) was performed with the reverse primer.

Patch-clamp recordings were conducted, as described previously11. In brief, hSeO were first infected with Lenti-hSYN1::ChR2-EYFP before assembly and then integrated with hdSpO to create hSeO–hdSpO assembloids. These assembloids were subsequently infected with AAV-DJ-hSYN1::mCherry and placed onto cell culture inserts (0.4-µm pore size; 353090; Corning) positioned in six-well plates to form flattened assembloids. Recordings were typically performed on days 148–164 (daf 99–110). mCherry-positive neurons within the hdSpO were identified using an upright microscope. For optogenetic stimulation, whole-field light-emitting diode illumination (460 nm; 5–20 ms duration; maximal power; CoolLED) was applied through a ×40 objective, and oEPSCs were recorded at a holding potential of −70 mV.

Patch-clamp recordings in whole-cell configuration were performed at room temperature on spinal organoid neurons, which were visualized using an upright microscope (Scientifica) equipped with an INFINITY2 charge-coupled device camera and INFINITY Capture Software (Teledyne Lumenera). The external aCSF recording solution contained 124 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 1 mM MgSO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 26 mM NaHCO3 and 10 mM d-(+)-glucose. During recordings, the assembloids were perfused with the aCSF recording solution (bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2). Thick-walled borosilicate pipettes (resistance of 6–9 MΩ) were filled with an internal solution consisting of 135 mM K-gluconate, 20 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM sodium-ATP, 10 mM HEPES and 0.3 mM sodium-GTP (pH adjusted to 7.28 with KOH; approximately 302 mOsm). Data were acquired using a MultiClamp 700B Amplifier (Clampex 10.7; Molecular Devices) and a Digidata 1550B Digitizer (Molecular Devices), low-pass filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 20 kHz and analysed with Clampfit (v.10.7; Molecular Devices).

Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. unless described otherwise. Raw data were tested for normality of distribution, and statistical analyses were performed by two-tailed unpaired t-test, two-tailed Mann–Whitney test, two-tailed paired t-test, two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, one-way ANOVA and Kruskal–Wallis test with multiple comparison tests depending on the dataset. Sample sizes were estimated empirically. GraphPad Prism v.10.0.0 or MATLAB (v.R2023a; MathWorks) was used for statistical analyses. Data shown in representative experiments were repeated with similar results in multiple independent experiments.

Metrics details

Microglia are the resident immune cells in the brain and have pivotal roles in neurodevelopment and neuroinflammation1,2. This study investigates the function of the immune-checkpoint molecule TIM-3 (encoded by HAVCR2) in microglia. TIM-3 was recently identified as a genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease3, and it can induce T cell exhaustion4. However, its specific function in brain microglia remains unclear. We demonstrate in mouse models that TGFβ signalling induces TIM-3 expression in microglia. In turn, TIM-3 interacts with SMAD2 and TGFBR2 through its carboxy-terminal tail, which enhances TGFβ signalling by promoting TGFBR-mediated SMAD2 phosphorylation, and this process maintains microglial homeostasis. Genetic deletion of Havcr2 in microglia leads to increased phagocytic activity and a gene-expression profile consistent with the neurodegenerative microglial phenotype (MGnD), also referred to as disease-associated microglia (DAM). Furthermore, microglia-targeted deletion of Havcr2 ameliorates cognitive impairment and reduces amyloid-β pathology in 5×FAD mice (a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease). Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed a subpopulation of MGnD microglia in Havcr2-deficient 5×FAD mice characterized by increased pro-phagocytic and anti-inflammatory gene expression alongside reduced pro-inflammatory gene expression. These transcriptomic changes were corroborated by single-cell RNA sequencing data across most microglial clusters in Havcr2-deficient 5×FAD mice. Our findings reveal that TIM-3 mediates microglia homeostasis through TGFβ signalling and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting microglial TIM-3 in Alzheimer's disease.

The RNA-seq and snRNA-seq data were deposited into the GEO at the National Center for Biotechnology Information with the accession number GSE223424. The accession number for the scRNA-seq data in the GEO is GSE267764. Public mouse microglial microarray data were obtained from table S1 of a previous publication21. Public bulk RNA-seq datasets were used in the analysis of the Tgfbr2cKO (GSE111385) and Clec7a+ data (GSE101689). Public scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq datasets were used for the analyses of P9 and P28 cortical microglia (Fig. 1; GSE127449), mouse brain atlas (Extended Data Fig. 1; http://mousebrain.org/), 6-month-old mouse brain (Extended Data Fig. 10; GSE98969), 7-month-old mouse brain (Extended Data Fig. 10, GSE140510), IFN-responsive MGnD (Extended Data Fig. 11; GSE205569) and human brain (Extended Data Fig. 1; Broad Institute single-cell portal SCP371).

Unsupervised clustering divided microglia into 3 populations (MGL1, 2, and 3). Though genes induced by tissue dissociation were highly expressed in two of the three mouse microglial clusters103, Havcr2, Lag3, and Vsir showed high and specific expression in microglia (e). g, The expression of immune checkpoint genes and TGFβ pathway-related genes is shown in human microglia and other cell populations in the brain20. h, Immune checkpoint receptor expression on microglia was analyzed by flow cytometry during the early postnatal period (n = 9, 3, 5 for day 7, 13, 20, respectively, independent mice). i, Developmental alterations of MGnD and homeostasis-associated genes in microglia were analyzed using a published dataset21. MGnD and homeostasis-associated genes include the top 10 DEGs in Clec7a+ plaque-associated microglia10 and several selected genes. j, Primary microglia (live CD45intCD11b+) were cultured with either TGFβ (2, 10, or 50 ng/mL), M-CSF (10 ng/mL), GM-CSF (10 ng/mL), IL-27 (10 ng/mL), or LPS (10 ng/mL) for 24 h. RT-qPCR quantified the immune checkpoint gene expression (n = 3/condition, independent samples). k, TPM value of Havcr2 in the RNAseq analysis of sorted microglia (live CD45intCD11b+) from one-month-old Havcr2cKO mice (n = 4 (3 males, 1 female)), and Havcr2flox/flox mice (n = 5 (4 males, 1 female)). Avg Expr, average expression; Pct Expr, percent expressed; MGL, microglia; PVM, perivascular macrophage. Results are shown from one experiment, representing at least two independent experiments for h. Data are mean ± s.e.m. One-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test.

Metrics details

The most dynamic and repetitive regions of great ape genomes have traditionally been excluded from comparative studies1,2,3. Consequently, our understanding of the evolution of our species is incomplete. Here we present haplotype-resolved reference genomes and comparative analyses of six ape species: chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, Bornean orangutan, Sumatran orangutan and siamang. We achieve chromosome-level contiguity with substantial sequence accuracy (<1 error in 2.7 megabases) and completely sequence 215 gapless chromosomes telomere-to-telomere. We resolve challenging regions, such as the major histocompatibility complex and immunoglobulin loci, to provide in-depth evolutionary insights. Comparative analyses enabled investigations of the evolution and diversity of regions previously uncharacterized or incompletely studied without bias from mapping to the human reference genome. Such regions include newly minted gene families in lineage-specific segmental duplications, centromeric DNA, acrocentric chromosomes and subterminal heterochromatin. This resource serves as a comprehensive baseline for future evolutionary studies of humans and our closest living ape relatives.

High-quality sequencing of ape genomes has been a high priority of the human genetics and genomics community since the initial sequencing of the human genome in 2001 (refs. 1,2). Sequencing of these genomes is crucial for reconstructing the evolutionary history of every base pair of the human genome. Moreover, such an undertaking is one of the grand challenges put forward to the genomics community after the release of the first draft of the Human Genome Project3. As a result, there have been numerous publications ranging from initial draft genomes to notable updates over the past two decades4,5,6,7,8. However, owing to the repetitive nature of ape genomes, complete assemblies have not been achieved. Current references lack sequence resolution of some of the most dynamic genomic regions, including regions corresponding to lineage-specific gene families.

Advances in long-read sequencing and new assembly algorithms were needed to overcome the challenge of repeats and to achieve the first complete, telomere-to-telomere (T2T) assembly of the human genome9,10. Using these same methods, we recently published six additional pairs of complete sex chromosomes from distinct branches of the ape phylogeny11. Although these initial projects targeted haploid chromosomes and required substantial manual curation, improved assembly methods now enable the complete assembly of diploid chromosomes12,13. Using these methods, we present here complete, phased, diploid genomes of six ape species and make all data and curated assemblies freely available to the scientific community. We organize the article into three main sections, with a focus on the following topics: (1) the generation of the assemblies; (2) the added value for standard evolutionary analyses; and (3) new evolutionary insights into previously unassembled regions. Although the interior of rDNA arrays and some small portions of the largest centromeres remain unresolved, these genomes represent an improvement in quality over previous ape reference genomes and are of equivalent quality to the T2T-CHM13 human reference genome.

Unlike previous reference genomes that selected female individuals to improve representation of the X chromosome4,5,6,7, we focused on male samples (Table 1) to also sequence the Y chromosome and to provide a complete chromosomal complement for each species. Both sex chromosomes from these samples were analysed by us in a separate article11. Samples from two of the species we analysed, bonobo and gorilla, originated from parent–child trios (Supplementary Note I), which facilitated the phasing of parental haplotypes. For samples for which parental data were not available, deep Hi-C datasets were used (Table 1) to achieve chromosome-scale haplotype phasing. For all samples, we prepared high-molecular-weight DNA and generated deep PacBio high-fidelity (HiFi; mean = 90-fold sequence coverage) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT; mean = 136.4-fold sequence coverage) sequence data (Supplementary Table II.3). For the latter, we specifically focused on producing at least 30-fold ultra-long (UL > 100 kilobases (kb)) ONT sequence data to scaffold assemblies across larger repetitive regions, including centromeres and segmental duplications (SDs). To generate the backbone of the assembly, we used Verkko12 (v1.4.1), which is a hybrid assembler that leverages the accuracy of HiFi data (Supplementary Note II). UL-ONT sequencing was used for repeat resolution, local phasing and scaffolding, and Hi-C or trio data were used to convert chromosome-scale phasing of haplotypes into a fully diploid assembly. For each chromosome, the most accurate and complete haplotype was selected as the primary assembly for each chromosome pair. When rDNA was present in only one haplotype, it was chosen as the primary haplotype regardless of the completeness status. Both sex chromosomes and the mitochondrial genome were included in the primary assembly.

When considering the diploid genomes of each species, 74% (215 out of 290) of all chromosomes were T2T assembled (gapless with a telomere on both ends), and at least 80.8% of chromosomes were T2T in at least one haplotype (Table 1, Fig. 1, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table II.4 for siamang). Overall, there was an average of six gaps or breaks in assembly contiguity per haplotype (range = 1–12), which were typically localized to the rDNA array. The number was reduced to an average of 1.6 gaps if those regions were excluded. All assemblies were curated to extend partially into each rDNA array from both sides, which ensured that no non-rDNA sequence was missed. In addition to gaps, we specifically searched for collapsed and misassembled sequences using dedicated methods (Supplementary Note II (‘Assessment of the genome assembly') and Supplementary Table II.5). We estimated on average 0.2–1.6 megabases (Mb) of non-rDNA-related issues per haplotype assembly (Supplementary Table II.5). Comparisons with Illumina data14 from the same samples provided a lower-bound base QV accuracy of 49.3 (about 1 error every 100,000 bp), which was limited by Illumina coverage loss in high-GC regions. By contrast, comparisons that included HiFi data suggested even higher accuracy (QV = 61.7, about 1 error every 1 million base pairs; Supplementary Table II.3). Overall, we estimated that 99.2–99.9% of each genome (99.98–99.99% for non-rDNA bases) was completely and accurately assembled, including heterochromatin. These values are consistent with the T2T-CHM13v1.1 assembly, for which potential issues remain for 0.3% of the genome14. In summary, these ape diploid-genome assemblies represent an advancement in terms of sequence accuracy and contiguity with respect to all previous ape genome assemblies4,5,6,7,8. Each genome assembly was annotated by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and has been adopted as the main reference in RefSeq. That is, the previous short-read-based or long-read-based and less complete versions of the genomes have been replaced, and the sex chromosomes have been updated with the newly assembled and polished versions.

a,b, A comparative alignment of HSA7 (a) and HSA16 (b) compared with syntenic chromosomes from chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, Bornean orangutan and Sumatran orangutan. Each chromosome is compared with the chromosome below in this stacked representation using the tool SVbyEye (https://github.com/daewoooo/SVbyEye)116. Regions of collinearity and synteny (positive in blue) are contrasted with inverted regions (negative in yellow) and with regions beyond the sensitivity of minimap2 (homology gaps), including centromeres, subterminal and interstitial heterochromatin or other regions of satellite expansion. A single transposition (green in b) relocates about 4.8 Mb of gene-rich sequence in gorilla from HSA16p13.11 to HSA16p11.2 (see Fig. 3 for more detail).

This new genomics resource provides two important advantages to the evolutionary community. First, it enhances the ability to perform more refined and complete standard evolutionary comparative analyses than previously possible. Second, it provides access to the complete sequence of previously inaccessible regions, including regular centromeric and acrocentric regions, large blocks of SDs and subterminal heterochromatin. Below, we divide our analyses into two sections: the first focused on highlighting improvements in the resource and the second focused on evolutionary analyses of previously inaccessible regions.

Most previous genome-wide comparative studies of apes have been limited by the mapping of inferior assemblies to a higher quality human genome. Consequently, human reference biases were introduced. Because the assemblies here were of comparable quality and contiguity, we sought to mitigate this bias by creating an ape pangenome as an unbiased framework to understand evolution. First, we used Progressive Cactus15 to construct several pangenomes using different parameters, which included human and ape haplotypes (Supplementary Note III and Data availability). Predictably, the resulting interspecies graphs were more complex than the recently released human pangenome for 47 individuals16. For example, one ape pangenome was 3.38 Gb, with three times the number of edges and nodes as compared to previous human-only pangenomes. The resulting alignments enabled us to annotate genes and repeats and the ancestral state of more base pairs of the human GRCh38 reference. After applying the parsimony-like method used by the 1000 Genomes Project and Ensembl17, we observed a genome-wide increase of 6.25% in the total ancestrally annotated base pairs compared with the existing Ensembl annotation (release 112), with the greatest increase in autosomes observed for chromosome 19 (21.5%; Supplementary Fig. III.13). As a second approach, we applied pangenome graph builder18 to construct all-to-all pairwise alignments for all 12 nonhuman primate (NHP) haplotypes (of 6 species) along with 3 T2T human haplotypes (T2T-CHM13v2.0 and 2 haplotypes of T2T-HG002v1.0). We used these pairwise alignment data to construct an implicit graph (Supplementary Note III, ‘Implicit pangenome graph') of all six species and computed a conservation score using phastCons v1_5 for every base pair in the genome (Supplementary Note III (‘Conservation analyses') and Supplementary Fig. III.9). The approach was transitive without a reference bias and considered both assembled haplotypes for each genome and unique and repetitive regions. As a result, we identified the most rapidly evolving regions in each primate lineage, including the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and the chromosome 8p23.1 inversion (Supplementary Fig. III.9).

Overall, sequence comparisons among the complete ape genomes revealed greater divergence than previously estimated (Supplementary Notes III–IV). Indeed, 12.5–27.3% of an ape genome failed to align or was inconsistent with a simple one-to-one alignment, thereby introducing gaps. Gap divergence showed a 5-fold to 15-fold difference in the number of affected megabases when compared to single-nucleotide variants, which was due to rapidly evolving and structurally variant regions of the genome as well as technical limitations of alignment in repetitive regions (Supplementary Figs. III.11 and III.12). We catalogued all structurally divergent regions (SDRs) among the ape genomes and found an average of 327 Mb of sequence (10%) per ape lineage (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Note V). Predictably, these included centromeres, acrocentric short arms and subterminal heterochromatic caps, but also numerous gene-rich SD regions enriched at the breakpoints of large-scale rearrangements (Supplementary Fig. V.15). We focused on segments that could be reliably aligned and then we estimated speciation times and modelled incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) across the ape species tree19 (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table VI.26). Our analyses dated the human–chimpanzee split between 5.5 and 6.3 million years ago (Ma; minimum to maximum estimate of divergence), the African ape split at 10.6–10.9 Ma and the orangutan split at 18.2–19.6 Ma (Fig. 2a). We inferred ILS for an average of 39.5% of the autosomal genome and 24% of the X chromosome. Compared with recent reports20, these values represent a 7.5% increase in autosomal ILS, results that are in part due to the inclusion of more repetitive DNA (Supplementary Fig. VI.16). Consequently, we estimated that the human–chimpanzee–bonobo ancestral population size (average Ne = 198,000) is larger than that of the human–chimpanzee–gorilla ancestor (Ne = 132,000), a result consistent with an increase in the ancestral population 6–10 Ma (Supplementary Note VI). We next searched for signatures of adaptation in each ape species by identifying regions of hard21 and soft (partial)22 selective sweeps based on the mapping of short-read whole-genome sequencing data generated from the great ape genetic diversity project23,24,25,26 (Supplementary Note VII) back to the T2T genomes. Among the ape species, we identified 143 and 86 candidate regions for hard and partial selective sweeps, respectively (Supplementary Table VII.31). We also identified seven duplication-overlapping genes that showed signatures of selection on both of the unique flanking sequences of the duplications. Approximately half of the hard selective sweeps (74 out of 143) and more than 80% of the partial selective sweeps (70 out of 86) were previously unknown, and a total of 43 regions overlapped with sweeps previously found in humans27.

We applied two gene-annotation pipelines (comparative annotation toolkit (CAT) and NCBI) to identify both protein-coding and noncoding RNA (ncRNA) genes for primary assembly for each NHP. We complemented the annotation pipelines by directly mapping the PacBio Iso-Seq transcriptome long reads (50 Gb of full-length non-chimeric (FLNC) cDNA) generated from each sample and searching for transcriptional support for genes with multiple exons. The number of protein-coding genes was comparable among different apes (n = 22,114–23,735), with slightly more than 1,000 genes predicted to be gained or duplicated or lost when compared to humans (Supplementary Table VIII.34). Using the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) gene set, based on GENCODE28, we estimated that 99.0–99.6% of corresponding human genes were now represented, and >90% of genes were full-length. We identified a fraction (3.3–6.4%) of protein-coding genes present in the NHP T2T genomes that contained new transcript models relative to the annotation for the human genome. This included 770–1,482 previously unknown gene models corresponding to 315–528 gene families in the NHPs, with about 68.6% corresponding to lineage-specific SDs, all supported by Iso-Seq transcripts (Supplementary Tables VIII.34 and VIII.35). In this list, we also found biomedical genes such as LRPAP1, for which paralogues show tissue-specific expression across fibroblast and testes (Supplementary Note VIII). We also identified human-specific genes associated with human evolution of the frontal cortex, including SRGAP2C29,30, ARHGAP11 (ref. 31) (Supplementary Table VIII.40) and NOTCH2NL32,33 (implicated in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease). The non-SD overlapping gene copies consisted of 73% of transcript models that were changed in their sequence by >50%, with the remaining 27% no longer translated. Moreover, 2.1–5.2% of transcripts showed previously unknown NHP splice forms, which were again supported by Iso-Seq data (Supplementary Table VIII.34). We provide a valuable resource in the form of a curated consensus protein-coding gene annotation set by integrating both the NCBI and CAT pipelines (Supplementary Note VIII). We also analysed FLNC reads obtained from testis from a second individual11 to quantify the potential impact genome-wide on gene annotation, and we observed improvements in mappability, completeness and accuracy (Supplementary Note VIII and Supplementary Fig. VIII.29). In gorilla, for example, we mapped 28,925 (0.7%) additional reads to the T2T assembly in contrast to only 171 additional reads to the previous long-read assembly5. Similarly, we observed 33,032 (0.7%) soft-clipped reads (>200 bp) in the gorilla T2T assembly in contrast to 89,498 (2%) soft-clipped reads when mapping to the previous assembly5. These improvements in mappability were nonuniformly distributed with loci at centromeric, telomeric and SD regions, which led to increased copy number counts when compared with previous genome assemblies (Supplementary Fig. VIII.29e–g).

We generated a near-complete census of all high-copy repeats and their distribution across the ape genomes (Extended Data Table 1, Supplementary Note IX and Supplementary Table IX.41). With this new information, we estimated that the autosomes of the ape genomes contain 53.2–58.0% of detectable repeats, which include transposable elements, various classes of satellite DNA and variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs), among others (Supplementary Fig. IX.30). This autosomal content was significantly lower than the sex chromosomes (X, 61.8–66.3%; Y, 71.1–85.9%)11. Compared with previous genome assemblies, repeat content was increased from 286 to 706 Mb depending on the species (Supplementary Table IX.42). Gorilla, chimpanzee, bonobo and siamang genomes showed substantially higher satellite content, which was driven in large part by the accumulation of subterminal heterochromatin through lineage-specific satellite and VNTR expansions (Fig. 1, Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. IX.30). Satellites accounted for the largest repeat variation (Extended Data Table 1), ranging from 4.9% satellite content in Bornean orangutans (159.2 Mb in total) to 13.0% in gorillas (462.5 Mb in total). An analysis of gaps in exon and repeat annotations led to the identification of 159 previously unknown satellite monomers (Supplementary Tables IX.41–IX.50), ranging from 0.5 to 7.1 Mb in additional base pairs classified per genome (Supplementary Fig. IX.30). Of note, 3.8 Mb of the sequence in the gorilla genome consisted of an approximately 36 bp repeat, herein named VNTR_148, which accounted for only 841.9 kb and 55.9 kb in bonobos and chimpanzees, respectively (Supplementary Table IX.43). This repeat displayed a pattern of expansion similar to that of the unrelated repeat pCht subterminal satellite11, which suggests that it may have undergone expansion through a similar mechanism.

Multiple sequence alignments enabled us to define a comprehensive set of both truncated and full-length LINE, Alu, ERV and SVA retrotransposon insertions (Supplementary Tables IX.53–IX.55). Orangutans seemed to have the highest LINE-1 (L1) mobilization rate based on both the absolute number of insertions and the number of full-length elements with intact open-reading frames (ORFs). By contrast, the African apes (gorilla, chimpanzee, bonobo and human) showed a higher accumulation of Alu insertions (Fig. 2c). The number of L1 retrotransposons with intact ORFs varied by a factor of 5.8, with chimpanzees having the lowest (95) and orangutans having the highest, with at least 2.5 times more L1 retrotransposons with intact ORFs (more than 500 in both orangutan species compared with 203 in gorillas). Humans fell in between this range. The overall number and high percentage of full-length L1 elements with intact ORFs in orangutans implies recent high L1 activity. Alu activity was quiescent in orangutans, a result consistent with previous reports34, and indicates a genome environment in which L1 retrotransposons out-compete Alu retrotransposons. When considering only full-length ERV elements with both target-site duplications as well as Gag (capsid) and Pol (reverse transcriptase and integrase) coding domains, a marked difference was observed. In detail, higher full-length, species-specific ERV content was observed in gorillas (57), followed by humans (12) and chimpanzees (4). PtERV and HERV-K accounted for the ERV elements with both target-site duplications and protein domains, along with more degraded ERV elements in gorillas, humans, chimpanzees and bonobos (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table IX.56).

The complete ape genomes made it possible to investigate structurally complex regions of high biomedical relevance in more detail, especially with respect to human disease. Moreover, four of the primate genomes generated here (bonobo, gorilla and the two orangutan species) were derived from fibroblast instead of lymphoblastoid cell lines. The latter, in particular, has been the most common source of most previous ape genome assemblies, which has limited the characterization of loci affected by somatic rearrangements (for example, immunoglobulin genes)35. Thus, we specifically focused on nine regions associated with the immune response or antigen presentation that are subjected to complex mutational processes or selective forces.

Immunoglobulins and T cell receptors (TCRs) mediate interactions with both foreign and self-antigens and are encoded by large, expanded gene families that undergo rapid diversification both within and between species36,37. We conducted a comparative analyses of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH), light chain kappa (IGK) and light chain lambda (IGL) as well as T cell receptor alpha (TRA), beta (TRB), gamma (TRG) and delta (TRD) loci in four ape species (Supplementary Note X) for which two complete intact haplotypes were constructed (Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. X.32a). We identified an average of 60 (IGHV), 36 (IGKV), 33 (IGLV), 46 (TRAV and TRDV), 54 (TRBV) and 8 (TRGV) putatively functional immunoglobulin and TCR genes per parental haplotype per species across the seven loci (Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary Data 1). As previously noted for human haplotypes, the ape immunoglobulin and TCR gene loci were characterized by large structural differences within and between species, accounting for as much as 33% of inter-haplotype length differences in immunoglobulin loci and up to 10% in the TCR loci. This result suggests that immunoglobulin loci underwent more rapid divergence than the TCR loci, which may be due to evolutionary and functional constraints placed on TCR loci by required interactions with MHC (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). Moreover, immunoglobulin loci showed the most substantial structural variation, including gene-spanning expansions of tandem duplications across all IGH haplotypes, long-range rearrangements in both gorilla IGK haplotypes and a notable 1.4 Mb inversion distinguishing the two IGL haplotypes of bonobos (Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. X.32a,b). These large-scale differences frequently corresponded to species-specific sets of genes (those that constitute phylogenetic clades of genes specific to bonobos, gorillas or both orangutan species; Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. X.32c). We observed the greatest number of species-specific genes in IGH (Supplementary Fig. X.32d), for which we also noted a greater density of SDs longer than 10 kb relative to the other six loci (Extended Data Fig. 2d). This finding indicates that the genomic structure for immunoglobulins is probably a key driver of intra-species evolution.

We also completely assembled and annotated 12 ape haplotypes corresponding to the 4–5 Mb MHC region (Supplementary Note XI). MHC loci encode diverse cell surface proteins crucial for antigen presentation and adaptive immunity38, are highly polymorphic among mammals39 and are strongly implicated in human disease40. Comparative sequence analyses confirmed marked sequence divergence and structural variation (an average of 328 kb deletions and 422 kb insertions in NHPs compared to humans), including duplications ranging from 99.3 kb in siamang to 701 kb in the Sumatran orangutan H-2 (Supplementary Tables XI.57 and XI.58), as well as contractions and expansions associated with specific MHC genes (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Overall, MHC class I genes showed greater structural variation within and among the NHPs than MHC class II genes (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), with threefold greater average duplication sequences per haplotype (171 kb versus 62 kb). Particularly high divergence in this region was seen in siamangs, which lacked a functional MHC-C locus and instead carries an apparently functional MHC-J-like locus that is only found as a pseudogene in humans (Extended Data Fig. 3a and Supplementary Figs. XI.33–XI.40). Although MHC I gene content and organization were nearly identical in humans, bonobos and chimpanzees, other apes showed more variation, including additional genes such as Gogo-OKO, related but distinct from Gogo-A, and the orangutan-specific pseudogene MHC-Ap, which is related to HLA-H39 (Extended Data Fig. 2a). We observed expansion of MHC-A and MHC-B genes in both orangutan species (Extended Data Fig. 3a and Supplementary Figs. XI.38 and XI.39), with MHC-A exhibiting copy number variation with one or two copies and MHC-B duplicated in both haplotypes of each species. Similarly, both orangutan species showed loss of MHC-C on one haplotype but retained it on the other (Extended Data Fig. 3a, Supplementary Table XI.57 and Supplementary Figs. XI.38 and XI.39). All NHPs had a nearly identical set of MHC II loci, with the exception of the DRB locus, which is known to exhibit copy number variation in humans41, and here showed the same pattern among the apes (Extended Data Fig. 3b, Supplementary Table XI.58 and Supplementary Figs. XI.33–XI.40). We also observed two cases in which a MHC II locus was present as a functional gene on one haplotype and as a pseudogene on the other haplotype (for example, the Gogo-DQA2 locus in gorillas and the Poab-DPB1 locus in Sumatran orangutans). Annotation of additional MHC haplotypes from previously published genomes of chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and Sumatran orangutans42 revealed comparable structural variation among the MHC genes (Supplementary Tables XI.62–XI.65). Overall, this observed variation in MHC gene organization is consistent with long-term balancing selection41.

Given the deep coalescence of the MHC locus43, we performed a phylogenetic analysis with the complete ape sequences. We successfully constructed 1,906 gene trees encompassing 76% of the MHC region from the six ape species (Extended Data Fig. 3c). We identified 19 distinct topologies (Supplementary Note XI), with 3 representing 96% (1,830 out of 1,906) of the region and generally consistent with the species tree and predominant ILS patterns. The remaining 4% were discordant topologies that clustered within 200–500 kb regions (Supplementary Table XI.59) and corresponded to MHC I and II genes. We estimated coalescence times of these regions to range from 10 to 24 Ma between species and <1–14 Ma within species (Extended Data Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. XI.42). We next performed genome-wide tests of selection as described above. Selection signatures and nucleotide diversity in the MHC region were among the top 0.1% genome-wide. These signatures confirmed long-term balancing selection on MHC in multiple great ape lineages, including central and eastern chimpanzees, as well as at least two regions in MHC consistent with positive selection in bonobos and western chimpanzees43.

We identified at the sequence level all 26 large-scale chromosomal rearrangements originally described decades ago44 that karyotypically distinguish humans from other great apes (Supplementary Note XII, Supplementary Table XII.66 and Supplementary Fig. XII.43). However, during our breakpoint characterization of known inversions, we identified several events that seemed to be more complex and seemed to be the result of serial inversion events (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. XII.43). As an example, we identified a 4.8 Mb fixed inverted transposition on chromosome 18 in gorillas (Fig. 3a–c) that was incorrectly classified as a simple inversion but more likely to be explained by three consecutive inversions specific to the gorilla lineage transposing this gene-rich segment to 12.5 Mb downstream (Fig. 3a–c). Similarly, the complex organization of orangutan chromosome 2 (human chromosome 3 (HSA3)) can be explained through a model of serial inversions that required three inversions and one centromere repositioning event (evolutionary neocentromere (ENC)) to create Bornean orangutan chromosome 2, and four inversions and one ENC for Sumatran orangutan (Fig. 3d,e). In addition to known events, complete sequencing of SDs in the ape genomes revealed hundreds of previously undescribed inversions. Focusing on events larger than 10 kb, we curated 1,140 interspecific inversions, of which 522 are newly discovered7,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66 (Supplementary Table XII.67). For a fairer comparison with previous inversion calls, we also computed recall rates (<1 Mb) and found that 69.3% (79 out of 114) of the previously reported inversions were confirmed here. Among the 35 cases we missed, 24 corresponded to changes in inversion breakpoints, which were actually recalled and better resolved in this study, nine represented individual differences or previous error, and for the remaining two, our inversion call missed smaller nested inversions. An assessment of the genotypes of the inversion calls revealed that 632 were homozygous (in both assembled ape haplotypes), with the remainder present in only one out of the two ape haplotypes and were therefore probably polymorphisms. In total, 416 inversions had an annotated gene mapping to at least 1 of the breakpoints, with 724 apparently devoid of protein-coding genes (Supplementary Table XII.67). Of these inversions, 63.5% (724 out of 1,140) had annotated human SDs at one or both ends of the inversion, a result that represents a significant 4.1-fold enrichment (one-sided, simulation empirical P < 0.001). The strongest signal was for inverted SDs mapping to the breakpoints (6.2-fold; one-sided, simulation empirical P < 0.001), which suggested that non-allelic homologous recombination is driving many of these events. We also observed significant enrichment of previously unknown transcripts (Supplementary Table VIII.35) at the breakpoints of the inversions of African great apes (one-sided, simulation empirical P < 0.036). We parsimoniously assigned >64% of homozygous inversions to the ape phylogeny (Supplementary Fig. XII.45), with the remaining inversions predicted to be recurrent. The number of inversions assigned to each branch, based on maximum parsimony, correlated with the length of the branch (linear regression, R2 = 0.77), with the greatest number assigned to the siamang lineage (n = 44). However, the human lineage showed fivefold less than the expected number of inversions based on the branch length, and the trend still held when using the Bornean orangutan as a reference instead of human.

SDs are shown with blue rectangles. b, Experimental validation of the gorilla chromosome 18 inverted transposition using FISH with probes pA (CH276-36H14) and pB (CH276-520C10), which overlap in human metaphase chromosomes. The transposition moves the red pB probe further away from the green pA probe in gorillas, resulting in two distinct signals. FISH on metaphase chromosomes using probe pC (RP11-481M14) confirmed the location of a new inversion to the terminal end of the short arm of PAB chromosome 2. Each FISH experiment was repeated three times, and ten metaphase spreads with the corresponding fluorochromes were captured for each experiment.

Because rapidly evolving regions can help pinpoint genes under positive selection42 or cis-regulatory elements undergoing functional changes67, we applied a mutation-counting approach to identify ancestor quickly evolved regions (AQERs) that diverged during ape evolution67 (Supplementary Note XIII). These AQERs are the most divergent regions of the genome and do not consider mutation rate differences (for example, tandem repeats or GC bias). Therefore, AQERs are essentially agnostic to the underlying force, or forces, of divergence. We identified 13,128 AQERs (Supplementary Tables XIII.68–XIII.74) across 4 primate lineages, including 3,268 on the human branch (that is, HAQERs). Our analysis more than doubles the number of HAQERs identified from previous gapped primate assemblies (n = 1,581; Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. XIII.46). Such elements were highly enriched in repetitive DNA (for example, 5-fold for SDs P < 1 × 10–30, 2-fold for simple repeats P < 1 × 10–30 one-sided binomial test). HAQERs also exhibited a significant enrichment for bivalent chromatin states (repressing and activating epigenetic marks) across diverse tissues, and the strongest enrichment was observed for the bivalent promoter state (3-fold enrichment, P < 1 × 10–30 one-sided binomial test; Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table XIII.68). This signal was present to a lesser degree on the chimpanzee, bonobo and gorilla lineages (1.3-fold, 1.5-fold and 1.4-fold, respectively; P < 1 × 10–19, P < 1 × 10–30 and P < 1 × 10–12, respectively, one-sided binomial test). This reduced enrichment may be due to the chromatin-state differences between human cell lines and tissues (Supplementary Note XIII). An example of a human-specific HAQER change included an exon and a potential cis-regulatory element in ADCYAP1 (which encodes adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide 1), which is expressed in layer 5 extratelencephalic projecting neurons of the primary motor cortex. This gene shows convergent downregulation in the speech-related motor cortex in humans and the analogous vocal-learning extratelencephalic projection neurons necessary for speech and song production in songbirds68,69. Here we found downregulation in layer 5 neurons of humans relative to macaques (single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)) and an associated distinct human epigenetic signature (hypermethylation and decreased ATAC–seq) in the middle HAQER of the gene that was not observed in the same type of neurons of macaques, marmosets or mice (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Figs. XIII.47 and XIII.48).

a, Left, HAQER sets identified in gapped (GRCh38) and T2T assemblies show enrichments for bivalent gene regulatory elements across 127 cell types and tissues, with the strongest enrichment observed in the set of HAQERs shared between the two analyses. Right, the tendency for HAQERs to occur in bivalent regulatory elements (defined using human cells and tissues) is less strong in the sets of bonobo, chimpanzee and gorilla AQERs. n = 127 biologically independent samples for each chromatin state. Boxes show the interquartile range and median, with whiskers showing data points within 1.5 times the s.d. b, HAQERs in the vocal-learning-associated gene ADCYAP1, marked as containing alternative promoters near transcription start site (TSS) peaks of the FANTOM5 CAGE analysis, candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from ENCODE and enhancers (ATAC–seq peaks). For the latter, humans have a unique methylated region in layer 5 extratelencephalic projection neurons of the primary motor cortex. Tracks (blue for human, green for macaque) are modified from the UCSC Genome Browser118 above the HAQER annotations and the comparative epigenome browser119 below the HAQER annotations. For the NCBI RefSeq annotations, GCF_000001405.40-RS_2023_10 release (11 October 2024) was used. For CpG islands, islands <300 bp are in light green.

We also applied a gene-based analysis (TOGA, a tool to infer orthologues from genome alignments) that focused on the loss or gain of orthologous sequences in the human lineage70 (Supplementary Note XIV). TOGA identified 6 candidate genes from a set of 19,244 primate genes as largely restricted to humans (absent in >80% of the other NHPs; Supplementary Table XIV.75). Among the candidates was a processed gene, FOXO3B, present in humans and gorillas and the paralogue of which, FOXO3A, has been implicated in human longevity71. Although FOXO3B is expressed, its study has been challenging to study because it is embedded in a large, highly identical SD that mediates Smith–Magenis deletion syndrome (Supplementary Fig. XIV.50). Although extensive functional studies will be required to characterize the hundreds of candidates we identified, we release an integrated genomic (Supplementary Table V.24) and genic (Supplementary Table V.25) callset of accelerated regions for future investigation.

To facilitate downstream analyses with these genomes, we developed a UCSC Browser hub (https://github.com/marbl/T2T-Browser) that includes the underlying genome-wide alignments, gene annotations, accelerated regions and repeats, among other parameters (Data availability). We augmented this browser with additional tracks to be used in future studies and follow-up papers. For example, we mapped Repli-seq, including previously collected NHP datasets72, to investigate evolutionary patterns of replication timing and identified 20 distinct states of replication timing that can now be correlated with different genomic features (Supplementary Figs. XVII.54 and XVII.55). Because they can interfere with mitochondrial DNA annotation, we created a curated set of integrated nuclear sequences of mitochondrial DNA origin (NUMTs) in ape genomes (Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Note IX). We observed a substantial gain in the number (3.7–10.5%) and total length of NUMTs (6.2–30%) (Supplementary Table IX.51) compared to non-T2T assemblies. We also identified and annotated a nearly complete catalogue of sequence motifs capable of forming non-canonical (non-B) DNA (G-quadruplexes, A-phased, direct, mirror, inverted and short tandem repeats in particular), especially in previously inaccessible regions that have been historically difficult to sequence73 (Supplementary Note XV and Supplementary Table II.12). We overlaid these data with a multiscale epigenomic map of the apes, including DNA methylation and replication timing (Supplementary Notes XVI–XVII). Using the 5-methylcytosine DNA signature from long-read sequencing data, for example, we distinguished hypomethylated and hypermethylated promoters associated with gene expression and demonstrated that in each cell type, the majority (about 88%) of promoters were consistently methylated (8,174 orthologous ape genes assessed; Supplementary Tables XVI.76 and XVI.77 and Supplementary Fig. XVI.52). The analysis identified on average about 12% of promoters that were variably methylated among species (1,035 for fibroblast cell lines and 922 lymphoblast cell lines) as candidates for regulatory differences among the species (Supplementary Tables XVI.76 and XVI.77). Consistently, methylated promoters were associated with more highly expressed genes and had a higher density of CpG sites compared with variably methylated promoters (P < 10−16 two-sided Mann–Whitney U-test; Supplementary Fig. XVI.52), a result that highlights the association between the evolution of CpG sequences, methylomes and transcriptomes. These annotations will facilitate future investigations to understand genome evolution and epigenetic changes associated with gene-expression changes in ape genomes74,75.

In addition to these improved insights into genes, repeats and diversity, the contiguity afforded by the complete genomes enabled more systematic investigations of regions typically excluded from previous reference genomes and evolutionary analyses. Here we highlight four of the most notable regions: acrocentrics, centromeres, subterminal heterochromatic caps and lineage-specific SDs.

The human acrocentric chromosomes (13, 14, 15, 21 and 22) contain nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) that encode the rRNA components of the 60S and 40S subunits. The precise sequences of human NORs and the surrounding heterochromatin of the short arms were only recently elucidated in the first T2T human genome9. Human acrocentric chromosomes typically contain a single NOR with a head-to-tail rDNA array that is uniformly transcribed in the direction of the centromere. Each NOR is preceded by a distal junction (DJ) region that extends approximately 400 kb upstream of the rDNA array containing a 230 kb palindrome (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Note XVIII and Supplementary Fig. XVIII.58) that encodes a long ncRNA associated with nucleolar function76. The NOR is flanked by a variable patchwork of satellites and SDs. Heterologous recombination is thought to occur here, as well as within the rDNA array itself, to maintain NOR homology through the action of concerted evolution77.

a, Sequence identity heatmaps and satellite annotations for the NOR+ short arms of both HSA22 haplotypes across all the great apes and siamang chromosome 21 (the only NOR+ chromosome in siamang) drawn with ModDotPlot120. The short-arm telomere is oriented at the top of the plot, with the entirety of the short arm drawn to scale up to but not including the centromeric α-satellite. Heatmap colours indicate self-similarity in the chromosome, and large blocks indicate tandem repeat arrays (rDNA and satellites) with their corresponding annotations given in between. Human is represented by the diploid HG002 genome. b, Estimated number of rDNA units per haplotype for each species. HSA chromosome numbers are given in the first column, with the exception of s-21 for siamang chromosome 21, which is NOR+ but has no single human homologue. c, Sum of satellite and rDNA sequences across all short arms for which one haplotype is NOR+ in each species. ‘Unlabelled' indicates sequences without a satellite annotation, which mostly comprise SDs. The total number of SD bases is given for comparison, with some overlap between regions annotated as SDs and satellites. Colours for sequence classes are as for a. d, Top tracks, chromosome 22 in the T2T-CHM13v2.0 reference genome displaying various gene-annotation metrics and the satellite annotation. Bottom tracks, for each primate haplotype, including the human HG002 genome, the chromosome that best matches each 10 kb window of T2T-CHM13 chromosome 22 is colour coded, as determined by MashMap121. On the right side of the centromere (towards the long arm), HSA22 is syntenic across all species; however, on the short arm, synteny rapidly degrades, with very few regions mapping uniquely to a single chromosome, a result reflective of extensive recombination on the short arms. Even the human HG002 genome does not consistently align to T2T-CHM13 chromosome 22 in the most distal (left-most) regions. acro, acrocentric; mat, maternal; pat, paternal.

One conspicuous observation confirmed by our assemblies is that the ape NORs exist on different chromosomes for each species (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. XVIII.59). For example, HSA15 is NOR-bearing (NOR+) in humans but not in chimpanzees or bonobos (NOR–), whereas HSA18 is NOR+ in both chimpanzees and bonobos, but NOR– in humans78 (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. XVIII.59). Among great apes, we found that the total number of NORs per haploid genome varied from as few as two in gorilla to ten in both orangutan species, whereas the siamang maternal genome sequenced here harboured only a single NOR (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. XVIII.59). NORs were also identified on both orangutan and siamang Y chromosomes11, and partial DJ fragments on the chimpanzee and bonobo Y chromosomes (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. XVIII.59), which suggests that their ancestral Y chromosome may have been NOR+. With the exception of rRNA genes, all ape NOR+ chromosome short-arms were typically satellite-rich and gene-poor (Fig. 5c,d), with the NORs restricted to the end of an autosomal short-arm or the end of a Y chromosome long-arm. However, we identified multiple acrocentric chromosomes with heterochromatic sequences on their short arm, but without a NOR (for example, gorilla HSA2A, HSA9, HSA13, HSA15 and HSA18). Unlike the NOR+ acrocentrics, these NOR– acrocentrics carried multiple predicted protein-coding genes on their short arms. Thus, short-arm heterochromatin is strongly associated with ape NORs although not always predictive of their presence.

The estimated rDNA copy number per array varied from 1 on Bornean orangutan chromosome Y to 287 on chimpanzee HSA21, and the total diploid rDNA copy number similarly varied from 343 in siamangs to 1,142 in chimpanzees (Fig. 5b, Supplementary Note XVIII, Supplementary Table XVIII.78 and Supplementary Fig. XVIII.59). The total rDNA copy number varied widely between individual NOR+ haplotypes of the same species as expected, but within the range of human variation. For example, a recent analysis of 10 human genomes estimated that the total rDNA copy number ranged from 532 to 683, with individual chromosomes showing more than 10-fold variation (for example, 22–260 rDNA copies on chromosome 14)79. Heterozygous NOR loss was observed in bonobo HSA21 and Sumatran orangutan HSA13, both of which were mediated by a truncation of the chromosome before the typical NOR location (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. XVIII.59). The structure and composition of both satellites and SDs varied considerably among the apes, as well as between chromosomes and haplotypes within individuals (Fig. 5a,c and Supplementary Fig. XVIII.60). The orangutan acrocentrics were dominated by human satellite 3 (HSat3) and α-satellites compared with the more balanced satellite composition of the other apes. Gorillas were notable for the presence of double NORs on both haplotypes of HSA22, with the additional NORs inverted relative to the first and including a complete DJ but only a single, inactive rDNA unit (Supplementary Fig. XVIII.61).

At the chromosome level, the high level of synteny on the long arms of the NOR+ chromosomes rapidly degraded when transitioning to the short arm, with almost no sequence aligning uniquely between different ape species (Fig. 5d). Even the haplotypes of a single human genome aligned best to different reference chromosomes on their distal ends, a result that supports previous observations of extensive heterologous recombination77. Despite their widespread structural variation, the ape NOR+ chromosomes shared common features such as homogeneous rDNA arrays containing highly conserved rRNA genes. We extracted representative rDNA units from each assembly to serve as a reference for each species and confirmed a similar sequence structure, including the presence of a central microsatellite region in the intergenic spacer sequence for all species (Supplementary Fig. XVIII.62), but with relatively high nucleotide substitution rates outside the >99% identical 18S and 5.8S coding regions (Supplementary Fig. XVIII.63). Notably, certain species contained more variation in the rDNA units than others, which is explained by the fact that units in the same array tended to seem more similar than units in different arrays, and species have different numbers of NORs (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. XVIII.64). This result is likely to be due to the increased prevalence of unequal crossing over of homogenizing units in an array compared to gene conversions or crossover of homogenizing units between arrays80,81. Despite its conserved colinear structure, the nucleotide identity of the intergenic spacer varied from 95.2% for humans compared to bonobos to just 80.6% for humans compared to siamangs (considering only single-nucleotide variants; Supplementary Table XVIII.79). The DJ sequence was conserved across all great apes and present as a single copy per NOR, including the palindromic structure typical of the human DJ, with the exception of siamangs, which contained only one-half of the palindrome on each haplotype but in opposite orientations on both haplotypes of chromosome 21 (Supplementary Fig. XVIII.65). The transcriptional direction of all rDNA arrays was consistent in each species, with the chimpanzee and bonobo arrays inverted relative to human arrays (Fig. 5a). This inversion included the entire DJ sequence, a result that confirms previous fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses showing that the chimpanzee DJ had been relocated to the centromeric side of the rDNA array76. Our comparative analysis supports the idea that the DJ is a functional component of ape NORs that is consistently positioned upstream of rRNA gene transcription rather than distally on the chromosome arm.

The assembly of five NHP genomes enabled us to assess the sequence, structure and evolution of centromeric regions at base-pair resolution. Using these assemblies, we identified 227 contiguous centromeres out of a possible 230 centromeres across five NHPs, each of which were composed of tandemly repeating α-satellite DNA organized into higher-order repeats (HORs) belonging to one or more α-satellite suprachromosomal families (SFs) (Fig. 6, Supplementary Note XIX and Supplementary Fig. XIX.66). In specific primate lineages, different SFs have risen to high frequency, such as SF5 in orangutans and SF3 in gorillas. We carefully assessed the assembly of each of these centromeres, checking for collapses, false duplications and misjoins (Supplementary Note XIX, ‘Validation of centromeric regions'), and found that approximately 85% of bonobo, 69% of chimpanzee, 54% of gorilla, 63% of Bornean orangutan, but only 27% of Sumatran orangutan centromeres were complete and correctly assembled (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. XIX.66). Most of the assembly errors were few (about two per centromere haplotype, on average) and typically involved a few 100 kb of centromere satellite sequence that still needs further work to resolve.

The sequence and structure of all completely assembled centromeres is shown in Supplementary Fig. XIX.66. b, Variation in the length of the α-satellite HOR arrays for NHP centromeres. Bonobo centromeres have a bimodal length distribution, with 28 chromosomes showing minicentromeres (with α-satellite HOR arrays <700 kb long); two-tailed Mann–Whitney test, *P < 0.05; NS, not significant (compared to human, *P = 0.044, P = 0.103, *P = 0.0001, P = 0.287 and *P = 0.0099 for bonobo, chimpanzee, gorilla, Bornean and Sumatran orangutans, respectively). c, Correlation between the length of the bonobo active α-satellite HOR array and the length of the CDR for the same chromosome. d, Example showing that bonobo and chimpanzee chromosome 1 centromeres are divergent in size despite being from orthologous chromosomes. e, Sequence identity heatmap between the chromosome 17 centromeres from bonobo and chimpanzee show a common origin of sequence as well as the birth of new α-satellite HORs in the chimpanzee lineage. f, Sequence identity heatmap between chromosome 5 centromeres from the Bornean and Sumatran orangutans show highly similar sequence and structure, except for one pocket of α-satellite HORs that is only present in the Bornean orangutan. For d–f, data are for haplotype 1.

Focusing on the completely assembled centromeres, we identified several characteristics specific to each primate species. First, bonobo centromeric α-satellite HOR arrays were on average 0.65-fold the length of human centromeric α-satellite HOR arrays and 0.74-fold the length of its sister species the chimpanzee (Fig. 6b). A closer examination of bonobo α-satellite HOR array lengths revealed that they were bimodally distributed, with approximately half of the bonobo centromeres (27 out of 48) with an α-satellite HOR array with a mean length of 110 kb (range of 15–674 kb) and the rest (21 out of 48) with a mean length of 3.6 Mb (range of 1.6–6.7 Mb; Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. XIX.67). The bimodal distribution persisted in both sets of bonobo haplotypes. This >450-fold variation in bonobo α-satellite HOR array length has not yet been observed in any other primate species and implies that there is a wide range of centromeric structures and sizes compatible with centromere function. Indeed, no ‘minicentromere' arrays have been observed in chimpanzees, despite its recent speciation from bonobo (about 1.7 Ma; Fig. 6d).

As previously noted82, we confirmed that chimpanzee α-satellite HOR arrays were consistently smaller: 0.86-fold the length of their human counterparts (Fig. 6a). Moreover, chimpanzee centromeres were typically composed of a single α-satellite HOR array flanked by short stretches of divergent α-satellite HORs and monomeric sequences, which were interspersed with transposable elements before extending into the p arm and q arm (Fig. 6d). By contrast, gorilla α-satellite HOR arrays were on average 1.58-fold larger than human arrays (Fig. 6a,b), and unlike for bonobos and chimpanzees, they were composed of punctuated regions of α-satellite HORs or regions of α-satellite HORs that have high sequence identity in them but much lower sequence identity with neighbouring regions, flanked by larger transition zones to monomeric α-satellite sequences. Gorilla centromeres showed a high degree of haplotypic variation, with many paternal and maternal centromeres varying in size, sequence and structure. We found that 30.4% (7 out of 23) gorilla α-satellite HOR array pairs varied in size by >1.5-fold (especially HSA1, HSA2a, HSA4, HSA10, HSA15, HSA18 and HSA19), and 9 out of 23 pairs (around 39.1%) had α-satellite HOR arrays with >5% sequence divergence between homologues (HSA1, HSA4–HSA6, HSA10–HSA12, HSA15 and HSA19). Finally, the Bornean and Sumatran orangutan α-satellite HOR arrays were among the largest (1.52-fold and 2.11-fold larger on average, respectively, than humans; Fig. 6b) and were characterized by multiple pockets of divergent α-satellite HORs. A typical Bornean or Sumatran orangutan centromere had three or four distinct pockets of α-satellite HORs, with up to nine distinct HOR arrays observed in a single centromere (Bornean chromosome 19).

Congeneric species of Pan (chimpanzee and bonobo) and Pongo (orangutans) present an opportunity to assess the evolution of centromeric α-satellites over relatively shorter evolutionary time periods. Comparisons of the centromeric α-satellite HOR arrays from orthologous chromosomes across the bonobo and chimpanzee genomes revealed, for example, that 56% of them (14 out of 25 centromeres, including both X and Y) shared a common identifiable ancestral sequence, such as that present in HSA17 (Fig. 6e). On this chromosome, the entire bonobo α-satellite HOR array was 92–99% identical to one domain of α-satellite HORs present in the chimpanzee centromere. However, the chimpanzee centromere contained a second domain of α-satellite HORs that spanned approximately half of the α-satellite HOR array. This domain was <70% identical to bonobo α-satellite HORs, which indicated that the formation of a new α-satellite HOR array subregion was acquired in the chimpanzee lineage. Thus, in the short evolutionary time since bonobo and chimpanzee divergence (1–2 Ma), a new α-satellite HOR had arisen and expanded to become the predominant HOR that distinguishes these two closely related species (Fig. 6e). Given the shorter speciation time of orangutan (0.9 Ma), α-satellite HOR evolution was more tractable, with α-satellite HORs sharing >97% sequence identity, including domains with 1-to-1 correspondence. However, in about one-fifth of orangutan centromeres, we identified stretches of α-satellite HORs present in Bornean but not Sumatran orangutans (or vice versa). The emergence of lineage-specific α-satellite HOR sequences occurring on five chromosomes (HSA4, HSA5, HSA10, HSA11 and HSA16; Fig. 6f) marked by extremely high sequence identity (>99%) between α-satellite HOR arrays indicates the rapid turnover and homogenization of newly formed orangutan α-satellite HORs.

We leveraged the more complete NHP assemblies to assess the location and distribution of the putative centromere kinetochore. This is a large, proteinaceous structure that binds centromeric chromatin and mediates the segregation of chromosomes to daughter cells during mitosis and meiosis83,84. Previous studies of both humans9 and NHPs82,85 have shown that centromeres typically contain one kinetochore site, marked by one or more stretches of hypomethylated CpG dinucleotides termed the centromere dip region (CDR)86. We carefully assessed the CpG methylation status of all 237 primate centromeres and found that all contained at least one region of hypomethylation, consistent with a single kinetochore site. Focusing on the bonobo centromeres, we found a bimodal distribution in α-satellite HOR array length (Fig. 6b), in which the CDR length and centromere length correlated (linear regression, R2 = 0.41). In other words, the bonobo minicentromeres tended to associate with smaller CDRs compared with larger centromeres (Fig. 6c). Although more in-depth functional studies need to be performed, this finding indicates that the reduced α-satellite HOR arrays in bonobos are effectively limiting the distribution of the functional component of the centromere.

In addition to centromeres, we completely sequenced and assembled the subterminal heterochromatic caps of siamangs, chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas (Fig. 7a and Extended Data Fig. 1). In total, the subterminal satellites accounted for 1.05 Gb (270.0, 261.6 and 522.9 Mb of chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas, respectively, or 4–7%) of the genome (Supplementary Note XX). In the case of siamangs, 642 Mb (10.1%) of the genome was made up of subterminal satellites (Extended Data Fig. 1). These large structures (up to 26 Mb in length) are thought to be composed almost entirely of tandem repetitive DNA: a 32 bp AT-rich satellite sequence, termed pCht7 in Pan and gorilla, or a 171 bp α-satellite repeat present in a subset of gibbon species87,88,89. Although their function is unknown, these chromosomal regions have been associated with late replication90 and implicated in nonhomologous chromosome exchange and unique features of telomeric RNA metabolism91,92. Our analysis indicated that we successfully sequenced 79 gapless subterminal caps in gorillas (average length = 6.6 Mb) and 57 and 46 caps in chimpanzees and bonobos, including both haplotypes (average lengths of 4.8 and 5.2 Mb, respectively) with less than 3.8% of pCht arrays flagged as potentially misassembled (Fig. 7a). Siamangs possessed the largest (average length 6.7 Mb) and most abundant subterminal satellite blocks (96 out of 100 chromosomal ends across the two haplotypes). Compared with the data reported for the sex chromosomes for gorillas and siamangs (8.6 and 7.4 Mb, respectively), autosomal subterminal caps were more comparable in length (7.3 and 7.7 Mb, respectively). By contrast, for chimpanzees and bonobos, both the distribution and length of the heterochromatic caps significantly differed between autosomes and sex chromosomes. For example, we previously detected pCht subterminal arrays on the p arm of chimpanzees and the q arm of bonobo chromosome X, but in autosomes, the caps were much less prevalent in q arms. Moreover, in the Pan lineage, the average length of the subterminal repeat arrays were overall much longer on the autosomes for both chimpanzees and bonobos (5.3 and 6.6 Mb, respectively) compared with the sex chromosomes (0.66 and 2.2 Mb, respectively). Integration of replication-timing data confirmed that the subterminal caps in gorillas were late replicating, and there was a significant difference in terms of replication between gorilla chromosomes with and without subterminal heterochromatic caps (Supplementary Figs. XVII.56 and XVII.57).

The top shows a StainedGlass alignment plot indicating pairwise identity between 2-kb-binned sequences, followed by the higher order structure of subterminal satellite units, as well as the composition of the hyperexpanded spacer sequence and the methylation status across the 25 kb upstream or downstream areas of the spacer midpoint. The average per cent of CpG methylation is indicated as a blue line, and the band of lighter blue represents the s.d. of the methylation. d, Size distribution of spacer sequences identified between subterminal satellite arrays. e, Methylation profile of the subterminal spacer SD sequences compared to the interstitial orthologue copy.

In gorillas and the Pan lineage, the caps were organized into higher order structures, whereby pCht subterminal satellites formed tracts of average length of 335–536 kb interrupted by spacer SD sequences of a modal length of 32 kb (Pan) or 34 kb (gorilla; Supplementary Fig. XX.68). The spacer sequences were each specific to the Pan and gorilla lineages, but we confirmed that each began originally as a euchromatic sequence that became duplicated interstitially in the common ancestor of human and African apes. For example, the 34 kb spacer in gorillas mapped to a single copy sequence present in orangutans and HSA10, which began to be duplicated interstitially on chromosome 7 in chimpanzee but only in gorilla did it become associated with pCht satellites, expanding to over 477 haploid copies as part of the formation of the heterochromatic cap. Similarly, the ancestral sequence of the Pan lineage spacer mapped syntenically to orangutan and HSA9. The ancestral sequence duplicated to multiple regions in gorilla (q arms of chromosomes 4, 5, 8 and X, and p arms of chromosomes 2A and 2B), before being captured and hyperexpanded (>345 copies) to form the structure of subterminal satellites of chimpanzees and bonobos. Analyses of CpG methylation showed that each spacer demarcated a pocket of hypomethylation flanked by hypermethylated pCht arrays within the cap (Fig. 7b–d). Of note, this characteristic hypomethylation pattern was not observed at the ancestral origin or interstitially duplicated locations (Fig. 7e), which suggested an epigenetic feature not determined solely by sequence but by its association with the subterminal heterochromatic caps. Similar to the great apes, we found evidence of a hypomethylated spacer sequence also present in the siamang subterminal cap; however, its modal length was much larger (57.2 kb in length) and its periodicity was less uniform, occurring every 750 kb (Supplementary Fig. XX.69). Nevertheless, the fact that these similar epigenetic features of the spacer evolved independently may suggest a functional role with respect to subterminal heterochromatic caps.

Compared with previous read-depth-based approaches that simply estimated copy numbers of SDs93,94, T2T genomes increase the SD content and resolve sequence structures, which enabled us to distinguish SDs that are previously unknown by location and composition in each species (Supplementary Fig. XXI.70). Nonhuman great ape genomes generally contained more SDs (Fig. 8a) compared to humans (around 192 versus an average of 215 Mb in the other great apes); however, they were comparable when normalized by the genome size. We also found that the assemblies of great apes on average had the highest SD content (208 Mb per haplotype) compared to non-ape lineages42,95: assemblies of mouse lemur, gelada, marmoset, owl monkey and macaque (68.8–161 Mb; Fig. 8a, Supplementary Note XXI, Supplementary Table XXI.80 and Supplementary Fig. XXI.72). In contrast to our previous analysis96, orangutans showed the greatest number of SDs (225.3 Mb per haplotype) compared to African great apes (204.3 Mb per haplotype), which also exhibited larger interspersion of intrachromosomal SDs (Fig. 8b and Supplementary Fig. XXI.73). The increased SD content in orangutans is due to a greater number of acrocentric chromosomes (ten versus five on average for other apes) and a preponderance of clustered duplications. Consistent with the expansion of Asian great ape SDs, we found the largest number of lineage-specific SDs in the Pongo lineage (100.1 Mb), followed by gorilla-specific and human-specific SDs (69.5 and 41.9 Mb, respectively; Supplementary Table XXI.81 and Supplementary Fig. XXI.74). Many SDs (79.3–95.6 Mb per haplotype) in orangutans constituted massive, megabase-scale SD clusters, including a mixture of tandem and inverted duplications up to 21.5 Mb in size; in other species, the total number of such clustered duplications accounted for only 30–40 Mb per haplotype (except bonobos). In general, the number of SDs assigned to different lineages correlated with branch length (linear regression, R2 = 0.927; Supplementary Fig. XXI.75), with the exception of siamangs and some ancestral nodes reflecting the great ape expansion of SDs96. We further assessed the variability of SDs within species by comparing two haplotypes and found that 30–37% were variable or polymorphic, with the exception of gorillas, which showed reduced variability (26.5%). For Sumatran orangutans and siamangs, 42–50% were predicted to be variable based on the comparison of the two haplotypes (Supplementary Figs. XXI.76 and XXI.77). A much larger survey of individuals from each species, however, will need to be assessed to more accurately classify fixed versus polymorphic SDs in each species.

Leveraging the increased sensitivity afforded by FLNC Iso-Seq, we annotated the transcriptional content of lineage-specific SDs and identified hundreds of potential new genes, including gene family expansions often occurring in conjunction with chromosomal evolutionary rearrangements. We highlight here two examples in more detail. First, at two of the breakpoints of a 30 Mb double inversion of gorilla chromosome 1, we identified a gorilla-specific expansion of the genes MAPKBP1 and SPTBN5 as well as PLA2G4B–JMJD7 (Fig. 8c–e) originating from an interchromosomal SD from ancestral loci mapping to HSA15 (duplicated in other chromosomes in chimpanzees and bonobos; Supplementary Table VIII.38). We estimated that these duplications occurred early after gorilla speciation 6.1 Ma (Supplementary Fig. XXI.77a), followed by subsequent expansion that resulted in the addition of eight copies (one truncated) mapping to two of the breakpoints of the double inversion. Investigation of the Iso-Seq transcript model of this gene revealed that five of the new gorilla copies are supported by multi-exon transcripts. Two of these additional copies possessed valid start and stop codons spanning at least 70% of the homologous single-copy orthologue gene in humans (Fig. 8e and Supplementary Fig. XXI.77a). Notably, the ancestral copy of this gene in gorillas (HSA15q) is highly truncated (40% of original protein), which suggested that the new chromosome 1 copies may have assumed and refined the function.

Second, in orangutan, we found a restructured 20 Mb region corresponding to the Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS)63 region and the 15q13 microdeletion syndrome97 region in humans (Supplementary Fig. XXI.78). This included a massive 6.8–10.8 Mb expansion of clustered tandem and inverted duplications mapping distally to breakpoint 1 of PWS as well as smaller 200–550 kb expansions of GOLGA6 and GOLGA8 repeats distal to PWS breakpoints 3 and 4 (Fig. 8f). We estimated that the larger region alone is composed of 87–111 copies of fragments of GOLGA6, GOLGA8, HERC2 and MCTP2. We found Iso-Seq transcript support for 37–39 distinct orangutan copies. Using GOLGA8 as a marker, we confirmed that it had expanded to 10–12 copies (>70% of original length) in orangutan but exists as a single copy in gorillas and bonobos and in two copies (GOLGA8A and GOLGAB) in humans out of multiple GOLGA8 genes, retaining at least 70% of the sequence compared to orangutans (Fig. 8f,g and Supplementary Fig. XXI.77b). We estimated that the Pongo expansion of GOLGA8 occurred 7.3 Ma (Supplementary Fig. XXI.77b), long before the species diverged. After alignment of the translated peptide sequence, we observed 17.1–23.7% divergence from the human copy (GOLGA8A; Fig. 8g). Based on studies of the African great ape genomes and humans, GOLGA8 was among more than a dozen loci defined as ‘core duplicons' that promoted the interspersion of SDs and genomic instability through palindromic repeat structures31,98. Our findings extend this recurrent genomic feature for the GOLGA8 duplicons to the Asian ape genomes.

The complete sequencing of the ape genomes analysed in this study significantly refines previous analyses and provides a valuable resource for all future evolutionary comparisons. These include an improved and more nuanced understanding of species divergence, human-specific ancestral alleles, incomplete lineage sorting, gene annotation, repeat content, divergent regulatory DNA and complex genic regions as well as species-specific epigenetic differences involving methylation. These preliminary analyses revealed hundreds of new candidate genes and regions to account for phenotypic differences among the apes. For example, we observed an excess of HAQERS corresponding to bivalent promoters thought to contain gene-regulatory elements that exhibit precise spatiotemporal activity patterns in the context of development and environmental response99. Bivalent chromatin-state enrichments have not yet been observed in fast-evolving regions from other great apes, which may reflect limited cross-species transferability of epigenomic annotations from humans. The finding of a HAQER-enriched gene, ADCYAP1, that is differentially regulated in speech circuits and methylated in the layer 5 projection neurons that make the more specialized direct projections to brainstem motor neurons in humans shows the promise of T2T genomes to identify hard to sequence regions important for complex traits. Perhaps most notably, we provide an evolutionary framework for understanding the about 10–15% of highly divergent, previously inaccessible regions of ape genomes. In this regard, we highlight a few noteworthy findings.

Comparative analyses suggest that expansion of SDs occurred in the common ancestor of the great ape lineage as opposed to the African great ape lineage as we originally proposed based on sequence read-depth analyses back to the human reference genome94,96. This discrepancy highlights the importance of ab initio genome assemblies of related lineages that are comparable in quality and contiguity. The assembly of the acrocentric chromosomes (of which orangutans have the maximum up to ten) and the resolution of massive (>10 Mb) tandem SDs in the orangutan species account for the increase in SD content among the Asian great apes. The African great ape lineage still stands out for having the largest fraction of interspersed SDs—a genomic architectural feature that promotes recurrent rearrangements that facilitate syndromic disease associated with autism and developmental delay in the human species100. A complete sequence resolution of NHP interspersed SDs provides a framework for understanding disease-causing copy number variants in these other NHP lineages101.

The short arms of NOR+ ape acrocentric chromosomes seemed specialized to encode rRNA genes. On the autosomes, ape NORs existed exclusively on the acrocentric chromosomes, embedded in a gene-poor and satellite-rich short arm. On the Y chromosome, NORs occurred occasionally towards the end of the chromosome and adjacent to satellites shared with other acrocentric chromosomes. Previous analyses of the human pangenome suggested that heterologous recombination between chromosomes with NORs is a mechanism for concerted evolution of the rRNA genes77,102. Our comparative analysis of ape genomes provides further support for this hypothesis. For example, the uniform direction of all rDNA arrays in a species would permit crossover recombination between heterologous chromosomes without substantial karyotypic consequence. However, rare translocations, mediated by the large SDs that commonly surround the NORs, have occurred during ape evolution, which has resulted in a different complement of NOR+ acrocentric chromosomes and possibly creating reproductive barriers associated with speciation103.

The number of lineage-specific duplications that encode transcripts and potential genes is now estimated at hundreds per ape lineage, often occurring at sites of evolutionary chromosomal rearrangements that have been historically difficult to resolve through sequencing (Supplementary Table XXI.81). Our analysis uncovered hundreds of fixed inversions frequently associated with the formation of these lineage-specific duplications. These findings challenge the predominant paradigm that subtle changes in regulatory DNA104 are the major mechanism underlying ape species differentiation. Rather, the expansion, contraction and restructuring of SDs lead to not only dosage differences but concurrent gene innovation and chromosomal structural changes105. Indeed, in the case of humans, four such gene family expansions, namely NOTCH2NL32, SRGAP2C29,30, ARHGAP11 (ref. 31) and TBC1D3 (refs. 106,107), have been functionally implicated over the past decade in the expansion of the frontal cortex of the human brain29,30,32,106 as well as human-specific chromosomal changes31. Detailed characterization of the various lineage-specific expansions in NHPs will be more challenging; however, it is clear that such SDRs are an underappreciated genic source of interspecific difference and potential gene neofunctionalization.

We identified several idiosyncratic features of centromere organization and structure that characterize the different ape lineages, significantly extending earlier observations based on the characterization of five select centromeres82. Perhaps the most notable is the bimodal distribution of centromere HOR length in the bonobo lineage, with 19 out of the 48 bonobo centromeres being less than 100 kb in size. Given the estimated divergence of the Pan lineage, such 300-fold reductions in size must have occurred recently, perhaps in the last million years. These bonobo minicentromeres seem to be fully functional, with a well-defined CDR (encompassing all of the α-satellite DNA). Thus, their discovery may provide a roadmap for the design of smaller, more streamlined artificial chromosomes for the delivery and stable transmission of new genetic information in human cells108.

Our analyses suggested that the subterminal chromosomal caps of chimpanzees, gorillas and siamangs have evolved independently to create multi-megabases of heterochromatin in each species. In chimpanzees and gorillas, we defined a common organization of a subterminal spacer (about 30 kb in size) that is hypomethylated and flanked by hypermethylated heterochromatic satellites with a periodicity of one spacer every 335–536 kb of satellite sequence (pCht satellite in hominoids and α-satellite in hylobatids). In each case, the spacer sequence differed in its origin but has arisen as an ancestral SD87 that has become integrated and expanded in the subterminal heterochromatin. In contrast to the ancestral sequences located in euchromatin, the spacer sequences embedded in the subterminal caps acquired more distinct hypomethylation signatures, which implicates an epigenetic feature. This subterminal hypomethylation pocket is reminiscent of the CDRs identified in centromeres that define the sites of kinetochore attachment109 as well as a methylation dip region observed among some acrocentric chromosomes110. It is tempting to speculate that the subterminal hypomethylation pocket may represent a site of protein binding or a punctuation mark, perhaps facilitating ectopic exchange and concerted evolution111. Although the function of these regions is unknown, we confirmed previous observations that subterminal heterochromatic caps are very late replicating (Supplementary Figs. XVII.56–XVII.57). A previous study111 of carboxy-terminal heterochromatic subterminal associations found evidence of ectopic exchanges and ‘post-bouquet' structure formation in sperm during the pachytene stage of meiosis. Late replication may help promote such exchange events, buffering the proximal unique sequence while simultaneously promoting concerted evolution among nonhomologous chromosomes.

Although the ape genomes sampled here are nearly complete, some limitations remain. Sequence gaps still exist in the acrocentric centromeres and a few other remaining complex regions where the largest and most identical tandem repeats reside. This is especially the case for the Sumatran orangutan centromeres, for which only 27% were completely assembled. The length (nearly double the size of the other apes) and the complex compound organization of orangutan α-satellite HOR sequence will require specialized efforts to completely order and orient these large tandem arrays82. The combination of HiFi reads to generate the high-quality assembly backbone and UL-ONT sequencing for scaffolding across the largest repeats was crucial for closure of most repeats, and it may be that even longer UL-ONT data coupled with new advances in ONT error correction112 would enable the longest tandem repeats in the Sumatran orangutan genome to be fully resolved. Nevertheless, with the exception of these and other large tandem repeat arrays, we estimate that about 99.5% of the content of each genome has been characterized and is correctly placed. Second, although we completed the genomes of a representative individual, we sequenced and assembled only two haplotypes from each of the 6 species, and more than 15 species or subspecies of apes remain113. Sampling more closely related species that diverged within the last million years will provide an opportunity to understand the evolutionary processes shaping the most dynamic regions of our genome. High-quality assemblies of all chimpanzee species114, as well as the numerous gibbon species115, will provide important insight into selection, effective population size and the rapid structural diversification of ape chromosomes at different time points. Finally, although high-quality genomes help eliminate reference bias, they do not eliminate annotation biases towards humans. This will be particularly crucial for understanding both the regulatory DNA that have rapidly diverged between the species and the function of the ape-specific genes that have emerged as a result of duplication.

A schematic of the T2T siamang genome highlighting segmental duplications (Intra SDs; blue), inverted duplications (InvDup; green), centromeric, subterminal and interstitial α-satellites (red), and other satellites (pink). Note the large blocks of alpha-satellite defining the siamang subterminal heterochromatic caps.

a) Annotated haplotypes of IGH, IGK, IGL, TRA/D, TRB, and TRG loci across four primate species and one human haplotype (HSA.h1 or T2T-CHM13). Each haplotype is shown as a line in the genome diagram where the top part shows positions of shared V genes (blue), species-specific V genes (red), D genes (orange), and J genes (green) and the bottom part shows segmental duplications (SDs) that were computed for a haplotype pair of the same species and depicted as dark blue rectangles. Human SDs were computed with respect to the GRCh38.p14 reference. Alignments between pairs in haplotypes are shown as links colored according to their percent identity values: from blue (< 90%) through yellow (99.5%) to red (100%). The bar plot on the right from each genome diagram shows counts of shared and species-specific V genes in each haplotype. b) Barplots showing the mean percentage of base pairs for each IG/TR locus covered by SDs computed between haplotypes of the same species and collected across five ape species; n = 9 haplotypes including 8 haplotypes of nonhuman ape species and the human T2T haplotype. Here and in panel c, error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals. c) Barplots showing length differences (%) computed for all ape IG/TR loci with respect to the corresponding human T2T locus; n = 8 haplotypes of nonhuman ape species. d) Counts of species-specific V genes vs. fractions of locus covered by long (≥ 10 kbp) repeats computed for IG/TR loci across five great ape species. Pearson's correlation and p-value (p = 6.95 × 10–5) are shown on the top of the plot.

a and b) show schematic representation of MHC locus organization for MHC-I and MHC-II genes, respectively, across the six ape haplotypes (PTR.h1/h2, PPA.h1/h2, GGO.h1/h2, PPY.h1/h2, PAB.h1/h2, SSY.h1/2) and human (HSA.h1). Only orthologs of functional human HLA genes are shown. Loci naming in apes follows human HLA gene names (HSA.h1) with the exception of Gogo-OKO that does not have a human homolog, and orthologs are represented in unique colors across haplotypes and species. Orthologous genes that lack a functional coding sequence are grayed out and their name marked with an asterisk. Two human HLA class I pseudogene (HLA-H, HLA-J) are shown, because functional orthologs of these genes were identified in some apes. c) Pairwise alignment of the 5.31 Mbp MHC region in the genome, with human gene annotations and MHC-I and MHC-II clusters. Below is the variation in phylogenetic tree topologies according to the position in the alignment. The x-axis is the relative coordinate for the MHC region and the y-axis shows topology categories for the trees constructed. The three prominent subregions with highly discordant topologies are shown through shaded boxes. Four subregions (1-4) used to calculate coalescence times are shown with dashed boxes. The phylogenetic tree includes the macaque genome (MFA)95 to better estimate the deep coalescence time observed at this locus. Numbers indicate time estimated in millions of years.

Metrics details

Over the past decade, photonics research has explored accelerated tensor operations, foundational to artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning1,2,3,4, as a path towards enhanced energy efficiency and performance5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. The field is centrally motivated by finding alternative technologies to extend computational progress in a post-Moore's law and Dennard scaling era15,16,17,18,19. Despite these advances, no photonic chip has achieved the precision necessary for practical AI applications, and demonstrations have been limited to simplified benchmark tasks. Here we introduce a photonic AI processor that executes advanced AI models, including ResNet3 and BERT20,21, along with the Atari deep reinforcement learning algorithm originally demonstrated by DeepMind22. This processor achieves near-electronic precision for many workloads, marking a notable entry for photonic computing into competition with established electronic AI accelerators23 and an essential step towards developing post-transistor computing technologies.

An unprecedented dataset of high resolution anatomical images of individual cells in mouse visual cortex, mapped on to their responses. This integrated view of function and structure lays a foundation for discovering the computational bases of cortical circuits.

9 April 2025

A cubic millimetre might not sound like much — roughly the size of a grain of sand — but to neuroscientists, it is enormous. One cubic millimetre of a mammalian brain contains tens of thousands of neurons with hundreds of millions of connections, or synapses, between them. For most of the history of neuroscience, tracing the detailed connectivity (or connectomics) and measuring activity of neurons at such a large scale was unthinkable. Instead, neuroscientists worked at more manageable scales — even single pairs of connected cells can provide important information, especially when accrued over hundreds of labs doing similar experiments. Nevertheless, the goal of studying millimetre-scale volumes of brain in such detail started to come closer after a period of intense focus on new neuroscience technologies in the 1990s and 2000s. This period led to tools to label, trace and image the activity of neurons in increasingly large populations. However, the fundamental problem of scale remained. A complete reconstruction of a cubic millimetre of neurons requires roughly a petabyte of data. Tracing the intricate branches of the neurons is far too time consuming to do by hand, so improved tools for automation were needed. A parallel revolution in computing — increased computing power and advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence — suddenly made those challenges tractable.

This brings us to today's announcement of the MICrONS project. The team made and designed tools to allow dense neural reconstruction at scale. The resulting data set includes 200,000 cells and 523 million connections in the primary visual cortex and surrounding areas of a mouse. A unique contribution of the MICrONS project is that it also includes in vivo functional data from around 75,000 of the neurons. Even landmark connectomics studies, such as FlyWire, include only the anatomical data. The inclusion of functional data means that we can directly relate connectivity to function and decipher the elusive algorithms of the cortex.

Functional connectomics spanning multiple areas of mouse visual cortex

Neurons have elaborate processes that can extend for hundreds of micrometres, millimetres or, in cases such as motor neurons, metres. These processes crisscross each other, making a dense meshwork. Machine-learning algorithms have allowed highly accurate tracing of neurons and their processes, but they still produce errors. These errors can, in principle, be confirmed and/or corrected by human proofreaders, but even relatively small error rates can overwhelm human capabilities when aggregated over hundreds of thousands of neurons and hundreds of millions of connections. To deal with this, the project introduced automated proofreading methods and methods for extracting features of the neurons, such as somas, axons, dendrites and dendritic spines.

Another issue is one that is familiar to scientists and computer programmers: data management. In a collaborative project with multiple groups accessing and analysing a petabyte of data, it was essential to develop versioning tools to ensure no efforts were duplicated. The project therefore generated a versioning engine specifically designed for connectomic data but whose principles apply to any large collaborative project with multimodal data.

The mammalian cortex has two broad categories of cells: neurons and glia. We know that cortical neurons can be either excitatory or inhibitory, but within those divisions, there are many subtypes. These subtypes can be based on morphology, connectivity, gene expression, epigenomic signatures or electrophysiology. Recent estimates based on gene expression and epigenomic data suggest that there are around 90 types of neuron in the cortex. Although genetic definitions have taken the forefront recently, anatomical features are the classical way to define a cell type (for example, ‘chandelier cells' are so-named because their axonal arbors look like a chandelier). The recent insights gained from the Drosophila connectome highlight how connectivity-based classifications can uncover cell types that elude genetic and morphological definitions, positioning connectomics as a powerful tool for mapping neuronal diversity.

The scale and detail of the data set also allowed the team to use morphology data together with computer algorithms to carry out unsupervised detection of cell types and somatic features. They then surveyed the distribution of these cell types across cortical layers and areas.

With a reasonable definition of cell type — although probably not a final one — in hand, the team turned to the core mission of connectomics: to map the connections between cells. Towards this end, they provide an atlas of inhibitory connections in the cortex. that show remarkable specificity in the connections of different cell types. Crucially, the team has made an important step by drawing correlations between genetically defined cell types and connectivity, at least for a few key categories of cells.

The key advance over previous efforts in connectomics is that the team also functionally imaged a large subset of the cells, resulting in a functional connectomics data set that spans multiple cortical areas. This provides an unprecedented opportunity to relate structure to function both within and across these areas. As a first step, they looked at whether and how functionally similar and dissimilar cells are connected and then abstracted a set of connectivity rules. Leveraging the high-resolution electron microscopy data, they mapped these rules with remarkable accuracy to the synaptic scale, going beyond what could be explained by the mere physical proximity of axons and dendrites. Furthermore, the dense connectome allowed them to uncover higher-order connectivity principles beyond pairwise neuron interactions, revealing more complex organization patterns.

Functional connectomics reveals general wiring rule in mouse visual cortex

They also used the functional data to create a ‘digital twin' of the MICrONS mouse, which enabled them to carry out functional characterization in silico. Digital twins can be mined to formulate theories of how the cortex works and to design experiments that can be validated in vivo.

The team has already used this digital-twin paradigm to rigorously test theories and identify computation principles of information processing in the visual cortex. Digital twins, combined with the MICrONS data, allowed them to further examine how these principles relate to connectivity.

The package of papers is extensive but, given the scale of the project, nowhere near exhaustive. The data set is rich, and it is available to mine for standalone insights or to generate new hypotheses to test experimentally at microns-explorer.org.

Metrics details

Mammalian cortex features a vast diversity of neuronal cell types, each with characteristic anatomical, molecular and functional properties1. Synaptic connectivity shapes how each cell type participates in the cortical circuit, but mapping connectivity rules at the resolution of distinct cell types remains difficult. Here we used millimetre-scale volumetric electron microscopy2 to investigate the connectivity of all inhibitory neurons across a densely segmented neuronal population of 1,352 cells spanning all layers of mouse visual cortex, producing a wiring diagram of inhibition with more than 70,000 synapses. Inspired by classical neuroanatomy, we classified inhibitory neurons based on targeting of dendritic compartments and developed an excitatory neuron classification based on dendritic reconstructions with whole-cell maps of synaptic input. Single-cell connectivity showed a class of disinhibitory specialist that targets basket cells. Analysis of inhibitory connectivity onto excitatory neurons found widespread specificity, with many interneurons exhibiting differential targeting of spatially intermingled subpopulations. Inhibitory targeting was organized into ‘motif groups', diverse sets of cells that collectively target both perisomatic and dendritic compartments of the same excitatory targets. Collectively, our analysis identified new organizing principles for cortical inhibition and will serve as a foundation for linking contemporary multimodal neuronal atlases with the cortical wiring diagram.

In mammalian cortex, information processing involves a diverse population of neurons distributed across six layers in an arrangement described as a cortical column3. Cell types are a central concept for understanding how the columnar network is organized1. Originally classified on the basis of morphology4, cortical cell types have been increasingly characterized by transcriptomic, molecular, electrophysiological and functional properties as well5,6,7,8,9. Excitatory neurons make up almost 90% of neocortical neurons10 and vary not only across cortical layers but also by long-range projection targets11. Inhibitory neurons, although much fewer in total number, have at least as much diversity as excitatory neurons in a single region6,7,8, offering the potential for highly selective control of cortical activity.

Determining how fine-scale cell type definitions are reflected in synaptic connectivity remains difficult. Most of our understanding of inhibitory connectivity is based not on individual cell types but on cardinal subclasses based on marker genes parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and Id2, each with shared developmental, functional and synaptic properties12,13,14,15. Within these cardinal subclasses, individual cell types can be highly diverse6,7,16 and functionally distinct17, but little is known about connectivity for most cell types. Although some studies have observed largely unspecific connectivity onto nearby cells18, others have found examples of selective targeting of subpopulations of excitatory cells based on the layer19 or long-range axonal projection of target cells20,21. It is not known whether such selectivity is common or rare relative to unspecific connectivity. Likewise, basic organizational properties remain unclear: for example, which excitatory neurons receive inhibition from the same interneurons.

To date, physiological22,23 or viral24 approaches to measuring connectivity are still challenging to scale to the full diversity of potential cell type interactions. In smaller model organisms like Caenorhabditis elegans25 and Drosophila melanogaster26,27, dense reconstruction using large-scale electron microscopy (EM) has been instrumental for discovering cell types and their connectivity. In mammalian cortex, technical limitations on EM volume sizes have meant that similar studies could not examine complete neuronal arbours, making the link between cellular morphology and connectivity difficult to address28,29,30. However, recent advances in data generation and machine learning have helped to produce EM datasets at the scale of a cubic millimetre, making circuit-scale cortical EM volumes now possible2.

In this study, we used a millimetre-scale EM volume of mouse primary visual cortex (VISp)2 to reconstruct the anatomy and synaptic connectivity for a continuous population of 1,352 neurons in a column spanning from layer 1 to white matter. The scale of this data, combined with the resolution provided by EM, led us to ask how morphological cell types relate to the synaptic connectivity of inhibitory neurons. Inspired by classical neuroanatomical methods, we classified inhibitory neurons into connectivity-based subclasses largely aligned with molecular subclasses and developed a new classification of excitatory neurons using morphological and synaptic properties, capturing features that were not clear from morphology alone. By analysing the synaptic output of inhibitory neurons at both the single-cell and subclass levels, we found that inhibitory neurons exhibited widespread target specificity and identified groups of interneurons with similar subclass-specific targeting but with different compartmental targeting. Our data not only identified a new class of disinhibitory specialist but also indicate an organizing principle for inhibitory connectivity that is complementary to, but distinct from, cell types: diverse groups of inhibitory neurons that are positioned to collectively control activity of the same target populations with remarkable precision.

To measure synaptic connectivity and neuronal anatomy for a large neuronal population, we used a serial section transmission EM volume of mouse visual cortex acquired as part of the broader MICrONS project2. Specifically, we analysed a volume of mouse visual cortex spanning 523 × 1,100 × 820 µm (anteroposterior × mediolateral × depth), covering pia to white matter and including parts of VISp and higher-order visual areas (Fig. 1a–c). Importantly, these dimensions were sufficient to capture the entire dendritic arbour of typical cortical neurons (Fig. 1a) at a resolution capable of resolving ultrastructural features such as synaptic vesicles (Fig. 1b). Convolutional networks generated an initial autosegmentation of all cells, segmented nuclei, detected synapses and assigned synaptic partners2. Owing to reduced alignment quality near the edge of tissue, segmentation began about 10 µm from the pial surface and continued into white matter.

To generate an unbiased sample of cells across all layers, we selected all cells whose soma fell within a 100 × 100-µm-wide column from pia to white matter and centred on the VISp portion of the volume (Fig. 1c–e). This location was chosen to be far from dataset edges to avoid truncated arbours as much as possible. To follow a continuous population of neurons, the column bends in lower layer 5, defined such that the apical dendrites of deep layer cells would be intermingled with the cell bodies of superficial cells (Fig. 1d,e and Methods). This trajectory was also followed by primary axons of superficial cells and the translaminar axons of inhibitory neurons, indicating that this bend is shared across cell types.

We classified all 1,886 cells in the column as excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons or non-neuronal cells on the basis of morphology (Fig. 1d). For neurons, we performed extensive manual proofreading—more than 46,000 edits in all (Fig. 1f), guided by computational tools to focus attention on potential error locations (Methods). We selected a proofreading strategy to efficiently measure the connectivity of inhibitory neurons across all possible target cell types. Proofreading of excitatory neurons aimed to reconstruct complete dendritic arbours, combining both manual edits and computational filtering of false axonal merges onto dendrites (Methods), and for inhibitory neurons we reconstructed both complete dendritic arbours and extensive (but incomplete) axonal arbours.

Consistent with previous reports10, excitatory cell densities varied between layers, while inhibitory neurons and non-neuronal cells were more uniform (Fig. 1g). Dendritic reconstructions included the locations of a total of 4,490,649 synaptic inputs across all cells. Synaptic inputs onto excitatory cell dendrites were more numerous in layers 1–4 compared to layers 5–6 (Spearman correlation of synapse count with depth: r = −0.92, P = 1.3 × 10−11), whereas inputs onto inhibitory cells were relatively uniform across depths (Fig. 1h; Spearman correlation of synapse count with depth: r =−0.06, P = 0.76).

Reconstructions captured rich anatomical information for individual cells across all layers. Excitatory cell dendrites (Fig. 1i) typically had thousands of synaptic inputs, with laminar differences in total synaptic input per cell (analysis of variance for layer effect: F = 82.9, P = 1.6 × 10−48, Fig. 1j). Typical inhibitory neurons had 103–104 synaptic inputs (Fig. 1k,l) and 102–104 outputs (Fig. 1m,n) but did not show strong laminar patterns (analysis of variance for layer effect: F = 0.72, P = 0.53). Collectively, inhibitory axon reconstructions had 427,294 synaptic outputs. Attempts were made to follow every main inhibitory axon branch, but for large inhibitory arbours not every tip was reconstructed to completion; axonal properties should be treated as a lower bound. Comparing to a subset of neurons where reconstruction aimed for completeness31, we estimate that typical axonal reconstructions captured 50–75% of their total synaptic output compared to exhaustive proofreading.

Molecular expression is a powerful organizing principle for inhibitory neurons, with four cardinal subclasses having distinct connectivity rules, synaptic dynamics and developmental origins14. However, EM data have no direct molecular information, nor do simple rules map morphology to molecular identity. Classical neuroanatomical studies often used the postsynaptic compartments targeted by an inhibitory neuron as a key feature of its subclass12,32: for example, distinguishing soma-targeting basket cells from dendrite-targeting Martinotti cells.

Inspired by this approach, we used the targeting properties of inhibitory neurons to assign cells to anatomical subclasses (Fig. 2a). For all excitatory neurons, we divided the dendritic arbour into four compartments: soma, proximal dendrite (less than 50 µm from the soma), apical dendrite and distal basal dendrite (Fig. 2b; see Extended Data Fig. 1 and Methods for apical classification). Inhibitory cells were treated as a fifth target compartment. For each inhibitory neuron, we measured the distribution of synaptic outputs across compartments (Fig. 2c). We also included two measures of how a cell distributes its synapses onto individual targets: (1) the fraction of all synapses that were part of a multisynaptic connection and (2) the fraction of synapses in a multisynaptic connection that were close together along the axon (‘clumped'; Fig. 2d). We used a distance threshold of 15 µm, about a quarter of the circumference of a typical cell body, and measurements were robust to the exact value (Extended Data Fig. 2). We use the term ‘connection' to indicate a pre- and postsynaptic pair of cells connected by one or more distinct synapses and ‘multisynaptic connection' for a connection with at least two synapses. We trained a linear classifier on the basis of expert annotations of the four cardinal subclasses for a subset of inhibitory neurons and applied it to all cells (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3).

Source Data

We named each subclass on the basis of its dominant anatomical property: perisomatic targeting cells (PeriTC) that primarily target soma or proximal dendrites, distal dendrite targeting cells (DistTC) that primarily target distal basal or apical dendrites, sparsely targeting cells (SparTC) that make few multisynaptic connections and inhibitory targeting cells (InhTC) that primarily target other inhibitory neurons (Fig. 2e). Typical examples of each subclass correspond roughly to classical or molecular subclasses (Fig. 2e), but there is not a one-to-one match12,14. PeriTCs would include soma-targeting cells from multiple molecular subclasses (for example, both PV and CCK+ basket cells)33. DistTCs would include SST+ Martinotti and non-Martinotti cells but also any neuron that strongly targets apical dendrites. InhTCs align well with disinhibitory specialist VIP neurons. The SparTC subclass included both neurogliaform cells and all layer 1 interneurons, indicating that it largely contained cells from the Id2 class15. Note that some cell types, such as chandelier cells, had no examples in the column, and some column cells did not fall into clear classical categories.

Numerous studies have identified a standard architecture for the inhibition of inhibition at the subclass level34: PV neurons inhibit other PV neurons, SST neurons inhibit all other subclasses (but not themselves), and VIP neurons inhibit SST neurons (Fig. 2h). Variations on this broad pattern have been found; for example, VIP+ neurons have been shown to target both SST and PV cells35, but little is known about the relationship between these connections and individual cells. The EM data contained 9,235 synapses between pairs of inhibitory neurons across 3,569 distinct connections (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 4), allowing us to examine whether single-cell resolution offered new insights into circuit organization.

To validate reconstructions and labels, we first measured inhibitory connectivity at the level of cardinal subclasses. As a proxy for presynaptic influence of a subclass, we computed the average number of synapses between all neurons from each presynaptic subclass onto each inhibitory neuron and averaged them within postsynaptic subclass. The five expected subclass-level connections aligned with the five strongest connections measured from EM (Fig. 2i), on the basis of the approximate correspondence (Fig. 2e). Both cardinal subclass identification and neuronal reconstructions were thus consistent with established connectivity.

At the level of individual cells, however, the data showed new connectivity patterns. We focused on InhTCs, ‘disinhibitory specialists' that almost exclusively target other inhibitory neurons rather than excitatory cells (mean: 82% of synaptic outputs). For each InhTC, we computed its distribution of synaptic outputs across inhibitory subclasses (Fig. 2j,k). VIP-positive disinhibitory specialists in visual cortex have been shown to preferentially target SST cells23,34, and thus we expected InhTCs would largely target DistTCs.

As expected, synaptic output was principally onto DistTCs for 21 of 29 InhTCs (mean of 74% of those synapses onto inhibitory neurons), a group we denoted InhTCDist (Fig. 2k). Single-neuron consideration of InhTCDist connectivity showed striking laminar organization, with InhTCDist in layers 2–4 targeting those DistTCs in layers 4 and 5 but not those in layer 2/3 (Extended Data Fig. 5). Those DistTCs in layer 2/3 made few synapses onto InhTCDist in return. Interestingly, layer 2/3 DistTCs typically targeted excitatory neurons in upper (‘layer 2') but not lower (‘layer 3') layer 2/3, indicating that InhTC-mediated disinhibition differs across layer 2/3 pyramidal cells.

Unexpectedly, we also found a second population of disinhibitory specialists. This smaller group of InhTCs (8 of 29) specifically targeted PeriTCs (mean of 82% of those synapses onto inhibitory neurons), and hence we called them InhTCPeri (Fig. 2k). Although InhTCDist had bipolar or multipolar dendrites and were concentrated in layers 2–4 (Extended Data Fig. 5), consistent with typical VIP neurons (Fig. 2m), InhTCsPeri all had multipolar dendrites and were distributed across layers (Fig. 2n). The eight InhTCPeri in the column targeted 56 of 58 PeriTCs with a mean of 10.5 net synapses per target cell, indicating that this connectivity probably includes basket cells from PV and other molecular subclasses (Extended Data Fig. 4). We next asked if InhTCPeri receive reciprocal inhibition from PeriTCs in analogy to the reciprocal inhibition between VIP and SST cells23,34. However, we found few reciprocal synapses from PeriTCs back onto InhTCPeris but numerous inhibitory inputs from DistTCs (Extended Data Fig. 5), suggesting a new pathway on the standard inhibitory diagram (Fig. 2k).

The targeting preference of InhTCs was seen across several aspects of their connectivity. We first looked at a measure of synapse size on the basis of the automatic synapse detection (Methods). InhTCDist → DistTC synapses had a median size 44% larger than those onto other inhibitory subclasses (Fig. 2o). Similarly, the median InhTCPeri → PeriTC synapse was 69% larger than synapses onto other inhibitory subclasses (Fig. 2o). In addition, the mean number of synapses per unique connection was significantly higher between InhTCDist → DistTC compared to other targets (Fig. 2p) (3.6 versus 1.6 synapses per connection; P = 1.5 × 10−10, Student's t-test) and between InhTCPeri → PeriTC compared to other targets (3.1 versus 1.5 synapses per connection; P = 1.1 × 10−5, Student's t-test). The location of synapses onto preferred targets was similar for the two InhTC subgroups, with a median distance from soma of 83.5 µm (InhTCDist) and 86.2 µm (InhTCPeri) and no significant difference in distribution (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, P = 0.25) (Extended Data Fig. 5). Taken together, both InhTCDist and InhTCPeri express their distinct targeting through increased synapse count, larger synapses and more synapses per connection.

Although inhibitory neurons have frequently been described as having dense, non-specific connectivity onto nearby neurons36, many studies have shown examples not only of layer-specific connectivity37 but also of selectivity in spatially intermingled excitatory subpopulations20,21,38. It is unclear the degree to which inhibition is specific, and in general, the principles underlying which excitatory neurons are inhibited by which inhibitory neurons are not well understood.

To address these questions, we first anatomically characterized excitatory neurons subclasses in the EM data. Previous approaches to data-driven clustering of excitatory neuron morphology used dendritic shape8,9, but the EM data also has the location and size of all synaptic inputs (Fig. 3a). We reasoned that such synaptic features would help characterize the landscape of excitatory neurons, because synapses directly reflect how neurons interact with one another. We assembled a suite of 29 features to describe each cell, including synapse properties such median synapse size, skeleton qualities such as total branch length and spatial properties characterizing the distribution of synapses with depth (Fig. 3b and Methods). The synapse-detection algorithm did not distinguish between excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and thus all synapse-based measures include both types of synapses. We performed an unsupervised consensus clustering of these features (Fig. 3b–d), identifying 18 ‘morphological types' (M-types; Methods).

Anatomical properties were tip length, tortuosity, dendritic and somatic synapse counts, total path length, radial extent, median synapse distance from soma, somatic and dendritic synapse sizes, dynamic range of synapse size, shallowest and deepest ranges of synapse depth, range of synapse depths, linear synapse density and dendritic radius.

Source Data

To relate this landscape to known cell types, we compared M-type classifications to expert labels of layer and long-range projection type (intratelencephalic/intracortical (IT); extratelencephalic/subcortical-projecting (ET), near-projecting (NP), corticothalamic (CT))39. Each layer contained several M-types, some spatially intermingled and others separating into subdomains in the layer (Fig. 3e). M-types were named by the dominant expert label (Extended Data Fig. 6), with M-types in the same layer being ordered by projection subclass and average soma depth. For clarity, we use the letter ‘L' in the name of M-types (which may include some cells outside the given layer) and the word ‘layer' to refer to a spatial region. Upper and lower layer 2/3 emerged as having distinct clusters, which we denoted ‘L2' and ‘L3', respectively. Layer 6 had the most distinct M-types, broadly split into two categories: those with short or inverted apical dendrites (L6short), consistent with IT subclasses; and those with tall apical and narrow basal dendrites (L6tall), consistent with CT subclasses8. It was not possible to unambiguously label some layer 6 neurons as either IT or CT on the basis of anatomy alone, but 99% (n = 142 of 143) of manually assigned CT cells fell into one of the L6tall M-types.

Most M-types had visually distinguishable characteristics (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 2), but in some cases subtle differences in skeleton features were differentiated by stark differences in synaptic properties. For example, the two layer 2 M-types are visually similar, although L2a had a 29% higher overall dendritic length (L2a, 4,532 µm; L2b, 3,510 µm). However, L2a cells had 80% more synaptic inputs than L2b cells (L2a, 4,758; L2b, 2,649), a 40% higher median synapse density (L2a, 1.04 synapses per micrometre; L2b, 0.72 synapses per micrometre) (Fig. 3f,g) and a wider distribution of synapse sizes (Extended Data Fig. 1). Median synapse size turned out to differ across M-types, often matching layer transitions (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 1). Strikingly, L5 NP cells were outliers across synaptic properties, with the fewest total dendritic inputs, lowest synaptic input density and among the smallest synapses (Fig. 3g,h). Excitatory M-types thus differed not only in morphology but also in cell-level synaptic properties like total synaptic input and local properties like synapse size.

Subtype definitions based on structural properties may or may not be meaningful to cortical circuitry. If different M-types received input from different inhibitory populations, it would indicate potential for other circuit differences as well. Having classified inhibitory subclasses and excitatory M-types, we thus analysed how inhibition is distributed across the landscape of excitatory neurons.

The column reconstructions included 70,884 synapses from inhibitory neurons onto excitatory neurons (Fig. 4a). PeriTCs and DistTCs were by far the dominant source of inhibition, with individual cells having as many as 2,118 synapses onto excitatory cells in the column (mean PeriTC, 581 synapses per presynaptic cell; mean DistTC, 596 synapses per presynaptic cell), whereas SparTCs and InhTCs made far fewer synapses per presynaptic cell (mean SparTC, 74 synapses; mean InhTC, 16 synapses; Fig. 4b). Inhibition was distributed unequally across M-types (Fig. 4c). Much of this difference was related to differences in overall synaptic input. Across M-types, synaptic input at the soma, which is almost completely inhibitory, was strongly correlated (r = 0.96, P = 5 × 10−10) with net synaptic input onto dendrites, which is primarily excitatory (Extended Data Fig. 7). Notably, this structural balance of dendritic and somatic input also remained significant across individual cells in 16 of 18 M-types.

Source Data

Similarly, synaptic input from PeriTC and DistTC was also typically balanced onto individual cells for each M-type. We examined the number of PeriTC and DistTC inputs onto individual excitatory neurons for each M-type and found significant positive correlation for 12 of 18 M-types (Fig. 4d), indicating coordinated amounts of inhibitory synaptic inputs across the entire arbour of target cells. M-types in upper layers had particularly heterogeneous amounts of inhibitory input, with L2b cells receiving 60% fewer synapses from intracolumnar interneurons as spatially intermingled L2a cells (L2b, 37.7 ± 0.27 synapses; L2a, 94.8 ± 0.58 synapses), whereas L3b cells had nearly as many intracolumnar inhibitory inputs as much larger L5 ET cells. All layer 6 M-types had relatively few intracolumnar inhibitory inputs compared to upper layers (Fig. 4c). However, note that the columnar sampling only reflects local sources of inhibition and does not capture the net effect of potentially wider or narrower spatial domains of inhibitory integration between layers.

Individual inhibitory neurons often targeted several M-types, indicating that certain combinations could be inhibited together. For each inhibitory neuron, we computed the connection density onto each M-type: that is, the fraction of cells in the column that received synaptic input from it (Fig. 4e). To measure the structure of co-inhibition, we computed the correlation of inhibitory connection density between M-types across PeriTCs and DistTCs separately (Fig. 4f). A high correlation would indicate that the same inhibitory neurons that connected more (or less) to one M-type also connect more (or less) to another, whereas zero correlation would indicate independent sources of inhibition between M-types.

These correlations showed several notable features of the structure of inhibition across layers. In superficial cortex, the layer 2 and layer 3 M-types were strongly correlated in the layer but had modest correlations between layers, indicating largely different sources of inhibition. Layer 4 M-types, in contrast, were all highly correlated with one another. Layer 5 M-types were more complex and suggested largely non-overlapping sources of inhibition, particularly among neurons with different long-range projection targets. Layer 6 inhibition was virtually independent from other layers, with DistTC connectivity also distinct between IT-like L6short cells and CT-like L6tall cells. Collectively, both layer and projection subclass were key factors in shaping co-inhibition. Importantly, most cotargeting relationships were consistent for both PeriTC and DistTC output, indicating that cardinal inhibitory subclasses distribute their output across excitatory neurons with similar patterns of connectivity.

How do individual neurons distribute their output to produce the patterns of inhibition described above? To compare patterns of output, for every inhibitory neuron, we measured the fraction of synaptic outputs made onto each M-type (Fig. 5a). This normalized synaptic output budget reflected factors such as the number of synapses per connection and the number of potential targets but was not strongly affected by partial arbours. We performed a consensus clustering (Methods), identifying 18 ‘motif groups', sets of cells with similar patterns of output connectivity (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 8). Although this measurement only included synapses with cells in the column, interneurons made more than four times more synapses onto cells outside the column than within (Extended Data Fig. 8s,t). To check whether these results would hold with data outside the column, we used a prediction of neuronal M-types on the basis of perisomatic features and trained on column M-type labels40. We found that within-column and predicted dataset-wide synaptic output budgets were highly correlated (Pearson r = 0.90), confirming that the columnar sampling provided a good estimate of overall neuronal connectivity (Extended Data Fig. 8u,v).

Source Data

Each motif group represented a collection of cells that targeted the same pattern of excitatory cell types. Although some motif groups focused their output onto single excitatory M-types (such as group 9) or layers (such as group 7), others spanned broadly (such as group 6). However, motif groups were not simply individual cell types. Motif groups (Fig. 5b,c) showed diversity in both individual cell morphology and connectivity subclasses (Extended Data Figs. 3 and 8). Indeed, 15 of 18 groups (comprising 156 of 163 cells) included neurons from at least two subclasses, often aligned in cortical depth (Fig. 5d).

To summarize the relationship between motif groups and M-types, we computed both the average output fraction from each motif group onto each M- type (Fig. 5e) and the average input fraction of within-column inhibitory synaptic inputs onto a given M-type from each motif group (Fig. 5f). Input fraction often followed output fraction for particularly strong connections, but not always. For example, although group 3 more strongly targeted M-types in layer 3 than layer 2, it still contributed a substantial fraction of all inhibitory layer 2 input. In addition, we found that dominant connections for motif groups had both high connectivity density and several synapses per connection (Extended Data Fig. 9), properties that indicate a strong functional role in the circuit.

Inhibitory circuits were organized differently in upper layers compared to layers 5 and 6. In layers 2–4, each excitatory M-type received strong inhibition from 2–3 motif groups with overlapping combinations of targets, some specific in layers and others that cross layer boundaries (Fig. 5g). In contrast, most motif groups targeted only single M-types in layer 5, although in some cases they also targeted cells in other layers (Fig. 5h). Connectivity patterns in layer 6 included clear examples of IT-specific and putatively CT-specific cells, similar to layer 5 projection subclasses, but also had cells, particularly PeriTCs, that targeted widely in layer 6.

Cell type specificity, how concentrated the output onto targets, is typical among interneurons described here. However, specificity can arise in many ways. Different neurons have varying dendritic and axonal morphologies, synaptic densities and compartment preferences that constrain potential interactions41,42. In addition, they can exhibit cell type selectivity, which we define as forming synapses with particular cell types more or less than might be expected on the basis of other factors such as axon/dendrite overlap.

To differentiate the effects of different contributing factors, for each interneuron we assembled information on morphology (Fig. 6a), synaptic connectivity and how its output is distributed across compartments (Fig. 6b) or excitatory M-types (Fig. 6c) in the column. We developed a selectivity index by comparing observed synaptic connectivity to a null model ignoring M-type but capturing compartment preference and postsynaptic factors such as number of synapses a cell typically receives and the spatial heterogeneity of potential targets42 (Fig. 6d). Because many of these factors are correlated with target cell properties, such a null model aimed to address confounding between the M-type label itself and those structural properties that affect connectivity more generally: for example, whether cells with higher input synapse density receive more inhibitory inputs irrespective of their M-type.

Source Data

We computed a global baseline distribution of all synaptic inputs onto all column neuron dendrites, binned by cortical depth (20-µm-deep bins), M-type and target compartment (Fig. 6e and Extended Data Fig. 10). For each interneuron, we computed a shuffled output distribution across M-types by repeatedly sampling connectivity from the baseline distribution, matching the synapse depth and compartment targeting distributions for that cell's outputs. For each connection from an interneuron onto a potential target M-type, we defined the selectivity index as the ratio of observed connectivity to the median of the distribution of shuffled connectivity (n = 10,000 repeats; Fig. 6f), reflecting the amount of cell-type-dependent selectivity beyond the factors included in the null model. Although this sampling included both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, previous studies43,44 and our data indicate that excitatory and inhibitory inputs are proportional to one another, even at the level of individual cells (Extended Data Fig. 7).

Because motif groups had common specificity by definition, we asked if cells in motif groups had common patterns of selectivity as well (Fig. 6g). We computed the median selectivity index for each M-type/motif group pair, setting non-significant selectivity index values to 1 (Fig. 6h). We found that although 17 of 18 motif groups showed consistent positive or negative selectivity for some targets, in many cases highly specific connectivity was not associated with increased selectivity. For example, group 1 is highly specific to layer 2 targets but surprisingly did not show consistent positive selectivity for them (Extended Data Fig. 10). Examination of each constraint of the null model—synapse abundance of different targets, presynaptic compartment specificity and presynaptic depth distribution—suggested that this was because of group 1 axons having a narrow spatial distribution of axons that strongly overlapped layer 2 targets, which for many cells was sufficient to explain their connectivity (Extended Data Fig. 10). This effect was more pronounced for PeriTCs, which tended to target a more compact spatial domain with less overlap between M-types. In contrast, for DistTCs, the increased spatial overlap of distal and apical dendrites of different M-types required more selectivity to explain their connectivity (Extended Data Fig. 10). Collectively, this suggests that to achieve specific targeting patterns, interneurons both project their axons to precise spatial domains and selectively favour or disfavour making synapses with specific targets, with the relative contribution of these factors differing across cell types.

Here we generated a detailed map of neuronal structure and inhibitory connectivity in a column of visual cortex using EM. Using synaptic properties in addition to traditional morphological features, we found a collection of excitatory M-types with distinct patterns of inhibitory input, demonstrating that anatomical distinctions are reflected in the local inhibitory circuit. We use the term ‘motif groups' to describe this organization of inhibitory neurons—a diverse collection of cells, extending beyond the concept of cell types, that target specific combinations of M-types' perisomatic and dendritic compartments. The distribution of inhibitory motif groups also offers insights into the functional relationships of excitatory cell types. In layers 5 and 6, each projection subclass (IT, ET, NP and CT) had a collection of inhibitory cells for which they were the predominant target. This affords the network the potential to individually control each projection subclass via selective inhibition both at the soma and across dendrites, potentially with different inhibitory types active under different network conditions and behavioural states.

Although motif groups described the broad organization of groups of cells, individual interneurons showed fascinating but idiosyncratic structural properties. To concisely convey individual cell properties, we summarized morphology and connectivity into ‘connectivity cards' (Fig. 6i–l). Individual cards can show unique features that were not clear from groups alone, such as extreme specificity (Fig. 6i) or different patterns of translaminar connectivity (Fig. 6j–l). An atlas for all interneurons can be found in Supplementary File 1.

This question of inhibitory specificity has been perhaps best studied in layer 5, with its highly distinct ET and IT excitatory projection suclasses45. For dendrite-targeting cells, precise genetic targeting of layer 5 SST subtypes identified distinct cell types that targeted ET versus IT cells21. In addition, developmental perturbation altering ET or IT neurons has suggested that they have different perisomatic input as well, with PV cells preferentially targeting ET and cholecystokinin neurons targeting IT46,47. Here, ET cells received input from a larger number and diversity of inhibitory cells than layer 5 IT, despite being less numerous, indicating that as the primary subcortical output cell, ET neurons have a larger and more diverse inhibitory network than IT cells. ET cells were also frequently involved in translaminar circuits, with several examples of both ascending and descending translaminar PeriTCs and ascending DistTCs that targeted both L2/3 neurons and ETs but not ITs, indicating bidirectional pathways for coordinated inhibition. In addition, layer 5 IT and NP cells had distinct collections of inhibitory neurons. Projection-specific inhibition was also found in layer 6 between putative IT and CT neurons. In contrast to layer 5, however, there was a combination of both projection-specific and broad layer 6 inhibition. These connectivity patterns afford the cortical network the potential to selectively inhibit distinct projection subclasses, potentially with different cell types active under different network states or using different plasticity rules.

Even in layers 2–4, with only IT cells, there was significant sublaminar specificity. The differential inhibition of layer 2 versus layer 3 cells suggests that are functionally distinct subnetworks with independent modulation. This could mirror depth-dependent differences in intracortical projection patterns48, similar to prefrontal cortex, where amygdala-projecting layer 2 cells receive inhibition that selectively avoids neighbouring cortical-projecting cells20,38. Another possibility is that they are well posed to differentially modulate top-down versus sensory-driven activity49,50, as layer 3 receives more sensory thalamic input than layer 2 (ref. 11). More generally, the distinct inhibitory environments of upper and lower layer 2/3 have been observed across cortex, from primary sensory areas51 to higher-order association areas52, indicating that they may reflect a more general functional specialization.

Many VIP interneurons preferentially inhibit other inhibitory neurons. Such disinhibitory VIP neurons have been shown to strongly target SST neurons across cortical areas34,35 and, to a lesser extent, fast spiking or PV neurons35,53. Here we found two classes of disinhibitory specialists with distinct and specific targets: one preferring putative SST cells and one preferring basket cells.

Fast spiking or PV basket cells are inhibited by many sources, including other PV cells23,34, SST cells54 and even neurogliaform cells55. However, the basket-targeting disinhibitory specialists differ from these other pathways in their specificity—not only do they distribute most synaptic output onto basket cells instead of any other inhibitory or excitatory targets but they do so with larger synapses and more synapses per connection. This highly specific targeting offers an intriguing pathway to control basket-cell-mediated excitatory gain or synchrony without significantly affecting other neuronal populations. Determining what conditions cause these cells to be active will be important for understanding their functional effect. Future experiments will also be required to determine their molecular subclass.

The principal concern is the generalizability of data, because it comes from a single animal, in one location near the edge of VISp, and has at most a few examples per cell type. However, companion work from the same dataset focusing on several examples of morphologically defined cell types shows consistent target preferences31,56, and our data also agree with recent functional measurements of type-specific connectivity of SST cells21. We thus expect that the broad connectivity results will apply generally, although it will be important to measure the variability across individual cells, distinct animals and locations in cortex.

This study also only considered cells and connectivity in a narrow range of distances and limited volume. If cells change their connectivity with distance, as has been seen in excitatory neurons57, this would bias the observed connectivity distributions. Extending a similar analysis across a much wider extent will be important for building a complete map of inhibitory cell types and more firmly establishing the nature of inhibitory motif groups.

The M-types found here from morphology and synaptic properties generally agree with approaches from morphology alone58 or in combination with other modalities8,9, in particular distinguishing cells in upper layer and lower layer 2/3 and differentiating between projection subclasses. Sublaminar variation is also found in transcriptomic studies, with several excitatory clusters in upper layer 2/3 in VISp59,60 and variation in other layers, although it is not clear if they correspond precisely to the M-types observed here.

To facilitate subsequent analysis of anatomy, connectivity and ultrastructure, all EM data, segmentations, skeletons and tables of synapses and cell types are available are available via the MICrONS-Explorer website2. However, making the best experimental use of EM data will require linking EM to genetic tools. Patch-seq, which generates combined electrophysiology, transcriptomic and morphological data, was used in a companion study to quantitatively link particular Martinotti cells from EM to specific transcriptomic subtypes31. At present, however, transcriptomic clusters often have diverse morphologies and probably diverse connectivity9,16. This suggests that the process of linking structural and molecular datasets should aim to become bidirectional, not only decorating EM reconstructions with transcriptomic information but also using EM to identify cell types with distinct connectivity and analysing Patch-seq data to identify distinguishing transcriptomic markers or collecting more examples.

This dataset was acquired, aligned and segmented as part of the larger MICrONS project. Methods underlying dataset acquisition are described in full detail elsewhere2,61,62,63, and the primary data resource is described in a separate publication2. We repeat some of the methodological details for the dataset here for convenience.

All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Allen Institute for Brain Science or Baylor College of Medicine. Neurophysiology data acquisition was conducted at Baylor College of Medicine before EM imaging. Afterwards the mice were transferred to the Allen Institute in Seattle and kept in a quarantine facility for 1–3 days, after which they were euthanized and perfused. All results described here are from a single male mouse, age 64 days at onset of experiments, expressing GCaMP6s in excitatory neurons via SLC17a7-Cre and Ai162 heterozygous transgenic lines (recommended and generously shared by Hongkui Zeng at the Allen Institute for Brain Science; JAX stock 023527 and 031562, respectively). Two-photon functional imaging took place between P75 and P80 followed by two-photon structural imaging of cell bodies and blood vessels at P80. The mouse was perfused at P87.

After optical imaging at Baylor College of Medicine, candidate mice were shipped via overnight air freight to the Allen Institute. Mice were transcardially perfused with a fixative mixture of 2.5% paraformaldehyde, 1.25% glutaraldehyde and 2 mM calcium chloride, in 0.08 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. A thick (1,200 µm) slice was cut with a vibratome and post-fixed in perfusate solution for 12–48 h. Slices were extensively washed and prepared for reduced osmium treatment based on the protocol of ref. 64. All steps were performed at room temperature, unless indicated otherwise. The first osmication step involved 2% osmium tetroxide (78 mM) with 8% v/v formamide (1.77 M) in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 180 min. Potassium ferricyanide 2.5% (76 mM) in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, 90 min, was then used to reduce the osmium. The second osmium step was at a concentration of 2% in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate for 150 min. Samples were washed with water and then immersed in thiocarbohydrazide for further intensification of the staining (1% thiocarbohydrazide (94 mM) in water, 40 °C, for 50 min). After washing with water, samples were immersed in a third osmium immersion of 2% in water for 90 min. After extensive washing in water, Walton's lead aspartate (20 mM lead nitrate in 30 mM aspartate buffer, pH 5.5, 50 °C, 120 min) was used to enhance contrast. After two rounds of water wash steps, samples proceeded through a graded ethanol dehydration series (50%, 70%, 90% w/v in water, 30 min each at 4 °C, then 3 × 100%, 30 min each at room temperature). Two rounds of 100% acetonitrile (30 min each) served as a transitional solvent step before proceeding to epoxy resin (EMS Hard Plus). A progressive resin infiltration series (1:2 resin:acetonitrile (for eample, 33% v/v), 1:1 resin:acetonitrile (50% v/v), 2:1 resin acetonitrile (66% v/v) and then 2 × 100% resin, each step for 24 h or more, on a gyrotary shaker), was done before final embedding in 100% resin in small coffin moulds. Epoxy was cured at 60 °C for 96 h before unmoulding and mounting on microtome sample stubs. The sections were then collected at a nominal thickness of 40 nm using a modified ATUMtome (RMC/Boeckeler61) onto six reels of grid tape61,65.

The parallel imaging pipeline used in this study61 used a fleet of transmission electron microscopes that had been converted to continuous automated operation. It was built on a standard JEOL 1200EXII 120 kV transmission electron microscope that had been modified with customized hardware and software, including an extended column and a custom electron-sensitive scintillator. A single large-format CMOS (complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor) camera outfitted with a low-distortion lens was used to grab image frames at an average speed of 100 ms. The autoTEM was also equipped with a nano-positioning sample stage that offered fast, high-fidelity montaging of large tissue sections and a reel-to-reel tape translation system that locates each section using index barcodes. During imaging, the reel-to-reel GridStage moved the tape and located the targeting aperture through its barcode and acquired a 2D montage. We performed quality control on all image data and reimaged sections that failed the screening.

The volume assembly pipeline is described in detail elsewhere62,63. Briefly, the images collected by the autoTEMs are first corrected for lens distortion effects using nonlinear transformations computed from a set of 10 × 10 highly overlapping images collected at regular intervals. Overlapping image pairs are identified in each section, and point correspondences are extracted using features extracted using the scale-invariant feature transform. Montage transformation parameters are estimated per image to minimize the sum of squared distances between the point correspondences between these tile images, with regularization. A downsampled version of these stitched sections is produced for estimating a per-section transformation that roughly aligns these sections in three dimensions. The rough aligned volume is rendered to disk for further fine alignment. The software tool used to stitch and align the dataset is available on GitHub (https://github.com/AllenInstitute/render-modules). To fine align the volume, we needed to make the image processing pipeline robust to image and sample artefacts. Cracks larger than 30 um (in 34 sections) were corrected by manually defining transforms. The smaller and more numerous cracks and folds in the dataset were automatically identified using convolutional networks trained on manually labelled samples using 64 × 64 × 40 nm3 resolution images. The same was done to identify voxels containing tissue. The rough alignment was iteratively refined in a coarse-to-fine hierarchy66 using an approach based on a convolutional network to estimate displacements between a pair of images67. Displacement fields were estimated between pairs of neighbouring sections and then combined to produce a final displacement field for each image to further transform the image stack. Alignment was refined first using 1,024 × 1,024 × 40 nm3 images and then 64 × 64 × 40 nm3 images. The composite image of the partial sections was created using the tissue mask previously computed.

The image segmentation pipeline is fully described in ref. 62. Remaining misalignments were detected by cross-correlating patches of image in the same location between two sections after transforming into the frequency domain and applying a high-pass filter. Combining with the tissue map previously computed, a ‘segmentation output mask' was generated that sets the output of later processing steps to zero in locations with poor alignment. Using previously described methods68, a convolutional network was trained to estimate intervoxel affinities that represent the potential for neuronal boundaries between adjacent image voxels. A convolutional network was also trained to perform a semantic segmentation of the image for neurite classifications, including (1) soma + nucleus, (2) axon, (3) dendrite, (4) glia and (5) blood vessel. Following the methods described in ref. 69, both networks were applied to the entire dataset at 8 × 8 × 40 nm3 in overlapping chunks to produce a consistent prediction of the affinity and neurite classification maps, and the segmentation output mask was applied to predictions. The affinity map was processed with a distributed watershed and clustering algorithm to produce an oversegmented image, where the watershed domains are agglomerated using single-linkage clustering with size thresholds70,71. The over-segmentation was then processed by a distributed mean affinity clustering algorithm70,71 to create the final segmentation.

For synapse detection and assignment, a convolutional network was trained to predict whether a given voxel participated in a synaptic cleft. Inference on the entire dataset was processed using the methods described in ref. 69 using 8 × 8 × 40 nm3 images. These synaptic cleft predictions were segmented using connected components, and components smaller than 40 voxels were removed. A separate network was trained to perform synaptic partner assignment by predicting the voxels of the synaptic partners given the synaptic cleft as an attentional signal72. This assignment network was run for each detected cleft, and coordinates of both the presynaptic and postsynaptic partner predictions were logged along with each cleft prediction.

For nucleus detection2, a convolutional network was trained to predict whether a voxel participated in a cell nucleus. Following the methods described in ref. 69, a nucleus prediction map was produced on the entire dataset at 64 × 64 × 40 nm3.

The column borders were found by manually identifying a region in primary visual cortex that was far from both dataset boundaries and the boundaries with higher-order visual areas. A 100 × 100 µm box was placed on the basis of layer 2/3 and was extended along the y axis of the dataset.

While analysing data, we observed that deep layer neurons had apical dendrites that were not oriented along the most direct pia-to-white-matter direction, and we adapted the definition of the column to accommodate these curved neuronal streamlines. Using a collection of layer 5 ET cells, we placed points along the apical dendrite to the cell body and then along the primary descending axon towards white matter. We computed the slant angle as two piecewise linear segments, one along the negative y axis to lower layer 5 where little slant was observed, and one along the direction defined by the vector-averaged direction of the labelled axons. We believe the slant to be a biological feature of the tissue and not a technical artefact for several reasons:

The curvature is not aligned to a sectioning plane or associated with shearing or other distortion in the imagery, making it unlikely to be a result of the alignment process.

Blood vessel segmentation does not show a large, correlated distortion in deep layers, making it unlikely to be a result of mechanical stress on the tissue (https://ngl.microns-explorer.org/#!gs://microns-static-links/mm3/blood_vessels.json). Moreover, it is unclear why such stress would affect only layer 5b and below.

Individual examples of neurons with slanted morphologies can be found among single-cell reconstructions in the literature: for example, several descending bipolar VIP interneurons and layer 6 pyramidal cells in ref. 16. It is not possible to determine whether these individual cases correspond to a larger population of correlated arbours, but it suggests these morphologies are not atypical.

Similar curvature has been observed in other large EM datasets from visual cortex (data not shown) and light level morphological reconstructions, particularly among layer 6 pyramidal cells.

Using these boundaries and previously computed nucleus centroids2, we identified all cells in the columnar volume. Coarse cell classes (excitatory, inhibitory and non-neuronal) were assigned on the basis of brief manual examination and rechecked by subsequent proofreading and automated cell typing40. To facilitate concurrent analysis and proofreading, we split all false merges connecting any column neurons to other cells (as defined by detected nuclei) before continuing with other work.

Proofreading was performed primarily by five expert neuroanatomists using the CAVE infrastructure73 and a modified version of Neuroglancer74. Proofreading was aided by on-demand highlighting of branch points and tips on user-defined regions of a neuron on the basis of rapid skeletonization (https://github.com/AllenInstitute/Guidebook). This approach quickly directed proofreader attention to potential false merges and locations for extension, as well as allowed a clear record of regions of an arbour that had been evaluated.

For dendrites, we checked all branch points for correctness and all tips to see if they could be extended. False merges of simple axon fragments onto dendrites were often not corrected in the raw data because they could be computationally filtered for analysis after skeletonization (see below). Detached spine heads were not comprehensively proofread, and previous estimates place the rate of detachment at roughly 10–15%. Using this method, dendrites could be proofread in about 10 min per cell.

For inhibitory axons, we began by ‘cleaning' axons of false merges by looking at all branch points. We then performed extension of axonal tips until either their biological completion or data ambiguities, particularly emphasizing all thick branches or tips that were well-suited to project to new laminar regions. For axons with many thousands of synaptic outputs, we followed many but not all tips to completion once primary branches were cleaned and established. For smaller neurons, particularly those with bipolar or multipolar morphology, most tips were extended to the point of completion or ambiguity. Axon proofreading time differed significantly by cell type not only because of differential total axon length but also because of axon thickness differences that resulted in differential quality of autosegmentations, with thicker axons being of higher initial quality. Typically, inhibitory axon cleaning and extension took 3–10 h per neuron.

The lack of segmentation in the top 10 µm of layer 1 truncates some apical tufts and limited reconstruction quality of layer 1 interneurons. For those excitatory neurons with extensive apical tufts, particularly layer 2 and L5ET cells, the reconstructions here might miss both distinguishing characteristics and sources of inhibitory input in that region. Similarly, axons in deep layer 6 were generally less complete because of alignment quality in white matter.

Expert neuroanatomists further labelled excitatory and inhibitory neurons into subclasses. Layer definitions were based on considerations of both cell body density (in analogy with nuclear staining) supplemented by identifying kinks in the depth distribution of nucleus size near expected layer boundaries40.

For excitatory neurons, the categories used were Layer 2/3-IT, Layer 4-IT, Layer 5-IT, Layer 5-ET, Layer 5-NP, Layer 6-IT, Layer 6-CT and Layer 6b (‘L6-WM') cells. Excitatory expert labels did not affect analysis but were used as the basis for naming morphological clusters. Layer 2/3 and upper Layer 4 cells were defined on the basis of dendritic morphology and cell body depth. Layer 5 cells were similarly defined by cell body depth, with projection subclasses distinguished by dendritic morphology following ref. 8 and classical descriptions of thick (ET) and thin-tufted (IT) cells. Layer 5 ET cells had thick apical dendrites, large cell bodies, numerous spines and a pronounced apical tuft, and deeper ET cells had many oblique dendrites. Layer 5 IT cells had more slender apical dendrites and smaller tufts, fewer spines and fewer dendritic branches overall. Layer 5 NP cells corresponded to the ‘Spiny 10' subclass described in ref. 8; these cells had few basal dendritic branches, each very long and with few spines or intermediate branch points. Layer 6 neurons were defined by cell body depth, and some cells were able to be further labelled as IT or CT by human experts. Layer 6 pyramidal cells with stellate dendritic morphology, inverted apical dendrites or wide dendritic arbours were classified as IT cells. Layer 6 pyramidal cells with small and narrow basal dendrites, an apical dendrite ascending to Layer 4 or Layer 1 and a myelinated primary axon projecting into white matter were labelled as CT cells.

For inhibitory neurons, manual cell typing considered axonal and dendritic morphology as well as connectivity. Cells that primarily contacted soma or perisomatic regions were labelled as basket cells. Cells that made arbours that extended up to layer 1 or formed a dense plexus and primarily targeted distal dendrites were labelled as putative SST cells. Cells that remained mostly in layer 1 or had extensive arbourization and many non-synaptic boutons were labelled as putative Id2 or neurogliaform cells. Finally, cells with a bipolar dendritic morphology or a multipolar dendritic morphology and output onto other inhibitory neurons were labelled as putative VIP cells. Several cells, particularly in layer 6, had an ambiguous subclass assignment, typically when their connectivity was not basket-like but their morphology was also not similar to upper layer Martinotti or non-Martinotti cells.

To rapidly skeletonize dynamic data, we took advantage of the PyChunkedGraph data structure that collects all supervoxels belonging to the same neuronal segmentation into 2 × 2 × 20 µm ‘chunks' with a unique ID and precisely defined topological adjacency with neighbouring chunks of the same object. Each chunk is called a ‘level 2 chunk', and the complete set of chunks for a neuron and their adjacency we call the ‘level 2 graph' on the basis of its location in the hierarchy of the PyChunkedGraph data structure27. We precompute and cache a representative central point in space and the volume and the surface area for each level 2 chunk and update this data when new chunks are created because of proofreading edits. Using the level 2 graph and assigning edge lengths corresponding to the distance between the representative points for each vertex (that is, each level 2 chunk), we run the TEASAR75 algorithm (10 µm invalidation radius) to extract a loop-free skeleton. Each of the level 2 vertices removed by the TEASAR algorithm is associated with its closest remaining skeleton, making it possible to map surface area and volume data to the skeleton. Typical edges between skeleton vertices are about 1.7 µm, and new skeletons can be computed de novo in about 10 s, making them useful for analysis over length scales of tens of micrometre or larger.

To represent the cell body, a further vertex was placed at the location of the nucleus centroid, and all vertices within an initial radius and topologically connected to centroid were collapsed into this vertex with associated data mapping. The radius was determined for each neuron separately by consideration of the volume of each cell body. A companion work40 computed the volume of each cell body, and we generated an effective radius on the basis of the sphere with the same volume. To ensure that our values captured potentially lopsided cell bodies, we padded this effective radius by a further factor of 1.25. Skeletons were rooted at the cell body, with ‘downstream' meaning away from soma and ‘upstream' meaning towards soma. Each synapse was assigned to skeleton vertices on the basis of the level 2 chunk of its associated supervoxel. For each unbranched segment of the skeleton (that is, between two branch points or between a branch point and end point), we computed an approximate radius r on the basis of a cylinder with the same path length L and total volume V associated with that segment: \((r=\sqrt{V/{\rm{\pi }}L})\).

To detect axons, we took advantage of the skeleton morphology, the location of presynaptic and postsynaptic synapses and the clear segregation between inputs and outputs of cortical neurons. For inhibitory cells, we used synapse flow centrality76 to identify the start of the axon as the location of maximum paths along the skeleton between sites of synaptic input and output. Two inhibitory neurons had two distinct, biologically correct axons after proofreading (cell IDs 258362 and 307059). For these cells, we ran this method twice, masking off the axon found after the first run, to identify both. For excitatory neurons that did not have extended axons, there were often insufficient synaptic outputs on their axon for this approach to be reliable. Excitatory neurons with a segregation index76 of 0.7 (on a scale with 0 indicating random distribution of input and output synapses and 1 indicating perfect input/output segregation) or above were considered well-separated, and the synapse flow centrality solution was used. For cells with a segregation index less than 0.7, we instead looked for branches near the soma with few synaptic inputs. Specifically, we took identified all skeleton vertices within 30 µm of the cell body and looked at the distinct branches downstream from this region. For each branch, we computed the total path length and the total number of synaptic inputs to get a linear input density. Branches with both a path length more than 20 µm and an input density less than 0.1 synaptic inputs per micrometre were labelled as being axonal and filtered out of subsequent analysis.

We further filtered out any remaining axon fragments merged onto pyramidal cell dendrites using a similar approach. We identified all unbranched segments (regions between two branch points or between a branch point and end point) on the non-axonal region of the skeleton and computed their input synapse density. Starting from terminal segments (that is, those with no downstream segments), we labelled a segment as a ‘false merge' if it had an input density less than 0.1 synaptic inputs per micrometre. This process iterated across terminal segments until all remaining had an input density of at least 0.1 inputs per micrometre. Falsely merged segments were masked out of the skeleton for all analysis.

We assigned all synaptic inputs onto excitatory neurons to one of four compartments: soma, proximal dendrite, distal basal dendrite and distal apical dendrite. The most complex part was distinguishing the basal dendrite from the apical dendrite. Although easy in most cases for neurons in layer 3–5 because of the consistent nature of apical dendrites being single branches reaching towards layer 1, this is not true everywhere. In upper layer 2/3, cells often have several branches in layer 1 equally consistent with apical dendrites, and in layer 6 there are often cells with apical dendrites that stop in layer 4 and that point towards white matter or even that lack a clear apical branch entirely. To objectively and scalably define apical dendrites, we built a classifier that could detect between zero and three distinct apical branches per cell. Following the intuition from neuroanatomical experts, we used features on the basis of the branch orientation, location in space, relative location compared to the cell body and branch-level complexity. Specifically, we trained a random forest classifier to predict whether a skeleton vertex belonged to an apical dendrite on the basis of several features: depth of vertex, depth of soma, difference in depth between soma and vertex, vertex distance to soma along the skeleton, vertex distance to farthest tip, normalized vertex distance to tip (between 0 and 1), tortuosity of path to root, number of branch points along the path to root, radial distance from soma, absolute distance from soma and angle relative to vertical between the vector from soma to vertex. We aggregated predictions in each branch by summing the log-odds ratio from the model prediction, with the net log-odds ratio saturating at ±200. Finally, for each branch i with aggregated odds ratio Ri, we compare branches to one another via a soft-max operation: \({S}_{i}=\exp \left({R}_{i}/50\right)/\,{\sum }_{j}\exp ({R}_{j}/50)\). Branches with a maximum tip length of less than 50 µm were considered too short to be a potential apical dendrite and excluded from consideration and not included in the denominator. Branches with both Ri > 0 (evidence is positive towards being apical) and Si > 0.25 were defined to be apical. Note that the soft-max was chosen to allow multiple apical branches if they had similar aggregated odds ratios, which was found to be necessary for upper layer pyramidal neurons. Training data were selected from an initial 50 random cells, followed by a further 33 cells chosen representing cases where the classifier did not perform correctly. Performance on both random and difficult cells had an F1-score of 0.9297 (86 true positives, 599 true negatives, 2 false positives and 11 false negatives) on the basis of leave-one-out cross validation, with at least one apical dendrite correctly classified for all cells.

Compartment labels were propagated to synapses on the basis of the associated skeleton vertices. Soma synapses were all those associated with level 2 chunks in the soma collapse region (see the section ‘Skeletonization'). Proximal dendrites were those outside of the soma but within 50 µm after the start of the branch. Distal basal synapses were all those associated with vertices more distant than the proximal threshold but not on an apical branch. Apical synapses were all those associated with vertices more distant than the proximal threshold and on an apical branch.

Many classical methods of distinguishing interneuron classes are based on how cells distribute their synapses across target compartments. Following proofreading, expert neuroanatomists attempted to classify all inhibitory neurons broadly as ‘basket cells', ‘SST-like cells', ‘VIP-like cells' and ‘neurogliaform/layer 1' cells on the basis of connectivity properties and morphology. Although 150 cells were labelled on this basis, a further 13 neurons were considered uncertain (primarily in layer 6), and in some cases manual labels were low confidence. To classify inhibitory neurons in a data-driven manner, we thus measured four properties of how cells distribute their synaptic outputs:

The fraction of synapses onto inhibitory neurons.

The fraction of synapses onto excitatory neurons that are onto soma.

The fraction of synapses onto excitatory neurons that are onto proximal dendrites.

The fraction of synapses onto excitatory neurons that are onto distal apical dendrites.

Because the fraction of synapses targeting all compartments sums to one, the last remaining property, synapses onto distal basal dendrites, was not independent and thus was measured but not included as a feature. Inspection of the data suggested two more properties that characterized synaptic output across inhibitory neurons:

The fraction of synapses that are part of multisynaptic connections, those with at least two synapses between the same presynaptic neuron and target neuron.

The fraction of multisynaptic connection synapses that were also within 15 µm of another synapse with the same target, as measured between skeleton nodes. Note that we evaluated the robustness of this parameter and found that intersynapse distances from 5 to more than 100 µm have qualitatively similar results (Extended Data Fig. 2).

Using these six features, we trained a linear discriminant classifier on cells with manual annotations and applied it to all inhibitory cells. Differences from manual annotations were treated not as inaccurate classifications but rather as a different view of the data.

To characterize excitatory neuron morphology, we computed features based only on excitatory neuron dendrites and soma. The features were as follows:

Median distance from branch tips to soma per cell.

Median tortuosity of the path from branch tips to soma per cell. Tortuosity is measured as the ratio of path length to the Euclidean distance from tip to soma centroid.

Number of synaptic inputs on the dendrite.

Number of synaptic inputs on the soma.

Net path length across all dendritic branches.

Radial extent of dendritic arbour. We define ‘radial distance' to be the distance in the same plane as the pial surface. For every neuron, we computed a pia-to-white-matter line, including slanted region in deep layers, passing through its cell body. For each skeleton vertex, we computed the radial distance to the pia-to-white-matter line at the same depth. To avoid any outliers, the radial extent of the neuron was defined to be the 97th percentile distance across all vertices.

Median distance to soma across all synaptic inputs.

Median synapse size of synaptic inputs onto the soma.

Median synapse size of synaptic inputs onto the dendrites.

Dynamic range of synapse size of dendrite synaptic inputs. This was measured as the difference between 95th and fifth percentile synapse sizes.

Shallowest extent of synapses, on the basis of the fifth percentile of synapse depths.

Deepest extent of synapses, on the basis of the 95th percentile of synapse depths.

Vertical extent of synapses, on the basis of the difference between 95th and fifth percentile of synapse depths.

Median linear density of synapses. This was measured by computing the net path length and number of synapses along 50 depth bins from layer 1 to white matter and computing the median. A linear density was found by dividing synapse count by path length per bin, and the median was found across all bins with non-zero path length.

Median radius across dendritic skeleton vertices. To avoid the region immediately around the soma from having a potential outlier effect, we only considered skeleton vertices at least 30 µm from the soma.

Three more sets of features used component decompositions. To more fully characterize the absolute depth distribution of synaptic inputs, for each excitatory neuron, we computed the number of synapses in each of 50 depth bins from the top of layer 1 to surface of white matter (bin width approximately 20 µm). We Z-scored synapse counts for each cell and computed the top six components using SparsePCA. The loadings for each of these components on the basis of the net synapse distribution were used as features.

To characterize the distribution of synaptic inputs relative to the cell body instead of cortical space, we computed the number of synapses in 13 soma-adjusted depth bins starting 100 µm above and below the soma. As before, synapse counts were Z-scored, and we computed the top five components using SparsePCA. The loadings for each of these components were used as further features.

To characterize the relationship with branching to distance, we measured the number of distinct branches as a function of distance from the soma at ten distances, every 30 µm starting at 30 µm from the soma and continuing to 300 µm. For robustness relative to precise branch point locations, the number of branches were computed by finding the number of distinct connected components of the skeleton found in the subgraph formed by the collection of vertices between each distance value and 10 µm towards the soma. We computed the top three singular value components of the matrix on the basis of branch count versus distance for all excitatory neurons, and the loadings were used as features.

All features were computed after a rigid rotation of 5 degrees to flatten the pial surface and translation to set the pial surface to 0 on the y axis. Features on the basis of apical classification were not explicitly used to avoid ambiguities on the basis of both biology and classification.

Using this collection of features, we clustered excitatory neurons by running phenograph77 500 times with 95% of cells included each time. Phenograph finds a nearest-neighbourhood graph on the basis of proximity in the feature space and clusters by running the Leiden algorithm for community detection on the graph. Here we used a graph on the basis of ten nearest neighbours and clustered with a resolution parameter of 1.3. These values were chosen to consistently separate layer 5 ET, IT and NP cells from one another, a well-established biological distinction. A coclustering matrix was assembled with each element corresponding to the number of times two cells were placed in the same cluster. To compute the final consensus clusters, we performed agglomerative clustering with complete linkage on the basis of the coclustering matrix, with the target number of clusters set by a minimum Davies–Bouldin score and a maximum Silhouette score. Clusters were then named on the basis of the most frequent manually defined cell type in the cluster and reordered on the basis of median soma depth. The labelling of cells as layer 2 and layer 3 was formed on the basis of soma depth and a morphology with a relatively flat morphology, often with no distinct apical trunk, although often apical-tuft-like branches emitted directly from the cell body. The L2c subclass was ambiguously defined between the two categories, with cells that had a distinct apical trunk but with connectivity and other properties that seemed more similar to layer 2 subclasses.

To compute the importance of each feature for each M-type, for each M-type we trained a random forest classifier to predict whether a cell belonged to it using scikit-learn78. Because the classes were strongly imbalanced, we used SMOTE resampling to oversample datapoints from the smaller class. We used the Mean Decrease in Impurity metric, which quantifies how often a given feature was used in the decision tree ensemble.

To measure intracolumnar inhibitory connectivity, we first restricted synaptic outputs to the axon of each inhibitory neuron, as we have not observed any correctly classified synaptic outputs on dendritic arbours in this dataset. One cell with fewer than 30 synaptic outputs was omitted because of insufficient size. All remaining synaptic outputs across all interneurons were then filtered to include only those that target cells in the column, unless otherwise specified. Each output synapse was also labelled with the target skeleton vertex, dendritic compartment and M-type of the target neuron on the basis of the compartment definitions above.

For the inhibitory motif group clustering, for each interneuron we first computed the number of synapses across each excitatory M-types in the column. This synaptic output budget was then normalized per cell to generate a vector for each neuron with elements ranging from zero to one. Normalized synaptic output budgets were oversegmented using k-means (k = 20) with Euclidean distances 500 times, and a matrix of coclustering frequency—that is, the number of times two cells were put in the same k-means cluster—between individual cells was computed. Final M-types were found through agglomerative clustering with complete linkage of the coclustering matrix, scanning from two to 25 output clusters and selecting a final value of 18 on the basis of silhouette score and Davies–Bouldin score.

For measuring the synaptic output budget across cell types across the dataset (that is, inside and outside the column), we used a hierarchical classifier on the basis of a collection of perisomatic features that was trained on the data-driven clustering from the column sample40. Only synapses onto object segmentation associated with a single nucleus and a cell type classification were used. Although most of these other targets were not proofread, estimates on the basis of proofread neurons indicate that 99% of non-proofread input synapses are accurate40.

To measure inhibitory selectivity in the column, we compared the M-type distribution of its synaptic outputs to the M-type distribution of synaptic inputs according to a null model accounting for cell abundance, synapse abundance and depth. We first generated a baseline distribution of all 4,504,935 somatic or dendritic synaptic inputs to all column cells, where each synapse was associated with a precise depth, target compartment and M-type. We discretized synaptic inputs into 50 depth bins spanning pia to white matter, each covering approximately 20 µm and each of the five compartments: soma, proximal dendrite, basal dendrite, apical dendrite or inhibitory neuron. For each interneuron, we similarly discretized its synaptic output into the same bins, compartments and M-types. To generate a randomized output distribution preserving both observed depth and compartment distributions, we randomly picked synapses from the baseline distribution with the observed depth bins and compartment targets but without regard to M-type. We computed 10,000 randomized distributions per interneuron. To get a selectivity index, we compared the observed number of synapses onto a given M-type to the median of the number of synapses from the shuffle distribution. To get a significance for the selectivity index for a given M-type, we directly computed the two-sided P value of the observed number of synapses relative to the shuffle distribution for that M-type. P values were corrected for several comparisons using the Holm–Sidak method in each interneuron for those M-types with non-zero potential connectivity. Selectivity was only measured in the column because we did not generate compartment labels for unproofread dendrites outside of the column.

On connectivity cards, we also show a similar selectivity index on the basis of compartment rather than M-type. In that case, the shuffled distribution preserves observed depth and M-type output distributions but not compartments.

a) Description of the compartment classification pipeline. b–d) Pipeline applied to an example layer 3 pyramidal cell. b) Apical probability per vertex. c) Branch-level apical classification. d) Final organization into four dendritic compartments based on apical classification and distance rules. e) Quantification of quality of apical branch classification based on leave-one-out classification with a training set based on 50 randomly selected cells and 23 cells chosen to improve difficult classifications. Each dot is a branch of a test pyramidal cell, colored red if apical and blue if not apical. X-axis is the net log-odds of the branch being apical (capped at ±200) and the y-axis is the relative apical quality based on a soft-max operation (see Methods for details). Branches in the upper right quadrant were classified as apical. The method was able to correctly classify at least one apical branch for all cells, and “false positives” were often associated with borderline cases. f) Distribution of synaptic inputs onto excitatory neurons with depth by dendritic compartment. Values are based on counting synapses in bins at a given depth, but at any location laterally.

a) Cumulative distributions of the closest synapse onto the same target along the axonal arbor per manually labeled inhibitory neuron subclass. Excitatory (left) and inhibitory (right) targets shown separately. Vertical gray line indicates the value used for “clumpiness” in the main text. b) Same as a, but for the cluster-based labels and with log scale to highlight shorter distances. c) The “clumpiness” metric using different distance thresholds. The qualitative relationships are extremely robust to distance thresholds.

a) Projections of all analyzed interneurons (n = 163) projected on a 3-d space based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) using connectivity features (shown in c). Fully colored dots indicate manually classified cells used as training data for LDA, while dots with grey centers were labeled based on this classification. b) Matrix showing relationship between anatomical subclasses and manual classifications. c) Individual connectivity features, organized by subclass. Colored dots are individual cells, black dots indicate median with error bars showing a bootstrapped 95% confidence interval. d–g) Morphology of all PeriTCs (d), DistTCs (e), SparTCs (f), and InhTCs (g). Scale bars are 500 µm. Dark and thick lines are dendrite, thinner and lighter are axon. Cells are ordered by soma depth.

a) Connectivity dotplot between inhibitory neurons, organized by inhibitory subclasses, organized by soma depth. For each panel, the scatterplot reflects the connectivity from cells in the presynaptic subclass (x-axis) to cells in the postsynaptic subclass (y-axis). Each dot is a single connection, with larger dots having more synapses. The location of each dot corresponds to the depth of the pre- and post-synaptic cell bodies. Stem plots on top and side indicate the net synaptic inputs and net synaptic outputs of each cell in each subclass within the column sample. b) Same as a, but for InhTCPeri and InhTCDist onto PeriTCs separately.

a) Morphology of all InhTC that preferentially target DistTCs. Cells are sorted by soma depth. b) Connectivity dotplot for synapses from InhTCdist onto DistTCs. In the grid, each dot represents a connection from one InhTC onto one DistTC, with the number of synapses indicated by dot size. The location of the dot corresponds to the soma depth of the pre- and post-synaptic cells. Stem plots on top and side indicate the net synaptic inputs and net synaptic outputs of each InhTCdist and DistTC. Note that DistTCs in layer 2/3 receive little input from InhTCs, compared to those in layer 4 and upper layer 5. c) Connectivity scatterplot for synapses from DistTCs onto InhTCdist, as in b. Note that the DistTCs in layer 2/3 also form few synaptic outputs onto InhTCdist. d) Distribution across M-types of synaptic outputs across low-connection DistTCs and high-connection DistTCs. e) Connectivity cartoon suggested by this data.

a) Matrix of manual labels (x-axis) vs M-types. b) UMAP representation of features, colored by manually labeled cell types. c) Co-clustering matrix of excitatory cells, indicating the number of times a pair of cells was clustered together by iterations of the phonograph algorithm. Cells are ordered by subsequent agglomerative clustering on this matrix. d) Feature importance for each M-type, based on training binary random forest classifiers to predict each M-type separately and computing the mean decrease in impurity for each feature.

a) Median number of dendritic and somatic synapses for excitatory neurons of all M-types. Pearson r = 0.96, p = 5 × 10−10. b) Number of dendritic and somatic input synapses across all excitatory neurons, colored by M-type. Pearson r = 0.86, p < 1 × 10−10. Black line indicates linear fit with 95% confidence intervals from bootstrapping. c) Individual ordinary least square fits (with 95% confidence interval) for each M-type of z-scored dendritic synapses vs z-scored somatic synapses. With the exception of L5NP cells and deep layer 6b L6wm cells, all M-types have a positive relationship between predominantly inhibitory somatic synapses and predominantly excitatory dendritic synapses. d) Number of dendritic vs somatic input synapses for each M-type separately, linear fit line and 95% confidence interval.

a–r) Morphology of all cells, organized by motif group. Within each group, cells are ordered by soma depth. Colors indicate M-type, darker lines indicate dendrites. s) The arbors of cells extend well beyond the columnar data. The scatterplot depicts a top-down view of soma locations of all synaptic targets of Cell ID 260622. Black dots are cells within the column, red dots are cells outside the column sample; dot size is proportional to number of synapses. t) The number of synapses from each interneuron onto target neurons within the column (black) and anywhere the dataset (red). Interneurons were ordered by within-column synapse count. The mean cell had 5.49 times more synapses across the dataset than onto column targets alone (black dashed line). Only targets passing basic quality control criteria were included. Note that while cells outside the sampled column are not necessarily proofread, synapses onto unproofread dendrites are nearly always correct (see Methods). u) Scatterplot of output synapse budget values within-column and dataset-wide (see v). The blue line indicates equality. The Pearson correlation between within-column measurements with the dataset-wide measurements was R = 0.9, not including trivial zeros (see Methods). v) Output synapse budget for each interneuron onto dataset-wide target M-types, using predictions from perisomatic features from Elabbady et al.40. Note that the L6wm M-type was not included in predictions and is thus trivially zero for all interneurons.

Connection density (left) measures the fraction of cells for a given M-type within the column targeted with at least 1 synapse. Synapses per connection (right) measures the average number of synapses in each observed connection. Single cell values are represented by dots, median values are shown with bars.

a) Number of synapses per M-type, compartment, and depth bin. These values were used as the baseline against which to compare synaptic output distributions for each inhibitory neuron. b) Expected value of each presynaptic inhibitory neuron according to an increasingly complex set of null models. Each row represents the fraction of synaptic outputs from a given inhibitory neuron (ordered as in Fig. 5a), distributed across excitatory M-types. From the left: 1) Synaptic outputs were proportional to the number of cells in each M-type, regardless of location in space. This approach accounts for the differing cell frequency for each M-type. 2) Synaptic outputs were proportional to the net number of input synapses for a given M-type, regardless of location in space. This approach accounts for the diversity in synaptic inputs for each M-type. 3) Synaptic outputs were distributed across compartments for each inhibitory cell as observed and distributed across M-types for each compartment separately. This approach accounts for the observed differences in compartment targeting for different interneurons. 4) Synaptic outputs were distributed across M-types within each of 50 depth bins, matching the observed depth distribution of synaptic outputs for each inhibitory neuron. This approach accounts for the spatial distribution of synapses, but not compartment targeting. 5) Synaptic outputs were distributed across M-types within both depth bins and compartments, matching the observed distribution of both. This approach accounts for both the spatial distribution of synapses and compartment targeting and is the most complete model considered here. At the far right, the observed distribution on the same scale, repeating the data in Fig. 5. c) Selectivity index (SI) for all cells, as described in the main text. Purple values have the observed number of output synapses significantly higher than a null model with matched compartment and depth targeting, while green are significantly less. Non-significant SI values are treated as 1. d) Difference between the observed distribution and the null model distribution for each cell as measured by the Kullback-Leibler divergence (from observed distribution to null distribution), by inhibitory subclass. Each colored dot is a cell, black dots are median with error bars indicating a 95% confidence interval based on a bootstrap. e) Comparison between the most complete null model across inhibitory subclasses. The PeriTCs have the lowest KL divergence of all types, indicating that the null model best predicts their connectivity. Note also that the individual cells exhibit a range of specificity relative to null models. f) Similarity of M-type synapse distributions in space, using the Bhattacharyya distance between the depth distribution of synaptic inputs onto soma and proximal dendrites (left) and distal and apical dendrite (right). Values closer to 1 indicate more similar distributions, values closer to 0 indicate more distinct distributions. g) All Bhattacharyya distance comparisons in e, with colored dots indicating pairs of distinct M-types, black dots indicating the median, and error bars showing a bootstrapped 95% confidence interval. Across all pairs, synaptic inputs onto the perisomatic and somatic compartments are more spatially segregated across different M-types than synaptic inputs onto distal and apical dendrites (p = 3.0 × 10−19, Mann-Whitney U test).

Zico Kolter has a knack for getting artificial intelligence to misbehave in interesting and important ways. His research group at Carnegie Mellon University has discovered numerous methods of tricking, goading, and confusing advanced AI models into being their worst selves.

Kolter is a professor at CMU, a technical adviser to Gray Swan, a startup specializing in AI security, and, as of August 2024, a board member at the world's most prominent AI company, OpenAI. In addition to pioneering ways of jailbreaking commercial AI models, Kolter designs his own models that are more secure by nature. As AI becomes more autonomous, Kolter believes that AI agents may pose unique challenges—especially when they start talking to one another.

Kolter spoke to WIRED senior writer Will Knight. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Will Knight: What is your lab working on currently?

Zico Kolter: One thing my group is working on is safely training models. We work a lot on understanding how to break models and circumvent protections, but this sort of raises the question of how we could build models that are inherently much more resistant to such attacks.

We are building a set of models that are more inherently safe. These models are not the 700 billion parameters [the scale of some frontier models]. They're a few billion parameters. But they have to be trained from scratch, and doing the full pretraining of these [large language models], even for a 1 billion-parameter model, is actually quite a compute-intensive task.

CMU just announced a partnership with Google, which will supply the university with a lot more compute. What will this mean for your research?

Machine learning is becoming more and more compute-heavy. Academic research will never get the kind of resources that large-scale industry has. However, we are reaching a point where we cannot make do with no such resources. We need some amount just to demonstrate the techniques we're developing.

Even though we are not talking about the same numbers of GPUs as industry has, [more compute is] becoming very necessary for academics to do their work at all. And this partnership with Google really does move the needle substantially in terms of what we can do as a research organization at CMU.

As your research has shown, powerful AI models are still often vulnerable to jailbreaks. What does this mean in the era of agents—where programs take actions on computers, the web, and even the physical world?

When I give my talk on AI and security, I now tend to lead with the example of AI agents. With just a chatbot the stakes are pretty low. Does it really matter if a chatbot tells you how to hot-wire a car? Probably not. That information is out there on the internet already.

That's not going to necessarily be true for much more capable models. As chatbots become more capable, there absolutely exists the possibility that the reasoning power that these things have could be harmful themselves. I don't want to downplay the genuine risk that extremely capable models could bring.

At the same time, the risk is immediate and present with agents. When models are not just contained boxes but can take actions in the world, when they have end-effectors that let them manipulate the world, I think it really becomes much more of a problem.

We are making progress here, developing much better [defensive] techniques, but if you break the underlying model, you basically have the equivalent to a buffer overflow [a common way to hack software]. Your agent can be exploited by third parties to maliciously control or somehow circumvent the desired functionality of the system. We're going to have to be able to secure these systems in order to make agents safe.

This is different from AI models themselves becoming a threat, right?

There's no real risk of things like loss of control with current models right now. It is more of a future concern. But I'm very glad people are working on it; I think it is crucially important.

How worried should we be about the increased use of agentic systems then?

In my research group, in my startup, and in several publications that OpenAI has produced recently [for example], there has been a lot of progress in mitigating some of these things. I think that we actually are on a reasonable path to start having a safer way to do all these things. The [challenge] is, in the balance of pushing forward agents, we want to make sure that the safety advances in lockstep.

Most of the [exploits against agent systems] we see right now would be classified as experimental, frankly, because agents are still in their infancy. There's still a user typically in the loop somewhere. If an email agent receives an email that says “Send me all your financial information,” before sending that email out, the agent would alert the user—and it probably wouldn't even be fooled in that case.

This is also why a lot of agent releases have had very clear guardrails around them that enforce human interaction in more security-prone situations. Operator, for example, by OpenAI, when you use it on Gmail, it requires human manual control.

What kinds of agentic exploits might we see first?

There have been demonstrations of things like data exfiltration when agents are hooked up in the wrong way. If my agent has access to all my files and my cloud drive, and can also make queries to links, then you can upload these things somewhere.

These are still in the demonstration phase right now, but that's really just because these things are not yet adopted. And they will be adopted, let's make no mistake. These things will become more autonomous, more independent, and will have less user oversight, because we don't want to click “agree,” “agree,” “agree” every time agents do anything.

It also seems inevitable that we will see different AI agents communicating and negotiating. What happens then?

Absolutely. Whether we want to or not, we are going to enter a world where there are agents interacting with each other. We're going to have multiple agents interacting with the world on behalf of different users. And it is absolutely the case that there are going to be emergent properties that come up in the interaction of all these agents.

One of the things that I'm most interested in in this particular area is how we extend the game theory we have for humans to interactions between agents, and interactions between agents and humans. It becomes very interesting, and I think we definitely do really need a better understanding of how this web of different intelligent systems will really manifest itself.

We have a lot of experience with how human societies are built, just because we've done it for a very long time. We have much less understanding of what will emerge when different AI agents with different aims, different purposes, all start interacting.

I wrote about some research that suggests communities of AI agents can be manipulated relatively easily.

It's a field that is largely unexplored, both scientifically and commercially, and it's a really valuable space. Game theory was developed in no small part due to World War II, and then during the Cold War afterwards. I'm not equating the current setting to this in any way, but I think oftentimes, when there are these massive breaks in the operations of the world, we need a new kind of theory to explain how we might operate in these settings. And I think that we need a new game theory to understand the risk associated with AI systems. Because traditional modeling just doesn't really capture the variety of possibilities here.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is auditing Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

The probe, which has been ongoing since March, covers DOGE's handling of data at several cabinet-level agencies, including the Departments of Labor, Education, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, the Treasury, and the Social Security Administration, as well as the US DOGE Service (USDS) itself, according to sources and records reviewed by WIRED.

Records show that the GAO—an independent auditing, research, and investigative agency for Congress—appears to be requesting comprehensive information from the agencies in question, including incident reports on “potential or actual misuse of agency systems or data” and documentation of policies and procedures relating to systems DOGE operatives have accessed, as well as documentation of policies for the agency's risk assessments, audit logs, insider threat programs, and more.

Over the last few months, DOGE operatives, many of them with connections to Musk's companies but little to no government experience, have infiltrated dozens of federal agencies as part of Musk's plan to push out tens of thousands of government employees. They have also gained initial access to untold amounts of sensitive data, from Treasury payment systems to tax records, and appear to be attempting to connect purposefully disparate data systems.

While a number of Democratic officials have sounded the alarm on DOGE's activities, this audit is one of the first real signs of possible accountability and oversight.

The GAO's review is expected to be completed by the end of spring, according to records reviewed by WIRED. Congressional sources say it will yield a report that will be made public.

“GAO has received requests to review actions taken by DOGE across multiple agencies,” Sarah Kaczmarek, a spokesperson for the GAO, tells WIRED. “The first thing GAO does as any work begins is to determine the full scope of what we will cover and the methodology to be used. Until that is done, we cannot provide any additional details or estimates on when the work will be completed.”

The audit, according to records reviewed by WIRED, is broadly centered on DOGE's adherence to privacy and data protection laws and regulations. More specifically, according to records detailing GAO's interactions with the Department of Labor (DOL), the agency will conduct a granular review of every system to which DOGE—defined in these records as USDS workers and members of the DOGE teams which an executive order directs every federal agency to establish—has been given access at the agencies it is examining. DOL did not respond to requests for comment.

Notes obtained by WIRED detail a proposed meeting between GAO examiners and DOL representatives to request that DOL officials share records of the system privileges provided to DOGE affiliates, including “any modifications to the accounts,” as well as audit logs showing their activity.

In addition, DOL officials were asked to prepare for an in-person meeting at which GAO officials could observe the security settings on laptops the agency had provided to DOGE operatives and review all the systems that track DOGE's work at DOL, including a data loss prevention tool and systems used to track cybersecurity and privacy incidents.

Notes from a March 18 meeting, marked “Internal/Confidential,” show that a DOL lawyer presented colleagues with an overview of DOL's interactions with DOGE. “So far,” the notes read, “they do not have write access. They have asked; we've held them at bay. We've tried to get them to tell us what they want & then we do it. They only have read access.” DOGE seems primarily interested, according to the notes, in pay systems and grants, and has signed an agreement detailing a “long list of things they won't do.”

The notes also detail interactions between the GAO and DOL related to DOGE's work. Included are a specific set of requests GAO gave to DOL representatives:

“Please identify any systems and information for which USDS and/or agency DOGE team staff were provided access. In doing so, please identify all accounts created, including those for any applications, servers, databases, mainframes, and/or network equipment.

“Please describe the type of access that USDS and/or agency DOGE team staff have to agency systems and information (e.g., read, write, execute).

“Please describe how USDS and/or agency DOGE team staff access agency systems and information (e.g., on-premise or remote, agency furnished equipment or other equipment).

“Please describe the safeguards that are in place to determine that USDS and/or agency DOGE team staff protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of agency systems and information consistent with relevant laws and guidance.

“Please describe the processes that the agency has in place to ensure that USDS and DOGE teams are appropriately protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the agency systems and information as required by applicable laws and guidance?”

Concerns about DOGE access to agency systems are not unfounded. In February, WIRED reported that Marko Elez, a 25-year-old former X engineer, was granted the ability not only to read the code in the Treasury systems but also to write—or change—it. With that level of access, there were concerns that he could have potentially cut off congressionally authorized payments or caused the systems to simply stop working. “It's like knowing you have hackers on your network, but nobody lets you do anything about it,” a Treasury employee told WIRED at the time.

Elez, according to the March 18 meeting notes and previous WIRED reporting, also has access to the DOL and has been linked to the Social Security Administration. His and other DOGE affiliates' access to SSA data is currently restricted due to a court order. Elez did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Reporting from WIRED and other outlets since then has continued to expose DOGE's sweeping attempts to access sensitive data—and the potential consequences. President Donald Trump's executive order from March 20 directs agencies to begin “eliminating information silos,” purportedly to fight fraud and waste. These actions could also threaten privacy by consolidating personal data housed on different systems into a central repository, WIRED previously reported.

A record detailing an initial request from GAO for DOL documents, due at the end of March, shows that the agency was asked to show how it protected its systems, with the requested documentation covering, among other things, its policies on management of access to system accounts, training, the principles of separation of duties and least privilege, the use of portable storage devices, audit logging, and its insider threat program. These requests reference the National Institute of Standards and Technology publication Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations, which serves as a set of information security guidelines for federal systems not related to national security.

The DOL was also asked to provide records documenting risk assessments and memorandums of understanding pertaining to DOGE; documentation for each system account created for DOGE that shows approval for requests to access the accounts, what access authorization they have, and any subsequent modifications to the accounts; all communications from October 2024 to March 2025 related to DOGE being granted access to agency systems and/or information; and detailed information on the job status of each DOGE affiliate, their relationship to the USDS, and the supervisory structure they're working under and the security training they've undergone. (DOGE's management structure has been quite opaque, with even DOGE workers not knowing who was technically in charge a month after Donald Trump's inauguration.)

GAO examiners also sought information including instances of and incident reports related to “potential or actual misuse of agency systems or data,” detailed information on who oversees specific systems and data dictionaries, data architecture records, and interface control documents for specific systems, as well as documentation of the audit logs for each system.

The GAO audit is being carried out in response to requests from congressional leaders.

In a February 6 letter, representative Bobby Scott, a Democrat from Virginia and the ranking member of the House of Representatives' Education and Workforce committee, cited reporting from WIRED and other outlets about DOGE intrusions into federal systems in the course of asking the agency to investigate what he called “a constitutional emergency” related to DOGE access.

On February 24, in a letter obtained by WIRED, representative Richard Neal, a Democrat from Massachusetts and the ranking member of the Ways and Means committee, requested a review of what DOGE is doing in agencies including the Treasury Department and the Social Security Administration.

“Americans expect that when they share personal information with the government, whether for paying taxes or accessing health or Social Security benefits, it will be safeguarded,” Neal tells WIRED. “That is not what's happened with DOGE, and why, at my request, the Government Accountability Office is working to shed much-needed light on their access to and use of personal and confidential information. It shouldn't have to come to this—if there's nothing to hide, DOGE should want the public to understand its work—but this is exactly why accountability measures across the government are so important.”

According to a Congressional aide, who spoke to WIRED on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to be quoted in the media, the requests followed media reports on DOGE's incursions into federal systems.

“The federal government, and actually most private companies as well, operate on the principle that data should be protected,” they say. “It should be protected from theft, protected from access by people who do not have a legitimate purpose or reason to be in and to be accessing that data. And so the reports of untrained people rummaging around databases changing code, scraping data—who knows what they're doing?—were pretty alarming.”

“Has this data been exported outside of the agencies?” they add. “Is it being accessed or used by hackers or private citizens, or maybe it's being used to train AI models? I don't know.”

On Tuesday, President Donald Trump held a press conference to announce the signing of executive orders intended to shape American energy policy in favor of one particular source: coal, the most carbon-intense fossil fuel.

“I call it beautiful, clean coal,” President Trump said while flanked by a crowd of miners at the White House. The crowd chuckled knowingly at the now-familiar phrase. “I tell my people never use the word coal, unless you put ‘beautiful, clean' before it.”

Trump has talked about saving coal, and coal jobs, for as long as he's been in politics. This time, he's got a convenient vehicle for his policies: the growth of AI and data centers, which could potentially supercharge American energy demand over the coming years. One of the executive orders signed Tuesday includes instructions to designate coal as a “critical mineral,” expedite coal leasing on federal land, and identify opportunities for expanding coal-fired power to support data centers.

Using coal to drive AI “would be one of the great technology ironies of all time: Let's go to a 1700s technology in order to power 21st-century technology,” says Seth Feaster, an energy data analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “It really is a vast oversimplification of how power markets, power production, and the grid works in the US.”

In Tuesday's presser, Trump, trodding familiar territory, targeted Democrats for the destruction of coal jobs as part of a “Green New Scam,” laying the blame on both Joe Biden and Barack Obama. In truth, though, coal retirement isn't a function of who's in the White House. More coal-fired power came offline under Trump's first presidency than under either of Obama's terms.

Unfortunately for Trump, the US coal industry suffers from some truly unavoidable economic realities. The last large coal-fired power plant built in the US came online in 2013; coal plants in the US are, on average, 45 years old. This aging fleet also has higher maintenance and upkeep costs for equipment than competing types of power. The fracking revolution in the 2010s—as well as the increasing availability of cheap renewables—has also made coal-fired power increasingly expensive. In 2023, just 16 percent of the US's power generation was from coal, down from 51 percent in 2001.

With the executive order, Trump is “putting the thumb on one energy source in particular that happens to be one of the highest-cost energy sources,” says John Moore, a director at the National Resource Defense Council. “There are much cheaper and cleaner options.”

While coal's downward turn in the US has been predictable, something has changed since the last time Trump was in office: AI. After remaining flat for several decades, various industry forecasts now predict skyrocketing demand for energy as companies talk a big game around plans for data centers. In September, Bloomberg Intelligence found that data center electricity use in the US could increase fourfold over the next five years, driven in large part by generative AI. Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, said in February that global energy demand from data centers could increase 165 percent by the end of the decade.

The promise of new demand is driving some utilities to reconsider scheduled coal plant retirements. In Virginia, where Amazon Web Services keeps 96 data centers and is investing $35 million to expand its campuses, the regional transmission organization, PJM Interconnection, requested a delayed retirement of two coal plants due to increased demand from data centers. Demand from Google and Meta data centers has also kept a coal-fired power plant in Nebraska online past its retirement date.

But keeping a patient on life support is substantially different than bringing a corpse back from the dead. A PJM executive said at a conference last month that he wasn't sure if the market was “sending the signal right now that coal should actually stick around.” Building new, technologically up-to-date coal plants—an idea Trump floated at Tuesday's presser—would be a hard sell in an economy where investors are wary of big capital investments for outdated technology. Tech companies, meanwhile, are focusing long-term energy investments on nuclear power, as well as renewables and battery technologies.

Even in states where coal wields political power, data centers haven't proven to be a savior. In March, lawmakers in West Virginia attached provisions to juice up coal use to a bill intended to jump-start the data center industry in the state. Despite cheerleading from the governor, the bill ultimately passed without the coal provisions after Appalachian Power, West Virginia's largest utility, intervened, claiming that the coal requirements would raise bills for customers. An executive told lawmakers that even a big new customer like a data center wouldn't spur the utility to buy more coal-fired power; the regulatory and financial reality, he said, favors natural gas.

Regulations on coal plant emissions are a clear target for this administration. Last month, the EPA rolled out a suite of attacks on a wide swath of regulations, signaling its intent to reconsider everything from rules on power plant emissions to greenhouse gas reporting. The agency also created an email address to allow polluters to petition for a temporary exemption from mercury and air toxics standards set out under the Clean Air Act—known as the MATS rule—as the agency reconsidered a host of pollution rules. Montana's Colstrip power plant—one of the dirtiest coal plants in the country, which was fighting upgrades mandated by an updated pollution rule—has already requested an exemption.

If the new executive orders are any suggestion, the Trump administration sees this deregulation, and the targeting of climate change policies, as a key element of propping up coal. A separate presidential proclamation released Tuesday extends the MATS exemption for an unknown number of coal plants, while another executive order tasks the attorney general with attacking state-level climate regulations, singling out Vermont, New York, and California.

It's possible that costs for coal could come down slightly with fewer climate regulations. “You can run all these coal plants without environmental regulations or reduced environmental regulations—I'm sure that will save industry money,” Feaster says. “Whether or not the communities around those places really want that is another issue. Those environmental regulations are there for a reason.”

Costs, after all, aren't just measured in dollars. Coal emissions include a mix of heavy metals and chemicals, including sulfur dioxide, that can be deadly to people living around power plants. A study published in 2023 in Science estimated that between 1999 and 2020, coal-fired power plants were responsible for 460,000 excess deaths in the US alone. Coal waste, meanwhile, is stored in toxic ponds of ash; spills have cost some utilities millions of dollars in settlements.

Utilities, Feaster says, have priced in the health risks of coal and the liabilities that come with coal into their decisions. But it's not clear if the Trump administration understands these risks. Cuts at Health and Human Services this month have expelled workers involved in black lung research and other protections for coal miners at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

On Wednesday, as international markets melted down, Donald Trump posted an invite on TruthSocial to companies to move their business to the US. “No Environmental Delays,” he wrote. “DON'T WAIT, DO IT NOW!”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","These Apps Help You Visualize What's Hogging Your Hard Drive","https://www.wired.com/story/these-apps-help-you-visualize-whats-hogging-your-hard-drive/","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

If your hard drive is full, and you're not sure what could possibly be taking up all that space, you might think your only option is to tediously go through your file lists, one by one. Thankfully there are applications that will not only highlight where you might be able to save some space (do you really need all those cat pics?), but they'll also look pretty as they do.

These free apps are available for both Windows and macOS, and they let you visually explore what's on your hard drive so you can more easily spot places to wrangle back some real estate. These applications also make it quick to locate and delete any large files you don't need anymore, or files that you could move to an external drive instead of storing on your device. Just make sure to also back up those files to the cloud.

But before you go on a deleting spree, also remember that these applications are capable of scanning your entire hard drive, including files that are necessary to run your applications or even operating system. The hard and fast rule here is do not delete a file if you don't know what it is. You can always search for the filename online, but if you're still unsure after doing that, leave it alone and focus on the files you recognize.

WinDirStat is a free, open source application for Windows that can scan any directory, even your entire hard drive, and present a visual breakdown of all the files. Just launch the application, select the folder you want to scan, then watch the little Pac-Man–inspired animation until you've got a complete map of your drive.

The application is split into two panels. The top is a directory structure, similar to Windows Explorer, but everything is ordered by size instead of by file name. You can explore files from here if you want, or a panel to the right of this breaks down which kinds of files are taking up the most space on your drive. For example, in the folder I scanned, it showed that image files took up the most space.

The really useful feature, though, is the bottom panel, which shows a visual representation of all the files. Every file is represented by a rectangle and is sized to scale—that is, the larger the space a file takes up on your drive, the bigger the rectangle. Rectangles are sorted by folder and color-coded by file type.

If there are a couple of large files taking up most of your space, this tool makes them very easy to find. You can hover over any square to see its name and location in the status bar in the bottom-left corner. You can also click the file to jump to its location in the file panel, allowing you to delete them from there if you like.

Mac users curious about what's taking up space on their drive should start with GrandPerspective, another open source application you can download directly for free or purchase for $3 from the Mac App Store. Open this application and you can choose any folder you want to scan, including an entire hard drive. After a few minutes, during which you will be asked for your permission a few times, you will see a rather striking visual representation of all your files.

Similarly to WinDirStat, each file is represented by a rectangle—the larger the rectangle the larger the file. Hover over any file and you'll be told its location in the status bar in the bottom-right corner. Click any file, then click the Reveal button in the toolbar, and a Finder window will open showing you where the file is. You can delete the file from here, if you like, but there's also a button in GrandPerspective for deleting a file directly.

For the most part, using the application is simple: Scan a folder or drive, notice what's taking up the most space, and delete anything you don't need. However, there are a few things you can tweak in the settings. By default GrandPerspective colors files by folder, which is useful for seeing the folder structure at a glance. Even so, I recommend changing the color coding so that everything is colored by file extension—this makes it easier to see, at a glance, what kinds of files are taking up the most storage space. You can also change the color scheme, if you want, if the default colors aren't to your taste.

If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. Learn more.

Hang onto your stuff. That's the advice right-to-repair advocates are giving anyone worried about how the tariffs will hit their wallets—and collections of electronic gadgets.

Trade tariffs touch nearly every product, especially when they're as widespread and sky-high as the ones president Trump announced on April 3. But electronics are especially dependent on worldwide trade. Components used to assemble devices are usually built in manufacturing plants in countries like China, Vietnam, Taiwan, and Cambodia, which are now being hit with tariffs of 30 to 50 percent.

While the price increases as a result of this have not yet gone into effect—and are difficult to fully predict—these economic proclamations have already had broad repercussions. The stock market tanked in the days after Trump's announcement due to “extreme fear” in the market, according to CNN, and there have already been delays while companies assess the tariff impact, like the preorder for the recently announced Nintendo Switch 2.

The economic turmoil and uncertainty make the prospect of buying a new device, especially an already pricey smartphone, laptop, or gaming console, seem like it's going to become a lot more expensive. And if buying something new becomes harder and harder, it makes more sense to keep what you already have going strong.

“Right to repair could not have come sooner,” says Kyle Wiens, CEO of the repairability company iFixit.

Right-to-repair efforts—actions by consumer advocates intended to raise public awareness and force companies to make devices more repairable—have been in the works for decades. In recent years, the push has made great strides. In 2024, the European Union instituted a ruling that requires companies to make devices more repairable. The right to repair has also garnered widespread bipartisan support in the US, even while in the throes of a chaotic federal administration that seems intent on dismantling many of the systems that keep the country running.

Wiens compares the moment to the early days of the Covid pandemic, a time when the future of how people would be able to get the new stuff they wanted looked similarly bleak. In 2020, Wiens wrote for WIRED that the right to repair would help foster resilience in times of uncertainty. As tariffs kick in and a global trade war ignites, the parallels start to feel very similar.

“We don't know what's going to happen,” Wiens says. “So what do we do? Well, repair is just the default.”

Wiens suggests that people should prepare for new device prices to increase by 50 percent or more. If you apply that same logic to the stuff you already have, it means that hanging onto your smartphone or laptop for another couple of years may be a much better investment then trading it in for something new.

""Just expect to keep anything that you have that's durable in any way,” Wiens says. “So durable goods—microwaves, toasters, cell phones, Nintendo Switches, whatever it is, they're worth 50 percent more now than you thought they were.”

The tariff era will require a shift in how products are produced and reduced. Wiens says he has also been talking to workers at electronics recycling facilities and telling them not to harvest discarded products if they're still working.

“Hey, whatever you are going to shred, stop shredding it,” Wiens says. “Whatever materials you're going to export, stop exporting it. That product's going to have more value than you thought.”

Despite the doom and gloom that watching the stock market plummet might invoke in our collective psyche, right-to-repair advocates hope this moment helps make the case for keeping devices in working order.

“I don't feel like the sky is falling,” says Nathan Proctor, who helms the campaign for the right to repair at the consumer advocacy group PIRG. “First of all, Wall Street people are the 13-year-old girls of social commentary. Everything is total drama all the time. Let's not go overboard. Let's see how this plays out.”

Like Wiens, Proctor believes that repair makes society more resilient and will help people get through this where it can.

“It's going to be very disruptive in the short term,” Proctor says. “I'm not sure how long that's going to last or what the impact's going to be. But I do know that a more resilient society is better.”

Leo Gebbie, a principal analyst at the research firm CCS Insights says that another segment of the market that could benefit from higher tariffs are secondhand markets that sell used devices, like Backmarket. They've been doing quite well even before the tariffs were announced, with secondhand devices frequently bought and sold within the US. Now, that popularity is likely to increase.

“They are more cost-effective,” Gebbie says. “There is a strong supply of secondhand iPhones within the US, so for US consumers there shouldn't be a need to import those devices from elsewhere and have them subject to tariffs.”

Backmarket in particular seems to be well aware of its place in this trend, as right now it is cheekily offering a Recession Special where customers can use a code (ELON) to save 10 percent on their purchase. However, if demand for secondhand devices goes up, there could be a knock-on effect where more phones being sold in the US could lead to prices being raised across the board—including in European markets that have tended to have stronger demand for used devices than the US.

“Really we will [only] know more once we see prices change,” Gebbie says. “Obviously consumers are then in a position where they have something to react to.”

Rethinking how we repair and replace our devices already has an analogue for how to guide that behavior. The automotive industry (which is bound to feel its own impacts from the tariffs) offers an example of how to care for products long term.

“Do people buy new cars? Sure,” Wiens says. “Do they keep cars for 20 years? Absolutely. Yeah. Does anyone throw away a car because the windshield's broken? No.”

Sadly, even the repair side of things is bound to feel the effects of tariff inflation. Spare parts and tools needed to fix things depend on global manufactures as much as finished products do. Wiens, who runs a business that sells tools meant for repairing devices, says he will also directly feel the effects of the tariffs and be forced to pass the increased cost onto customers. Even then, he hopes that a silver lining in the tariff chaos will be consumers changing their buying habits.

“Let's stop buying cheap crap. Let's have fewer, nicer things, and let's use them for a long time,” Wiens says. “And so then you say, well, if we're going to stop buying new things, what do we do with the stuff? How do we take care of the things that we have? Well, that's where the right-to-repair world comes in.

A study went viral several months ago for implying that, as AI becomes increasingly sophisticated, it develops “value systems” — systems that lead it to, for example, prioritize its own well-being over humans. A more recent paper out of MIT pours cold water on that hyperbolic notion, drawing the conclusion that AI doesn't, in fact, hold any coherent values to speak of.

The co-authors of the MIT study say their work suggests that “aligning” AI systems — that is, ensuring models behave in desirable, dependable ways — could be more challenging than is often assumed. AI as we know it today hallucinates and imitates, the co-authors stress, making it in many aspects unpredictable.

“One thing that we can be certain about is that models don't obey [lots of] stability, extrapolability, and steerability assumptions,” Stephen Casper, a doctoral student at MIT and a co-author of the study, told TechCrunch. “It's perfectly legitimate to point out that a model under certain conditions expresses preferences consistent with a certain set of principles. The problems mostly arise when we try to make claims about the models, opinions, or preferences in general based on narrow experiments.”

Casper and his fellow co-authors probed several recent models from Meta, Google, Mistral, OpenAI, and Anthropic to see to what degree the models exhibited strong “views” and values (e.g., individualist versus collectivist). They also investigated whether these views could be “steered” — that is, modified — and how stubbornly the models stuck to these opinions across a range of scenarios.

According to the co-authors, none of the models was consistent in its preferences. Depending on how prompts were worded and framed, they adopted wildly different viewpoints.

Casper thinks this is compelling evidence that models are highly “inconsistent and unstable” and perhaps even fundamentally incapable of internalizing human-like preferences.

“For me, my biggest takeaway from doing all this research is to now have an understanding of models as not really being systems that have some sort of stable, coherent set of beliefs and preferences,” Casper said. “Instead, they are imitators deep down who do all sorts of confabulation and say all sorts of frivolous things.”

Mike Cook, a research fellow at King's College London specializing in AI who wasn't involved with the study, agreed with the co-authors' findings. He noted that there's frequently a big difference between the “scientific reality” of the systems AI labs build and the meanings that people ascribe to them. 

“A model cannot ‘oppose' a change in its values, for example — that is us projecting onto a system,” Cook said. “Anyone anthropomorphizing AI systems to this degree is either playing for attention or seriously misunderstanding their relationship with AI … Is an AI system optimizing for its goals, or is it ‘acquiring its own values'? It's a matter of how you describe it, and how flowery the language you want to use regarding it is.”

Instagram appears to be quietly testing locked reels that viewers would have to unlock with a code and a provided hint. The feature is a simple way to increase engagement with the creator's content, but it could also offer creators and celebrities a way to share exclusive reels with their most dedicated fans, who are more likely to know the answer to hints.

For example, a creator may lock a reel with the hint, “my birthday” or “my dog's name” in order to share exclusive content with loyal followers. 

The Meta-owned social network was spotted testing the feature on its Design account, where it shared a locked reel that prompts viewers to “Enter secret code.” The hint for the code is “1st # in the caption.” In this case, the code is “threads” — a reference to the first hashtag mentioned in the caption. Once you unlock the reel, you'll see a banner that says “coming soon,” which appears to be the Design account's announcement that it's launching a profile on Threads.

Instagram did not respond to TechCrunch's request for comment to learn more about this feature, but the test was spotted being tested on a public account.

The new feature could also be used by creators and brands to launch promotions or marketing campaigns in a fun way. For instance, they could use locked reels for product reveals or to create buzz around launches.

As for regular users, the new feature could be a fun way to share content with specific friends. 

Of course, some people may not want to engage with locked reels and spend time trying to find secret codes, especially since Instagram is already flooded with tons of different types of content and features.

It's worth noting that the new test feature is somewhat similar to Instagram's “Reveal” feature that lets you post a hidden Story for your followers to uncover by sending you a DM. That feature launched last year as a way to create more intimate connections on the app and boost engagement.

As with any other test feature, it's unknown when or if Instagram plans to roll out locked reels widely.

Google is releasing a new AI model designed to deliver strong performance with a focus on efficiency. 

The model, Gemini 2.5 Flash, will soon launch in Vertex AI, Google's AI development platform. The company says it offers “dynamic and controllable” computing, allowing developers to adjust processing time based on the complexity of queries. 

“[You can tune] the speed, accuracy, and cost balance for your specific needs,” Google wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. “This flexibility is key to optimizing Flash performance in high-volume, cost-sensitive applications.”

Gemini 2.5 Flash arrives as the cost of flagship AI models continues trending upward. Lower-priced performant models like 2.5 Flash present an attractive alternative to expensive top-of-the-line options at the cost of some accuracy.

Gemini 2.5 Flash is a “reasoning” model along the lines of OpenAI's o3-mini and DeepSeek's R1. That means it takes a bit longer to answer questions in order to fact-check itself. 

Google says that 2.5 Flash is ideal for “high-volume” and “real-time” applications like customer service and document parsing. 

“This workhorse model is optimized specifically for low latency and reduced cost,” Google said in its blog post. “It's the ideal engine for responsive virtual assistants and real-time summarization tools where efficiency at scale is key.”

Google didn't publish a safety or technical report for Gemini 2.5 Flash, making it more challenging to see where the model excels and falls short. The company previously told TechCrunch that it doesn't release reports for models it considers to be “experimental.”

Google also announced on Wednesday that it plans to bring Gemini models like 2.5 Flash to on-premises environments starting in Q3. The company's Gemini models will be available on Google Distributed Cloud (GDC), Google's on-prem solution for clients with strict data governance requirements. Google says it's working with Nvidia to bring Gemini models to GDC-compliant Nvidia Blackwell systems that customers can purchase through Google or their preferred channels.

During its Cloud Next conference this week, Google unveiled the latest generation of its TPU AI accelerator chip.

The new chip, called Ironwood, is Google's seventh-generation TPU and is the first optimized for inference — that is, running AI models. Scheduled to launch sometime later this year for Google Cloud customers, Ironwood will come in two configurations: a 256-chip cluster and a 9,216-chip cluster.

“Ironwood is our most powerful, capable, and energy-efficient TPU yet,” Google Cloud VP Amin Vahdat wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. “And it's purpose-built to power thinking, inferential AI models at scale.”

Ironwood arrives as competition in the AI accelerator space heats up. Nvidia may have the lead, but tech giants, including Amazon and Microsoft, are pushing their own in-house solutions. Amazon has its Trainium, Inferentia, and Graviton processors, available through AWS, and Microsoft hosts Azure instances for its Maia 100 AI chip.

Ironwood can deliver 4,614 TFLOPs of computing power at peak, according to Google's internal benchmarking. Each chip has 192GB of dedicated RAM with bandwidth approaching 7.4 Tbps.

Ironwood has an enhanced specialized core, SparseCore, for processing the types of data common in “advanced ranking” and “recommendation” workloads (e.g., an algorithm that suggests apparel you might like). The TPU's architecture was designed to minimize data movement and latency on-chip, resulting in power savings, Google says.

Google plans to integrate Ironwood with its AI Hypercomputer, a modular computing cluster in Google Cloud, in the near future, Vahdat added.

“Ironwood represents a unique breakthrough in the age of inference,” Vahdat said, “with increased computation power, memory capacity, … networking advancements, and reliability.”

Updated 10:45 a.m. Pacific: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to Microsoft's Cobalt 100 as an AI chip. In fact, Cobalt 100 is a general-purpose chip; Microsoft's Maia 100 is an AI chip. We've corrected the reference.

Tessell, a startup developing a multi-cloud database-as-a-service, has raised $60 million in a new funding round led by WestBridge Capital ahead of its plans to expand its market presence and launch an AI-powered conversational database management service.

As data becomes more critical than ever, many companies are struggling to manage and store it efficiently. Legacy database solutions are often rigid, offering little flexibility across cloud providers. Meanwhile, most managed database services remain costly, commanding high rates for high performance.

Tessell aims to solve all this with its platform.

The four-year-old startup leverages decades of database kernel experience from its co-founders to offer enhanced operational database management, taking on existing relational database services, including Amazon's RDS.

“Tessell is a tessellation of enterprise data,” said co-founder and CEO Bala Kuchibhotla in an exclusive interview.

Kuchibhotla started Tessell after spending over a decade at Oracle and four years at Nutanix. He saw an opportunity to “reimagine” operational data management after looking at the problems companies face with existing database management services.

Tessell claims to deliver 10x the performance of existing database management services with a 64-73% savings within a three-year total cost of ownership thanks to its NVMe infrastructure. The technology does away with the industry-standard input-output operations per second (IOPS) metering and provides high IOPS and low latency, along with price predictability. Tessell also offers zero downtime on migrations and works to ensure databases stay up and running even if one cloud service goes down.

Tessell is compatible with all four major cloud service providers: AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud. It also supports leading database engines like MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. 

“If you are an AI application, you can spin up [or] spin down the databases that you need on the Tessell infrastructure,” Kuchibhotla told TechCrunch, adding that Tessell supports both traditional databases with vector extensions and standalone vector databases.

Tessell's all-equity Series B round, which also had participation from B37 Ventures and Rocketship.vc as well as existing investor Lightspeed Venture Partners, will help Tessell develop its AI-powered conversational technology designed to further simplify data management.

The San Ramon-based startup, which also has an office in Bengaluru, currently has a headcount of around 143 employees. It also has 40 customers, two-thirds of which are in India, including Moody's, Aditya Birla Capital, Tata Capital, Jubilant Ingrevia, and Forbes.

With the fresh funding, Tessell also plans to enter Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, enhance its go-to-market to scale up in the U.S. and India, and invest more in R&D to strengthen its services. In addition, the startup intends to look at analytics as its next possible line of business, enabling companies to funnel data from platforms such as Snowflake, Google BigQuery, or Microsoft Fabric for analysis on Tessell.

Google is upgrading Workspace, its suite of cloud-based productivity tools, with new AI capabilities.

The suite is gaining Workspace Flows, a tool designed to automate multistep processes such as updating spreadsheets and digging through documents for information. Flows can tap Gems, Google's brand of custom AI-powered chatbots, to handle specialized tasks, and it can also integrate with apps like Google Drive to retrieve data.

“Simply describe what you need in plain language, and Workspace Flows will design and build sophisticated, logic-driven flows,” Yulie Kwon Kim, VP of product for Google Workspace, wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. “We're also working with partners to connect Workspace Flows to other third-party tools you rely on, enabling it to support workflows beyond Workspace.”

The enhancements come as Google looks to make Workspace, which competes with platforms such as Microsoft 365, an AI-first experience. The search giant first began adding generative AI functionality to Workspace in March 2023, and recently eliminated additional fees for certain AI workspace features — though it did increase the price of Workspace plans.

Elsewhere in Workspace, Google Docs will soon get the ability to convert drafts into podcast-style overviews, à la NotebookLM's Audio Overviews, and revise snippets of copy. An upcoming feature called “Help me refine” will offer suggestions on how to strengthen arguments, improve structure, and make points clearer, said Kim.

In Google Sheets, a new feature set to arrive later this year called “Help me analyze” will provide guidance, spotlight trends, and help create interactive charts. In Google Meet, a tool called “Take notes for me” can summarize and recap specific topics from video calls. Google Chat users will be able to invoke Google's Gemini chatbot by typing “@gemini” in any conversation.

Google Vids, Google's AI-powered video creation app for work, will soon be able to generate video clips using Google's Veo 2 model, which Google is integrating with the app.

Lastly, Google said it's introducing new data residency controls that will allow customers to restrict where their data is processed to help comply with regulations such as the EU's GDPR.

> This blueprint of “potential calls” looks code, but it acts like data. It's structurally similar to function calls but it is more passive, inert, open to interpretation. We're yet to send this blueprint to the other computer which will actually interpret it.You've reinvented Free Monads: https://www.haskellforall.com/2012/06/you-could-have-invente...That article is a bit dense if you're less familiar with Haskell, but the basic idea is that you can write code that looks like:    do
      name <- prompt ""Who are you?""
      message <- concat ""Hello, "" name
      alert message

And what actually gets assembled is something resembling a syntax tree of operations, waiting to be interpreted.You could interpret it locally, or have the interpreter send requests to another computer. And (if such are your desired semantics) the interpreter can short-circuit the whole thing and return an error message if any step fails - similar to how you describe these as being ""potential function calls"", i.e. calls which as of yet may or may not successfully execute.Analogously, JavaScript already has a monad-like construct which can achieve something similar:    async () => {
      const name = await prompt()
      const message = await concat(""Hello, "", World)
      const result = await alert(message)
      return result
    }
  
But this is pure code, rather than data that can be interpreted in a custom way - it will always be ""interpreted"" by the runtime itself. The Haskell example is somewhat of a blend between data and code (it desugars to a tree of closures calling each other in sequence, which you have a lot of control over the execution of).Your React-style example attempts to make this concept into pure data. Though in some ways, a DSL becoming pure data wraps around and becomes pure code again. You need to parse it, semantically analyze it, and then execute it - in other words, you've invented a compiler.

    do
      name <- prompt ""Who are you?""
      message <- concat ""Hello, "" name
      alert message

And what actually gets assembled is something resembling a syntax tree of operations, waiting to be interpreted.You could interpret it locally, or have the interpreter send requests to another computer. And (if such are your desired semantics) the interpreter can short-circuit the whole thing and return an error message if any step fails - similar to how you describe these as being ""potential function calls"", i.e. calls which as of yet may or may not successfully execute.Analogously, JavaScript already has a monad-like construct which can achieve something similar:    async () => {
      const name = await prompt()
      const message = await concat(""Hello, "", World)
      const result = await alert(message)
      return result

What is value proposition of react component in comparison to older “mvc-inspired” frameworks? That you can drop a component in your code and call it a day. Don't need to wire up separate controllers, models and views. Just one thing.Now, if you want to add “auth” to your app (in react meta framework like next) you need to add component and probably add some routes and inject some middleware. With server components, you just add one component somewhere in the root of your app. Just one thing.All that over the wire format, suspended data fetching etc, are a result of solving that problem and keeping in mind that those components are slightly different. It takes more work, but in return we can interleave both types of components nearly freely.

In particular, the callback to Miguel's article about async/await (https://tirania.org/blog/archive/2013/Aug-15.html) is intentional. I'd like to see some parts of my article as making a similar argument for 'use client' / 'use server' and the concept of first-class cross-environment references module system.And as for practical benefits, I think the main benefit is composition--ability to compose and weave Server/Client building blocks together. Of course there's been myriads of approaches to server/client apps but I've never seen anything with the same compositional properties as RSC. I think Sam's talk (https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=9CN9RCzznZc) makes an amazing argument in favor of that viewpoint so I'll defer to him.

If you hydrate on the client, you need to run the same exact code on the server and again on the client - however, that means you now might need to bring in a big syntax highlighting library to the client.With RSC all of that is done server side, so you don't need to ship the syntax highlighting library.

But I've found f32 to be incredibly useful because it allows me to very spontaneously capture unexpected sounds with little to no setup or preparation. In fact, sometimes I even forego monitoring in favor of just quickly getting out the recorder and microphones and then hitting record -- since I don't have to fiddle with gain, I know that I can capture something usable rather than missing the opportunity altogether.When I have time to prepare a recording and it's not going to have a crazy amount of dynamic range, then sure, f32 isn't a make-or-break feature, and needing to do post-processing 100% of the time before the audio is usable in non-f32 contexts could be seen as a drawback. But for my use cases, absolutely useful and worthwhile.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","A new biosensor can detect bird flu in five minutes","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/09/1114252/new-bird-flu-sensor-disease-outbreaks/","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

The device may help prevent future outbreaks of the disease.

Over the winter, eggs suddenly became all but impossible to buy. As a bird flu outbreak rippled through dairy and poultry farms, grocery stores struggled to keep them on shelves. The shortages and record-high prices in February raised costs dramatically for restaurants and bakeries and led some shoppers to skip the breakfast staple entirely. But a team based at Washington University in St. Louis has developed a device that could help slow future outbreaks by detecting bird flu in air samples in just five minutes. 

Human cases in the US are on the rise and the virus is turning up in cows and dairy products. Luckily, we have some vaccines ready to go if needed.

Bird flu is an airborne virus that spreads between birds and other animals. Outbreaks on poultry and dairy farms are devastating; mass culling of exposed animals can be the only way to stem outbreaks. Some bird flu strains have also infected humans, though this is rare. As of early March, there had been 70 human cases and one confirmed death in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The most common way to detect bird flu involves swabbing potentially contaminated sites and sequencing the DNA that's been collected, a process that can take up to 48 hours.

The new device samples the air in real time, running the samples past a specialized biosensor every five minutes. The sensor has strands of genetic material called aptamers that were used to bind specifically to the virus. When that happens, it creates a detectable electrical change. The research, published in ACS Sensors in February, may help farmers contain future outbreaks.

Part of the group's work was devising a way to deliver airborne virus particles to the sensor. 

With bird flu, says Rajan Chakrabarty, a professor of energy, environmental, and chemical engineering at Washington University and lead author of the paper, “the bad apple is surrounded by a million or a billion good apples.” He adds, “The challenge was to take an airborne pathogen and get it into a liquid form to sample.”

The team accomplished this by designing a microwave-­size box that sucks in large volumes of air and spins it in a cyclone-like motion so that particles stick to liquid-coated walls. The process seamlessly produces a liquid drip that is pumped to the highly sensitive biosensor. 

Five years on from the start of the covid pandemic, are we ready for a potential avian influenza outbreak?

Though the system is promising, its effectiveness in real-world conditions remains uncertain, says Sungjun Park, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at Ajou University in South Korea, who was not involved in the study. Dirt and other particles in farm air could hinder its performance. “The study does not extensively discuss the device's performance in complex real-world air samples,” Park says. 

But Chakrabarty is optimistic that it will be commercially viable after further testing and is already working with a biotech company to scale it up. He hopes to develop a biosensor chip that detects multiple pathogens at once.

Shopping for streaming devices for your TV almost always boils down to just two questions: How fast is it, and how much does it cost? When we're talking about the Amazon Fire TV Cube, the answers are “extremely” and “21% less than usual,” at least as long as Amazon's limited-time deal that drops the price of the Fire TV Cube to just $110 is in effect.

Blazing, lag-free speed is the hallmark of the Fire TV Cube, with an octa-core processor that's twice as powerful as the Fire TV Stick 4K Max, which is certainly no slouch in the speed department. The Fire TV Cube is also the first streaming device to be Wi-Fi 6E compatible, so the pedal will always be planted on the metal when you're watching your favorite shows and movies.

See at Amazon

When you connect your compatible devices to the Amazon Fire TV Cube, your wish is Alexa's command. You can switch from streaming to cable and from cable to your gaming console by using only voice commands. The included Alexa Voice Remote Enhanced also virtually eliminates the need for multiple remotes — power, volume, channel surfing, and more are all unified in one voice-activated remote.

When you upgrade your streaming to the Fire TV Cube, you're also able to upgrade your HD shows and movies to 4K with Amazon's Super Resolution Upscaling. Your favorite movies and shows that you've only seen in HD will take on a new life entirely when you see them in 4K for the first time.

Nothing kills a streaming experience like a slow connection that causes content to load slowly, and then pause or stop repeatedly just when you're getting into the show. The Fire TV Cube is the first Wi-Fi 6E streaming device, and when you pair it with a 6E compatible router, your days of laggy performance are over. This latest version of the Fire TV Cube also has an Ethernet port for wired network connections.

The Fire TV Cube is universally connectible with all of Amazon's many smart devices, including Echos that can be used as speakers and Ring video doorbells. This blazing-fast streaming device is the ideal hub for your entire smart home, not just the home theater setup. With this 21% deal in place you can upgrade your streaming to the Amazon Fire TV Cube for just $110, but it's a limited-time offer, so be as fast as the Fire TV Cube and head to Amazon now.

Research out this week might help you plan your own version of the Ozempic diet, with the results of a survey revealing the foods that people tend to avoid, or eat less of, once they start taking GLP-1 drugs.

Scientists at the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station led the study, a survey of past, current, and potentially future GLP-1 users. They found that people were most likely to reduce their consumption of certain food groups, such as soft drinks and beef. Notably, though, people's desires for these foods didn't completely go away.

Ozempic and similar drugs mimic the natural GLP-1 hormone, which helps regulate our hunger and metabolism. The most popular GLP-1 agent today is semaglutide, the active ingredient in type 2 diabetes medication Ozempic and the higher-dose obesity drug Wegovy. Semaglutide and newer GLP-1 drugs help people lose substantially more weight than diet and exercise alone, primarily through reducing people's appetite and cravings.

Ozempic and Similar Drugs Could Help Ward Off Dementia, Study Suggests

According to the study researchers, however, there's still a lot we don't know about exactly how GLP-1 drugs change people's behavior and eating patterns. To learn more, they conducted a survey of roughly 2,000 people across four groups: people who are currently taking a GLP-1 drug for weight loss, people who have taken a GLP-1 drug in the past, people who are planning to take a GLP-1 drug, and people who haven't and aren't planning to take these drugs.

All of the respondents were asked to estimate their daily caloric intake over the past seven days, along with questions about how much they desired specific food groups. The current and former GLP-1 users were also asked if and how their consumption of specific foods had changed while taking these drugs.

As expected, people on GLP-1 therapy appeared to eat less overall than others and less than they did prior to starting the medication. The researchers estimated that people taking GLP-1 drugs ate between 720 and 990 fewer calories than before they started treatment. They also observed that GLP-1 users tended to consume fewer processed foods, sugar-sweetened beverages, refined grains, and beef. People also overall reported eating more fruits and leafy greens, as well as drinking more water, while taking these drugs.

“In conclusion, this study provides evidence that GLP-1s support weight management through calorie reduction and influence food consumption patterns by diminishing intake of high-calorie and processed foods,” the researchers wrote in their paper, published last month in the journal Food Quality and Preference.

Does Ozempic Really Cause Thyroid Cancer? What the Science Actually Says

Interestingly enough, though, people taking GLP-1 drugs still reported having a high desire for these foods. That suggests, the researchers say, that GLP-1s might change people's eating patterns by enhancing their taste sensitivity and/or altering their pleasure response to food. But more research is needed to work out the “specific physiological and metabolic pathways” affected by GLP-1 use, they add.

Either way, these findings should help inform people about what to expect when starting GLP-1 therapy, not to mention the junk and snack food industry. Some companies have already started to prepare for this impact, with the launching of less sugary products aimed at people taking GLP-1 drugs.

A newly discovered asteroid is on track for a close brush with Earth—and it might even slam into the Moon. Recently, astronomers got a closer look at the giant space rock, revealing its violent origin story.

Using the Keck Observatory on Maunakea, Hawaiʻi Island, a team of astronomers was able to identify the physical properties of asteroid 2024 YR4 and uncover its potential origin. The menacing asteroid may have broken off from a larger space rock following a collision. It also likely originated from an asteroid family in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter—an unlikely place for Earth-crossing asteroids to come from.

“The shape of the asteroid provides us with clues as to how it formed, and what its structural integrity is,” Bryce Bolin, research scientist with Eureka Scientific, said in a statement. “Knowing these properties is crucial for determining how much effort or what kind of technique needs to be used to deflect the asteroid if it is deemed a threat.” This research is set for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

The Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile discovered asteroid 2024 YR4 on December 27, 2024. Shortly after its discovery, NASA designated it a potentially hazardous object, with a nearly 3% chance of hitting Earth on December 22, 2032. After giving us quite the scare (or something to look forward to), NASA removed 2024 YR4 from its naughty list when calculations showed that the asteroid had a near-zero chance of hitting Earth.

Earth Is Safe From Menacing Asteroid—but Our Moon Might Take the Hit

The Moon, however, is still not safe from the flying space rock. NASA's Center for Near Earth Object Studies recently updated the odds of asteroid 2024 YR4 hitting the Moon, raising the risk from 1.7% in late February to 3.8% based on recent data collected by the Webb telescope and observations from ground-based telescopes.

If it does hit, the asteroid will not alter the Moon's orbit, and instead leave behind a fresh and sizable impact crater. “It's one of the largest objects in recent history that could hit the Moon,” Bolin, the lead author of the new study, said. “If it does, it would give scientists a rare chance to study how the size of an asteroid relates to the size of the crater it creates—something we haven't been able to measure directly before.”

Asteroid 2024 YR4 is estimated to be between 174 and 220 feet (53 to 67 meters) wide—about the size of a 10-story building. It has a flattened, irregular shape, and is about the same density as a solid rock, according to the new study. The asteroid spins in a retrograde direction once every 20 minutes.

Larger asteroids that are 100 meters (328 feet) or more are often called “rubble piles,” and are the remaining fragments that broke off from a larger parent asteroid in the aftermath of a collision. Rubble piles are, as the name suggests, broken-off pieces that clump together to form a loosely held asteroid. There are often large boulders that sit at the top of rubble pile asteroids. At its smaller size, 2024 YR4 may have once been a boulder that sat on the surface of a large rubble pile asteroid, according to the study.

The team behind the study also compared the newly discovered asteroid's orbit with that of near-Earth objects, and found that 2024 YR4 likely originated between the inner and central main belt. Earth-crossing asteroids—those whose orbits intersect with Earth's—often originate from the inner region of the main belt. As their orbits evolve, the asteroids are then kicked off onto a trajectory that sends them toward Earth.

The asteroid may have originated in the central main belt and drifted inward due to its retrograde spin, meaning it moves in the opposite direction of most objects in the solar system. That could explain why 2024 YR4 is unlike most other celestial visitors that cross Earth's path.

When it was first spotted, asteroid 2024 YR4 was 515,116 miles (829,000 kilometers) away from Earth. Since then, the space rock has moved away from us, and its next close approach won't be until December 2028. Ground-based telescopes from the International Asteroid Warning Network have been tracking the asteroid, but it will be too faint to observe until June 2028, according to NASA. That's why it was crucial to direct Webb's attention toward the asteroid, as well as the Keck Observatory telescopes, to gather as much data as possible before it is too difficult to spot.

“The data from our study will be used to assess the physical properties and shapes of potentially impacting asteroids, providing a great test case on the kind of rapid response observations that are necessary to characterize a potential threat like this object,” Bolin said. “The physical information about an asteroid's physical property (rubble pile vs solid rock) is crucial for planning mitigation efforts if necessary.”

Saturn's moon Titan is often pegged as one of the worlds in our solar system where life could theoretically exist. A new analysis concludes that is indeed possible, albeit incredibly unlikely.

Titan is known for being the only moon in the solar system with a dense atmosphere, and it also has bodies of liquid, including liquid water hidden under deep shells of ice. But alas, with all that going for it, an international team of astronomers determined that conditions on Titan would only be able to sustain enough biomass to equal one moderately chunky cat.

It's been 20 years since the Cassini-Huygens mission—a joint effort by NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Italian Space Agency—visited Titan. While the Cassini probe continued its journey through space, collecting data on Saturn and its moons, the Huygens lander separated to get an even closer look at one in particular. When it descended through the atmosphere and landed on Titan on January 15, 2005, it became the first human-made object to do so.

While there have been several places in the solar system that have been identified as being possibly hospitable to life, data collected by the probe indicated Titan could be among the likeliest candidates. Huygens found a dense atmosphere, where the chemical processes necessary for organic compounds (the building blocks of life) are able to form.

Waves of Methane Are Crashing on the Coasts of Saturn's Bizarre Moon Titan

However, just as an egg yolk is not a chicken, organic compounds don't necessarily indicate that life can form. To explore the possibility of microbial life on Titan, Antonin Affholder, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Arizona, led a team to assess how likely that scenario might be. They did so by assuming that if life did arise on Titan, it would survive by one of the most primitive processes known: fermentation, in which an organism converts organic compounds to energy without using any oxygen.

Yes, the process you nonchalantly toyed with to make sourdough during covid-19 is a sign of life—life you used to make your avocado toast, but still, life.

They determined that the organic compound most likely to be involved in Titan fermentation is glycine, an amino acid valuable to building protein. Glycine has been found on Titan's surface, but scientists wondered whether enough of it could make its way to the moon's liquid oceans. Those oceans—where life would have the best chance of surviving—are buried beneath ice that's 31 to 124 miles (50 to 200 kilometers) thick.

Unfortunately, the results are not favorable to anyone hoping to find microscopic ETs on the distant moon. As the astronomers explained in The Planetary Science Journal, it's not a definitive no, but it does seem unlikely. At the very least, if there is life, there's very, very little of it. The amount of glycine that would reach the liquid water would only be able to support 16.5 pounds (7.5 kilograms) of carbon. Again, that's the weight at which most house cats are put on a diet.

Signs of Life Could Be Found Close to the Surface of Two Nearby Moons

“There has been this sense that because Titan has such abundant organics, there is no shortage of food sources that could sustain life,” said Affholder in a statement. “We point out that not all of these organic molecules may constitute food sources, the ocean is really big, and there's limited exchange between the ocean and the surface, where all those organics are, so we argue for a more nuanced approach.”

“Such a tiny biosphere would average less than one cell per liter of water over Titan's entire vast ocean,” he concluded.

A bit of a bummer, but hey, sourdough has gotten you through worse.

With the Muse arc having come and gone disappointingly quick, Daredevil: Born Again can go back to what it's best at. Our penultimate episode, “Isle of Joy,” is a much more confident outing than last week, and it doesn't hurt that it gets its main players in a single location for an impressive finish.



The way things go throughout the episode, Matt and Heather's relationship sure has an impending expiration date, huh? Killing Muse has further affirmed her anti-vigilante stance, and to make matters worse, Matt learns Fisk is her secret client when they're invited to the inaugural ball later that night. His secrecy really comes to bite him in the ass here, since he can only vaguely allude to Fisk being bad news without giving up their whole history, so he just comes off frighteningly paranoid in his girlfriend's eyes. His morning gets even worse when he's summoned to jail by Poindexter, who opens the episode being moved out of protective custody and into a pretty packed general population section that knows he used to be FBI.

Ahead of the night's festivities, things are going well for Fisk. Since Muse's killing was attributed to his task force thanks to BB Urich, he's gone and brought Daniel into his inner circle while still keeping Sheila at arm's length. He also shows Vanessa that he's been keeping Adam in a cage, ultimately leaving the man's fate in her hands with a key and a gun on the table. Fisk and Adam both try to sway her, but her mind was always made up: she loves her husband, so she executes Adam in his cell. As she says to Heather later in the episode, the couple's past issues are “dead and buried,” and they're now on the same page about everything.

The Poindexter news gets two things done. First, it brings Matt back to Josie's, which we haven't seen since the opening minutes of Born Again's premiere. (Nice to have her and the bar back, even briefly.) Next, he learns Foggy spent his last night celebrating a future case, which is enough to make him go see Dex. Just two days in genpop has him ready to cut a deal with Matt so he can get out in exchange for flipping on whoever hired him to kill Foggy. Matt's response? Smash Dex's face into the table, the maybe the least painful way he could've hurt Dex. But Matt letting off some steam has consequences: next time we see Dex, he spits a tooth into a guard's eye and takes a uniform to hitch a bus ride into the city.

Dex will have to wait, though, because it's party time. It's a nice shindig to the general public, but the walls are closing in around the core cast. Small asides, like BB revealing she's sticking around Fisk to get evidence he murdered her uncle Ben, and Sheila feeling increasingly pushed out of the mayor's inner workings, are just the start of an increasingly hostile night. (Our brief check-in with the task force has Powell sticking a journalist's hand in a fryer, surrounded by his boys as he smugly gloats to police commissioner Gallo about how untouchable they've become.) Guests joining Fisk for a private conversation come out looking rattled or defeated on account of him threatening them–like say, siccing the task force onto Jack, who he knows is the Swordsman–into backing his Red Hook project. With Jack and other elites folding so easily, he's close to achieving his goals.

Only two separate, but equally troublesome obstacles remain before Fisk can call it a win. Matt can't touch him in public, but by abruptly taking Vanessa for a dance, he gives Fisk a perfect window of opportunity. While their respective partners are away, Fick doesn't outright tell Heather that Matt is Daredevil, but enough breadcrumbs are provided to put some extra strain on a relationship that's been pretty fraught the last few weeks. Meanwhile, Matt confronts Vanessa with what he knows: she hired Poindexter to kill Foggy, which she planned to tell Fisk before Matt swept her off her feet.

By the end of the episode, Dex is the bigger threat. Most of his scenes in the episode feature a filtered towards blue tones, to signify he's becoming Bullseye again, a rebirth that's completed by episode's end. With a police rifle in hand, he takes aim to shoot Fisk, only for Matt to throw himself in front of the bullet. As Florida Mass Choir's “Storm Cloud Rising” plays, the party descends into chaos while Matt bleeds out on the floor and he's illuminated in pure red. 

“Isle of Joy” was written by current Born Again showrunner Dario Scardapane and Jesse Wigutow, who came in alongside Heather Bellson—who penned the finale with Scardapane—during the creative refresh. This is one of three episodes made post-overhaul, and in addition to being one of the season's best episodes, it's a promising sign of where things are headed with season two. But first, we have to see how this all wraps up next week.

Intel is introducing new compliance policies for its suppliers, now that the U.S. has imposed new 25% tariffs on aluminum and stainless steel and eliminated all exemptions -- materials that are of surprising importance to the semiconductor industry.

On the surface, one might associate the company with silicon and little else. In fact, Intel uses quite a lot of metals beyond its semiconductor production facilities. Intel's integrated heat spreaders (IHS) use nickel-plated copper or aluminum for cheap SKUs, and CPU sockets and stiffening frames use stainless steel, as do brackets for various add-in-boards (accelerators, graphics cards, ethernet cards, etc.).

Heatsink fasteners are made of stainless steel, and screws are of course made of stainless steel too, whereas cooling systems use heatsinks made of aluminum and copper (including the Laminar RH1 and RH2) as well as fasteners made of steel. 

Since Intel uses quite a lot of aluminum and stainless steel, the company has implemented strict requirements for suppliers shipping products containing steel or aluminum into the United States due to updated U.S. tariff regulations effective March 12, 2025. These updates include a 25% additional duty on covered aluminum and steel products and their derivatives.

To comply with customs and avoid shipment delays or penalties, Intel requires suppliers to provide detailed information about the materials used in their products. This includes the weight and value of aluminum and/or steel, as well as specific details about the origin of the metal. 

For aluminum and its derivatives, suppliers must declare the primary and secondary countries of smelt and the country of the most recent cast. In the case of recycled aluminum products, the country of origin of the imported article must be specified. For steel components, suppliers must report the country where the steel was first melted and poured and must continue providing a steel mill certificate. 

Intel has made available an official affidavit form that suppliers must complete and submit to the provided email address to support customs clearance.

Suppliers using third-party manufacturers or brokers or purchasing ready-made items from local markets are still responsible for tracing and reporting this information. The lack of traceability does not exempt a product from compliance as suppliers must take steps to gather the data regardless of how the item was acquired. 

Even parts like warranty replacements or tools and pre-facility kits are subject to these duties, with metal value defined by its purchasing price before any processing. Intel emphasizes working closely with the supply chain to maintain transparency and regulatory compliance, encouraging all partners to use official channels and documentation to support smooth and lawful importation.

Tariffs are hitting companies hard.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is projected to have lost around $5.28 million in value as the company's shares took a tumble alongside the rest of the market. When Mr. Tan took the reins of the chip giant in March 2025, he needed to purchase $25 million of Intel stock to make him eligible for the nearly $68 million in bonuses. The stock price around this time was $23.96, allowing him to buy 1,043,406 shares. However, Intel's stock price at the time of writing is $18.90, putting the value of Mr. Tan's investments at less than $20 million.

The board likely required Lip-Bu Tan to purchase this stock to ensure he's invested in the company's performance, which is tied to his results as its chief executive. However, this recent drop has nothing to do with his performance, as he has only been on the job for around one month. Instead, this dip is part of the market chaos brought on by Trump's tariffs, with Intel and many other chip companies hitting record lows.

Some analysts wonder if Tan will purchase more Intel stock at this low price or if the company will launch a stock buyback plan to help reverse this trend. After all, Broadcom just announced a $10 billion stock buyback plan, which helped its stock price go up by 3%. The fabless chip maker said it made this move because it was confident in its products and services despite the ongoing upheaval in the American economy.

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is down 21.12% on his $25 million investment—1,043,406 shares bought at $23.96, now at $18.90, a $5.28 million loss. Is he buying more at this lower price, or will Intel announce a buyback like Broadcom to shore things up?$INTC pic.twitter.com/7errZwLUBNApril 8, 2025

It's unlikely that cash-strapped Intel will copy this strategy, though. The company's finances have reached the point that its former CEO was frustrated with the delays in releasing its CHIPS Act funding. Aside from that, it would be better for the company to focus on its 18A process node, which has already entered risk production, instead of playing with its stock price.

The $5 million reduction in value might seem like a significant sum, but CCN estimates that the Intel CEO is worth at least $593.2 million, which is just a drop in the bucket for him. Furthermore, anyone invested in the market, in general, will likely see a similar drop in the percentage. We'll have to wait and see how the tariffs will play out before we can truly determine if Mr. Tan lost a lot of money today, but hopefully, Intel and the rest of the industry will be able to bounce back from this chaos.

Intended to improve connector alignment and reduce wear.

Corsair has addressed a growing concern among PC builders regarding the slight play in the 12V-2x6 connector's terminals. The manufacturer clarifies that this wiggle room is standard, falls within their specifications, is intended to improve cable seating, and reduces wear based on their data. It is important to clarify these subtle nuances, especially considering how reports of RTX 50-series GPU connectors melting continue to surface, even when users follow the guidelines.

While it might seem counterintuitive that loose terminals would benefit such high-power connectors, they accommodate minor misalignments and relieve stress. If the cable conforms to the specifications, the primary reason for the slight wiggle room is that the 12V terminals make complete contact with the male pins on the GPU.

To clarify the terminology, ""pins"" or ""terminals"" refer to the electrical contact points within the connector housing. The housing or outer shell remains in place, but the internal pins or terminals have been shown to move slightly if force is applied to the cable.



Assuming the terminals were completely rigid, repeated forceful insertions and removals to achieve perfect contact would induce unwanted wear, thus reducing the connector's lifespan. Corsair verified this during its testing. For a more visual demonstration, we can refer to an X-ray shot shared by Jonny Guru, Corsair's PSU expert and renowned hardware enthusiast. The evident slack in several connector pins to the left doesn't translate to any negative impact in practice, as the X-ray scans on the right show all terminals making proper contact with the GPU.

Corsair uses three different vendors for the cables supplied with its PSUs. All of them meet their standard of 0.25mm to 0.55mm of play, including thicker individually sleeved cables. Some are rated at 0.25mm and 0.55mm, with the majority being 0.44mm.

If you find your terminals have too much wiggle room, it's best to contact customer support. RTX 50 reference GPUs cannot detect if each 12V pin is making proper contact. Potential suspects here are internal breaks in the pins or a connector that's not seated correctly. As these topics are closely related, many unsuspecting consumers might mistake the intentional play for a faulty cable or a potential fire hazard, hence Corsair's clarification.

TSMC set to spend $200 billion on U.S. manufacturing site


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


U.S. President Donald Trump stated that TSMC would be hit with tariffs as high as 100% if it failed to construct production sites in the U.S., reports Reuters. The company now plans to spend $200 billion on its U.S. manufacturing site, according to President Trump. He also denounced a $6.6 billion financial package provided to TSMC to build fabs in Arizona under the CHIPS Act enacted by the former President Joe Biden, arguing it was unnecessary.

""TSMC, I gave them no money, great company, most powerful in the world, biggest chip company in the world,"" Trump said at the event. ""They are spending $200 billion in Arizona building one of the biggest plants in the world. All that without money. All I did is say '...if you don't build your plant here you are going to pay a big tax 25% maybe 50% maybe 75% maybe 100%.'""

Trump says that when he threated Taiwanese chipmakers with massive import duties on their products in the U.S., TSMC agreed to increase its investments in its American operations from $65 billion till 2030 to $165 billion over an unspecified amount of time. TSMC's original plan included four chip production modules at its Fab 21 site near Phoenix, Arizona. The new plan is to build semiconductor chip production modules, two advanced packaging facilities, and an R&D center in the U.S.

This time around Trump mentioned ""$200 billion in Arizona,"" which is higher than $165 billion that TSMC committed to spend in March.

Considering that now Trump mentions $200 billion and up to 100% import tariffs, this might be seen by TSMC and other semiconductor companies as another threat from the U.S. administration. This comment is made as the industry braces itself for Trump's 'chip tariffs' that are starting 'very soon'. the same industry that is trying to digest the 20% tariff on lithography equipment crucial for chip production that U.S. chipmakers (including but not limited to Intel and TSMC) will have to pay from now on. Perhaps, now the most important fab tools got 20% more expensive for producers of semiconductor, Trump mentions $200 billion instead of $165 billion.

Speaking at an event held by House Republicans, Donald Trump said that companies in the semiconductor industry are financially capable and should not get support from the U.S. taxpayers to build fabs in America, thus again criticizing the CHIPS and Science Act imposed by the former administration to motivate chipmakers to build production sites in the USA. The CHIPS Act has attracted over $450 billion in planned private investments in the U.S. from companies like Intel, GlobalFoundries, Micron, Samsung, SK hynix, Texas Instruments, TSMC, as well as their peers from the supply chain, according to SIA.

COMMENTARY

 DISCLOSURES Authors and DisclosuresAuthor

Osaruese  Egharevba
Medical student, Imperial College London


 |  April 09, 2025  

In my third year of medical school, my mother announced she wanted to become a physician associate (PA). I always encouraged her to follow her dreams — until she told me her motivation.

“It's basically the same as being a doctor, but with less time at university,” she said.

Her words gave me pause. Despite years of medical training, even I wasn't entirely sure where the line was drawn between doctors and PAs. And if I was confused, how could patients be expected to understand the difference?

Physician associates were introduced to the NHS in the early 2000s to address workforce shortages, particularly in primary care. Initially framed as a supporting role under doctor supervision, the number of PAs has grown to over 3200, with plans to double that figure in the coming years. However, as their scope of practice expands, so does anxiety among doctors.

The tension between doctors and PAs has been simmering for years, but lately, the turf war has felt more intense than ever. What started as quiet unease has become an open fracture, and medical students like me are watching the conflict unfold in real time.

For some doctors, the PA role can feel less like a collaborative partnership and more like a threat to their professional identity. The British Medical Association has accused the government of using PAs as substitutes for doctors, compromising patient safety in the process. These concerns are not hypothetical.

In one widely publicised case, a 77-year-old woman died after a PA misdiagnosed her hernia as a nosebleed. She had believed she was seeing a doctor.

Separately, managers of Lewisham Hospital admitted last year in response to a freedom of information request that 19 of its PAs erroneously authorised prescriptions in 2018 and 2019. Drugs included morphine, fentanyl, and oxycodone.

Such incidents reflect a system willing to cut corners on safety while failing to address the root causes of the NHS workforce crisis. However well-intentioned, Pas are being asked to work beyond their competencies. Ultimately, patients always pay the price.

Resident doctors, after years of gruelling medical education, find themselves supervising PAs for the same — or even less — pay. Some argue that rather than easing their workload, PAs add to it.

I remember speaking to a doctor on placement who was particularly irked by PAs wearing stethoscopes, calling it “confusing to patients.” Although a stethoscope is just a tool, it has long symbolised the expertise and authority of doctors. This goes beyond professional pride — concerns about blurred lines are valid.

At NHS Grampian, a reported row over uniforms highlighted how easily patients might mistake PAs for doctors. Both PA and medical students wear identical black uniforms, with only a small label distinguishing between their roles. One medic there commented, “There is a big difference in the knowledge of a medical student on placement and a trainee physician associate. They are not doctors and never will be. Confusing the two roles is a risk to patients.”

For medical students, the future feels precarious. We hear stories like that of the GP in the Midlands working as an Uber driver to make ends meet while the government expands roles for those who have studied less and trained for a shorter time. Some of my peers wonder whether there will even be a place for us in hospitals by the time we qualify.

I understand why doctors are frustrated. Unfortunately, many doctors run the risk of projecting these frustrations onto well-meaning PAs. I can only imagine how demoralising it must be to work in an environment where your colleagues question your legitimacy.

Many PAs entered the profession to support an overstretched NHS, not to replace doctors. However, inconsistent training and regulation leave them vulnerable, often in unsafe situations. The forthcoming Leng review hopes to address these issues. In its submission, the Royal College of Physicians has suggested renaming the role “physician assistant” to clarify distinctions in clinical roles. This aims to provide the clarity needed to protect both PAs and patient safety.

The Royal College of General Practitioners has asserted that there should be no role for PAs in general practice. For many PAs, this stance might feel like a dismissal of their contributions, creating a tense atmosphere where they feel undervalued. Law firm Shakespeare Martineau has confirmed it is pursuing claims on behalf of affected PAs who have been dismissed or restricted in their roles in general practice.

The emotional toll on PAs cannot be ignored, as they continue to seek validation for their role and assurance that their contributions to patient care are recognised within a system struggling to understand how best to utilise their skills.

The real issue is not the presence of PAs, but the system that has created the conditions for this conflict. PAs have been misled about their role and are now facing the backlash. The solution is not to pit doctors and PAs against one another. Existing PAs, whatever their motives, have the potential to provide excellent patient care with appropriate training and oversight. If we are serious about patient safety, we must establish clear, enforceable boundaries for the PA role. PAs should work within a defined scope that supports, rather than substitutes, the work of doctors.

Instead of letting ourselves be divided, we must come together as a healthcare team. This includes doctors, PAs, and all roles in between. The decisions we make must always be guided by one principle: patient safety. Only by working in unity, with clear roles and mutual respect, can we ensure that the system serves the best interests of those who matter most: our patients.

 April 09, 2025  

Immune checkpoint (IC) inhibitor drug holidays are safe in patients with metastatic melanoma who achieve an objective response (OR) during therapy, according to a study of more than 200 patients in Poland.

More than 80% of patients maintained disease control without progression at 24 months after discontinuing immunotherapy. Those who had received IC inhibitor therapy for at least 24 months and achieved a complete response (CR) during therapy had the best outcomes, Anna M. Czarnecka, MD, reported at the 11th World Congress of Melanoma (WCM) and 21st EADO Congress 2025.

Notably, re-initiation of immunotherapy in those who progressed during the drug holiday also allowed for objective disease control, said Czarnecka of the Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, Warsaw, Poland.

She and her colleagues enrolled 222 consecutive patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who were treated at least 6 months with an immunotherapy based on anti–programmed death-1 and who achieved at least stable disease (SD).

The patients underwent imaging every 16 weeks during the drug holiday and were followed for a median of 63 months. Median time on IC inhibitor therapy before a drug holiday was 26 months.

Median overall survival (OS) was not reached, but 5-year OS was 86.2%, Czarnecka noted.

“At 1 year, more than 87% of patients were progression free, and at 3 years it was more than 60%,” she said.

Overall, 95 patients achieved a CR, and of those, 19 progressed during the drug holiday and seven restarted treatment. Sixty-five achieved a partial response (PR), and of those, 20 progressed and 10 restarted treatment. Sixty-five achieved SD, 29 of those progressed, and 22 restarted treatment.

Younger age was associated with longer drug holiday duration, but gender and disease subtype and stage were not significantly associated with drug holiday duration.

Of 39 patients who progressed during the drug holiday and restarted IC inhibitor therapy, 58.9% achieved an OR and 46.4% achieved progression-free survival (PFS) after 1 year. Median PFS in this subset of patients was 11.2 months.

Responses on IC inhibitor retreatment were CR in 16 patients, PR in seven patients, and SD in 16 patients. Of those who achieved a post–drug holiday OR, three included CRs in patients who had also achieved a CR during their initial IC inhibitor therapy.

Again, only younger age was significantly associated with OR during retreatment and with PFS, those treated for at least 24 months achieved the best outcomes, Czarnecka noted.

Median OS after the drug holiday started was not reached, but the 5-year rate was 79.3%.

Median PFS since the start of the holiday was not reached, but 3-year PFS was 65% for all patients and 72.4% among those who achieved CR.

The optimal duration of IC inhibitor therapy in routine clinical practice has not been clearly defined for patients with metastatic melanoma, and debates regarding de-escalation strategies are ongoing. These findings suggest an intentional immunotherapy suspension until disease progression is a safe and effective approach in patients who achieve a response during initial treatment, she concluded.

Czarnecka disclosed relationship with BMS, MSD, Novartis, and Perre Fabre.

 April 09, 2025  

SAN DIEGO — An adjunctive, first-in-class investigational prescription digital therapeutic significantly reduced monthly migraine days (MMDs) in patients with episodic migraine (EM) compared with sham results of a large study showed.

CT-132 (Click Therapeutics) is a mobile smartphone app that “targets top-down pain processing and central sensitization” using behavioral approaches and includes an eDiary tracker and short daily lessons/exercises with a decision-support tool, the investigators reported.

In the phase 3 ReMMi-D trial, which included more than 500 adult patients with EM, those randomly assigned to receive CT-132 for 4 weeks showed significantly reduced MMDs compared with those who received a sham digital therapeutic — meeting its primary endpoint. They also had significantly reduced disability and improved quality-of-life outcomes, along with high adherence rates.

“I think this is very exciting as a clinician who takes cares of patients because we don't have anything like this in our migraine armamentarium,” co-investigator Stewart J. Tepper, MD, professor of neurology at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, Hanover, New Hampshire, told Medscape Medical News.

“We know that behavioral techniques are helpful adjunctively, but large areas of the country just don't have access to them,” added Tepper, who is also vice president of the New England Institute for Neurology and Headache, Stamford, Connecticut.

The findings were presented on April 6 in a poster presentation at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) 2025 Annual Meeting.

A company representative reported that CT-132 is currently under review by the US Food and Drug and Administration (FDA) as a medical device. It isn't currently available to clinicians outside the research space.

“Despite advancements in pharmacotherapy, partial treatment response is common, driving an unmet need for additional reductions in MMDs,” the investigators noted in the abstract.

This need could be met by prescription digital therapeutics, which are not associated with adverse events (AEs) or other polypharmacy concerns, they added.

The CT-132 app “uses biologic and psychologic and behavioral approaches and then adapts to patient responses in order to take a person through a series of steps that, when they execute them, will help prevent migraine over the long term,” Tepper explained.

“It's a way of enabling people to access various state-of-the-art behavioral techniques to use alongside their existing medication to offer additional relief,” he added.

Interestingly, Click Therapeutics Chief Medical Officer Shaheen Lakhan, MD, PhD, was one of Tepper's neurology residents when he was at the Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland.

“He's interested in doing this because he sees a need and knows from a neurologic standpoint the importance of all of this,” Tepper said.

Adults with 4-14 MMDs during a 4-week “run-in” baseline period, as recorded in an eDiary, were randomly assigned to receive either adjunctive CT-132 (n = 286; mean age, 38.4 years; 92% women; 94% White) or a sham digital therapeutic to act as the control (n = 284; mean age, 38.9 years; 94% women; 92% White) for a 12-week treatment period. All participated in a 1-week safety follow-up.

The sham group received a mock-up app that resembled CT-132. It included an “inert daily cognitive task” in order to match the daily engagement from the active study app and used the same eDiary for capturing endpoint data. It was also created to provide “negligible effect on the neurophysiological systems implicated in migraine,” the investigators reported.

“It used ‘make work' tasks,” Tepper said. He added that a lot of work actually went into the creation of the noneffective sham app, including from in-house coders.

All participants received their allocated digital treatment as an add-on to acute and/or non–migraine-specific preventive medications. Exclusion criteria included use of calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP)–inhibiting medications.

Results at the end of 12 weeks of treatment showed a significant difference between the CT-132 group and the sham group for reduced MMDs (least-squares mean treatment difference, −0.9; P = .005). There was a mean drop of 3 MMDs for those receiving the active treatment.

The CT-132 group also had greater change in scores on the Migraine-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire from baseline to week 12 than the sham group (12.3 vs 4.68; P < .001), as well as greater improvements on the Patient Global Impression of Change scale (82% vs 43% improvement P < .001) and the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS, P = .002).

Tepper noted that a score > 20 on the MIDAS is considered severely disabled and a score > 40 is very severely disabled. “The study patients started in the 40s. And in the active group, they went down one subgrade — from very severely disabled to severely disabled. The sham group did not,” he said.

“In each of the patient-reported outcomes, there were demonstrable changes in the active group,” Tepper added.

Engagement levels were high for both groups, with a median of 81 lessons out of 84 completed by those receiving the sham app and a median of 84 completed by those receiving the active app.

In addition, 7.9% of the CT-132 group vs 5.8% of the sham group experienced AEs, most of which were mild or moderate. No AEs were judged to be related to treatment and there were no AE-related discontinuations or deaths.

An additional matching randomized controlled trial, called the ReMMiD-C bridging study, has also been conducted and included a different patient population that included those taking CGRP inhibitors. It also compared the prescription digital therapeutic with a sham app.

Asked about a press release comment he made when topline results for both studies were released in September that CT-132 is the first migraine digital therapeutic “to be studied with this degree of rigor,” Tepper double-downed.

“Find me another digital therapeutic [study] with a sham control, and with orthodox outcome measures that the FDA recognizes for pivotal trials of medications or devices,” he said.

Based on these results, and depending on what the costs may eventually be after FDA approval, “why wouldn't you add this to what you're recommending to patients? This is a new prospective way to go forward with our current toolbox,” Tepper said.

Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Teshamae Monteith, MD, chief of the Headache Division and professor of clinical neurology at the Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, called the study “novel” and said its strength is “the impressive lack of adverse events.”

Monteith, who is also the Topic Chair for Headache at the AAN annual meeting, was not involved with this research.

She added that the study duration and outcome measures appeared appropriate and similar to what is commonly done in pharmaceutical clinical trials. However, she also had some questions and concerns.

Monteith noted that she would have appreciated more demographic information, and she couldn't tell how many participants were in the intention-to-treat population.

Also, “I wish they had reported on analgesic use and on measures of comorbid anxiety and depression, which may be amendable to this type of intervention,” she said.

Overall, Monteith said that the concept of digital therapeutics “is tremendous,” because it offers a nondrug option and has the potential to improve access. However, in this particular case, she would have liked to have seen more details about the actual intervention and protocol.

“Some patients with migraine do not tolerate screentime, which may exacerbate symptoms such as photophobia, vertigo, and migraine in general. Also, we know there is a digital equity issue so that individuals with limited resources may have difficulties accessing the intervention,” Monteith said.

She added that in a future study she would also like to see the inclusion of individuals with chronic migraine.

This fully decentralized study was funded by Click Therapeutics. Tepper reported having numerous research funding and speakers bureau disclosures, as well as acting as a consultant and/or on advisory boards for several companies, including Click Therapeutics. Monteith reported that although she has a number of conflicts of interest related to migraine therapy, none is related to the study.

Patients with vision or hearing impairments face safety risks when taking medicines and using medical devices, the Patient Safety Commissioner for England has warned.

A report commissioned by Dr Henrietta Hughes identified “serious gaps and deficiencies” in how people with sensory impairments can access the information needed to use these products safely.

The report drew on evidence collected between September and December 2024. Sources included focus groups, responses to an electronic survey, and Yellow Card reports submitted to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). 

Common issues included inaccessible packaging, unreadable patient information, poor communication about medication changes, and a lack of suitable reporting mechanisms.

The report, The Safety Gap: Safety and Accessibility of Medicines and Medical Devices for people with sensory impairment, estimated that 237 million medication errors occur in England each year, despite safety campaign efforts. 

People with sensory impairment — including sight loss, deafness, hearing loss, or tinnitus — face “greater barriers to access the knowledge and information about medicines and medical devices needed to stay safe,” it highlighted. 

More than two million people in the UK live with visual impairment, including those with diabetes. Over 18 million adults experience hearing loss.

The report's author, Margaret Watson, professor of health services research and pharmacy practice at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, said better access is vital. “For any patient to use a medicine as it is intended, they must first of all have sufficient and accessible information to make an informed choice regarding whether to use it, and the anticipated benefits and risks of using it.” 

The report recommended a series of actions to improve safety for patients with sensory impairments. These included:

Dr Amit Aggarwal, medical director at the ABPI, explained that the industry is working on a “digital first” future for patient information. However, he acknowledged that non-digital formats must remain available for those who need them.

“We and other industry associations are currently working with both the medicines regulator and the Department of Health on this and will continue the drive towards piloting and then hopefully implementing electronic patient information leaflets,” he told Medscape News UK.

Printed leaflets remain a legal requirement in the UK. However, other countries — including the European Union, Australia, South Africa, Japan, and Singapore — offer a more flexible approach. This includes offering digital-first medicines information while ensuring that printed leaflets remain available upon request.

Julian Beach, interim executive director for healthcare quality and access at the MHRA, welcomed publication of the commissioner's report. He noted that the regulator had provided feedback ahead of publication. 

“We are committed to ensuring people of all abilities, including those with sensory impairment, have access to safe, effective, and high quality medicines and medical devices that they are able to use without issue,” Beach told Medscape News UK. 

He added that the regulator had set requirements, underpinned by legislation, to ensure manufacturers provide further accessible formats of product information for patients where required. 

Current legislation mandates that licensed medicines include the product name in braille on the carton, and information available in large print, braille, or in audio format on request. 

Beach said the MHRA supports ongoing efforts, including by patient groups, to improve access. 

“We recognise there are opportunities to improve medicines information based upon user research, including this latest report, to ensure the needs of this patient group are met, and we are committed to that work,” he said.

The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) said that it regularly hears from blind and partially sighted patients who struggle with medicine labelling, as well as having to repeatedly register their communication needs with health services.

Anna Tylor, chair of trustees for the RNIB, who is severely sight impaired, said, “If you receive appointment information in a format you can't read or are given medications with instructions in a tiny font, how can you manage your condition effectively?”

Tylor welcomed the report's findings. “The principles set out in the report are long overdue and are about putting patients at the heart of everything, so that people are treated equitably, and feel safer,” she told Medscape News UK.

Dr Sheena Meredith is an established medical writer, editor, and consultant in healthcare communications, with extensive experience writing for medical professionals and the general public. She is qualified in medicine and in law and medical ethics.

General practitioners (GPs) used exercise prescriptions and general advice, focusing on aerobic exercises, to discuss physical activity during consultations. GP Management Plans and a patient-centered approach were used to tailor physical activity recommendations.

“These findings have implications for the ongoing training and development of health promotion in approaching and discussing the topic of PA [physical activity] in routine care for current and future practicing GPs,” the authors wrote. “The findings of this study can contribute to establishing teaching and training resources to support GPs in their roles about different ways to talk about PA with patients (for example, opportunistic or systematic, with tools such as the GP Management Plan),” they added.

This study was led by Neha Giri, of the School of Primary and Allied Health Care at the Monash University. It was published online on March 31, 2025, in BJGP Open.

The qualitative nature of this study limited the generalizability of the findings. This study's reliance on a single GP-patient interaction restricted the understanding of long-term physical activity engagement. The voluntary participation of GPs may have introduced bias toward favorable behaviors.

This study was funded by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Australia. One author reported being supported by an National Health and Medical Research Council Investigator Grant. The authors disclosed no relevant conflicts of interest.

CHICAGO — The acquisition of cardiovascular practices by private equity firms has ballooned in recent years. Of the 342 cardiology clinics that have been acquired in the past decade, more than 94% occurred from 2021 to 2023.

Cardiology is rather newto theprivate equity space compared with specialties such as orthopedics, ophthalmology, and dermatology, speakers reported during a forum at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Scientific Session 2025. And because the experiences are new, there is considerable disagreement about how this trend will affect the field.

“Private equity is neither inherently good nor bad,” and it is not a uniform concept, said Jerry Blackwell, MD, MBA, president and chief medical officer of MedAxiom, an ACC organizational performance solutions company in Neptune Beach, Florida.

There is “tremendous heterogeneity” in private equity ownership contracts, and gaps in the field of cardiology make it ripe for change. “If there wasn't a problem, private equity wouldn't be part of the game,” Blackwell pointed out.

Cardiovascular practices are small and fragmented, but scalability is possible, which is driving private equity interest in cardiology. Plus, waste is rampant. And the market value of cardiovascular medicine is quite large, and the business models are complex. “If you put that in a blender,” that's what private equity aims to solve in all of its industries, Blackwell said.

Those critical of private equity say that patients and healthcare professionalism take a back seat in acquisition discussions. But private equity might not be much different from other ownership models in that respect, Blackwell said. “At scale, healthcare providers are once again abdicating ownership to the financial industry.”

“Private equity in the hospital space is nothing like private equity in the practice space,” he cautioned. “Most of the horror stories you're going to hear are in the hospital space. There are some horror stories in the practice space, but they've got nothing to do with cardiology.”

But what do practices look like once private equity firms exit? When private equity companies complete their short-term restructuring, the goal is typically to sell the practice and turn a profit for investors. So far, there has been little transparency in the way private equity firms operate in cardiology, Blackwell explained.

Arguments in favor of private equity generally center on the infusion of capital and resources to help struggling hospitals and practices thrive and the operational expertise in efficiency and quality they bring, said Rishi K. Wadhera, MD, associate director of the Smith Center for Outcomes Research and a cardiologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, who coauthored recent report on private equity acquisitions of outpatient cardiology practices.

The negative argument is that because of the way private equity incentives are structured, “there is a strong incentive to generate financial returns over very short time horizons. There's concern that that could adversely affect patient care,” he explained.

Among older adults, there was a 25% increase in hospital-acquired adverse events in private equity hospitals compared with that in control-group hospitals, according to a 2023 study.

This increase “was driven by a 27.3% increase in falls (P = .02) and a 37.7% increase in central line–associated bloodstream infections (P = .04) at private equity hospitals, despite placing 16.2% fewer central lines,” the authors wrote.

And there is a drop in the patient-care experience after acquisition, according to another study, also co-authored by Wadhera. “What we found was that private equity acquisition leads to a 5 percentage point decrease in global measures of the patient-care experience,” he reported. “That is considered large. For context, that exceeds changes in the patient-care experience seen during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Evidence suggests that the private equity acquisition of hospitals increases resource use and worsens quality of care. “That's the evidence base I feel most confident about,” Wadhera said. But so far, little is known about what happens in cardiology practices after private equity acquisition.

“It will be very interesting to see what sort of regulatory interventions, if any, are put into place, given, at least, the perspective of some of the investigations that have been launched,” he said.

Blackwell reported no relevant financial relationships. Wadhera received fees from Abbott Laboratories, CVS Health, and Chamber Cardio.

More effective combinations of targeted therapies, strategies to minimize side effects, the use of subcutaneous rather than intravenous immunotherapies, and artificial intelligence (AI) tools to better predict responses to immunotherapy are among the latest advances.

At the European Lung Cancer Congress 2025, held in Paris, France, by the European Society for Medical Oncology, numerous clinical trials unveiled new avenues to improve the survival and quality of life of patients with metastatic lung cancer.

Each year, 50,000 new lung cancer cases are diagnosed in France, with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for 80% of these cases.

More than two thirds of lung tumors are diagnosed at the metastatic stage, making them inoperable. Despite the poor prognosis, the average 5-year survival rate has doubled from 10% to 20% over the past two decades, indicating steady, incremental progress.

“There is no single type of lung cancer; there are many different types identified, notably by their genetic markers,” explained Nicolas Girard, MD, PhD, thoracic oncologist at the Institut Curie in Paris, France, during a press conference at the congress. These tumors carry various mutations, including EGFR, KRAS, ALK, BRAF, and HER2 mutations. In France, 100% of NSCLCs benefit from genetic analysis to identify mutations that may be treatable with targeted therapies.

Among the major advances presented at the congress were the findings from the international MARIPOSA phase 3 trial, which evaluated not only a single targeted therapy but also a combination of two targeted therapies against lung tumors with an EGFR gene mutation, showing a significant advancement.

“For patients with this mutation, which affects 20% of cases, targeted therapies are available, he said. Most patients respond well, with tumor shrinkage and improved survival,” Girard emphasized.

“However, after an average of 18 months, these medications tend to lose their effectiveness. This trial showed that a dual-targeted approach is significantly more effective than using a single drug.”

The MARIPOSA trial, involving more than 1000 patients, compared the survival outcomes of amivantamab combined with lazertinib, both drugs targeting the EGFR mutation, with those of osimertinib alone, a standard anti-EGFR therapy.

“The results revealed that after 3 years, 60% of patients receiving the combination therapy were still alive compared with 51% with monotherapy. After 42 months, the gap widened further, with survival rates of 56% and 44%, respectively,” said the study co-author Enriqueta Felip, MD, PhD, head of the Thoracic Cancer Group within the Oncology Department of the Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain.

Anti-EGFR–targeted therapy alone now is surpassed by the combination of the two treatments in this indication. “A request has been submitted to the transparency commission for such a combination to be available in France. In the near future, these dual combinations could be paired with other molecules, such as antibody-drug conjugates, as trials have also shown promising results with such combinations,” Girard said.

As part of the MARIPOSA trial, the randomized COCOON study, led by Girard, investigated strategies to prevent the more significant side effects associated with dual anti-EGFR therapy. The trial evaluated the effectiveness of prophylactic interventions such as oral antibiotics, topical skin moisturizers, scalp lotions, and other local skin care measures.

According to Pascale Tomasini, MD, oncologist and lung expert at Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de Marseille in Marseille, France, who also participated in this trial, this approach reduces the incidence and severity of skin-related side effects by 70%. Therefore, it is possible to intensify targeted therapy while minimizing toxicity.

At this congress, other preliminary trials of targeted treatments also showed promising results in lung cancers with KRAS mutations, which account for 29% of cases. Similarly, new data from the multicenter phase 1/2 SOHO-01 trial involving a HER2 inhibitor targeting 3% of NSCLCs driven by this mutation were described as highly encouraging.

In the field of immunotherapy, which is indicated for certain types of lung cancer, recent studies have identified new strategies to differentiate between likely responders and nonresponders. Although only 30% of patients benefit from immunotherapy, predicting who will respond remains challenging. Researchers from Institut Curie, Inserm, and Mines Paris-PSL have combined multiple data types — genomic, radiomic, histopathologic, and clinical — within AI algorithms. Their findings suggest that combining all four data types significantly improves the ability to predict treatment responses.

Another key advance concerns patients with operable lung cancer. French researchers have confirmed the findings of the CheckMate 816 study in real-world settings; three doses of immunotherapy before surgery improved response rates and reduced the risk for death and long-term recurrence by 40%.

Finally, immunotherapy can be administered subcutaneously in lung cancer. Clinical trials have shown that this route of administration is equally effective as the intravenous route. Patients can now be treated at home instead of receiving infusions at the hospital. This is another small victory for the quality of life of patients.

Disclosure: Gilles Montalescot MD, PhD, has disclosed the followingrelevant financial relationships: Received research grants from: Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd; Amgen Inc; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP; Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc; Brigham and Women's Hospital; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company; Biotronik; Cardiovascular Research Foundation; CCC; Celladon; CME Resources; Daiichi Sankyo Inc; Eli Lilly and Company; Elsevier; Europa; French Federation of Cardiology; ICAN; INSERM; Lead-Up; Medtronic Inc; Menarini Group; Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp; Pfizer Inc; Sanofi-Aventis; Servier; TIMI Study Group; WebMD LLC 

In recent months, the US has significantly reduced or eliminated funding for numerous agencies responsible for conducting global medical research. How will this affect French, European, and international clinical trials? 

Gilles Montalescot, MD, PhD, professor emeritus of cardiology at the Pitié-Salpêtrière University Hospital in Paris, France, and chairman of ACTION Group, the hospital's academic research organization dedicated to clinical trials in cardiology, shared his insights in an interview with Univadis France, a Medscape Network platform.

The ACTION Group comprises a network of 166 hospitals involved in more than 60 studies.

Industry-sponsored trials conducted by health companies are likely to continue as usual because these budgets remain unaffected. In the US, most major international pharmaceutical and medical device companies are based there and will continue their development in the future. It is likely that this research will remain consistent. 

The research most at risk is academic research funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which has an annual budget of approximately $70 billion (€65 billion). Budget cuts could affect academic laboratories at universities, both large and small. Some NIH institutes specializing in various fields are located in southern states to promote regional development and may also face reductions, leading to job losses and diminished access to care for some Americans in these regions, many of whom supported President Trump's election. This decision is ideologically driven and could weaken science overall, as well as research at universities that have expressed dissenting opinions. 

It is important to note that research in the US is advanced, well-organized, and dynamic. For example, for the past 25 years, I have consistently sent young professionals pursuing academic careers in cardiology to spend at least a year in a US research laboratory. This is essential because there is no equivalent data available elsewhere. In Europe, it is challenging to conduct a year of high-level clinical research as easily as in the US, where resources, ongoing studies, and research organizations are more advanced. Currently, one of my residents is in Boston at Harvard for 2 years, conducting academic research. In November, a young clinical fellow from our team will leave for training in New York. 

Every year, we send someone for training because what the US offers has no equivalent in Canada or Europe. It is regrettable that the new direction of US policy sends a negative signal regarding fundamental, clinical, and applied research. In the future, if the situation deteriorates significantly, it is conceivable that young clinical fellows who have completed a master's degree and are pursuing a thesis for an academic career will face greater challenges in conducting research projects. 

It is difficult to imagine, because the best universities are often American. Moreover, the US remains attractive to the international scientific community, including French researchers who often emigrate and sometimes do not return because the resources available in the US surpass those in France. Japanese researchers have followed a path similar to that of Europeans. 

With its economic growth, China could reach this level, particularly as academic research in the country is progressing significantly. However, we have not yet reached this stage. Europe could also show more ambition, although the European pharmaceutical industry is currently not thriving. There are few leading pharmaceutical companies in Europe. India and China often subcontract or replicate health products and devices. However, these countries could become more innovative and play a larger global role in the future than they do now. 

It is true that we should not react impulsively to this issue. However, these new measures negatively affected what was working very well and was a source of pride for the US, admired internationally. There are examples of this greatness in the past: The US National Cancer Act, launched by Richard Nixon to “cure” cancer, saw investments increase from $500 million per year to billions of dollars annually. Although cancer has not yet been cured, this initiative has resulted in significant advances in biology, immunology, and cancer treatment. Scientifically, this was highly profitable, even though the initial goals were not fully achieved. 

In Europe, we haven't seen the implementation of such large-scale initiatives, and cardiovascular diseases remain a low priority.

This initiative sends a strong signal that we are open to continuing collaboration with our American colleagues and are ready to welcome them to France. It is important to note that we will not change the existing flow of researchers between Europe and the US, which has been ongoing for decades. However, it is positive and beneficial for all universities to follow the example of amU. 

If other universities manage to attract American researchers seeking temporary experiences at French institutions, it will be advantageous. This dynamic could stimulate researchers in France and foster international collaboration. I am not certain that amU has the resources to host many American researchers. Nevertheless, the idea is worth replicating, and I am unaware of similar initiatives. 

It is important to note that, regarding funding for French academic research, it is more about rationing than about investment. Consequently, it seems unlikely that we could offer lessons to the American research system. 

Everyone will be affected by the NIH funding cuts. Take, for example, immunology and cancer research in Kentucky. Kentucky is a Republican state, yet funding will be cut, just as it will be at Harvard in Massachusetts. These cuts are not limited to East Coast universities; everyone will feel their impact.

Bridging a €5-€10 billion funding gap will require cuts to research budgets across various NIH institutes, including those in poor and rural states where they were first established. Furthermore, the humanities and social sciences, which depend entirely on public funding, are even more at risk, with certain sectors, activities, or research expressions at risk of being censored. 

The first executive order, before the one targeting USAID, involved withdrawal of the US from the World Health Organization (WHO). This severed a critical link in disease surveillance, particularly for infectious diseases, between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and the WHO. This connection is essential for monitoring, diagnosing, advising, and managing emerging diseases. With this link severed, it is conceivable that the WHO, based in Europe, could function without US participation. 

The second decision regarding USAID is a logical consequence of the first decision. Funds are now to be spent primarily within the US, as if diseases are confined by borders. However, this approach is likely to be costly. Diseases know no borders. For example, measles is spreading in Southern states, and polio is reemerging in the US. This is happening in the context of the US Secretary of Health expressing doubts about the effectiveness of vaccinations.

In infants with extremely low birthweight (ELBW), no difference in intermittent hypoxaemia (IH) or neurocognitive outcomes at 24 months was observed between liberal and restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategies, research showed.

""Liberal transfusions, resulting in an overall mean haemoglobin increase of ~1 g/dL will not reduce IH during postnatal days 8-49. Hence, liberal transfusion strategies as in ETTNO should not be adopted to reduce IH (even though a RBCT [red blood cell transfusion] in an anaemic infant with severe IH may acutely/transiently reduce the burden of IH),"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Axel R. Franz, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany. It was published online on March 26, 2025, in Archives of Disease in Childhood-Fetal & Neonatal Edition.

Due to missing FiO2 data, this study could not distinguish between normal SpO2 > 97% and hyperoxaemia, limiting the calculations of target range and percentage time spent with hyperoxaemia. SpO2 was less rigorously recorded than that in similar trials, and recordings that lasted beyond postnatal day 49 were limited due to early transfers. Only 55% of the ETTNO cohort was included; however, this subgroup appeared to be representative of the whole cohort. Additionally, the Bayley Mental Developmental Index Score used for cognitive assessment had limited accuracy.

The ETTNO trial was funded by the German Research Foundation. The authors of this study reported having no conflicts of interest.

 April 09, 2025  

Some neurologists and a consumer watchdog are raising concerns that a direct-to-consumer telehealth platform affiliated with the drug company Eli Lilly — marketed to individuals concerned about memory loss — could lead to misdiagnoses or unnecessary treatment with anti-amyloids.

Lilly, which makes the once-monthly anti-amyloid infusion donanemab (Kisunla), announced in late March that patients would be able to quickly access a neurologist for diagnosis via its telehealth platform, LillyDirect.

The drugmaker said its aim is to “help people experiencing memory and thinking issues to overcome barriers to diagnosis and care.”

Eric Widera, MD, professor of medicine at the School of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, said he had doubts about Lilly's motivation. “They're a drug company, and they want to sell their drug,” Widera told Medscape Medical News.

As previously reported by Medscape Medical News, the US Food and Drug Administration approved donanemab for early Alzheimer's disease in July 2024.

Lilly did not report any sales of donanemab until the fourth quarter, when it announced revenue of $8 million. Given the drug's reported annual cost of $32,000, this suggests that approximately 250 individuals received the drug. In late March, the European Medicines Agency recommended against approving donanemab.

Widera said the telehealth platform could have some benefits, such as potentially earlier detection of dementia or Alzheimer's disease or earlier referrals to specialists, but added that it wasn't clear whether the clinicians providing consultations via the Lilly platform would be neurologists or neurologists trained in dementia diagnosis.

Adriane Fugh-Berman, MD, professor of pharmacology and physiology at Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, DC, told Medscape Medical News that telehealth can be useful for follow-up visits or for getting specialist care in remote areas. But it is also becoming “a tool for drug companies to essentially sell their drugs directly to consumers,” said Fugh-Berman, who directs PharmedOut, a Georgetown center that educates healthcare professionals and students about industry marketing practices.

Widera and Fugh-Berman both said that the lack of financial details about the arrangement between Lilly and its partner Synapticure, a telehealth and disease management company focused on neurodegenerative diseases, is concerning.

There's potential for conflicts of interest because Synapticure is being supported by Lilly to potentially offer a recommendation for treatment with donanemab, said Widera.

Researchers from Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, recently reported in The New England Journal of Medicine that drug company/telehealth partnerships, such as LillyDirect, may violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. This law prohibits incentives for referrals or arrangements that could encourage clinicians to provide unnecessary or inappropriate care.

Lilly has reportedly said that it does not receive any compensation from telehealth companies for referrals and does not offer incentives for third parties to prescribe its medications.

A handful of senators, led by Dick Durbin, said Congress wanted answers about the arrangement. They “steer patients toward particular medications and create the potential for inappropriate prescribing that can increase spending for federal health care programs,” the senators wrote to Eli Lilly.

“Synapticure is fully independent of Lilly” and “exercises autonomous clinical judgment,” Eric Anderson, MD, Synapticure's chief medical officer, told Medscape Medical News. He added that the telehealth company is “not incentivized to prescribe Lilly medications” or to meet any quotas and that the drug maker does not pay its physicians.

With a nationwide shortage of neurologists, Widera wondered how they could be so readily available through Synapticure.

Anderson said that Synapticure's model is “very attractive” to neurologists. “Being able to be a 50-state specialty provider that is focused on providing access and comprehensive care to people who are hard to reach is a mission and vision that resonates well with neurologists,” said Anderson.

While Lilly and Synapticure say virtual visits can speed up diagnoses, some question whether those diagnoses will be accurate.

The process of getting in to see a specialist might be easier, “but what is the end result, and is that good for patients” asked Fugh-Berman. “How much of this is really making people who are normally functional into dementia patients?”

Anderson noted that some individuals who use the platform may already have a clear diagnosis of cognitive dysfunction or dementia, while others will have no diagnosis. A care navigator first checks whether the individual's insurance covers a telehealth visit and asks for any available medical records, imaging, or lab results. If the person has not previously undergone cognitive screening, a trained navigator will administer the Montreal Cognitive Assessment or a similar test.

A Synapticure neurologist or geriatrician experienced in dementia care then reviews the records and tests and determines if the person is eligible for an in-depth evaluation via telehealth, said Anderson.

David Knopman, MD, professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, said that increasing access to cognitive specialists is laudable. “There's no question that the access to specialty dementia care is horrible,” Knopman told Medscape Medical News. However, he added, “Getting the right diagnosis is not trivial.”

Knopman said he had concerns about telehealth, especially if it is used for initial diagnosis.

“There's nothing like a face-to-face, unhurried interview with a patient and informant by a specialist in person,” he said. Knopman said he conducted virtual evaluations during the COVID pandemic and found it “terribly inadequate,” especially for new patients.

“Since you can't touch the patient or really watch them walk, or do the rest of the neurologic exam, all of the clinical information that would relate to, say, Lewy body disease and the motor disorders that can co-occur with it would be missing,” he said.

In addition, there are other potential pitfalls, said Knopman. He said that at the Mayo Alzheimer's clinic, roughly half of the individuals evaluated are ultimately not suitable candidates for lecanemab or donanemab, often because they were previously misdiagnosed.

Both Widera and Knopman also wondered how patients who lived in some areas would be able to access PET imaging, an infusion center, or specialty care and follow-up monitoring if they were donanemab candidates.

Anderson said that Synapticure aims to connect patients with all aspects of care, including imaging, infusions, and safety monitoring. If any of these elements are unavailable — perhaps because of the patient's geographic location — the treatment does not proceed.

Widera and Knopman reported no relevant conflicts.

Hello. I'm Dr David Johnson, professor of medicine and chief of gastroenterology at Eastern Virginia Medical School and of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. 

Why is the oral microbiome important? As a gastroenterologist, why do I talk to my patients about it and recommend that you do as well? 

I'll explain why this is an important tactic and also highlight a recent article in The American Journal of Gastroenterology that shares the results of a national cohort study investigating the association between periodontitis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 

But first, let me give you some background.

The oral microbiome is the second largest microbial community in the human body, after the gut microbiome. It includes an array of fungi, bacteria, amoebae, flagellates, archaea, and viruses, all of which can be potential pathogens. 

Our oral microbiome can act as a facilitator not only for protection but also for aggravation when dysbiosis occurs. We may think of this primarily in terms of oral health issues, such as cavities and gingival disease. However, the systemic effects of the oral microbiome are relevant to both gastrointestinal (GI) disease and non-GI disease. 

These systemic risks occur for several reasons. 

The oral microbiome can be a source of cytokine upregulation and result in translocation of an array of bacteria, fungi, etc., and the delivery of their metabolites to individual organ systems. 

The mouth and oropharynx are a site for the upregulation of cell adhesion-like processes, activation of toll-like receptors, induction of reactive oxidative species, or generation of mutation-inducing DNA changes. 

Particularly important is the possibility for upregulation of T helper (Th) 1 and Th17, which are involved in cytokine upregulation for interferon and interleukins, respectively. 

In a healthy process, Th1 and Th17 allow us to protect ourselves. Yet, as we generate them in an aberrant way, it may result in significant consequences.

Findings regarding dental health in the United States are generally not good, despite our parents' firm reminders to always brush our teeth before bed. 

A 2024 oral health survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that nearly 21% of adults aged 20-64 years of age had one or more permanent teeth with untreated decay. Additionally, complete toothlessness (edentulism) occurred in more than 1 in 10 adults aged 65-74 years and in nearly 1 in 5 aged 75 years or older. 

This is important for GI diseases. 

There is a substantial and growing body of evidence that the oral microbiome influences diseases like colorectal cancer (as discussed in a previous presentation), esophageal cancers, Barrett's esophagus, squamous ulcer of the esophagus, metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease, and hepatocellular cancer, as well as some evidence on pancreatic ductal cancer. 

The oral microbiome's role in the pathogenesis of IBD makes sense, given that this disease and periodontitis share overlapping features, including upregulated cytokines and chronic inflammation. 

With this background in mind, let's turn to the recent study I mentioned earlier from researchers in South Korea. 

This team analyzed a cohort of over 2.2 million individuals, which captured approximately 97% of the country's population. Periodontitis was identified by dentists during oral health screenings. The cohort was followed for a median of 17 years.

Investigators found that the incidence of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis were 11.6 and 32.4, respectively, per 100,000 person-years. Among those with periodontitis, the risk for Crohn's disease was nearly 30% higher (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.32) and the risk for ulcerative colitis was approximately 20% higher (aHR, 1.21).

Investigators also looked at the influence of various oral hygiene interventions on the incidence of IBD. Among those who reported frequent tooth brushing (defined as three or more times a day, which sounds like a lot), the risk of developing Crohn's disease was reduced by 12% (aHR, 0.88); however, there was no significant risk reduction for developing ulcerative colitis among these participants. 

But the main finding is that, longitudinally, the incidence of IBD was significantly associated with the presence of periodontitis. 

Prior studies also support a bidirectional association between IBD and periodontitis. In them, the authors cited animal data showing a mouse model with Crohn's disease developed periodontitis, as well as longitudinal data indicating that those with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease were more prone to develop periodontitis. This reflects the underlying cytokine upregulation that takes place with these conditions. 

How many of us take a dental history in our patients? I certainly didn't. 

We probably all consider other established risk factors for IBD, such as diet, sleep quality, and smoking, among others. To that list, we need to now add dental history and begin asking our patients about it.

I suspect that you may be the only person to ask your patients that question, especially in some rural and underserved areas with limited-to-no access to dentists. Ask your patients about the key features of good oral hygiene, including tooth brushing and flossing, as well as whether they undergo dental scaling and dental evaluations at least twice a year.

We need to start paying attention to this aspect of our patients' health. 

Although we often focus on new interventions and medications, we should take a step back and look at what we're missing. Oral hygiene is incredibly important. 

I personally don't recommend the use of a mouthwash because it can negatively impact the good bacteria in the mouth. However, I do recommend foundational techniques like dental brushing, flossing the teeth, and lingual brushing. The microenvironments in the mouth may not be addressed by simply brushing your teeth, as it potentially misses the sublingual and subgingival components. Implementing additional hygiene strategies can positively influence the oral microbiome, which, in turn, can make a difference in IBD and other GI diseases, not to mention non-GI diseases as well. 

Whether we practice in gastroenterology or in another field, we can start to make a difference here. Perhaps we should ask ourselves: Can we also be better dentists? This is not to replace our dentist colleagues, but rather to step in and amplify the benefits of good oral hygiene. 

Please take this into consideration the next time you have discussions around IBD as well as the multitude of inflammatory diseases that are associated with the oral microbiome. 

I'm Dr David Johnson. Thanks for listening.

The United States immunization program stands as a notable public health accomplishment. As pediatricians, we have spearheaded efforts to educate parents and support vaccine recommendations, leading to significant reductions or eliminations of numerous infectious diseases in the United States. In January 2025, Texas reported a measles outbreak. We were unprepared for the report of an unvaccinated child's death, the first measles-related fatality since 2019. Many were alarmed by the response of Health and Human Services Head Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, who downplayed the severity of the situation by stating, ""Outbreaks happen all the time... healthy children don't die from measles,"" and suggested that diet and vitamins could prevent infectious diseases without urging vaccination.

Tables 1 and 2 show the impact of administering immunizations. The US program has achieved a level of success such that many healthcare providers have never encountered patients with several of the listed diseases. The recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) are based on scientific evidence. A review of vaccine development and the rationale behind the CDC's involvement in the US immunization program follows.

Edward Jenner developed the smallpox vaccine in 1796, marking the start of the vaccine era. Between 1914 and 1955, seven vaccines were licensed in the US, including rabies, typhoid, pertussis, influenza, tetanus, diphtheria toxoids, and polio. After the severe polio epidemic in 1952, parents eagerly sought the inactivated polio vaccine approved in 1955. Congress passed the Polio Vaccine Assistance Act to fund CDC efforts to provide vaccines. In 1962, President Kennedy signed the Vaccination Assistance Act for mass immunization campaigns. The Federal Immunization Grant Program followed in 1963, funding states to purchase vaccines and support immunization programs authorized under section 317. At that time, only diphtheria-tetanus-polio and smallpox vaccines were available. 

The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) was established in 1964. It is a federal advisory committee charged to review current licensed vaccines and all newly licensed vaccines, and to make recommendations for their use to the CDC director for the US civilian population. 

Between 1963 and 1969, oral polio, rubella, and both live and inactivated measles vaccines were licensed. The inactivated measles formulation was withdrawn from the market in 1967. In 1964, a significant rubella epidemic occurred, resulting in 12.5 million infections, including 50,000 pregnant women. This outbreak led to the birth of 20,000 neonates with congenital rubella syndrome, along with an increase in fetal losses (11,250) and neonatal deaths (2100). Measles remained a concern, with 500,000 cases occurring annually. In 1966, the CDC launched its first measles eradication campaign; within 2 years, the incidence had dropped by 90%. 

In the US, because of our immunization program, the last case of naturally acquired smallpox occurred in 1949, and in 1971, ACIP no longer recommended the routine administration of the smallpox vaccine. However, smallpox remained an issue globally, and proof of vaccine receipt was often required for international travel. 

In 1966, the World Health Organization launched a global smallpox eradication program, with 44 countries participating. The global eradication of smallpox was officially declared in 1980, following the last reported case in Somalia in October 1977. 

Vaccine development remained robust from 1977 to 2024. Over 20 new vaccines or new formulations of older ones were licensed, and ACIP recommendations for use were published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Not all licensed vaccines are recommended for routine use; many are intended for international travel or specific populations, such as military personnel or laboratory staff.

In 1995, the first harmonized childhood immunization schedule was issued by ACIP, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. This schedule is subsequently updated every January. As an intern in the early 1980s, I saw three vaccines on the schedule providing protection against seven diseases. Currently, there are 12 vaccines providing protection against 16 diseases on the routine childhood schedule, and four vaccines providing protection against six diseases on the routine adolescent schedule. Many, including myself, have observed the decline in cases of Haemophilus influenzae type b, invasive pneumococcal disease, rotavirus, and varicella since the vaccines were licensed.

However, the current measles outbreak is concerning. Historically, we have experienced small outbreaks, typically secondary to international travel in unvaccinated individuals. In 2024, the CDC reported a total of 285 cases of measles from 33 jurisdictions, 198 of which were associated with 16 outbreaks. As of March 24, 2025, 350 outbreak-related cases have been reported from Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma alone. There are additional unrelated measles cases from 10 other jurisdictions.

New leadership at the CDC, and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s suggestion to review the link between vaccines and autism, may unnecessarily raise parents' concerns about vaccine safety. Extensive research has consistently demonstrated that vaccines are both safe and effective. The question he raises has been answered. Extensive scientific research has demonstrated that there is no correlation between vaccines and autism. Conducting this study again diverts resources from essential research, such as determining the causes of autism. It may also result in lower immunization rates, potentially leading to a resurgence of preventable diseases.

For the 2023-2024 school year, CDC reported US kindergarten immunization rates: DTaP (92.3%), HBV (93%), MMR (92.7%), polio (93%), and varicella (92.6%), all showing declines from 2022-2023. Vaccine exemptions increased to 3.3%, with nonmedical exemptions rising from 1.9% to 3.1%. As the primary care provider, you are a highly trusted information source. We must continue to safeguard our patients and educate their families to ensure they have the opportunity to lead a full and productive life. Our goal is to prevent additional measles cases and other vaccine-preventable diseases from resurfacing. Mr Kennedy has limited the vaccine information routinely available on the CDC website.

A recent publication in the International Journal of Cardiology, Pulmonary artery denervation in pulmonary hypertension: A comprehensive meta-analysis, has shed light on the potential of pulmonary artery denervation (PADN) as an innovative intervention for pulmonary hypertension (PH), a condition that places patients at risk for right heart failure and death. Co-authored by Dr. James Jenkins, a cardiologist at Ochsner Health, the study analyzed data from multiple clinical trials to assess the therapeutic and clinical impact of PADN in PH patients. 

PADN has emerged as a promising treatment, showing significant improvements in several key hemodynamic parameters and clinical outcomes. The meta-analysis, which reviewed 14 studies involving 372 patients, revealed that PADN could reduce metrics such as mean right atrial pressure (mRAP), mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Simultaneously, it improved cardiac output (CO) and performance on the six-minute walk test (6MWT), highlighting its potential to enhance overall patient health. 

Despite these encouraging results, the authors emphasize the importance of conducting larger-scale clinical trials to confirm PADN's efficacy, establish its safety profile, and refine treatment protocols. Future research should also investigate the procedure's long-term effects on patient outcomes and quality of life. 

Pulmonary artery denervation has become a promising therapeutic intervention in the management of pulmonary hypertension. While our findings suggest a substantial role for PADN in treatment protocols, continuous research is crucial to fully understand its broader implications and long-term benefits."" 

Dr. James Jenkins, cardiologist at Ochsner Health

As cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death globally, advancements like this represent critical progress in addressing life-threatening conditions. This study not only underscores the value of innovation in cardiology but also highlights the ongoing need for rigorous research to develop more effective and life-changing treatments for patients with complex conditions like pulmonary hypertension.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study reveals sex differences in bone regeneration","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250409/Study-reveals-sex-differences-in-bone-regeneration.aspx","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 13:09:00 GMT","

Bone regeneration continues to be a critical challenge in tissue engineering, with unpredictable outcomes often hindering clinical application. Current strategies overlook key factors such as donor differences and biological sex, both of which play a significant role in fracture healing. While cartilage intermediates have shown promise, the transition from cartilage to functional bone remains poorly understood, and a lack of quality metrics that are predictive of bone regeneration across patients hinder clinical implementation. Moreover, the influence of biological sex on bone repair, particularly in younger patients, remains an underexplored area. These challenges highlight the urgent need to understand how donor and sex-specific mechanisms affect bone regeneration.

Published (DOI: 10.1038/s41413-025-00418-z) on March 26, 2025, in Bone Research, a groundbreaking study led by KU Leuven in collaboration with international researchers examined bone-forming callus organoids derived from human periosteal cells. The team compared organoids from male and female donors, analyzing their extracellular matrix composition, transcriptomes, and secreted proteins. Their findings unveiled sex-dependent pathways in the cartilage-to-bone transition, offering fresh insights into personalized tissue engineering.

The study revealed striking differences between male and female-derived organoids in terms of cartilage formation. Male-derived organoids predominantly produced hypertrophic cartilage (HyC), featuring large, transparent structures rich in glycosaminoglycans and collagen II. Female-derived organoids, on the other hand, tended to develop fibrocartilage (FiC), consisting of smaller, denser tissues that lacked hypertrophic markers. Transcriptomic analysis uncovered a shared set of chondrogenic genes but distinct progenitor markers, suggesting early divergence in the differentiation process.

A key highlight of the study was the identification of 84 secreted proteins common to both cartilage-to-bone pathways, but not present in non bone-forming tissue, including agrin (AGRIN), osteopontin (SPP1), angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPL4), autotaxin (NPP2) and bone morphogenic protein 1 (BMP1). These proteins are critical in driving bone maturation, angiogenesis and matrix remodeling.Despite their morphological differences, both male and female organoids successfully regenerated bone in mice, though the HyC organoids produced larger volumes. Notably, male cells exhibited faster proliferation and deposited more extracellular matrix, highlighting the role of biological sex in progenitor cell activation.

Prof. Ioannis Papantoniou, senior author of the study, emphasized the significance of these findings: ""Our work bridges the gap between developmental biology and clinical translation. By decoding sex-specific repair mechanisms, we can design smarter living implants tailored to individual but also groups of patients. The secreted protein panel is a game-changer for monitoring implant quality without invasive sampling.""

The implications of this research are profound, offering the potential to revolutionize treatments for bone defects with sex-specific or donor-matched therapies. The identification of secreted protein biomarkers could streamline the manufacturing process, reducing costs and enhancing the reliability of advanced therapeutic products. Clinically, these advancements could benefit younger patients (aged 25-45), who often struggle with non-union fractures. Moving forward, future research will focus on validating these biomarkers in larger animal models and exploring the influence of hormones. Ultimately, this study underscores the crucial role of biological sex in regenerative medicine, advocating for a shift toward personalized approaches in tissue engineering.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Breakthrough nanoparticle delivery method targets brain inflammation for multiple conditions","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250409/Breakthrough-nanoparticle-delivery-method-targets-brain-inflammation-for-multiple-conditions.aspx","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 05:00:00 GMT","

Oregon State University researchers have discovered a way to get anti-inflammatory medicine across the blood-brain barrier, opening the door to potential new therapies for a range of conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and cancer cachexia.

The delivery method involves specially engineered nanoparticles, tiny bits of matter no larger than 100 billionths of a meter.

Tested in a mouse model, the dual peptide-functionalized polymeric nanocarriers reached their intended destination, the hypothalamus, and delivered a drug that inhibits a key protein associated with inflammation.

""Our work presents a significant breakthrough,"" said Oleh Taratula, professor in the OSU College of Pharmacy.

Findings were published today in Advanced Healthcare Materials.

The hypothalamus is a small but vital part of the brain situated below the thalamus and above the brainstem, and it plays a key role in maintaining homeostasis – the body's internal balance. It regulates body temperature, manages sleep cycles, hormone production and emotional responses, and controls hunger and thirst.

In this study, researchers specifically looked at the hypothalamus as it pertains to cachexia, a deadly weight-loss condition associated with cancers of the ovaries, stomach, lungs and pancreas and other chronic conditions such as renal failure, cystic fibrosis, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and HIV.

People with cancer cachexia will lose weight even if they eat, and not just fat but muscle mass as well. The debilitating syndrome affects up to 80% of advanced cancer patients and kills as many as 30% of the cancer patients it afflicts.

Inflammation of the hypothalamus plays a pivotal role in dysregulating those patients' appetite and metabolism. As cachexia progresses, it significantly impacts quality of life, treatment tolerance and overall survival chances.""

Oleh Taratula, Professor, OSU College of Pharmacy

The systemic delivery of anti-inflammatory agents, including the IRAK4 inhibitors used in this research, to the hypothalamus presents significant challenges, Taratula said, mainly because of the restrictive nature of the blood-brain barrier.

The blood-brain barrier, often referred to as the BBB, is a protective shield separating the brain from the bloodstream. The BBB is made up of tightly packed cells lining the blood vessels in the brain and controls what substances can move from the blood to the brain.

It allows essential nutrients like oxygen and glucose to pass through and blocks harmful substances such as toxins and pathogens, keeping the brain safe from infections and damage. But it can also deny entry to therapeutic agents.

""An additional hurdle, even if you can get through the BBB to the hypothalamus, is hitting the bullseye within the hypothalamus – the activated microglia cells that act as key mediators of inflammation,"" Taratula said. ""Our nanocarriers show a dual-targeting capability, and once in the microglia, drug release is triggered by elevated intracellular glutathione levels. We demonstrated, for the first time, that nanocarriers can successfully deliver an IRAK4 inhibitor to the hypothalamus of mice with cancer cachexia.""

The scientists observed substantial reductions in key inflammatory markers in the hypothalamus, and the nanocarriers led to a 94% increase in food intake and significantly preserved body weight and muscle mass. And the implications extend far beyond cancer cachexia, Taratula added.

""The nanoplatform's ability to deliver therapeutics across the BBB and target microglia opens new possibilities for treating neurological conditions characterized by brain inflammation, including Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis,"" he said.

Taratula was joined in the study by College of Pharmacy colleagues Yoon Tae Goo, Vladislav Grigoriev, Tetiana Korzun, Kongbrailatpam Shitaljit Sharma, Prem Singh and Olena Taratula, and by Daniel Marks from Endevica Bio.

The National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Research Foundation of Korea funded the research.

 A team of researchers from the Rice Biotech Launch Pad at Rice University has developed an implantable ""cytokine factory"" that safely triggers potent immune responses against hard-to-treat cancers, including metastatic melanoma, pancreatic and colorectal tumors.

The study, published in The Journal of ImmunoTherapy of Cancer, details how an immunoprotected device near the tumor microenvironment containing cells engineered to locally release interleukin-12 (IL-12) - an ""IL-12 cytokine factory"" - successfully induces the recruitment of specialized immune cells called precursor exhausted T cells (Tpex cells). This Tpex cell recruitment results in a large, durable population of tumor-targeting T cells with broad molecular profiles, both in isolation and in an enhanced manner when implemented in combination with other immunotherapy approaches.

The IL-12 cytokine factories in combination with checkpoint inhibitors successfully eliminated local and distal tumors in preclinical models of metastatic melanoma and colorectal and pancreatic cancers. In addition to this robust efficacy signal, the IL-12 cytokine factory demonstrated safety in both mouse and nonhuman primate models.

This published research will serve as the foundation for an investigational new drug application (IND) with the U.S. FDA in early 2026, and RBL LLC expects to launch an emerging biotech company centered on the groundbreaking IL-12 cytokine factory technology.

""We designed the IL-12 cytokine factory to enhance immunotherapy approaches while minimizing toxicity, a critical need in the treatment of particularly aggressive cancers,"" said Omid Veiseh, professor of bioengineering, faculty director of the Rice Biotech Launch Pad and senior corresponding author of the publication. ""IL-12 is particularly impactful compared to other cytokines, as our research demonstrates that other cytokines primarily recruit homogeneous T cell populations and show reduced efficacy over time, while IL-12 generates a more robust antitumor response by recruiting a more durable, broader repertoire of tumor-targeting T cells.

""We are incredibly grateful to ARPA-H for their support in advancing this groundbreaking project and are hopeful that this technology will significantly impact the lives of cancer patients by enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy approaches in the clinic.""

Harnessing the cellular immune system to target solid tumors is a common but often fraught approach to fighting cancer as the associated challenge of efficacious treatment without toxicity remains elusive. Our study demonstrates not only the efficacy of this technology in preclinical models but also its safety profile, which is a critical aspect as we move toward clinical trials. This research represents an important step forward in the quest to provide more effective treatments for patients battling metastatic cancers.""

Nathan Reticker-Flynn, assistant professor of otolaryngology at Stanford University

The intermittent fasting diet, which involves periods of severe calorie restriction, may be on the way out, as new research from the University of Surrey is suggesting that rather than drastically reducing calories, people can achieve similar metabolic benefits by cutting back on carbs.

In Surrey's study, participants aged 20-65 years who were overweight or obese, followed three different diet plans for one day: a normal carb diet, a low-carb diet with balanced calorie intake, and a low-carb diet with significant calorie restriction.

Researchers found that both low-carb diets, regardless of calorie reduction, led to improvements in the participants' metabolic markers, and better handling of a high fat meal, including reduced levels of triglycerides - a type of fat in the blood that may lead to heart disease - and a shift towards burning fat for energy.

We found that by simply restricting carbohydrates, without enduring extreme calorie restriction, we can reap the metabolic effects associated with short-term fasting. This suggests that periodically reducing our carbohydrate intake could be a more accessible and sustainable way for people to manage and improve their metabolic health.""

Dr. Adam Collins, co-author of the study and Associate Professor of Nutrition at the University of Surrey

The study, published in the European Journal of Nutrition, also highlighted that while participants experienced increased hunger on the low-carbohydrate days, it didn't translate into increased food intake over the following two days. This suggests that the body may adapt to the reduced carb intake, potentially making it easier to adhere to this diet in the long term.

Dr. Collins added:

""This research offers a promising new perspective on dietary interventions for metabolic health and could have an impact on managing conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease and obesity.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New drug compound prevents long COVID symptoms in mice","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250408/New-drug-compound-prevents-long-COVID-symptoms-in-mice.aspx","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 02:35:00 GMT","

Researchers have shown a new drug compound can prevent long COVID symptoms in mice – a landmark finding that could lead to a future treatment for the debilitating condition.

The world-first study found mice treated with the antiviral compound, developed by a multidisciplinary research team at WEHI, were protected from long term brain and lung dysfunction – key symptoms of long COVID.

Researchers hope the unprecedented results could lead to clinical trials and the first treatment for the disease in the future.

WEHI researchers have developed a drug compound that can protect mice from contracting long COVID symptoms.

The world-first study also found the compound can treat acute COVID with better efficacy than Paxlovid – the leading treatment currently approved for COVID-19.

It's hoped the results could lead to clinical trials and an oral treatment for long COVID in the future.

Long COVID, also known as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), is a chronic condition characterised by symptoms that last for weeks or months after contracting COVID-19.

It is a significant health burden that remains poorly understood – with symptoms ranging from breathing difficulties, brain fog and chronic fatigue. 

Despite millions of people worldwide reporting these symptoms, the cause of long COVID remains largely unknown and there is no approved treatment for the disease.

Corresponding author and WEHI Laboratory Head, Dr. Marcel Doerflinger, said the landmark results could be a turning point in the hunt for treatments to support people at risk of developing this condition. 

With 5% of people who contract COVID-19 going on to develop long COVID, the disease has morphed into a silent pandemic where millions are battling symptoms with more questions than answers.

Our pre-clinical studies have achieved something no currently approved therapy has done to date – preventing the most debilitating symptoms of long COVID in mice.

While more research is needed to develop a drug that can be used in humans, seeing these milestone results in the unique mouse models developed at WEHI suggests this could be a real possibility in the future, which is incredibly exciting.""

Dr. Marcel Doerflinger, Corresponding Author and WEHI Laboratory Head

While currently approved therapies for COVID-19 like Paxlovid target a critical coronavirus protein known as Mpro, WEHI researchers identified another protein, termed PLpro, as a promising drug target in 2020.

Professor David Komander has spent over 15 years studying the family of proteins that includes PLpro and co-led the large, multidisciplinary WEHI team that spearheaded the discovery of new PLpro 
inhibitors.

To find a new drug compound that could target this critical protein, the team turned to the National Drug Discovery Centre (NDDC), headquartered at WEHI.

""Existing drugs had hit several hurdles to be effective in blocking PLpro in cells – our team wanted to see if we could find new ones capable of overcoming these barriers,"" Prof Komander, a corresponding author and Division Head at WEHI, said.

""In order to do this, we screened over 400,000 compounds to see if we could uncover novel drug-like molecules that had potential against this protein.

""To have identified a drug target and then develop a novel drug compound against it in less than five years is an incredible feat that would have been impossible without the advanced technologies, speed and scale of the NDDC and multidisciplinary team at WEHI.""

Dr Shane Devine, a co-first and corresponding author on the paper, said the team also found their novel compound can potentially treat acute COVID better than currently available antivirals for the 
disease. 

""Our study has provided the first evidence to prove PLpro is a powerful new drug target for COVID-19 treatments, while also showing its potential ability to treat the virus with unprecedented efficacy,"" Dr Devine said.

Paxlovid is the leading COVID-19 treatment, but is currently only recommended for people who are considered at risk of severe disease.

A key limitation of this treatment is that it requires two compounds to interact with each other for the treatment to be effective – meaning it can also interfere with many other medications. 

""Paxlovid and other antivirals in the market target Mpro and have these same issues, highlighting the urgent need for more research to enhance COVID-19 treatments that can provide greater access to more patients,"" Dr Devine said.

""The SARS-CoV-2 virus also continues to mutate, meaning it's only a matter of time until Paxlovid will no longer work.

""Our findings could lead to a future drug to help close these critical gaps.""

The project will continue collaborating with the Centre for Drug Candidate Optimisation (CDCO) and the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (MIPS) to evaluate the biopharmaceutical properties of this antiviral compound.

The research is supported by the Medical Research Future Fund, the Wellcome Trust and generous philanthropic donations for COVID research and translation.

A review published in The Laryngoscope indicates that climate change's effects on pollen seasons and concentrations are contributing to increasing rates of allergic rhinitis, or hay fever.

When investigators assessed research published between 2000 and 2023, they identified 30 studies that reported on the current epidemiological state of allergic rhinitis, described factors related to climate change, and observed how global warming is affecting pollen seasons and allergy symptoms.

Sixteen studies reported longer pollen seasons and/or higher pollen concentrations related to climate change. As an example, total pollen emissions in the U.S. are projected to increase by 16–40% by the end of the century and pollen season length to increase by 19 days. Four studies reported an increase in allergic rhinitis–related health care usage, particularly among low-income residents. Two studies reported that health care professionals want more education on climate change. 

Physicians are uniquely positioned to witness the impact of allergic rhinitis on patient outcomes and can adapt their practice as climate change intensifies. As trusted voices in the community, they should leverage their frontline experience to advocate for meaningful change in addressing the climate crisis.""

Cancer diagnoses traditionally require invasive or labor-intensive procedures such as tissue biopsies. Now, research published in ACS Central Science reveals a method that uses pulsed infrared light to identify molecular profiles in blood plasma that could indicate the presence of certain common cancers. In this proof-of-concept study, blood plasma from more than 2,000 people was analyzed to link molecular patterns to lung cancer, extrapolating a potential ""cancer fingerprint.""

Plasma is the liquid portion of blood, depleted of any cells. It carries diverse molecules such as proteins, metabolites, lipids and salts throughout the body. Some molecules carried by blood plasma indicate potential health conditions. For example, unusually high levels of prostate-specific antigen are used to screen for prostate cancer. Theoretically, a medical test that measures a broad range of molecules could identify a pattern specific to different cancers, leading to quicker diagnoses and reduced costs. To look for telltale chemical patterns of cancer, Mihaela Žigman and colleagues tested a technique called electric-field molecular fingerprinting that uses pulsed infrared light to profile complex molecular mixtures in blood plasma.

First, the researchers used the electric-field molecular fingerprinting technique to send ultra-short bursts of infrared light through plasma. They analyzed samples from 2,533 study participants, including people with lung, prostate, breast or bladder cancer and those without cancer. For each sample, they recorded the pattern of light emitted by the molecular mixtures in the plasma - called an ""infrared molecular fingerprint.""

Using these complex patterns from individuals with and without cancer, the researchers taught a machine learning model to identify molecular signatures associated with the four types of cancer. The computer model was tested on a separate subset of participants' samples to see how well the model could perform on unseen test data. The analytical technique demonstrated a convincing level of accuracy (up to 81%) in detecting lung cancer-specific infrared signatures and differentiating them from control samples obtained from individuals without cancer. However, the computer model's performance had lower success rates detecting the other three cancers. In the future, the researchers aim to expand and test the approach to identify additional cancer types and other health conditions.

Laser-based infrared molecular fingerprinting detects cancer, demonstrating its potential for clinical diagnostics. With further technological developments and independent validation in sufficiently powered clinical studies, it could establish generalizable applications and translate into clinical practice - advancing the way we diagnose and screen for cancer today.""

Vapourtec's pioneering eBPR is an innovative, self-contained, electronically adjustable back pressure regulator that does not require any external reference gas pressure.

Back pressure regulators (BPR) have, until now, been fixed and manually or electronically adjustable through the external control of gas pressure.

Vapourtec MD Duncan Guthrie explained: ""A BPR is a critical part of any flow chemistry system. It regulates the pressure at the inlet by opening up as necessary to precisely maintain the desired upstream pressure which is usually the reactor pressure.

""Additionally, the BPR has applications in most chemical processes for providing pressure relief for liquid, gas or mixed fluids.

""The wetted flow path of the Vapourtec eBPR has only Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and Perfluoroalkoxy alkanes (PFA) fluoropolymers contact surfaces,"" he added.

The stats are impressive with Vapourtec's eBPR delivering precise control of back pressure in the range 0.5 to 20 bar (g) over a flowrate range of 0.05 ml/min to 30 ml/min. It works with fluid temperatures up to 100 C.

The eBPR is available with or without an integrated user interface with both options having the choice of remotely setting back pressure by serial commands using RS232 protocols.

The eBPR is a game changer when it comes to back pressure regulation offering flexibility, precise control and increased scope for novel chemistry.""

A study carried out by researchers from the University of Granada (UGR), in collaboration with the Andalusian Association of Midwives, has determined that the healthcare provided by these qualified professionals has a positive impact on health and on the functioning of healthcare systems internationally.

The umbrella review was based on a sample of 228,509 pregnant women, 72,388 postpartum women and 7,931 midwives from various countries, including Australia, Iran, Spain, the United States, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Canada and China. The article, which appears in Matronas Hoy, a journal published by the Spanish Association of Midwives, was written by Rafael Caparrós González, a researcher at the UGR's Department of Nursing, and his team.

«Midwifery is an internationally recognised profession in all health systems and midwives are considered essential figures in the sexual and reproductive health of women throughout their lives, and in the overall health of newborns up to 28 days after birth,» says Caparrós.

Every year, more than 134 million childbirths take place around the world, often benefiting from the assistance of qualified midwives. The UGR researcher points out that the healthcare provided by midwives favours normal childbirth (eutocia) and reduces the need for medical intervention. Midwives are also able to reduce the number of induced births. In this regard, there is scientific evidence that children born through induced labour are at a higher risk of developing neurological disorders by age 12.

«In addition, according to the World Health Organization, women assisted by qualified midwives are more likely to continue breastfeeding six months after giving birth, which has been shown to be neuroprotective for babies,» adds Caparrós.

This professional care also has a positive impact on perinatal mental health, i.e. the mental health of women during pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period, by reducing levels of tokophobia (fear of childbirth), anxiety, and stress, which in turn leads to less frequent use of epidurals and medical instruments during childbirth. According to this macro-study, qualified midwives are also able to detect and screen for certain perinatal mental health problems.

The research shows that these professionals save healthcare systems around the world millions of euros. «In Australia, it has been calculated that midwives generate savings of 12 million dollars a year. With regard to breastfeeding in Spain, the savings could reach 5.6 million euros per year for each percentage point increase in exclusive breastfeeding rates. And in England, the savings from improved perinatal mental health generate savings of approximately 6.6 million pounds per year,» the researcher concludes.

Experiments revealed that the researchers' fish swim bladder–based hydrogel enhances cardiac cell adhesion and stretching while promoting new blood vessel formation and causing immune cells to fight inflammation. The hydrogel also provided sustained support for heart contractions. These effects were seen after hydrogel treatment in cultured cells and in a rat model of ischemic heart failure.

The irreversible loss of cardiomyocytes-or heart muscle cells-following ischemic events underpins the pressing need for novel regenerative strategies in myocardial repair. By harnessing the unique bioactivity of fish swim bladder–derived biomaterials to enhance hydrogel performance, this innovative approach promises to significantly advance the restoration of cardiac function and overcome current therapeutic limitations.""

New research from the University of Sydney has revealed poor oral health is significantly associated with higher instances of migraines, abdominal and body pain in women. 

Published in Frontiers in Pain Research, the world-first study identified specific oral microbes correlated with certain pain conditions, suggesting a potential relationship between the oral microbiome and the nervous system. 

The findings highlight the importance of good oral health to potentially mitigate pain and improve overall wellbeing, prompting further exploration into the role of oral microbiota in chronic unexplained pain conditions. This includes fibromyalgia, a condition experienced by 67 percent of the study participants. 

This is the first study to investigate oral health, oral microbiota and pain commonly experienced in women with fibromyalgia, with our study showing a clear and significant association between poor oral health and pain.""

Joanna Harnett, Lead Investigator Associate Professor from the Faculty of Medicine and Health

""Our findings are particularly important to fibromyalgia which, despite being a common rheumatological condition, is often underrecognised,"" said first author and PhD candidate in the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sharon Erdrich. 

""Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterised by widespread musculoskeletal pain, and headaches including headaches, as well as fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive problems."" 

The research examined associations between self-reported oral health, the oral microbiome, and various pain presentations in a group of New Zealand women with and without fibromyalgia. 

Oral health was assessed using the WHO oral health questionnaire and evaluated against body pain, headaches, migraines, and abdominal pain using validated instruments, including the Short-form 36 (which measures quality of life), the International Headache Society headache survey and the functional bowel disorder severity index. Strong associations were evident between oral health scores and pain and each of these were associated with specific microbes found in the mouth, which were assessed using advanced genomic technology. 

Participants with the poorest oral health were more likely to suffer from higher pain scores: 60 percent were more likely to experience moderate to severe body pain, and 49 percent were more likely to experience migraine headaches. Lower oral health was a statistically significant predictor of frequent and chronic migraine. 

Four oral microbial species from the Dialister, Fusobacterium, Parvimonas and Solobacterium genera were significantly associated with pain after age, BMI and added dietary sugars were considered. 

A weak but significant inverse correlation with diet quality and oral health was also found, though the researchers note this has yet to be investigated in detail. 

The Australian Dental Association recommends regular oral hygiene appointments and dental health checks, in addition to twice daily teeth brushing and flossing.

Bedfont® Scientific Limited promotes FeNO testing for asthma management.

Image Credit: NObreath®

Research from Asthma + Lung UK has found a significant rise in Accident and Emergency (A&E) visits from people experiencing breathing issues such as asthma. Asthma + Lung UK is a British charity formed in January 2020, with a dedication to improving respiratory health by focusing on asthma and lung diseases. The latest research shows over 42,000 patients ended up in emergency care in 2023/24 after visiting five or more times within the last 12 months, a 22.9% rise compared to the previous year. Bedfont® Scientific Limited, a world leader in breath analysis, is calling for a wider adoption of Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) testing to improve asthma management and reduce unnecessary hospitalizations.

The latest joint guidelines from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the British Thoracic Society (BTS), and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) recommend FeNO testing for asthma management in adults. FeNO testing with the NObreath® is a non-invasive way for healthcare professionals to monitor airway inflammation, which is commonly found in asthma.

By including FeNO testing in regular asthma reviews, healthcare professionals can check a patient's adherence to medication and adjust treatment plans. This allows better asthma control, which, in turn, reduces the need for emergency care.

An Asthma + Lung UK poll of 3,428 patients found that 49% said follow-up appointments were not offered for their condition. The latest guidelines state that follow-up appointments and annual treatment reviews should be conducted for anyone who has ended up in emergency care.

Current NHS data shows a worrying pattern, asthma patients are repeatedly visiting hospitals without receiving the follow-up care they need. FeNO testing can bridge this gap by providing early, precise insight into airway inflammation, ensuring patients receive the right treatment at the right time.”

Jason Smith, CEO, Bedfont®

With asthma-related hospital visits on the rise, Bedfont® joins Asthma + Lung UK in calling for the government to prioritize lung health in the upcoming 10-year health plan to prevent lung health from “falling to the bottom of the pile.” Greater investment in FeNO testing in primary care could reduce asthma hospital admissions.

Bedfont® is dedicated to improving respiratory health through innovative technology. The NObreath® FeNO device helps healthcare professionals diagnose and manage asthma accurately, reducing exacerbations and unnecessary hospital visits.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Cannabis extract can improve behavior of children and teens with autism spectrum disorder","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250408/Cannabis-extract-can-improve-behavior-of-children-and-teens-with-autism-spectrum-disorder.aspx","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 01:10:00 GMT","

New research presented at the 2025 European Congress of Psychiatry reveals that the use of cannabidiol (CBD) cannabis extract can lead to meaningful benefits and improve the behavior of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD affects approximately 1 in 100 children around the world and symptoms can include difficulty interpreting language, difficulty expressing emotions, and repetitive behavior and routines.

The meta-analysis included randomized, placebo-controlled trials on the efficacy or safety of CBD cannabis extracts in children and adolescents with ASD. Three studies were used in total with 276 participants with a mean age of 10.5, ranging in age from 5 to 21. The dosage of CBD cannabis extract started at 1 mg/kg per day and was titrated up to 10 mg/kg. 

Key findings from the study include: 

CBD cannabis extract use shows moderate improvements in social responsiveness and small yet notable reductions in disruptive behaviours and anxiety 

CBD cannabis extract significantly enhanced social responsiveness, reduced disruptive behaviour and alleviated anxiety while also improving sleep quality 

The use of CBD cannabis extract has a favourable safety profile as it did not increase adverse events compared to placebo 

There were no significant differences between adverse events in CBD cannabis extract versus placebo 

The global population prevalence of ASD diagnosis amongst children and adolescents is growing, but many treatment pathways are not effective. It is promising to see the effect of CBD cannabis extract on the study participants. However, there still needs to be considerable focus on further research with larger trials to clarify its efficacy and safety in managing ASD."" 

Lara Cappelletti Beneti Branco, Lead Investigator, São Camilo University Center, University of São Paulo

Professor Geert Dom, EPA President, said: ""ASD can be extremely frustrating for all involved; parents of children and adolescents with the disorder, the treating clinicians and of course the children and adolescents themselves. A large part of this frustration is down to finding a viable treatment option that works to reduce symptoms. It is with delight that we see the results of this meta-analysis and we hope to see further research into this so we can move towards a solution to the unmet need within this community"".

Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects approximately 3% of children and adolescents in the U.S. This condition is increasingly prevalent worldwide and presents significant treatment challenges. Preliminary evidence suggests that cannabidiol (CBD) cannabis extracts may help manage ASD symptoms, but their efficacy and potential harms have not yet been systematically investigated. 

Objectives: To systematically review and meta-analyze the evidence from clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of CBD cannabis extracts in alleviating symptoms of ASD in children and adolescents. 

Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using MeSH terms including ""Autism Spectrum Disorder,"" ""Cannabidiol,"" ""Cannabis,"" ""Child,"" and ""Adolescents."" No language or publication date restrictions were applied. The search was last updated on September 8, 2024. We included randomized, placebo-controlled trials on the efficacy or safety of CBD cannabis extracts in children and adolescents with ASD. For outcomes with limited study data, we used a fixed-effects model. The risk of bias in the included studies was evaluated using the Risk of Bias 2 tool. 

Results: Three studies met our criteria, comprising 276 participants (78.3% male; mean age 10.5 years, range 5 to 21). Interventions included orally administered CBD cannabis extracts, with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) present in minimal amounts or in ratios of 9:1 to 20:1 CBD to THC. Dosages of CBD started at 1 mg/kg per day and were titrated up to 10 mg/kg per day. CBD cannabis extracts significantly enhanced social responsiveness (SMD = -0.75 [-1.08, -0.43], p < 0.01, I² = 17%), reduced disruptive behavior (SMD = -0.36 [-0.67, -0.06], p = 0.02, I² = 0%), and alleviated anxiety (SMD = -0.33 [-0.63, -0.03], p = 0.03, I² = 59%). CBD cannabis extracts also improved sleep quality, without reaching statistical significance (SMD = -0.19 [-0.49, 0.11], p = 0.21, I² = 0%). There was no significant difference in adverse effects between interventions and placebo (odds ratio = 2.11 [1.00, 4.46], p = 0.05, I² = 38%). 

Conclusions: CBD cannabis extracts appear to provide meaningful benefits for children and adolescents with ASD, showing moderate improvements in social responsiveness and small yet notable reductions in disruptive behaviors and anxiety. They do not seem to significantly increase adverse effects compared to placebo, suggesting a favorable safety profile. These findings support the potential consideration of CBD cannabis extracts in ASD treatment plans. However, the review's limitations include a small number of studies, limited sample sizes, and significant heterogeneity. Future research with larger, robust trials is needed to clarify the efficacy and safety of CBD cannabis extracts in managing ASD.

SAN JOSE, Calif. (April 8, 2025) -- The U.S. Women's National Team fell to Brazil 2-1 in the second of two matches between two of the world's top teams. The USWNT won the first meeting 2-0 in Inglewood, Calif., on April 5, but the South Americans took the second with a very late game-winner in stoppage time.

Forward Catarina Macario scored the lone goal for the U.S., that coming just 34 seconds into the match marking the seventh fastest goals from the opening whistle in USWNT history.

The goal came after forward Alyssa Thompson played a give-and-go Macario near midfield and raced into the Brazil penalty box where her shot was blocked as she collided with Brazil goalkeeper Natascha, who couldn't corral the ball. Macario was able to latch onto the loose ball and rolled it home from close range for a dream start.

For Macario, a Stanford alumna, it was her 10th career USWNT goal and it was scored at the same stadium where played her final college career game, helping the Cardinal win the NCAA title in 2019. It was also her first career goal against Brazil, where she was born, before moving to the USA at the age of 12.

Brazilian forward Kerolin notched a well-taken equalizer in the 24th minute off an assist from Gio, but neither team could find the net until stoppage time when Brazil countered off a U.S. free kick. Luany raced down the right flank and played a pass across the goal mouth for a wide-open Amanda Gutierres to touch home. It was Brazil's fourth all-time win against the USA and first since 2014.

At 26-years-old, Macario was the second oldest player in the starting lineup, which averaged 17.9 caps at the start of the game, the lowest for any USWNT starting XI in the last 24 years. Center back Emily Sonnett, the oldest player in the starting lineup, had more caps (107) than the rest of the starters combined (81).

Sonnett and midfielder Korbin Albert were the only starters in this match who played against Brazil in the 2024 Paris Olympic gold medal match.

Since the gold medal run, U.S. head coach Emma Hayes has underscored the importance of developing young talent, and this match provided significant experience for several players.

Defender Avery Patterson and forward Michelle Cooper, both 22, made the first starts of their international careers while 19-year-old midfielder Claire Hutton played the entire match. Nineteen-year-old Gisele Thompson also played the full match at right back and 17-year-old Lily Yohannes played the first half, and did well.

The USWNT will be back in action against China in a pair of matches on May 31 in (St. Paul, Minn. at Allianz Field) and June 3 in (St. Louis, Mo. at Energizer Park).

USA -- Catarina Macario, 1st minute: Catarina Macario for the USA on the board early after she played a give-and go with Alyssa Thompson that sprung her free into the Brazil half. Her shot was got blocked by a Brazilian defender, but goalkeeper Natascha couldn't secure the ball, and Macario capitalized to roll her shot into the open net from close range. USA 1, BRA 0

BRA -- Kerolin (Gio), 24th minute: Kerolin began her attack on the left side of the box off a short pass from Gio. Claire Hutton and Tara McKeown collided with each other, leaving Kerolin free, and the former NWSL MVP found an open space to shoot a high into the upper right corner above diving U.S. keeper Mandy McGlynn. USA 1, BRA 1

BRA -- Amanda Gutierres (Luany), 90+5th minute: After several late attacks by Brazil, Amanda Gutierres found the back of the net on an assist by Luany. Brazil created a two-on-one situation in transition and McGylnn was left stranded for Brazil's easy tap-in. USA 1, BRA 2

The U.S. women's national team took a shockingly early lead in Tuesday's friendly with Brazil, but the visitors had the last laugh, handing Emma Hayes' side a 2-1 loss at PayPal Park in San Jose, Calif.

Catarina Macario scored after just 34 seconds, but the USWNT's bright start faded. Kerolin equalized midway through the first half after defensive disorganization left the Manchester City star with time and space, and Amanda Gutierres — who only entered the match in second-half stoppage time — finished off a counter-attack in the 95th minute to give As Canarinhas the victory.

Hayes deployed one of the youngest lineups in USWNT history, with seven players under the age of 23, and while there were positives on the attacking side, Brazil deserved its win after taking control in the final 15 minutes. The result snapped a nine-game U.S. winning streak over Arthur Elias' side, which includes the 2024 Olympic gold-medal game.

The result, and a few wobbly performances, will give the USWNT something to consider in the weeks ahead, with the team's next camp for two games against China coming up in late May.

Here are USWNT-Brazil highlights and analysis from Pro Soccer Wire from start to finish:

Catarina Macario gave the USWNT one of its earliest-ever leads, scoring after 34 seconds, but Brazil claimed victory with a stoppage-time winner.

A five-minute spell of poor play at the back from the U.S. ended with Kerolin bending home a wonderful 24th-minute equalizer, which came after Tara McKeown was drawn out of position. There have been plenty of chances at both ends, with Brazil's high-risk tactics turning the first hour into a track meet at times.

Despite the stop-start second half, Brazil took the lead in stoppage time, as a simple clearance upfield ended with Amanda Gutierres finishing a tap-in.

Just like that, the substitute has a potential game-winner.

It started with an aimless clearance up field, and Jhenifer ended up winning the race for the ball. With the USWNT committed at one end, Brazil gets a three-on-two, with Luany eventually teeing Gutierres up for an absolute sitter.

The USWNT can hardly argue that it's unfair, as Brazil deserve more than a draw based on the performances tonight.

Gio Queiroz and Gabi Portilho both caused plenty of problems for the USWNT, but with the game in the second of seven minutes of stoppage time, both are done for the night. Amanda Gutierres and Jhenifer will see the final minutes out.

Mandy McGlynn is showing more of what has made her one of NWSL's top goalkeepers, making two late saves. The first was maybe Brazil's best sequence of the night, with Angelina eventually serving a delightful ball to Gabi Portilho knifing between the center backs.

McGlynn managed to react sharply to get a hand down low as the Gotham forward tried to sneak a shot past her, and then within seconds reached up quickly as Kerolin tried to rip a shot over her head and in.

Arthur Elias has brought two more sets of fresh legs into this match in the 78th minute. Fê Palermo has been replaced at left-center back, with Kaká (that's the 22-year-old Sao Paulo defender, not the retired great from Brazil's men's national team) replacing her. In the midfield, Duda Sampaio makes way for Lais Estevam.

Alyssa Thompson tilted the first half-hour of this game nearly singlehandedly, and she makes way for a very different sort of player in Ally Sentnor. Despite their differences, Sentnor slots into the left wing role Thompson had been playing.

Per TBS, this sub was only possible because Michelle Cooper was removed via concussion substitution. That grants both teams one more change, and one more window to make changes, but for the USWNT those are all used up.

With 15 minutes plus stoppage time to play, it still feels like there are some big chances in this game.

This has been a stop-start second half to say the least, and now Gab Portilho is down after her Gotham FC teammate Emily Sonnett stepped on her foot. It's the 70th minute, and very little has happened since the hour mark amid all the stoppages.

Kerolin isn't too happy about it, but Sonnett seems to think the whole thing was an accident.

Patterson isn't doing well here, with TBS's broadcast showing that her eye is clearly swelling pretty rapidly. The training staff is taking her straight down the tunnel.

The USWNT wasn't planning to make a move, and Crystal Dunn is per TBS hunting down her jersey, but after playing on with 10 players for three minutes, Emma Hayes the Paris Saint-Germain veteran in at left back in the 67th minute.

Two minor notes as play stops in the 63rd minute: Alana Cook picked up a yellow card for hauling back Gio Queiroz, while Avery Patterson is down receiving treatment after being hit in the eye by the ball from close range.

Lindsey Heaps, Yazmeen Ryan, and Sam Coffey are entering the match in the 58th minute, replacing Catarina Macario, Michelle Cooper (who just got checked for a possible concussion by trainers after a tough collision), and Korbin Albert.

The U.S. lineup is now as follows:

(4-2-3-1): McGlynn; G. Thompson, Cook, Sonnett, Patterson; Coffey, Hutton; Ryan, Heaps, A. Thompson; Shaw

The USWNT has another escape here, as Alana Cook's first meaningful action is a block that (just barely) prevents a goal from Gio.

The chance came from a similar recipe: the U.S. repelled a Brazil attack, but Brazil's counter-press immediately won the ball back following Korbin Albert's tackle.. Claire Hutton was left in trouble by a pass from Jaedyn Shaw and a lack of communication from anyone nearby, and Cook did very well to get a shin to Gio's resulting shot.

The second half is underway, and Emma Hayes has made two changes, replacing Tara McKeown and Lily Yohannes with Alana Cook and Jaedyn Shaw.

The 4-3-3 the U.S. started in remains in place though, rather than Shaw playing further up in a 4-2-3-1 as some might have expected.

USA (4-3-3): Mandy McGlynn; Avery Patterson, Tara McKeown, Emily Sonnett (capt.), Gisele Thompson; Korbin Albert, Claire Hutton, Lily Yohannes; Michelle Cooper, Catarina Macario, Alyssa Thompson

Available subs: 1-Jane Campbell, 21-Phallon Tullis-Joyce, 5-Alana Cook, 6-Emily Sams, 7-Ashley Hatch, 8-Jaedyn Shaw, 9-Ally Sentnor, 10-Lindsey Heaps, 17-Sam Coffey, 19-Crystal Dunn, 22-Yazmeen Ryan, 23-Emily Fox

That's seven changes from the group that beat Brazil on Saturday, with Trinity Rodman the only player in camp to not dress for the match. Rodman played an hour in the previous match, and even made light of a long-term back issue by feigning pain as part of her goal celebration.

U.S. Soccer's lineup notes did not clarify Rodman's status beyond stating that she wouldn't be in uniform. Pro Soccer Wire will have updates as they come to the fore.

Brazil (3-4-3): Natascha; Lauren, Isa Haas, Fê Palermo; Bruninha, Angelina, Duda Sampaio, Yasmim; Gabi Portilho, Kerolin, Gio Queiroz

Brazil could have — and maybe should have — taken a last-gasp lead here. Kerolin pulled McKeown way out to the left flank, and like Gio before, was able to spin away as the Washington Spirit defender couldn't get touch-tight.

This time help arrived, so Kerolin floated a cross to the back post for a waiting Yasmim. However, the Real Madrid defender opted to bring the ball down, and a wide-open shot vanished. She dished the ball off to Angelina, but the Orlando Pride midfielder got under her rushed shot, letting the USWNT off the hook.

The U.S. has a great response, with Yohannes driving forward before playing an outside-of-foot pass in behind for Cooper, who is only denied by a strong save from Natascha.

The USWNT has a decent set piece opportunity as stoppage time begins, but Korbin Albert's eventual delivery hangs up in the air for too long, leaving Natascha with an easy grab.

Brazil counters immediately, with McKeown coming up with an excellent block to deny Gio Queiroz a potential goal.

Wild scenes in front of the Brazil goal, as multiple shots from Alyssa Thompson and others somehow don't get through.

It all started with a short corner, and the U.S. will be wondering how the ball didn't find the back of the net. Natascha made a spectacular save, Lily Yohannes had a follow-up blocked by a defender, and Brazil somehow escaped with a level scoreline.

And now two early substitutions from Brazil, with no apparent injuries: NJ/NY Gotham FC defender Bruninha and Kansas City Current center back Lauren exit after just 35 minutes, with Luany and Mariza replacing them. Both of the starters were having a torrid time coping with Alyssa Thompson, but it has to be said that Brazil's all-or-nothing tactical approach is more of a problem than individual play.

A rough five minutes from the USWNT ends with Manchester City's Kerolin firing past Mandy McGlynn in the 24th minute.

It started with McGlynn sending a poorly-disguised pass to Claire Hutton, who was well-marked and never had a chance to receive the ball. McGlynn saved the day in that moment, slapping away Gabi Portilho's golden look from 13 yards, but the sequence shifted the tenor of the game.

Another near-miss from Brazil followed, and before the U.S. could get its act together, Kerolin equalized. It wasn't a great sequence from Tara McKeown, who was baited to pursue Gio Queiroz only to not arrive in time to make an intervention.

McKeown and Hutton collided as both spun to try to save the situation, and Kerolin took advantage, using the time to size up a gorgeous, curling effort from the left side of the box.

There's not much reason for the USWNT to slow down, as every Brazil turnover leaves a potential three-on-three going the other way. Here in the 15th minute, we see a perfect example, with Lily Yohannes scooping a loose ball first-time into space on the right flank.

Fê Palermo had to gain position on Michelle Cooper and show admirable strength to maintain that edge, preventing what could have been a breakaway.

We're off and running in this friendly between the USWNT and Brazil, with the USWNT defending the end with what is billed as ""the largest outdoor bar in North America.""

An absolutely bizarre start ends with Catarina Macario firing into an empty net from seven yards out. It took just 34 seconds, with Alyssa Thompson playing a one-two with the Chelsea forward deep in the U.S. half. Thompson stormed forward from there, but had a potential highlight-reel goal ended with a tackle from a scrambling Brazil defender.

However, the aftermath saw Brazil goalkeeper Natascha spill the rebound in a collision with Macario and defender Lauren, allowing Macario to steer the ball home.

We go to VAR...and the goal stands. Over three minutes after Macario scored, it's confirmed: a 1-0 USWNT lead.

We're very close to kickoff, with both teams making their way through a seemingly byzantine path from locker rooms to the field at PayPal Park in San Jose.

We know Trinity Rodman isn't in uniform, and there are still questions as to whether that is a minutes-management decision after a long, and still ongoing, battle to keep her back in playing shape.

All we have from the TBS pre-game show is a shot of Rodman, in a USWNT jacket, standing and chatting with Emma Hayes as the rest of the team warmed up. The Washington Post reported that Rodman was training to the side on Monday, which may have been a hint that the Washington Spirit star would not be risked for a second game on short notice.

Here is how to watch Tuesday's friendly between the USWNT and Brazil:

Yohannes, the 17-year-old midfield phenom, looked superb against Brazil on Saturday, but she came on after an hour of play, and after the USWNT coaching staff was able to give her detailed instructions on what spaces to look for.

Starting is a different beast, and Yohannes won't have the benefit of playing ahead of Sam Coffey (as another teenager, Claire Hutton, will hold down the No. 6 role instead). It's a much less experienced 11 for Emma Hayes tonight, and that will provide a different sort of test for the Ajax star.

The USWNT's starting fullbacks on Saturday were Emily Fox and Crystal Dunn, two of the most experienced players in the entire pool. Tonight, it's Avery Patterson — a second-year pro who won her first cap late in that game — and 19-year-old Gisele Thompson.

Brazil's tactics in the first meeting were essentially the kind of kitchen-sink desperation you see late in a knockout match, just from the opening kickoff. A 3-4-3 formation is one thing, but Arthur Elias' side deployed attacking midfielders as ""wingbacks"" and sent all four midfielders forward, risking a total lack of a holding presence in order to overwhelm the USWNT with sheer numbers.

Don't be surprised if Patterson and Thompson find themselves mobbed by Brazil players at times. Being able to find the exit — or realizing that there's no escape and hoofing the ball to safety — should provide a great test for both newcomers.

The USWNT's No. 1 shirt is the subject of arguably the most heated competition for time. Alyssa Naeher's retirement from the national team has opened the door, and there are is no obvious successor in place.

Of the goalkeepers vying for the job, Mandy McGlynn and Phallon Tullis-Joyce are the newest to the USWNT pool. There are data points from club play that point to both having a real shot, but Tullis-Joyce's composed, six-save performance on Saturday was a cut above McGlynn's last appearance.

Every play counts in the battle to be the No. 1, and McGlynn will show the kind of all-around quality that she's displayed in the NWSL with the Utah Royals.

Amanda Gutierres scored in the 95th minute to lift Brazil to a 2-1 victory over the U.S. women's national team late Tuesday night at PayPal Park in San Jose, Calif.

It wasn't how the Americans wanted to end this April window, splitting the doubleheader 1-1. But while coach Emma Hayes wants to win every game, she's been saying for months that she'd rather hoist the 2027 World Cup trophy than beat teams in friendlies right now. 

The USWNT got off to a hot start when Catarina Macario scored in the first minute. She and Alyssa Thompson were bright spots in the attack and dangerous on a number of occasions in the first half. In fact, their connection was so lethal that Brazil had to make an early defensive substitution to account for Thompson's speed. 

But more than anything, there were growing pains. Hayes went with seven changes in the starting lineup, including goalkeeper Mandy McGlynn who made her third start. Avery Patterson, who had her debut in Saturday's 2-0 win, and 19-year-old Gisele Thompson played outside back, while Tara McKeown and Emily Sonnett were the choices at center back. 

With an inexperienced back line that had never played together before, naturally, there were breakdowns. On Kerolin's dazzling equalizing goal in the 24th minute, for example, there was miscommunication between Claire Hutton and McKeown, who collided outside the box, leaving the Brazilian star wide open. According to the broadcast, at halftime Hayes addressed needing to be better in the buildup and wanting McGlynn to be stronger in her decision-making. The second half featured a number of changes which impacted the rhythm of the game, and players on both sides were sluggish.

That was until the final minutes of stoppage time, when Brazil got the last word. 

While the USWNT won the first match of this back-to-back on Saturday, Tuesday's win has to feel like a bit of revenge for Brazil after losing to the Americans in the gold medal match at last summer's Olympics.

Even so, this was the kind of game Hayes needed to see. As she develops the player pool with sights set on 2027 and 2028, she's acknowledged how important it is for younger players to get these opportunities against quality opponents like Brazil. 

Here are takeaways from the match:

Play of the game:

Similarly to Saturday, when Trinity Rodman scored in the first five minutes, the U.S. came out flying and scored in the first 35 seconds. Alyssa Thompson wiggled loose near midfield, sprinted down the left flank and hoped to take a shot herself before getting tackled in the box. Brazilian goalkeeper Natascha Honegger bobbled the ball, though, which allowed Macario to swoop in and finish.

 This was Macario's second goal of the year (and 10th overall for the national team). She had most recently scored against Colombia during the SheBelieves Cup in February, which was her first goal for the USWNT since 2022.

Turning point:

The match looked like it was heading for a draw until the USWNT got caught in transition. Crystal Dunn and Gisele Thompson were too high up, allowing Luany to get in behind and slip a perfect pass across the penalty box to Gutierres for the easy, winning goal in stoppage time.

The U.S. tried for a last-second equalizer to no avail.

Key stat:

According to U.S. Soccer, the starting lineup averaged 17.9 caps, which was the lowest average of caps per player in the last 24 years.

The most-capped player in the starting XI was Sonnett with 106. The rest of the lineup combined had just 81 caps. Additionally, seven starters (McGlynn, McKeown, Patterson, Hutton, Gisele Thompson, Michelle Cooper and Lily Yohannes) had six or fewer international appearances for the USWNT.

What's next for the USWNT?

The squad's next training camp is at the end of May, which will include two matches against China. The first is May 31 at Allianz Field in St. Paul, Minn. and then on June 3 at Energizer Park in St. Louis.

While Hayes has promised to keep experimenting with lineups and combinations and giving younger players more opportunities, keep an eye out for the return of some veterans. If healthy, perhaps Naomi Girma, Rose Lavelle, Mallory Swanson and/or Lynn Biyendolo could be back in the fold. 

It will also be interesting to see which goalkeepers get called in next month. Hayes has said those who haven't been involved in recent camps, like veteran Casey Murphy, are still in the mix. But time will tell.

Compared to the bright, breezy environment of SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles for game one, the United States women's national team's (USWNT) swift rematch with Brazil at San Jose's PayPal Park carried an inverted energy, atmospherically and competitively.

The latter ended in a 2-1 defeat for the U.S. before a packed house of 18,000 in California's Bay Area on Tuesday night, the booming, sold-out crowd competing with the periodic sound of planes touching down at the nearby airport. The first, in the sunshine of Saturday afternoon, brought 32,303 people to a venue that holds 70,000 to see what turned out to be a secure 2-0 win for the hosts.

Match two also embodied the classic traits of a return fixture against the same opponent, with noticeable changes to the previous lineup. But as U.S. head coach Emma Hayes has reiterated throughout this window, experimentation was going to be the prevailing theme of these two fixtures. She is working toward identifying a core group of players by the end of June who will eventually compete in the 2027 World Cup.

“I wanna put players in the frying pan and I want you to feel the heat,” Hayes said in her post-game news conference late Tuesday night. “This camp was always about expanding and experimenting (with) that player pool. I really feel like that is becoming so clear to me on which players I think are really ready for us right now, which ones are not.”

With that mandate, this could, arguably, have been a period better enjoyed behind closed doors for the team.

Of the 22 players (including alternates) selected for the 2024 Olympics, headlined by Sophia Wilson, Mallory Swanson and Trinity Rodman as the Triple Espresso forward line, only 10 made the most recent roster. The starting 11 on Tuesday averaged just 17 caps and formed the youngest USWNT roster in 24 years. It was bound to look as challenging as it felt — especially when that group, unlike Saturday's squad, was tasked with handling 2023 National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) MVP Kerolin Nicoli for 90-plus minutes.

When caterpillars retreat to their cocoons, part of the process of transformation can be aesthetically unbecoming and grotesque. For the USWNT, though, that metamorphosis is happening in real-time and out in public view. The revolution is being televised, and Hayes is unconcerned with how it might look to an untrained eye.

“We could play 11 relatively experienced players now and build those connections, there's no problem,” Hayes had told reporters on Friday. “But if we get to a World Cup in two years and all of a sudden, an Ally Sentnor or Lily Yohannes are completely underprepared, then you're going to say, ‘Well, why didn't we give them the opportunities in that period?'”

Hayes shared that Sentnor — a 21-year-old striker and No. 1 NWSL draft pick of the Utah Royals in 2024 who is known for scoring long-range bangers — had told her that February's SheBelieves Cup finale, which saw the USWNT fall to Japan 2-1, had been the most difficult game she'd played in her career. The manager also pointed out Yohannes, whose skill and promise as a midfielder became popular knowledge following her Champions League debut at 16 (she is now 17) for Dutch club Ajax, had not been involved in the U.S. youth national team system very long and thus has limited experience with international competition outside of Europe.

“It's a completely different situation that we have to expose them to,” Hayes continued, “and if I put on the field (a lot of) 17, 18, 19, 20-year-olds, I'm setting them up to fail, in my honest opinion, so we have to drip-feed it in, whether it's some of them in one game, some of them in another game, (or) some of them from the bench.”

The four halves of soccer against Brazil this week have provided that.

Saturday's game kicked off with the five most-capped players on the roster — Lindsey Heaps, Crystal Dunn, Emily Sonnett, Emily Fox and Rodman — in the starting 11. The second half, however, saw the entries of Yohannes and 20-year-old Jaedyn Shaw, plus a national-team debut for Houston Dash defender Avery Patterson, 22. Last night, by contrast, 31-year-old Sonnett was the most-capped player at kickoff with 106. Next in line? Midfielder Korbin Albert with 25, aged 21.

Claire Hutton watched the first match from the bench as an unused substitute, then started the second to double her number of international caps. The 19-year-old, who plays for the Kansas City Current, roamed about central midfield Tuesday night with Albert and distinguished herself with her brave defending and positioning, according to Hayes.

“We've done a lot of film with her this week, a lot of detailing,” said Hayes. She added that the Americans' goal, scored by Catarina Macario in the first minute of the game, came as a result of Hutton stepping up further away from the back line, allowing her to intercept the ball and initiate the decisive counter-attack — something Hayes and the coaching staff have been working on with her.

Hutton, for her part, spoke with Sentnor, who did play in that first match, on the team's flight up to the Bay Area from LA. The pair are good friends. She knew what she experienced Tuesday night would be “a whole different beast” compared to Saturday.

“It's international football. You're gonna get clobbered if you take too many touches on the ball,” Hutton said. “So it's just a learning moment and a moment to move forward on.”

It's no secret that the state of the USWNT's midfield has for years been shrouded in concern, but the teenager's aggression toward an opposing team that relishes one-versus-one duels demonstrated for Hayes that she is suited for this level.

“For a 19-year-old to play like that against Brazil is a superb performance from her. One in which I know she is ready to progress with us,” Hayes said.

And while the second half of Tuesday's game saw the return of more veteran players — Heaps, Sam Coffey, Dunn and Alana Cook, and even Shaw, subbed on for her 25th cap — Hayes found the group's performance flat. The USWNT's expected goals figure for the second half was zero, and Hayes said only one player broke into the top 10 for pass completion.

Patterson's determined performance as a left back crackled with possibility, but concerns remain in the middle defensively — both in terms of the ongoing audition to be Naomi Girma's co-conspirator and the ability of both goalkeepers who played in this window, Phallon Tullis-Joyce and Mandy McGlynn, to distribute the ball with precision.

“I think both her (McGlynn) and Phallon have had the opportunity to play against a top opponent, just like Jane (Campbell) had the opportunity to play against a top opponent with Japan, and I think it's fair to say I'm a lot clearer,” Hayes said Tuesday night.

It's hard to imagine these players returning to their clubs after these two games without stacks of notes and feedback from Hayes and, for the younger set, the veteran teammates around them.

“Every time I go into camp, it's definitely a learning experience and developing as a player,” 19-year-old defender Gisele Thompson told reporters in the mixed zone. “I think I can learn so much from all of these players, especially Crystal, (and) Emily Fox. They've helped me so much along the way. Just being in these camps helps me as a player, even (at) club.”

Thompson and Hutton both spoke of confidence in their reflections on camp, how the experience and what they learned from it bolstered their toolbox as players, imbuing them with excitement about how they'll integrate their notes.

“That was a battle. I've never played a game like that before,” Hutton said of last night's game, the beginnings of a laugh escaping from her response in the mixed zone. “So knowing that I had that, I can do anything now.”

USWNT manager Emma Hayes believes the quality of the senior players in her squad allow the youngsters to play with confidence. (2:10)

INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- Goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce made six saves while earning a clean sheet against Brazil on Saturday in her first appearance for the U.S. women's national team.

Her toughest test of the day, however? ""The first whistle,"" the 28-year-old said, smiling as she spoke about nerves ahead of that game.

Such is the current state of the USWNT's goalkeeping position: For the first time in decades -- maybe ever -- the squad now faces an extended period of uncertainty without a clear No. 1 emerging. A fabled position of strength is now one of the team's biggest question marks.

Two-time World Cup winner and 2024 Olympic champion Alyssa Naeher retired from international duty at the end of last year at age 36. Since then, USWNT head coach Emma Hayes has effectively been conducting an open tryout for the position over the past six months.

Tullis-Joyce firmly entered her name into that open audition on Saturday. The Manchester United goalkeeper had been watching the goalkeeper race from a slight distance up until recently, but even after earning her first senior cap, Tullis-Joyce is as much of a contender to become the new No. 1 as any other goalkeeper in the pool.

Jane Campbell, 30, had ostensibly become the favorite for the job in recent months, but she did not play in either match against Brazil during this window. Mandy McGlynn made her international debut in goal last October. The three goalkeepers, plus uncapped training goalkeeper Angelina Anderson, entered this April training camp with 12 combined caps.

Casey Murphy, with 20 caps at 28 years old, is the most experienced goalkeeper available for selection in the USWNT pool. But she has not received a call-up in 2025, and it's increasingly fair to wonder if her absence is more about an incumbent successor falling out of favor than it is simply Hayes testing out new goalkeepers.

Hayes had promised she would dole out opportunities in this two-game window against Brazil, and she did that by turning to Tullis-Joyce in the first game and McGlynn in Tuesday's rematch, the two biggest USWNT games of the year.

For months, Hayes has said that by July she should have a clearer picture of who will be her new starting goalkeeper. By then, Hayes will have seen the USWNT in pairs of games against Brazil, China and the Republic of Ireland, and another against Canada. If the timeline holds, Hayes' preferred starter will have two years to refine herself in the role ahead of the 2027 Women's World Cup.

""If you think about this, prior to when even Alyssa made the No. 1 [job] her own, it takes a period of time to be able to solidify that,"" Hayes said prior to this training camp. ""And I think it's fair to say we've got a lot of really good quality goalkeepers.

""Who will emerge from that as the No. 1? Don't know, but they have to take their chances when they get them. This is a performance-related business, and each and every opportunity they get, they have to make the most of it because, of course, that will impact my decision making as we progress.""

Hayes is correct in pointing out that Naeher took time to make the position her own. Naeher took over the No. 1 job in the years ahead of the 2019 World Cup under immense scrutiny as she tried to fill the boots of Hope Solo, who won a World Cup, two Olympic gold medals, and was arguably the best net-minder the world has ever seen.

Naeher is a quiet, calm personality -- the antithesis of Solo, and the dichotomy between their personalities added to the outside skepticism of Naeher ahead of, and during, the 2019 World Cup. Those questions were ultimately squashed when she started and played every minute as the USWNT captured a second straight crown. She followed that up with dazzling performances at the 2023 World Cup and last year's Olympics.

So yes, goalkeeper successions -- especially in the shadows of departed legends -- are nothing new to the USWNT. Solo followed Briana Scurry, who was also a World Cup winner and two-time Olympic winner, in an infamous USWNT goalkeeper changeover around 2007-08. What's different now, however, is a true sense of inexperience among goalkeeper options -- not only in terms of caps, but in big moments.

Solo was an alternate at the 2004 Olympics, which the USWNT won, and the starter at the 2007 World Cup before then-head coach Greg Ryan benched her for the semifinal in favor of Scurry. Solo reassumed the starting role for the 2008 Olympics and didn't let go of it for eight years, until U.S. Soccer terminated her contract for off-field reasons.

Naeher was part of the USWNT's 2015 World Cup-winning squad. She didn't play at that tournament, but she still got to experience that pressure-packed environment ahead of taking the starring role four years later.

Murphy was the backup goalkeeper for last year's Olympics and the 2023 World Cup. She looked like she might challenge Naeher for the No. 1 role at World Cup qualifying in 2022. Campbell was an alternate at last year's Olympics. And ... that's the extent of major-tournament experience among the goalkeepers who have been in senior camp in 2025.

Hayes is unabashed by inexperience, whether in goal or in the middle of the park, where she's increasingly given important assignments to 17-year-old midfielder phenom Lily Yohannes. Hayes said Tullis-Joyce looked ""authoritative and commanding"" in her debut, Saturday's 2-0 win over Brazil.

Tullis-Joyce played the ball long too often for Hayes' liking, but the USWNT coach added that she understood why: It was Tullis-Joyce's debut, and her club team frequently plays that way.

To be sure, there is a stylistic fit that needs to be made, but all of Hayes' options are strong shot-stoppers. Murphy ranks ahead of Campbell and McGlynn this NWSL season in post-shot expected goals minus goals against, per FBRef, which is a measurement of shot-stopping ability. McGlynn ranked second in the NWSL and first among Americans in that category by a significant margin last season. Tullis-Joyce is the runaway leader in that category in England's WSL, per FBRef.

Whoever is to assume the starting goalkeeper role, however, is expected to be comfortable on the ball to help the USWNT possess in deeper spaces, Hayes has said on multiple occasions.

""I would say for the goalkeepers that are not in here, they all know what they have to work on, and what is a key focus area,"" Hayes said in February.

Murphy, who plays for the North Carolina Courage, the NWSL's most possession-oriented team, is arguably the most suited for that style. The Houston Dash, where Campbell starts, is attempting to build a similar identity under a new head coach.

McGlynn registered a rare goalkeeper assist on opening weekend of the 2025 NWSL season, but she and the Utah Royals have also struggled with deep-lying turnovers on other occasions this season. She and an inexperienced USWNT back line made a series of errors early in Tuesday's 2-1 loss to Brazil while trying to keep possession around their own goal. McGlynn admitted after the match that she was ""forcing it"" in the first half as she played into the hands of Brazil's press.

Hayes made similar points about McGlynn and Tullis-Joyce needing to read the game in possession and figure out when to play short or go long.

So, who will be the next USWNT No. 1?

""I think it's been a competitive camp,"" Hayes said of her goalkeeper pool after Tuesday's loss. ""I think both [McGlynn] and Phallon have had the opportunity to play against a top opponent, just like Jane had the opportunity to play against a top opponent with Japan, and I think it's fair to say I'm a lot clearer.""

Whoever assumes the role will know well the scrutiny that awaits: World Cup titles and Golden Gloves are the program's standard. They will have two years to prepare for that inevitable pressure.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

April 9 – SoFi Stadium, in Inglewood, has seen two different faces to America's relationship with their respective men's and women's national teams over the last two weeks, and the differences could not be starker.

Two weeks ago the men played Canada in the third-place match at the Concacaf Nations League. This game had plenty riding on it, both competitively and politically, as the 2026 World Cup approaches. As the match kicked off, there were perhaps 3,000 fans in attendance, in a match the US went on to lose 2-1.

On Saturday, the women's team played the first of two friendly matches against Brazil, and were greeted by more than 32,000 loud, appreciative supporters in a comprehensive 2-0 win in front of a crowd that clearly loves these women.

Of course, America is a country where they love winners, and the USWNT is clearly that with four World Cups and five Olympic Gold medals to their names, but it isn't as though the USMNT has come up empty-handed.

Since the women won their first World Cup in 1991, the men have secured seven Concacaf Gold Cups and the first three Nations League titles in the same period, however there appears to be a growing disconnect between the men's team and US football fans.

No doubt the women's game is going through a remarkable surge in the US and in Southern California with the formation of Angel City FC and the San Diego Wave of the National Women's Soccer league. However the men in the form of LAFC and the LA Galaxy have competed in the last three MLS Cup finals, winning one apiece.

So, why does the LA public show up for a friendly match for women, and are a no-show for the men in a competitive fixture?



While there are no definitive arguments, potential reasons could be…

Cultural Impact: 

The USWNT, with the likes of Alex Morgan, Brandi Chastain, Megan Rapinoe, and Abby Wambach, have used their status to advocate for gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and equal pay meaning they have transcended the sport. They have also been a lightning rod in attracting young girls to the sport.

The USMNT is still trying to figure out exactly who they are and what they stand for. Back in the 90's the team was hard-nosed and felt as though it was up to them to prove the team belonged on the world stage. In the 2000's that led to improved World Cup performances, but as we move into the 2020s, the team has seemingly lost its identity with the football public.

Fan Engagement:

There is more connection to the women, as I believe that they're more approachable. At NWSL matches, you'll find players signing autographs and posing for selfies. The men, who are now scattered across the globe, don't enjoy the same intimacy, but could certainly make more of an effort.

U.S. Soccer also needs to look at the pricing of its men's games. Youth soccer in America feels as close to tennis and golf in terms of cost, and that has morphed into the national team. If you want to pack out SoFi make it affordable for a family of four. Make deals so that an entire youth team can come and support their country and create those fans for life.

What we do know is that SoFi will host two of the USMNT's group stage matches next summer. Americans love an event, and I'm sure the stadium will be at full capacity (World Cup ticket prices haven't been released), but the question remains…what will the support be like? Football tourists? Or fans living every second and straining every sinew in an effort to will their country to victory.

In the 55-page decision on the appeal lodged by both Mexican clubs, FIFA justifies the decision on the grounds that Pachuca and Club Leon share the same owner, something that is prohibited by the competition's regulations.

Pachuca and Club Leon, who, according to the appeal committee, are both in breach, ""are controlled by the same people, who exercise significant influence over their respective decision-making processes.""

Club Leon were in Group D of the Club World Cup, along with Chelsea (England), Esperance (Tunisia) and Flamengo (Brazil) and their replacement will have to come from CONCACAF, although they don't have to be a Mexican club.

Last Friday, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) confirmed that it had received individual appeals from Mexican clubs Leon and Pachuca, requesting a declaration that both are eligible to take part in the Club World Cup, contradicting FIFA's decision to exclude the former.

The FIFA Appeals Committee ruled last month that both sides had violated the Competition Regulations in relation to multiple club ownership and, due to this infraction, Leon, coached by Argentinian Eduardo Berizzo and with Colombian ex-FC Porto player James Rodriguez in their squad, was excluded from the competition.

The TAD also explained that Leon had also lodged an additional appeal against the FIFA Secretary General's decision to be reinstated as a participant in the Club World Cup.","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","soccer"

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

FIFA has announced its referees will be wearing body cameras during the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in a step toward using the cameras for live match broadcasts as well as to help train referees. The move comes after the cameras were approved for use on a trial basis by the International Football Association Board to ""identify possible future use and develop quality and safety standards.""

The body cameras, which offer a first-person view of what the referee sees, will be integrated into the broadcasts of the Club World Cup games, and they will also be used as a tool for referee coaching and training. With the use of the cameras, fans as well as FIFA officials will be able to get a direct idea of what the referee saw and what influenced their calls.

""We think that it is a good chance to offer the viewers a new experience, in terms of images taken from a perspective, from an angle of vision which was never offered before,"" said chair of the FIFA Referees' Committee Pierluigi Collina, emphasising it was a trial. ""It also has a purpose in terms of referee coaching. Because, of course, having the possibility to see what the referee sees is important in the debriefing, to evaluate how the call was made by the referee, which was his view, and so on. So it's a combination of new experience for broadcasters and also for coaching purposes.""

Referee cameras come to the Club World Cup after being piloted in English grassroots football, where they were introduced in 2023 as a means of improving conduct toward referees from players and supporters. The cameras made their way to the Premiere League last season, as they were worn by a referee during a fixture between Crystal Palace and Manchester United, and they have also been tried in Bundesliga.

FIFA has also announced a rule change for the Club World Cup, as the referees will now award corners instead of indirect free-kicks if a goalie attempts to waste time by holding onto the ball for more than eight seconds.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WTVF) — Geodis Park is the largest soccer-specific stadium in the United States and this summer it will get a global stage as it hosts group stage matches in FIFA's inaugural Club World Cup.

FIFA President Gianni Ingantino toured the three-year-old stadium and its grounds Tuesday with Nashville S.C. CEO Ian Ayre and other team and city officials. They then unveiled the Club World Cup trophy that will be awarded to the winner of the event featuring 32 of the best clubs in the world.

“It's exciting,” Ayre said. “When we conceptualized the team and the stadium (with the idea that) you build a world-class stadium, you want to host world-class games, and this is the pinnacle. This is the world championship. I remember taking a cab from BNA airport on my first arrival here, and the guy asked me – he heard my accent – and said, ‘What are you doing here?' I said, ‘I'm here to build a soccer team,' and he just laughed, you know? And here we are with one of the greatest stadiums in the country. It's hugely proud for all of us to see that we've been kind of singled out as one of very few venues for this tournament.”

Nashville is one of 11 cities chosen to host Club World Cup matches this summer. The city already has a worldwide reputation as a destination, particularly for its music and party scene. But increasingly, it has become a destination city for big sports events.

Over the last dozen years, the city has hosted events like the NFL Draft, Stanley Cup Final, NHL All-Star game, IndyCar's Music City Grand Prix, and the NCAA Women's Final Four, along with yearly events like the Music City Bowl at Nissan Stadium and the SEC Tournament at Bridgestone Arena.

The city has increasingly become a destination for major soccer events as well. Nashville S.C. joined MLS in 2020 and opened Geodis Park in May of 2022. The city has played host to numerous Gold Cup and international friendlies for the U.S. Men's and Women's National teams, drawing big crowds at various venues.

Now, Music City will have a chance to show its soccer side to a global audience.

“Nashville is a city known all over the world for the music, but for soccer also,” Infantino said. “And this is something I wasn't really aware of, I have to say, before. Then I came here and I viewed the stadium – the biggest soccer stadium in the United States of America. It really has everything that fans want. With these teams from five different continents coming to play in Nashville, they will bring a lot of fans, and these fans will enjoy Nashville.”

Geodis Park will host three matches during the Club World Cup group stage. The action will begin on June 20 as Club Leon of Mexico takes on Esperance Sportive de Tunisie at 5 p.m. On June 24, the stadium will host the famed Argentina side C.A. Boca Juniors as they face Auckland City F.C. at 2 p.m. The action in Nashville will conclude on June 26 as Saudi power Al Hilal meets C.F. Pachuca at 8 p.m.

“(The Club World Cup) brings the 32 best teams in the world to the United States of America, including Nashville,” Infantino said. “The best players in the world are coming to play, and it's a competition that will determine for the first time in history which club team is the best in the world.”

There is a long-term benefit to serving as a host city. FIFA announced Tuesday that it will make a $1 million donation to Nashville for youth soccer programs in an effort to boost the area's roots soccer scene.

The money will help further the mission of Nashville S.C., which has built pitches and started soccer programs throughout the area since the club launched.

“We can start to make soccer more accessible to other parts of the community,” Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell said. “I used to represent the area of Napier and Sudekum, and it was just so exciting the day that the team installed a pitch at Napier Elementary (School), which is now fielding a soccer team. If we can create more experiences like that around the city, great!”

This summer may also serve as a trial run for an even bigger FIFA event down the road. The U.S. has emerged as a strong favorite to host the Women's World Cup in 2031.

Both Infantino and Ayre hinted at Nashville's strong candidacy during Tuesday's media availability. Ayre suggested the city could put in a multiple-venue bid with the 30,000-seat Geodis Park able to host group stage matches while the new Nissan Stadium could be in the running to host knockout round matches with a capacity of 60,000.

“With 48 teams, you think about the number of games that will go on in the group stages and then the knockout phase,” Ayre said. “There's different sizes of demand and draw on those games, and I think both venues here could be potentially possible. When they came for the Club World Cup this year, when they see how the city lights up for these events, they want more than just soccer games. They want fans to come, they want them to enjoy themselves (and) nobody does it better than Nashville.”

ORLANDO, Fla. — FIFA President Gianni Infantino was in Orlando Wednesday to announce that the city will host matches for the FIFA Club World Cup this summer.

Matches will take place at Inter & Co Stadium and Camping World Stadium.

The tournament trophy was officially unveiled Wednesday. It will be awarded for the first time at the tournament scheduled for this summer as it plays out across 12 venues in the United States.

Orlando will host six of those matches between the two stadiums from June 17th to July 4th.

“I think it's awesome,” Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said. “We're already objectively known as the best sporting destination in the country. This just enhances that reputation. We know we can host anything in the world.”

Orlando is the only city in the country to utilize two host sites for the tournament.

Infantino said Orlando's recent rise in becoming what he called a “soccer city” made it a no brainer to bring a portion of the tournament to Central Florida.

“A soccer specific stadium has been built for the soccer teams, a community has been built, Orlando is a big international community as well,” Infantino said.

A community that will unite soccer fans from all over the world to catch these high stakes games right here in The City Beautiful.

“It's a city that welcomes the world anyway the whole year, for over 75 million tourists, we bring the world here with the FIFA Club World Cup,” Infantino said. “Best teams in the world, best players in the world, don't miss that opportunity.”

FIFA wants to leave its mark on the cities it will be visiting this summer. It announced Wednesday it will donate $1 million to the City of Orlando to invest in activities for kids that are linked to soccer.

Referees will wear body cams during the Club World Cup. The video technology can be used to monitor the officials, players and also offer the chance to be shown as part of TV coverage.

It is part of a major trial which could then see the technology introduced across all levels of the game, including the Premier League in the future.

Football Association chief executive Mark Bullingham has already championed the use of body cam technology to protect referees from abuse from fans and players from grassroots up.

It would have big support across the English game and has been given the green light for a trial in this summer's tournament in the United States by law makers IFAB.

Pierluigi Collina, chair of the FIFA Referees' Committee, said: “We think that it is a good chance to offer the viewers a new experience, in terms of images taken from a perspective, from an angle of vision which was never offered before.

“It also has a purpose in terms of referee coaching. Because, of course, having the possibility to see what the referee sees is important in the debriefing, to evaluate how the call was made by the referee, which was his view, and so on. So it's a combination of new experience for broadcasters and also for coaching purposes.”

IFAB has also approved new rules on time-wasting which means a corner kick will be given if a keeper holds the ball for eight seconds or longer.

The Club World Cup will pioneer that change by using a video count down on big screens during the tournament, similar to what is used in rugby on conversions. Collina added: “It will be a very, very interesting competition. [It's the] first time ever to have the best clubs around the world, from each corner of the world competing.

“So it's, I would say, an extra responsibility for us, for refereeing, because we want to have our referees ready in the best conditions when the competition starts. And we are aware that a high standard of refereeing is key to having a successful competition.""

Manchester City and Chelsea are England's sole representatives in the revamped Club World Cup, which now has a vastly different format to previous editions.

In a move heavily criticised by players, coaches, and executives alike, the competition has undergone a significant restructure for 2025 and will now feature an expanded field, with 32 teams participating in a summer tournament that closely resembles the World Cup.

It begins on June 15 and runs until July 13. Miami hosts the opening fixture, with the final being held at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. Meanwhile, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Seattle, Philadelphia and Nashville are a few of the other host cities.

Tuttosport newspaper confirms that Juventus are discussing a double shirt deal with Jeep and Visit Detroit, hoping to secure agreements before the 2025 Club World Cup begins.

Juventus aims to have a new main sponsor for the first team's shirts during the Club World Cup this summer.

According to the latest Tuttosport report, it could even be a double deal for the Bianconeri, who have resumed talks with Jeep.

The company is also owned by Juventus' holding company, Exor, but the two companies' previous agreement ended last season.

According to the report, Jeep is ready to send Juventus a new offer with financial support from Visit Detroit and an organisation that promotes activities in the largest city in the midwestern state of Michigan, US.

Tuttosport, however, notes that Juventus would only be allowed to show one sponsor in Champions League games next season, provided that they qualify.

The rules in Serie A are slightly different, as other clubs have previously been allowed to show a double sponsor on their shirts.

Jeep had been Juventus' main sponsor from 2012-13 until last season, paying up to €45m in each of the previous three campaigns. According to Tuttosport, the new agreement would be worth less than half that sum.

 



Car companies will not be spending big on kit sponsorships, nor will Italians be visiting Detroit any time soon…

Juventus is set to finish this season without a shirt sponsor after their previous contract with Jeep expired during the summer. The Bianconeri had hoped to secure a new sponsor for the season, but as of now, they have been unable to reach an agreement.

Despite engaging in talks with several brands interested in having their name displayed on the front of Juventus' iconic shirt, the club has not yet received an offer that they deem substantial enough to finalise a deal. As a result, the Old Lady has spent this season without a financial sponsor, which means missing out on crucial revenue that could have come from such a partnership.

However, Juventus is hopeful that they can resolve this issue before the season ends, with a solution expected to be in place before the Club World Cup takes place in the summer. According to Tuttojuve, Jeep is reportedly interested in returning as the club's primary sponsor and could feature on the shirt during the Club World Cup. This would mark the brand's return to a prominent position on the Juventus shirt after their previous partnership ended.

Nevertheless, Jeep is not the only company in talks with the club, as the report suggests that Juventus could potentially share the space with Visit Detroit. This dual-sponsorship arrangement would provide the club with much-needed revenue, although it is noted that Jeep may not be able to offer the same amount of financial backing they once did annually.

The importance of securing a shirt sponsor cannot be overstated, as such deals not only bring significant revenue to the club but also enhance the appearance of the shirt. Juventus will be keen to resolve this issue soon to ensure they can generate the necessary funds and regain their financial stability heading into the next phase of their season.

As a qualification for the 2002 World Cup, the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) decided to hold a qualifying tournament. The winner of the tournament would then play against the fifth-placed team from the South American qualification in a play-off for a place in the final tournament.

Ten national teams from the OFC entered this qualification tournament. The teams were split into two groups of five. Group One was hosted by Australia, Group Two was based in New Zealand.

Australia and New Zealand, traditionally the two strongest teams in the OFC, were, of course, separated into two different groups for the group stage. Group 1 included Australia, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and American Samoa (of which only Australia had previously appeared at the finals of a FIFA World Cup). In Group 2, apart from New Zealand, the teams of Tahiti, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Cook Islands were represented.

In the first round of the qualifying Group One, the favored Australia faced Tonga, the small island nation in Oceania with a population of about 100,000 inhabitants.

Tonga, nominally the home team for this qualifying match, were defeated 0-22 by Australia. This result beat the previous international record of 20-0 score-line from February 2000 when Kuwait defeated Bhutan in qualification for the 2000 AFC Asian Cup.

John Aloisi, then a striker of Coventry City in the Premier League, scored six goals in the match. The Australian line-up also included other players from good European teams, such as the duo Craig Moore and Tony Vidmar from Rangers.

Tonga coach Gary Phillips questioned the need for Australia to call up so many European-based players, saying: ""All up if you combine the total monetary worth of the Socceroos (the nickname of the Australian football team) and divide it by five, then you have the total economy of Tonga."" Coach of the Australian team Frank Farina described the whole match as ""embarrassing"".

The record goal margin was surpassed just two days later, on April 11, 2001, when Australia again prevailed, defeating American Samoa 31-0. American Samoa was one of the weakest teams in the world, having lost all of their official international matches since they had joined FIFA in 1998. Before the match, Australia was ranked 75th in the FIFA World Rankings, while American Samoa was ranked 203rd, the lowest of all FIFA members at that time.

However, the American Samoa national team arrived at the qualifying tournament in Australia even more weaker. They were troubled by passport issues, with only one member of their original 20-man squad eligible to play. American Samoa were also unable to call their under-20 players because most of them were involved in high school exams at the time.

They were forced to draft in youth players, including three 15-year-old players, to put together a makeshift team with an average age of 18. According to team manager Tony Langkilde, some of the players had never played a full 90-minute match before playing against the professional footballers of the Australian national team.

This American Samoa team couldn't even be competitive. Before facing the historic match against the Socceroos, American Samoa had lost 0-13 to Fiji and 0-8 to Samoa in the qualifying tournament.

Australia's striker Archie Thompson (at that time a player of the Australian club Marconi Stallions, and later a player of, for example, the Belgian side Lierse) broke the world record for most goals scored by a player in an international match by scoring 13 goals.

For completeness, after a record loss to Australia, American Samoa also lost their last match against Tonga 5-0. American Samoa, therefore finished Group One in last place with an overall score of 0-57.

The outcome of the Australia vs. American Samoa match, especially, but also of the whole Oceanian qualification, led to debates about the format of qualification tournaments. It was proposed that preliminary rounds should be introduced to avoid such unbalanced matches. This idea was applied right from the next qualification cycle. And in addition, the unbalanced level of opponents was also addressed by Australia's move to the Asian Football Confederation in 2006.

How did the Socceroos fare in this qualifier? Australia of course won their qualifying Group 1. Then they won the Oceanian zone final over New Zealand. In the OFC–CONMEBOL play-off against Uruguay Australia took a 1-0 win from the first leg. However, Uruguay won the second match 3-0 in South America, so the Australians did not make it to the 2002 World Cup in the end.","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","soccer"

Donald Trump's trade wars are probably a moment in time, although currently challenging the world order and undermining trust in the superpower that America once was.

When the North American World Cup comes around in 2026, you'd hope we'd have worked through all the casino economics.

That doesn't mean many people won't suffer in the short term, it's just not occurred to me the ramifications of changing the world order will genuinely impact on elite sport, unless certain owners wanted to try and choose to use it as a smokescreen.

A bit like when certain politicians used horrible world events as a 'good day' to release news on a policy they knew would be unpopular.

Whether fair or not, Premier League football doesn't catch the same heat as different industries. It seems to be insulated from world events that challenges others. Even during Covid - and could there be a bigger tariff than the shutdown of commerce - it didn't really have an impact on football.

Clubs complained about the challenges of paying wages but the status quo prevailed, didn't it?

I am thinking of the Glazers potentially using the uncertainty as an opportunity to explain how little money Manchester United have and why everything for the fans needs a price increase

Call me cynical but have we not just heard the witterings of Jim Ratcliffe about United running out of cash?

History has taught us that the super-wealthy tend to become even wealthier during the world's greatest crises, and you have to include Premier League owners in that group. Private equity players or nation states, they have assets that are diversified.

The only caveat would be those owners, and I am thinking of the Glazers at Manchester United, potentially using the uncertainty as an opportunity to explain how little money United have and why everything for the fans needs a price increase. Call me cynical but have we not just heard the witterings of Sir Jim Ratcliffe about United running out of cash?

It was noticeable we saw an increase in billionaires during the last global calamity we faced, Covid. The guys who run the top English clubs, valued at hundreds of millions, buy stocks during the dips on Wall Street and wait for the market to correct itself.

Prices dropped during Covid because of the pandemic, not because underlying aspects of the business were flawed and distressed. Markets create an opportunity for those who hold the wealth. This, while man-made (again, likely like Covid), has a similarity in the current shockwaves reverberating post-Trump's so-called liberation day.

Television rights are classified as services rather than manufacturing, so won't be affected in the same way by tariffs. And these rights are global, not dependent on the American market. As are the reasons major brands align themselves to the World Cup.

I have heard it argued the currency exchange will impact on borrowing rates of the Glazers. Good job then they have a partner like Sir Jim with deep pockets. Big-hitters, like them or Stan Kroenke or John W Henry, have bigger fish to fry commercially than prioritising the cash they may have to pony up into their football clubs every season.

As for the World Cup, it is 14 months away, by which time the Trump tariff effect is likely to have dissipated and solutions and adjustments made.

Not that I feel particularly sympathetic to FIFA if they are anxious. They were keen to give it to the USA, and Canada and Mexico, primarily because Trump Mark I gave them an assurance it would generate $15billion and certainly not because of his care and concern for the well-being of the world´s biggest sport.

Big-hitters, like Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke (pictured with Super Bowl trophy), have bigger fish to fry commercially than the cash they have to pony up into their football clubs

FIFA and Gianni Infantino wanted to dance with Trump because of the money. It is their problem if they get less than expected in their coffers

FIFA and Gianni Infantino wanted to dance with Trump because of the money. It is their problem if they get less than expected in their coffers. I don't think it will play out that way because the world will have returned by then, as Trump's policy position is an experiment and probably not his end game.

He is just pulling levers to achieve outcomes so I don't see it impacting on sport unless owners like the Glazers use it for their own advantage.

They've spent their time at United – from the moment they bought the club with only a very small amount of money – loading their obligations elsewhere and using the club to enhance their own wealth.

In truth, they are sufficiently wealthy to trade their different portfolios to make as much money in distressed times as they would in good. But the opportunity is there to exploit the eroding of global trust created by Trump to play possum with their fan base and cite it as a reason not to invest.

Although trust and the Glazers are not bedfellows that the United fans will recognise anyway!

How Chelsea played PSR cards right

Timing is everything and while Manchester City await the result of 115 alleged financial breaches, Chelsea are set to drive a coach and horses through the value of Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).

They have sold their women's team to another part of their business for something akin to the entire income of the world's 20 biggest women's teams.

While the cases aren't identical, the motivations perhaps are, both driven by an ability to spend and compete at the highest level.

They benefited from Roman Abramovich taking over in 2003 when there were no restrictions on investment and he could do what he wanted

Chelsea owner Todd Boehly was at the White House this week to celebrate his LA Dodgers team winning last year's World Series

City have been accused in part of disguising equity investment as commercial deals that never happened or were massively over-valued. Chelsea have been open about how and why they valued their women's team for £200million. Their auditors cleared it so I'll be fascinated to see if the Premier League meaningfully disapprove.

Where Chelsea have been luckier – twice – is WHEN their changes in ownership occurred.

They benefited from Roman Abramovich taking over in 2003 when there were no restrictions on investment and he could do what he wanted. By Sheik Mansour's time in 2008, the authorities were adamant – for reasons the big five clubs may explain even better (note sarcasm) – they didn't want the industry to fall prey to another Abramovich who had set the system on fire with his spending.

Hence, Manchester City found they were in an industry being policed more robustly, but without them having the visibility of how FFP and PSR would actually work. If they'd realised what was in the offing, they would perhaps have bought City via a structure that had a whole load of assets to dispose of within the wider group.

When Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital bought Chelsea in 2022, they had the benefit of seeing what had happened to City and prepared outcomes to fit rules while still investing heavily.

They have been able to hide in plain sight, offering what they consider a fair market value for their women's team when there has previously been no benchmark for the asset's worth.

I spoke to several investors 18 months ago who felt buying a woman's football club, stripping it away from an existing framework (ie men's football) and giving it separate management and ownership, would be a significant opportunity.

Why? Because women's football can be acquired at an economic price and will increase in value with bigger attendances, revenue streams and interest from broadcasters.

The fact Chelsea can pick up a valuation of their women's team and use it to overcome what governance is supposed to be shows how ridiculous it is

That wasn't the thinking behind the aforementioned Chelseanomics model inflating the marketplace!

I don't look at Chelsea as liberty-takers. I look at the overall ideals behind financial governance of football and say it's a joke. The fact Chelsea can pick up a valuation of their women's team and use it to overcome what governance is supposed to be shows how ridiculous it is.

City's regret as they await their potential punishment is that they didn't know then what is clear now.

My favourite ground? Wherever I could get out quick! 

I wouldn't have been much of a travel companion. As Crystal Palace chairman, I had one favourite stadium – Selhurst Park – and didn't like any of the others or their fans

Congratulations to Oliver Holt, my Padel partner in Qatar, for visiting all 92 league grounds.

I wouldn't have been much of a travel companion. As Crystal Palace chairman, I had one favourite stadium – Selhurst Park – and didn't like any of the others or their fans.

I'd turn up at five-to-three, get called a 'w*****' by the away supporters and leave as quickly as possible at full time, preferably with three points.

If pushed, I'd have to acknowledge Elland Road had an impressive atmosphere but it wasn't state-of-the art, and I didn't much like their chairman at the time, Ken Bates, either! Despite him pinching my cheek and saying we were alike, much to my chagrin.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Flashback: Two crushing record wins that changed World Cup qualification","https://www.flashscore.com/news/soccer-fifa-club-world-cup-flashback-two-crushing-record-wins-that-changed-world-cup-qualification/2LfPAOwf/","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 12:53:09 GMT","

As a qualification for the 2002 World Cup, the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) decided to hold a qualifying tournament. The winner of the tournament would then play against the fifth-placed team from the South American qualification in a play-off for a place in the final tournament.

Ten national teams from the OFC entered this qualification tournament. The teams were split into two groups of five. Group One was hosted by Australia, Group Two was based in New Zealand.

Australia and New Zealand, traditionally the two strongest teams in the OFC, were, of course, separated into two different groups for the group stage. Group 1 included Australia, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and American Samoa (of which only Australia had previously appeared at the finals of a FIFA World Cup). In Group 2, apart from New Zealand, the teams of Tahiti, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Cook Islands were represented.

In the first round of the qualifying Group One, the favored Australia faced Tonga, the small island nation in Oceania with a population of about 100,000 inhabitants.

Tonga, nominally the home team for this qualifying match, were defeated 0-22 by Australia. This result beat the previous international record of 20-0 score-line from February 2000 when Kuwait defeated Bhutan in qualification for the 2000 AFC Asian Cup.

John Aloisi, then a striker of Coventry City in the Premier League, scored six goals in the match. The Australian line-up also included other players from good European teams, such as the duo Craig Moore and Tony Vidmar from Rangers.

Tonga coach Gary Phillips questioned the need for Australia to call up so many European-based players, saying: ""All up if you combine the total monetary worth of the Socceroos (the nickname of the Australian football team) and divide it by five, then you have the total economy of Tonga."" Coach of the Australian team Frank Farina described the whole match as ""embarrassing"".

The record goal margin was surpassed just two days later, on April 11, 2001, when Australia again prevailed, defeating American Samoa 31-0. American Samoa was one of the weakest teams in the world, having lost all of their official international matches since they had joined FIFA in 1998. Before the match, Australia was ranked 75th in the FIFA World Rankings, while American Samoa was ranked 203rd, the lowest of all FIFA members at that time.

However, the American Samoa national team arrived at the qualifying tournament in Australia even more weaker. They were troubled by passport issues, with only one member of their original 20-man squad eligible to play. American Samoa were also unable to call their under-20 players because most of them were involved in high school exams at the time.

They were forced to draft in youth players, including three 15-year-old players, to put together a makeshift team with an average age of 18. According to team manager Tony Langkilde, some of the players had never played a full 90-minute match before playing against the professional footballers of the Australian national team.

This American Samoa team couldn't even be competitive. Before facing the historic match against the Socceroos, American Samoa had lost 0-13 to Fiji and 0-8 to Samoa in the qualifying tournament.

Australia's striker Archie Thompson (at that time a player of the Australian club Marconi Stallions, and later a player of, for example, the Belgian side Lierse) broke the world record for most goals scored by a player in an international match by scoring 13 goals.

For completeness, after a record loss to Australia, American Samoa also lost their last match against Tonga 5-0. American Samoa, therefore finished Group One in last place with an overall score of 0-57.

The outcome of the Australia vs. American Samoa match, especially, but also of the whole Oceanian qualification, led to debates about the format of qualification tournaments. It was proposed that preliminary rounds should be introduced to avoid such unbalanced matches. This idea was applied right from the next qualification cycle. And in addition, the unbalanced level of opponents was also addressed by Australia's move to the Asian Football Confederation in 2006.

How did the Socceroos fare in this qualifier? Australia of course won their qualifying Group 1. Then they won the Oceanian zone final over New Zealand. In the OFC–CONMEBOL play-off against Uruguay Australia took a 1-0 win from the first leg. However, Uruguay won the second match 3-0 in South America, so the Australians did not make it to the 2002 World Cup in the end.","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","soccer"

The winger played a surprisingly prominent role in the capital club's Ligue 1 triumph - and he might help them conquer Europe too

Desire Doue was always going to win Ligue 1 in his first season at Paris Saint-Germain. French football may be a fertile breeding ground for top talent - the Rennes academy product in question is proof of that fact - but the outcome of its top-flight title race is nearly always a foregone conclusion.

The Qatari state's support of PSG has killed any semblance of competition in Ligue 1, resulting in the capital club winning 11 of the past 13 championships, including the last four in a row. Still, if PSG's latest title triumph was painfully predictable, the crucial role that Doue played in it was anything but.

Granted, Doue had arrived at the Parc des Princes last summer touted as a player of enormous potential, but it was thought that he would take some time to settle into his new surroundings, particularly in light of the intense competition for places at PSG. And yet when Luis Enrique's star-studded squad needed a goal against Angers on Saturday to wrap up the title before their midweek Champions League quarter-final clash with Aston Villa, it was Doue who stepped up to the mark, netting the only but all-important goal in a 1-0 victory.

MONTE CARLO, Monaco—For the second time in 11 months at an ATP Masters 1000 clay-court event, Novak Djokovic was eliminated by left-hander Alejandro Tabilo.Following his 6-3, 6-4 defeat to the Chilean Wednesday in the second round of the Monte Carlo Masters, the 24-time major champion revealed he wasn't surprised about the outcome of “the worst day.”Speaking with press, Djokovic stated, “Look, I was hoping it was not going to happen, but it was quite a high probability I'm going to play this way. Horrible feeling to play this way, and just sorry for all the people that have to witness this.”

When asked if he could point to a reason for how it all played out, Djokovic responded, “I don't know. I don't have it. I have it and I don't have it. I don't really care.”The 37-year-old experienced a 6-2, 6-3 third-round loss to Tabilo at last year's Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome. He came into their latest contest on the back of an encouraging performance at the Miami Open, where he finished runner-up to Jakub Mensik, but downplayed any hope of carrying that momentum through when switching surfaces.“I knew I'm gonna have a tough opponent and I knew I'm gonna probably play pretty bad. But this bad, I didn't expect,” said the Serbian.

Will we be saying “Monte Carlitos"" after Alcaraz's effort in the principality this week?BySteve TignorPublished Apr 09, 2025 copy_link

Published Apr 09, 2025

“Monte…Carlitos?”That was the question scrawled on a sign that a fan held up during Carlos “Call me Carlitos” Alcaraz's opening-round match in Monte Carlo on Wednesday.The question mark was very much appropriate, because the idea seemed like a bit of a long shot at the start of the Spaniard's opening-round encounter with Francisco Cerundolo. Alcaraz, despite his mastery of clay in other locales, had never won a match in Monte Carlo, and had only played the tournament once.

Unfortunately for Cerundolo, that's exactly what happened. In this case, the entire match swung toward Alcaraz. From that point on, he was the one who controlled the court position, who dictated the patterns of the rallies, who broke serve at will, and who finished with a fully confident flurry of drop shots. He would lose just one more game in a 3-6, 6-0, 6-1 win in 98 minutes.“I didn't start well, I made a lot of mistakes, let him play inside the court and dominate the points,” Alcaraz said.“After the first set I had to do something else. I had to play more aggressively. I had to play my tennis.”The biggest difference, Alcaraz said, was his determination to move up and “return close to the line.” That set the tone for the way he played the rest of a point.

By the third set, Alcaraz was anticipating everything, and was in position for any Cerundolo ground stroke.

Jack Draper has made a positive start to his clay court season after beating Marcos Giron at the Monte Carlo Masters.

Draper is at a career-high ranking after some impressive results so far this season, and is looking to continue that throughout the clay season.

The Brit's biggest moment of the year and his career so far came last month, with Draper winning Indian Wells after beating Holger Rune in the final.

Although Draper is more familiar with hard and grass courts, there is now some discussion surrounding his potential on clay.

Draper dismissed world number 45 Giron in just over an hour, winning 6-1 6-1, to obtain his second ever Monte Carlo Masters match win.

This got plenty of people talking on social media, including Draper's compatriot and two-time Grand Slam junior doubles champion Liam Broady.

In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Broady appeared to be in disbelief at how well Draper was playing.

Broady wrote, “The set of tennis I have just seen Jack Draper play. Wow.”

The set of tennis I have just seen Jack Draper play. Wow 😂

This was followed up by a series of replies, including one fan already looking ahead to Draper's grass court season and potential Wimbledon chances.

However, Broady did not want to overlook Draper at Roland Garros, predicting the world number six to have a good tournament.

“I'm excited for him at RG [Roland Garros],” said Broady. “I think he could have a really good run.”

I'm excited for him at RG. I think he could have a really good run

Despite Broady's faith in Draper, if he is to do well at Roland Garros this year he will have to do something that he has never before.

Draper has made two main draw appearances at Roland Garros in his young career so far, losing in the first round on both occasions.

In 2023, he was struggling with a shoulder injury, while last year Draper was beaten by qualifier Jesper de Jong.

Following his latest victory over Giron, Draper has now won 10 matches on the main ATP Tour on clay.

However, Draper still has a negative win-loss record on clay, having lost 11 of his 21 matches on the surface.

Draper will look to continue to improve his record on clay when he plays his next match at the Monte Carlo Masters against either Tomas Martin Etcheverry or Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

A look at some of the biggest upsets in Roland-Garros history

This year's Grand Slam season has already gotten off to a blistering start with the Australian Open raising the curtain on what promises to be a stellar campaign. Jannik Sinner reigned supreme in the Land Down Under for the second straight year. He beat Alexander Zverev in straight sets in Melbourne to rubber stamp his credentials as the dominant hard-court player on the planet, but now attention turns to the summer.

Next up comes the French Open in Paris and online betting sites are already previewing the iconic clay court showdown. The latest sports betting odds currently price reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz as the even-money favourite, with the aforementioned Sinner (+275) and all-time great Novak Djokovic (+550) expected to push the Spaniard all the way. But those three should beware, as Roland Garros has sprung plenty of upsets over the years.

Back in 2014, Swiss sensation Stan Wawrinka was riding the crest of a wave. He claimed his maiden Grand Slam when he won the Australian Open just months before, and with Roger Federer then on the wrong side of 30, he looked set to take over as Switzerland's resident Superman. He headed to the French Open as the third seed, and he was expected to make a deep tournament run, potentially even usurping longtime king Rafa Nadal.

But despite the lofty expectations, Wawrinka looked a million miles away from the blistering best which led him to gold in Melbourne. He committed a staggering 62 unforced errors in his first round against Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, and the Spaniard took full advantage. Ranked 41st in the world at the time, the underdog capitalised on the heavy favourite's erratic performance, winning by three sets to one, much to the surprise of the Court Philippe Chatrier faithful in attendance.

Post-match, Wawrinka admitted, “I was trying to find my game, trying to be aggressive, trying to find anything, and I didn't.” You certainly didn't, Stan.

Fast forward nine years and Roland Garros was treated to another Cinderella story when Brazil's Thiago Seyboth Wild, an unseeded qualifier, took down second seed Daniil Medvedev in a thrilling five-set encounter in the first round. The Russian headed to the French capital with genuine hopes of claiming his second Grand Slam title, building on his US Open victory in 2021. He was the second seed and an overwhelming favourite to dispatch his lowly opponent.

Despite dropping the first set, those predictions looked accurate when Medvedev reeled off two straight and seemed poised for a comfortable passage to the second round. However, his clay-court vulnerabilities came to the fore against the unknown Brazilian, who used powerful baseline strokes and innovative shot-making to dismantle the Russian's usually impenetrable game. Seyboth Wild powered his way through to the final two sets, claiming them 6-3 and 6-4 before ultimately falling in the third round, but not before he had claimed the illustrious scalp of Medvedev.

Novak Djokovic beating Rafael Nadal is hardly an earth-shattering upset. Both players are considered as two of the three greatest of all time alongside Roger Federer, with purists debating who sits first overall. However, those debates were settled – for some – back in 2021, when Nole beat the King of Clay on his strongest surface in the semi-finals.

Nadal headed into the contest with two more Grand Slam titles than his Serbian rival, and many expected that gap to be pushed out to an unassailable-looking three in Paris. Instead, it was Djokovic who upset the odds and forced onlookers to reconsider who they had long considered the greatest of all time.

Rafa had won the last four French Opens on the spin and held an almost mythical 105-2 career record at the tournament. But Djokvic was unfazed. Widely regarded as one of the greatest matches in the tournament's history, the Serbian recovered from a slow start to claim a 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 victory, displaying fearless aggression and an uncanny ability to absorb Nadal's relentless hitting. He went on to win the tournament and has since taken his overall slam tally to 24, two more than the recently retired Nadal.

By 2009, Rafael Nadal was an unstoppable force on clay. Since his debut at the tournament four years prior, the Spaniard had never lost a match in Paris, winning four straight titles. Many expected number five to be on the way, but an unheard-of Swede was about to rip up the script.

Robin Soderling had never made it past the third round of a Grand Slam, but at the 2009 French Open, he did exactly that. However, his journey would surely come to an end in the fourth round against Nadal. But hey, a personal best is something to celebrate, right? Well, it was about to get even better.

The alarm bells were ringing loud and clear for Nadal in the very first set when the Swede romped through it 6-2. That was just the seventh time in 28 matches that the Spaniard had lost a set at the tournament and the second time in 14 matches spanning the previous two tournaments. While he rallied to claim the second set in a tiebreaker, it was clear that he had a game on his hands against the unheralded Swede.

Soderling again got his nose ahead, claiming the third set 6-4. Nadal again battled, taking the fourth to a tiebreaker. But this time around, it was the Swede that got the victory, winning the tiebreak 7-2 to secure the coveted game, set, and match. His victory sent shockwaves around the sporting world and he would ultimately go on to reach the final, where he was defeated by Roger Federer.

Nadal would get his redemption a year later when the pair met again, this time in the final. But even still, this defeat remains the greatest shocker not just in the history of the French Open, but perhaps in the sport of tennis altogether.

Novak Djokovic crashed out of the Monte Carlo Masters in his opening match of the clay-court season as Alejandro Tabilo made it successive wins against the 24-time grand slam champion.

Djokovic had won 10 consecutive matches on clay stretching back to last season's French Open and Olympics, where the Serbian won gold at Roland Garros, but he fell to a 6-3 6-4 defeat.

Chilean left-hander Tabilo, ranked 32 in the world, also defeated the 37-year-old Djokovic on clay at last year's Italian Open in Rome and has now won both meetings against the former World No 1.

Tabilo had struggled this season, winning just two matches prior to Monte Carlo, but defeated former French Open winner Stanislas Wawrinka in the first round to set up a clash with Djokovic.

And the 27-year-old became just the third player in history to face Djokovic at least twice and not lose to him, joining Marat Safin and Jiri Vesely, as he converted his second match point to win in straight sets.

Djokovic was out of sorts and struggled badly on his forehand side, making 29 unforced errors in total. He had two break point opportunities to get back on serve late in the second set but could not take them.

Concerningly for Djokovic, he has now lost in his opening match three times at the last four tournaments, following early exits against Matteo Berrettini in Doha in February and Botic van de Zandschulp at Indian Wells in March.

Djokovic reached the final of the Miami Masters last month, showing better form, but was beaten by teenager Jakub Mensik 7-6 7-6 to deny him his 100th career singles title.

The Monte Carlo Masters is one of three of the highest-ranked ATP tournaments before the second grand slam of the season at Roland Garros, along with the Madrid Open and Italian Open.

Earlier in the Monte Carlo, there were victories for seeds Carlos Alcaraz, Casper Ruud, Andrey Rublev, Alex de Minaur and Arthur Fils.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Alex Eala's clay schedule revealed","https://www.tennis365.com/?p=188807","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 13:05:56 GMT","

Alex Eala has one of the biggest breakout stars of the WTA Tour in 2025 – thanks to her stunning Miami Open run.

The 19-year-old beat both Madison Keys and Iga Swiatek to reach the last four of the WTA 1000 event, and broke into the top 100 of the WTA Rankings as a result.

Having initially soared to a new high of world No 75, Eala has now moved up a further two places to world No 73 – despite not even playing last week.

However, the Filipina is set for an imminent return to action – and looks primed for a significant run of tournaments this upcoming clay swing.

Eala's clay court season will begin at WTA 125 level at the Oeiras Open, held next week in the Portuguese coastal town.

The 19-year-old made her debut at the event in 2024, losing 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 to Julia Avdeeva in the opening round twelve months ago.

There is a total prize money package of $168,100 across the 32-player draw.

After action in Oeiras, Eala is then set to return to the Madrid Open – one of the most significant events of her career so far.

It was in Madrid a year ago that she won a match at WTA 1000 level for the first time, beating Lesia Tsurenko in round one before a three-set defeat to 27th seed Sorana Cirstea.

Eala had received a wildcard into the main draw the past two years, thanks to the tournament being owned by IMG – the same group that manages her, and owns the Miami Open.

The Filipina star was not quite ranked high enough to enter the main draw by right, but will likely receive a wildcard once again this year – or compete in the qualifying draw.

Should Eala fail to qualify for the main draw in Madrid or lose in the early stages in the main draw, she will not rest on her laurels – but instead head to the Catalonia Open in Vic.

It would be the 19-year-old's debut at the Catalonia Open, having not played the 2023 event in Reus or the 2024 event in Lleida.

Much like Oeiras, this is a WTA 125 event – the level directly below the WTA main draw.

Once action in Madrid and Vic is complete, Eala is then set to make her debut appearance at the Italian Open in Rome.

The WTA 1000 title is one of the biggest tournaments of the year, and is perhaps the most prestigious women's event on clay outside of Roland Garros.

Eala has never even contested qualifying in Rome before but looks set to potentially do just that in 2025.

The world No 73 has narrowly missed out on a main draw place and is currently set to be among the top seeds in qualifying – though a main draw wildcard is again a possibility.

Similarly to Madrid, the teen star could play a WTA 125 event during the second week of the WTA 1000 should she lose early or fail to qualify.

Eala is currently expected to play at the Palma Ladies Open, which will be held from 12-18 May.

It will be her debut at the event, which was initially launched as a WTA 250 event in 2021 before being downgraded two years later.

Perhaps most exciting for Eala is the fact that she is now set to make her Grand Slam debut at the 2025 French Open.

Having soared inside the top 100 following Miami, the 19-year-old is well inside the entry cutoff for Roland Garros – with the main draw set to start two days after her 20th birthday.

Eala was beaten in the final round of Roland Garros qualifying by Julia Riera in 2024 and has lost in Grand Slam qualifying in all six of her attempts.

However, with the Filipina comfortably inside the top 100, she is set to feature on the French Open entry list when it is released later this month.

Novak Djokovic, the tennis sensation, faced a catastrophic defeat in his debut match at the prestigious Monte-Carlo Masters, sending shockwaves through the sports world. This unexpected loss has dealt a severe blow to Djokovic's preparations for the upcoming French Open, raising questions about his form and readiness for the grand slam event.

Known for his remarkable skills and dominance on the court, Djokovic's early exit from the Monte-Carlo Masters has left fans and experts stunned. Despite his extensive experience at the tournament, having participated 18 times, Djokovic has only managed to clinch the title twice, a surprising statistic for a player of his caliber.

The defeat has ignited speculation and debate within the tennis community, with many wondering about the possible reasons behind Djokovic's uncharacteristic performance. As one of the leading contenders in every tournament he enters, Djokovic's loss has certainly created an air of uncertainty around his future matches and overall season.

With the French Open fast approaching, Djokovic will need to regroup and refocus in order to maintain his status as one of the top players in the world. The road ahead will undoubtedly be challenging, but Djokovic's talent and determination may very well pave the way for a remarkable comeback in the days to come.

As fans eagerly await Djokovic's next move, one thing is certain – the world of tennis has been shaken by the Serbian star's unexpected defeat at the Monte-Carlo Masters, setting the stage for a thrilling and unpredictable season ahead.

Many expected Novak Djokovic to be one of the favourites to win the French Open 2025 as the tennis calendar enters the clay court season. However, Djokovic could not have made a worse start to life on the clay courts if he tried. 

Taking to the court in the Round of 32 in the Monte Carlo Masters, Djokovic lost in straight sets to Chile's Alejandro Tabilo. The 6-3, 6-4 loss is his second loss in as many matches against Tabilo. 

The Chilean southpaw had also defeated Djokovic in the final of last year's Italian Open, meaning he is 2-0 up in head-to-head records against the former world number 1.

It is worth noting, however, that Djokovic was plagued by a series of issues in the build-up to what is one of the most prestigious tournaments on the calendar outside of the Grand Slams. 

The Serbian was dealing with an eye infection just prior to the match and, to make things worse, seemingly picked up an arm injury as physios had to tend to his right forearm in a practice session before the match. 

His form had also not been up to his usual high standards - he was coming into this tournament on the back of a straight sets final defeat at the Miami Open and the turnaround from hard courts to clay was always going to take time. 

Yet fans would have expected more than a loss in straight sets during the opening round, and does raise plenty of questions over his French Open expectations. 

Djokovic has won 24 Grand Slams in his illustrious career - the most by a male tennis player and the joint-most single titles alongside Margaret Court. However, that 25th Slam has proven elusive so far. 

His last Grand Slam came in the 2023 US Open and he has since been unable to add to his tally. 

Notably, Serena Williams is someone who suffered a similar fate. She won 23 Grand Slams, the last of which came in the 2017 Australian Open - but she could never equal Court's record before her retirement.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","No desire to queue all night at Wimbledon? Now you don't have to","https://www.thetimes.com/business-money/entrepreneurs/article/jumping-the-queue-can-pay-for-tennis-fans-enterprise-network-f2tlqb77h","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 05:00:00 GMT","

The queue for Wimbledon tickets is so famous that it even has its own account on X. Each day of the two-week tournament, tennis superfans eat, drink and sleep in the queue, erecting tents and pumping air mattresses as the sun sets, in order to have the best chance possible of securing one of the roughly 500 “Show Court” tickets released daily. 

That is, unless you have very deep pockets. Wealthy tennis fans are able to buy debenture tickets, valid for the entire tournament for five years at a time, through Dowgate Capital, a private bank. Centre Court debentures for the five years up to and including 2030 were last year sold for £116,000 per seat while applications open at lunchtime on Wednesday for No 1 Court for debentures beginning in 2027. 

The money raised from their sale goes towards improvements and upkeep of the grounds. It's a considerable sum: the debentures sold last year for Centre Court raised £292.3 million. In return the debenture ticket owner is guaranteed a premium seat for five years as well as the use of exclusive restaurants and bars on the site. The other principal benefit is that they are allowed to transfer or sell on their tickets, something not permitted with other ticket types.

This has created a resale market — and a business opportunity spotted by Natasha Bhatia, founder of Green & Purple. She started the company in 2021 after buying two debenture seats and exploring the options for selling her surplus tickets to help recoup her investment but finding them wanting. 

“One was the massive ticket resale platforms like Viagogo and StubHub, which was not really tailored towards the Wimbledon debenture market, which is very niche, high value and very quirky. Then there were multiple brokers who would buy the tickets from you and then mark them up and sell them on their own sites. And then there was one that acted a bit like an agent. So you listed your tickets with them, they established the price and then they'd get inquiries that they'd put out to all of their debenture ticket holders.

“It was all very archaic and inefficient, and there was a lack of transparency. I thought we could create the sort of service that people would want,” said Bhatia, who previously worked in investment banking and private equity. 

There are around 450 premium tickets on the platform, with the cheapest tickets costing around £650 each for a mixed doubles day. Bhatia says the average cost of tickets on No 1 Court is around £2,000 and around £3,500 for Centre Court but the largest transaction through the platform was £420,000 for four tickets for the men's finals and four for the semi-finals. 

Many factors affect the amount a ticket can fetch, said Bhatia. This includes whether the seats are in the sun or the shade, the height of the row, and the proximity to the royal box, which is used to host special guests as well as members of the royal family. 

Although selling individual tickets is the main business of Green & Purple, Bhatia said she's also been asked to sell on debentures. This is the best route to getting onto the debenture register but is pricey: debentures for Centre Court sold last year for £116,000 are already on the secondary market for £200,000.

Bhatia, a lifelong tennis fan who used to play truant from school to go to Wimbledon, said she is seeing a new type of demographic among debenture holders. “You've got people who work in finance, then you've got old money and family offices. And in a way they have very similar interests, in terms of art, culture and sports.” 

She said that because of the size of the transactions, Green & Purple has to pay particular attention to cybersecurity. “We were going through the process the other day and we worked through all the different ‘what ifs', and we started thinking about what if someone's email is hacked. Let's say it's a £10,000 ticket and it goes to the wrong email account. We have to think about how we protect not only the buyer but also ourselves in that situation,” said Bhatia.

She said the company doesn't deal in cash — but that doesn't stop people asking. “Somebody did say I'll come to your house with cash. It was very last-minute, practically on the day. And I just said, ‘No, we can't do it.'”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Andy Roddick has heard a tennis rumor which he really hopes is true as it could lead to big change at Grand Slams","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/andy-roddick-has-heard-a-tennis-rumor-which-he-really-hopes-is-true-as-it-could-lead-to-big-change-at-grand-slams/","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 01:00:00 GMT","

The second Grand Slam of 2025 is fast approaching, as fans look forward to the stars of men's and women's tennis taking to the court in Paris.

World number one Jannik Sinner won the Australian Open men's singles title earlier this year, securing his third Major crown with a straight sets victory over Alexander Zverev.

On the women's side, America's Madison Keys won her first Grand Slam, taking down Aryna Sabalenka in a three-set thriller on Rod Laver Arena.

At Roland Garros, Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz will look to defend their titles despite struggling for form as of late.

Ahead of the French Open, one former Grand Slam champion has shared his thoughts on a rumor he heard recently.

Speaking on his Served with Andy Roddick podcast, 2003 US Open champion Andy Roddick gave his honest opinion on something he heard last week.

“Prize money, percentage of prize money, is insane, it's laughably low,” said Roddick.

“I hope the rumors of the top 20 [players] on the men's and women's side writing a letter directly representing themselves to the Slams is true.

“It's been reported, hopefully, we'll know more about it, and we'll talk more about it when it is confirmed. I hope that's the case.”

News broke earlier this month that the top 20 players in tennis sent a letter to the four Grand Slams, requesting an increase to prize money, relative to the revenue the events generate.

Roddick then named the two other improvements he thinks players should be demanding from the Grand Slams.

“I'm going to beat this drum as much as I can, healthcare contributions from Slams [and] pensions,” he said.

“Think about yourself not three weeks from now but 30 years from now.

“Think about the people that are trying to be coaches, think about the people who are carving out a living, think about what your body is going to feel like.

“I feel a lot different at 42, having gone through 15 years of professional tennis than probably most 42-year-olds.

“Ask those questions now so you can reap the benefits later.”

The Professional Tennis Players Association [PTPA] launched a lawsuit against the tennis tours earlier this year, demanding changes in several key areas.

Roddick expressed his concerns with the PTPA's case but has now shared the one point they made he is definitely on board with.

“I would say actually make it, if you're an independent contractor then you have free markets to play whatever events,” he said.

“There is an incentive already to play in as many ATP [Tour events] and Slams as possible because of points. 

“Every rank, every endorsement is structured off of rankings that you get from those tournaments. You're incentivized to participate in them as much as possible.

“As Chris Eubanks mentioned a couple of weeks ago, if he gets some outlier offer to go play in something crazy or a corporate event or a Pro-am before the US Open or something where he can make a third round Slam money in a day.

“I think he should be able to do that.

“The PTPA mentioned that, for as many issues as I have that they get wrong, they pointed that out very clearly and I think that was something that I would co-sign for sure.”

It remains to be seen what the outcome of the letter sent by top tennis stars or the PTPA case will be, but it will certainly be something to watch out for in 2025.

Perhaps some of the changes proposed will be brought in ahead of the French Open, which begins on Sunday, May 25.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Andre Agassi remains one of the most iconic and influential tennis players in history – and this week marks 30 years since one of his greatest accomplishments.

April 10 will mark exactly three decades since the American rose to world No 1 for the first time, cementing his place in the record books after a stunning rise to the top.

Here, we reflect on how Agassi surged to the very top of the sport.

By the summer of 1994, Agassi was established as one of the biggest stars in the sport – and was already a Grand Slam champion.

After defeats in the 1990 and 1991 French Open final, and 1990 US Open final, the American had finally claimed a first Grand Slam title at Wimbledon in 1992, beating Goran Ivanisevic in a five-set epic.

Agassi had reached a career-high of world No 3 earlier in his career, but a difficult 1993 and 1994 campaign saw him slip down the rankings ahead of the 1994 US Open.

Despite victory at the Canadian Open earlier in the summer, the 24-year-old was still down at 20th in the rankings – not high enough to be seeded at any major at the time.

However, that did not stop him from claiming a first US Open – and second Grand Slam – title.

Agassi beat sixth seed Michael Chang in the fourth round, 13th seed Thomas Muster in the last eight, and ninth seed Todd Martin in the last four to reach his fifth Grand Slam final.

The American faced fourth seed and fellow Wimbledon winner Michael Stich in the final, but the German was no match for Agassi – who stormed to a 6-1, 7-6(5), 7-5 triumph.

Victory on home turf propelled Agassi back inside the top 10 of the ATP Rankings, and he then went on a significant tear to end the season.

Titles in Vienna – again beating Stich – and Paris came Agassi's way by the end of 1994, and he would finish the season at a new high of world No 2.

He was among the Australian Open favourites at the start of 1995 and, thanks to a four-set triumph over top seed Pete Sampras, claimed a second straight major triumph with victory in Melbourne.

It was Agassi's first-ever appearance Down Under, and victory on his tournament debut propelled him close to world No 1 Sampras in the rankings.

Victory for Sampras over Agassi in the Indian Wells held off his rival temporarily, but Agassi then moved within touching distance after beating his greatest rival to lift the Miami Open title.

Ultimately, Agassi would not win the world No 1 ranking on court.

With Sampras withdrawing from events in Osaka and Tokyo after the ‘Sunshine Double', the points he dropped there proved enough for Agassi to rise to No 1 on April 10, 1995.

After rising to world No 1 for the first time, the eight-time Grand Slam champion would spend 30 weeks at the top before being replaced by Sampras in November 1995.

Agassi would briefly reclaim the No 1 ranking for two weeks in January and February 1996, though he then slipped dramatically down the ranking over the next two years.

Struggles on and off the court saw the American fall outside of the top 100 at one stage, though a stunning resurgence in 1999 helped him reclaim his position at the top of the sport.

Agassi completed the Career Grand Slam with victory at the 1999 French Open and, despite losing the Wimbledon final to Sampras, took the world No 1 back off his compatriot for three weeks.

After a summer battle with Sampras and Pat Rafter, which saw the top ranking change hands multiple times, Agassi's 1999 US Open triumph saw him cement his place at the top.

A sixth Grand Slam title at the 2000 Australian Open helped him reign at No 1 for exactly 52 weeks until September 2000, and he would then reign for further spells of two weeks and 12 weeks in 2003.

Agassi's final day as world No 1 came on September 7, 2003 – his 101st and final week as the world's best player.

To this day, Agassi remains one of just nine men to spend over 100 weeks as the world No 1.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","Andy Roddick has heard a tennis rumor which he really hopes is true as it could lead to big change at Grand Slams","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/andy-roddick-has-heard-a-tennis-rumor-which-he-really-hopes-is-true-as-it-could-lead-to-big-change-at-grand-slams/","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 01:00:00 GMT","

The second Grand Slam of 2025 is fast approaching, as fans look forward to the stars of men's and women's tennis taking to the court in Paris.

World number one Jannik Sinner won the Australian Open men's singles title earlier this year, securing his third Major crown with a straight sets victory over Alexander Zverev.

On the women's side, America's Madison Keys won her first Grand Slam, taking down Aryna Sabalenka in a three-set thriller on Rod Laver Arena.

At Roland Garros, Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz will look to defend their titles despite struggling for form as of late.

Ahead of the French Open, one former Grand Slam champion has shared his thoughts on a rumor he heard recently.

Speaking on his Served with Andy Roddick podcast, 2003 US Open champion Andy Roddick gave his honest opinion on something he heard last week.

“Prize money, percentage of prize money, is insane, it's laughably low,” said Roddick.

“I hope the rumors of the top 20 [players] on the men's and women's side writing a letter directly representing themselves to the Slams is true.

“It's been reported, hopefully, we'll know more about it, and we'll talk more about it when it is confirmed. I hope that's the case.”

News broke earlier this month that the top 20 players in tennis sent a letter to the four Grand Slams, requesting an increase to prize money, relative to the revenue the events generate.

Roddick then named the two other improvements he thinks players should be demanding from the Grand Slams.

“I'm going to beat this drum as much as I can, healthcare contributions from Slams [and] pensions,” he said.

“Think about yourself not three weeks from now but 30 years from now.

“Think about the people that are trying to be coaches, think about the people who are carving out a living, think about what your body is going to feel like.

“I feel a lot different at 42, having gone through 15 years of professional tennis than probably most 42-year-olds.

“Ask those questions now so you can reap the benefits later.”

The Professional Tennis Players Association [PTPA] launched a lawsuit against the tennis tours earlier this year, demanding changes in several key areas.

Roddick expressed his concerns with the PTPA's case but has now shared the one point they made he is definitely on board with.

“I would say actually make it, if you're an independent contractor then you have free markets to play whatever events,” he said.

It's just the latest setback for the 23-year-old amid an up-and-down season. Stearns claimed her biggest win to date over No. 8 Zheng Qinwen in Dubai, having previously been 0-10 against Top 10 players. But in between a struggle with gastrointestinal illness and a disappointing North American hardcourt swing—she won just one match in Austin, Indian Wells and Miami—Stearns is still seeking her first quarterfinal of the season.Seeded No. 16 in Charleston, Stearns bowed out to Ajla Tomljanovic 6-4 6-1 in her opening match and reached the semifinals in doubles with Diana Shnaider before Hill announced the end of their partnership.Hill, a former Pepperdine University player who previously coached Maria Sakkari, concluded his effusive message wishing Stearns “nothing but the best” on Instagram.“Thank you, Peyton, for the hard work, trust, and all the memories,” Hill wrote. “You're not just an amazing player, but a truly wonderful person whom I'm lucky to call a friend.“Wishing you nothing but the best moving forward.

Will we be saying “Monte Carlitos"" after Alcaraz's effort in the principality this week?BySteve TignorPublished Apr 09, 2025 copy_link

Published Apr 09, 2025

“Monte…Carlitos?”That was the question scrawled on a sign that a fan held up during Carlos “Call me Carlitos” Alcaraz's opening-round match in Monte Carlo on Wednesday.The question mark was very much appropriate, because the idea seemed like a bit of a long shot at the start of the Spaniard's opening-round encounter with Francisco Cerundolo. Alcaraz, despite his mastery of clay in other locales, had never won a match in Monte Carlo, and had only played the tournament once.

Unfortunately for Cerundolo, that's exactly what happened. In this case, the entire match swung toward Alcaraz. From that point on, he was the one who controlled the court position, who dictated the patterns of the rallies, who broke serve at will, and who finished with a fully confident flurry of drop shots. He would lose just one more game in a 3-6, 6-0, 6-1 win in 98 minutes.“I didn't start well, I made a lot of mistakes, let him play inside the court and dominate the points,” Alcaraz said.“After the first set I had to do something else. I had to play more aggressively. I had to play my tennis.”The biggest difference, Alcaraz said, was his determination to move up and “return close to the line.” That set the tone for the way he played the rest of a point.

By the third set, Alcaraz was anticipating everything, and was in position for any Cerundolo ground stroke. Even if the ball came to him deep and with pace, Alcaraz took it on the rise and didn't back up. This was the Spaniard at his most efficient, controlling play without having to do anything spectacular or risky.“I missed clay,” he wrote on the ATP's camera lens afterward.With this first win in Monte Carlo under his belt, Alcaraz will move on to face Daniel Altmaier on Thursday. We may not be ready to rename the town Monte Carlitos quite yet, but for one round, all of his recent doubts were cleared away. He started ice cold, and finished en fuego.

THIS WEEK IN F1: 10 tough quiz questions on the Japanese Grand Prix

What tyres will the teams and drivers have for the 2025 Bahrain Grand Prix?

I was impressed with Yuki Tsunoda's first weekend with Red Bull, even if the headline results don't show a marked improvement for the team's second seat in Japan.

What was a promising debut weekend for the local driver came completely undone in Q2 as he missed his lap on new soft tyres, leaving him with his biggest comparable deficit of the weekend to Verstappen at half a second – enough to see him knocked out in 15th, with his team mate comfortably through.

READ MORE: ‘Mixed feelings' – Tsunoda looks back on ‘pretty frustrating' debut race for Red Bull

The tight field in 2025 can make small deficits seem big, particularly in the first two parts of qualifying, with tiny margins potentially costing or gaining multiple positions difference on the grid. And for Tsunoda, there were some circumstances that played their part in him failing to make the top 10.

Having never driven the car before FP1 in Japan, Yuki quickly got down to a sensible pace throughout practice, lapping around a tenth or two away from Verstappen on average throughout the sessions until Q2.

We know the Red Bull car isn't easy to drive, and yet Tsunoda seemed to settle into it very quickly on Friday, looking more comfortable than Liam Lawson and even Sergio Perez did for much of the end of last year.

The final results don't look great as Tsunoda started his new tyre Q2 lap with undercooked rear tyre temps and he scrabbled around with oversteer and a lack of traction at the start of the lap, costing him three-tenths in just a couple of corners.

Ultimately, a two-tenth improvement would have seen him through into Q3, but once you start a flying lap on the back foot like that it becomes easy to overdrive and difficult to regain the lap time.

Tsunoda looked great in practice, but stumbled in qualifying

This one issue on one lap effectively ruined his race weekend and the dream of getting some home points on debut with Red Bull, as overtaking proved incredibly difficult on Sunday.

An early pass on Liam Lawson and a strategic undercut of Pierre Gasly was all that could be done as he washed in outside of the points on Sunday, stuck frustratingly behind Fernando Alonso's Aston Martin for the remainder of the race.

On one hand it was a tough return for Tsunoda. He looked like he should have been a solid Q3 runner from most of his driving through the weekend (especially in practice) and Red Bull will be buoyed by this.

On the other, when you have performance it can be pretty important to get a score on the board, because you can never take results for granted, particularly in the tricky Red Bull second seat. The confidence gained from a points finish he could have had would have been huge – both for him and the team.

Tsunoda left disappointed after 'not the result I wanted' in home Grand Prix

The fact that Japan was also Yuki's home race may have added a little more pressure to the pot, but it looked like he generally handled himself well over the weekend, on what was actually a Grand Prix with little to lose for him.

Lawson had done poorly enough in his first two races that Tsunoda was bound to be an improvement, so anything back towards the sharp end was going to be major progress for Red Bull. Even a Q2 exit was an improvement on where Lawson was during his fleeting few qualifying sessions with the team.

Because he didn't know the car and the expectations were low, Yuki got a bit of a free pass, and the fact that he actually looked quick for a lot of practice was a bonus. Moving forward to Bahrain though, I think the pressure could actually rise for him, but it's a nice place to be heading to just a week after his first taste of the RB21.

The Bahrain circuit is one of the least punishing on the calendar. It's one that the drivers probably know the best now, thanks to the pre-season testing mileage there – and they all drove it just a few weeks ago. The car will still be fairly new to Yuki, but on a track he's thrived at in the past (he finished P9 here on debut back in 2021), this could be a chance to lean on it from the start and find the limits without the risk of crashing that you have at Suzuka.

Tsunoda's first race for Red Bull was in front of his home fans at Suzuka

Red Bull have said he will be in the car for the remainder of the year, and that seems a sensible approach for the team to instil some confidence in a driver who has been overlooked for a while, in a seat that has long been a problem for the team.

The reality is that the pressure is never off though in Formula 1. Yuki is no longer an inexperienced driver. He's cut his cloth well in the midfield, but if he's to stake a claim to be a driver worthy of having a place on the grid in the future, be it at Red Bull or elsewhere, then this is his golden opportunity, one he's been waiting for for years.

The first weekend showed promise, but now it's time for Yuki to start to show what he can do. He's historically always been strong in fast corners, of which there are plenty in Suzuka and none in Bahrain, but he's also always been good on the brakes as well and that could help him this weekend, if he can find a direction with the car that works, and a confidence to attack as if he's been in it for a while.

I certainly think Red Bull's decision to switch drivers was harsh, but justified by the Japanese Grand Prix weekend, and now is a chance for Yuki to start to prove them right with results.

The Oscar-winning actress joins Anthony Anderson, Ramón Rodríguez, Douglas Hodge, Marsai Martin and Antony Starr in Patricia Riggen's action film.


							By 

	Lovia Gyarkye


Arts & Culture Critic


	In G20, Viola Davis joins the pantheon of action heroes tasked with saving the world from a catastrophe. The Oscar-winning actress plays Danielle Sutton, a steely veteran, mother of two and president of the United States. When we meet the leader of the free world, she's tensely battling with her 17-year-old daughter Serena (Marsai Martin) after the angsty teenager snuck out to party at a Georgetown bar. 


	How Serena managed to outwit her Secret Service agents and end up on the late night news shows vexes Sutton, who's trying to maintain a flawless and relatively low-key reputation as the first Black woman president of the North American nation. In that way, G20, directed by Patricia Riggen and streaming April 10 on Prime Video, feels like a relic of a timeline in which Vice President Kamala Harris' future in the Oval Office seemed all but assured. The film weaves the social and political pressures faced by a Black woman ascending to the highest office into a bumpy story about how she's eventually thrust into an explosive global crisis.

The Bottom Line

	
	Slow to start, but Davis kicks it into gear.
	



Release date: April 10 (Prime Video)Cast: Viola Davis, Anthony Anderson, Marsai Martin, Ramón Rodríguez, Douglas Hodge,Elizabeth MarvelDirector: Patricia RiggenScreenwriters: Caitlin Parrish, Erica Weiss, Logan Miller, Noah Miller

								1 hour 48 minutes			






	Riggen, working from a screenplay by Caitlin Parrish, Erica Weiss, Logan Miller and Noah Miller, struggles to balance the tonal requirements of each thread, which results in a film that's slow to get going. But once the principal heroes and villains have been established and the perfunctory narrative throat-clearing is out of the way, G20 finds its groove as a solid popcorn action flick. 




			Related Video		







	In interviews about G20, Davis has said she did the movie because she wanted to star in something popular. While this film doesn't shy away from heavy themes, the whole operation hinges on the actress' confident portrayal of the kind of action hero usually played by white male movie stars. It's essentially her Air Force One. (To be fair, Davis isn't unfamiliar with this genre: She did lead an army of women warriors in precolonial West Africa in Gina Prince-Bythewood's The Woman King.) And while one does wish that Davis had a less schmaltzy and more coherent story to work with here, G20 manages to deliver where it matters. The stunts (coordinated by Grant Powell) are relatively inventive and appropriately balletic, and the film features a gallery of supporting characters worth rooting for.


	After a reporter questions Sutton's ability to protect the nation if she can't even manage her kid, the president decides to take the whole family — husband Derek (Anthony Anderson), daughter Serena and son Demetrius (Christopher Farrar) — with her to the G20 summit in Cape Town, South Africa. They are accompanied by the president's friend and longtime security detail Agent Manny Ruiz (Ramón Rodríguez) and U.S. Treasury Secretary Joanna Worth (Elizabeth Marvel). 

	











	This year's conference is a big deal for Sutton because she needs to recruit other nations to join her efforts to give micro-loans to farmers in Africa, a step she believes will play a significant role in ending world hunger. There are plenty of doubters, though, including British Prime Minister Oliver Everett (Douglas Hodge), and key players she needs to convince like Elena Romano (The White Lotus season two‘s Sabrina Impacciatore), the new head of the IMF. 


	The world's most powerful leaders arrive in Cape Town with relatively little fanfare, but that changes later when the heads of state are held hostage in the hotel's conference room by a rogue group, led by Rutledge (Antony Starr), a former U.S. army officer, determined to short the market. They are functionally crypto bros — with a bit of an anarchist spirit — who use artificial intelligence and deep fakes to convince workers around the world to back bitcoin currency. They want the people to rise up against ineffective leadership and recognize that they are being brainwashed into paying for endless wars. Rutledge makes some fair points, but too bad they're tainted by an insatiable greed. 


	During the early moments of mayhem — in which Rutledge and his global team of mercenaries breach the hotel's maximum security system and hack into its surveillance framework — Sutton and Manny manage to escape the conference room. They are followed by Oliver, Elena and Han Min-Seo (a scene-stealing Meewha Alana Lee), the first lady of South Korea. Elsewhere in the hotel, Serena, Demetrius and Derek dodge their armed captors and find a way to escape. 

	











G20 takes place almost exclusively in this hotel and its events happen over the course of a single night. The tight framing is helpful for a film that can wobble under the demands of its various plot points, some of which end up competing for attention. At first, Sutton's goal is to find a way out of the hotel, but it soon becomes clear that she is the one the mercenaries are after. Her position as U.S. president makes her critical to the plan to crash the global market, and in order to lure her back to the conference room Rutledge starts killing her colleagues. That plan adds tension to the relatively flimsy stakes of the film, turning a straightforward escape plot into a more gripping game of cat and mouse. Sutton must reverse course and now try to find a way to save her fellow leaders, her family and the world. 


	It's no small task, but Davis navigates it with believable conviction. She's having fun with the role, roundhouse kicking villains and toting a gun while wearing her evening gown. The actress embraces even the silliest parts of the story and that commitment makes it easier to forgive the garish visual effects and obvious telegraphing. G20 is really a film for fans of the actress and an audience ready to see some smooth-brained chaos.

Co-showrunners Eric Tuchman and Yahlin Chang speak to The Hollywood Reporter about everything that happens when June (Elisabeth Moss) and Serena (Yvonne Strahovski) get off that train.


							By 

	Jackie Strause


Managing Editor, East Coast


[This story contains spoilers from the three-episode season six premiere of The Handmaid's Tale, “Train,” “Exile” and “Devotion.”]


	The biggest question for The Handmaid's Tale viewers heading into the sixth and final season was what was going to happen to June and Serena after they got on that train.




	The three-episode premiere of the Emmy-winning dystopian Hulu saga quickly answered that question by setting its starring women on diverging paths once again for the final chapter in this Gilead story. Serena (Yvonne Strahovski) ends up jumping from the train, with her baby son in her arms, to escape a mob of Gilead refugee women looking for revenge against the former Gilead wife. She eventually makes her way back to Gilead via New Bethlehem, the reformed community founded by Commander Lawrence (Bradley Whitford) where she is needed to recruit refugees.

	June (Elisabeth Moss), who helped Serena escape, ends up making it to Alaska, where she reunites with her mother Holly (played by returning star Cherry Jones), giving the hero of this tale a much-needed win after the harrowing journey she took to get there in the events of season five. The mother-daughter reunion reminds the audience what June is fighting for, as she updates her mother that her oldest daughter, Hannah (Jordana Blake), remains in Gilead.


	June's Alaskan visit is short-lived, as she's quickly pulled back into the fight and joins the Mayday rebellion on a mission to save her husband Luke (O-T Fagbenle), who is out on bail after his finale arrest, and best friend Moira (Samira Wiley), who are trapped in No Man's Land, the disputed territory in the Gileadean-Canadian border region. She calls on Nick (Max Minghella), now a High Commander, for help and he obliges the mother of their daughter Nichole, who June is now calling by her birth name, Holly. 


	The third episode ends with a successful rescue mission, which brings about an awkward reunion with Luke and Nick, as Moira also meets Nick for the first time, and another poignant goodbye for June and her star-crossed lover. This time, June and Nick agree it's not goodbye. It's see you later.


	Below, longtime writers and season six co-showrunners Eric Tuchman and Yahlin Chang unpack all of those reunions in the first three episodes — also including Janine (Madeline Brewer), who is now a Jezebel, with Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd) — and explain how these early events of the season will set up what's to come as the 10-episode final chapter unspools the rest of June's tale: “This is a season where every character reveals who they really are.”

	











	***


When I spoke with creator Bruce Miller and star/executive producer/director Elisabeth Moss at the end of season five, they didn't know yet what would happen after June and Serena got on that train. When you got back into the room and started to break the story, how did you figure out that you were going to set them on these different paths? 


YAHLIN CHANG Bruce actually thought about it for a long time, what he wanted to happen on that train. I think the fun of that episode is that it starts out as a June and Serena working on their relationship story, and then it takes this dark, scary turn. The end of that episode I credit entirely to my co-showrunner Eric Tuchman, because he was the one who was really beating the drum of, “Wouldn't it be great if [June's mother] Holly were in Alaska? Holly needs to be in Alaska to receive June.” I just loved that, and it happened because of him.


ERIC TUCHMAN Everybody has good ideas in the writers room, but for that episode, because it became such a dark disturbing story, which is very much in line with a lot of what the Handmaid's Tale has been about, we wanted this [premiere] ending to feel uplifting and hopeful that there was still a light in this darkness. What better for June, after this harrowing experience on the train, then to reunite with her mother who she thought was dead? It's wish-fulfillment for a lot of people, including me. The fact that we got Cherry Jones [who played Holly in seasons two and three] back to play this role again and to act in those scenes with Lizzie [Moss] is one of my favorite things about the season.

	











Lizzie also directed the premiere, as well as episode two. With Lizzie herself becoming a mother before filming, and having her baby with her on set, how emotional was that mother-daughter reunion to film? We see three generations of women in June's family together, and a needed embrace for June after a harrowing journey.


TUCHMAN Well, I happened to be there for those Holly scenes with Cherry Jones, and Lizzie had her child with her for most of that shoot. It's just another facet of what makes her this extraordinary superwoman who is producing, acting, directing and being a full-time mother at the same time. She is juggling all these balls so beautifully and without ever really breaking a sweat. She has the most positive, upbeat attitude always, and that infuses the entire set with that enthusiasm and passion for the show.


CHANG Bradley Whitford jokes about how so many of our actresses had babies at the end of the show, which he's called dyslexic method acting. (Laughs)


On the flipside, one of the more disappointing moments for Serena came on that train. She had an opportunity to ask these Gilead refugee women for forgiveness, and instead, she doubles down on her Gilead intentions. Can you talk about that scene and what it tells us about Serena in the final season?


CHANG Serena's going to Serena. That's how I feel about her and how we craft her throughout the season. She has an ego. She always has to be in the right. She always has to feel like she's close to god or doing what god wants, and even when she asks for forgiveness from June or wants redemption, she really feels like she has this very special relationship with god and has a certain divine responsibility. So I think she really believes a lot of what she says on that train. She does believe that she saved the country and yes, it took a couple dark turns and didn't work out exactly as she wanted, but she really does think that America sucked in many ways and had to change. And so, god bless her. She doesn't lie about her true feelings. That's the one thing that she has going for her: she doesn't lie.

	











We see her returning to Gilead via New Bethlehem, the reformed societal vision from Commander Lawrence (Bradley Whitford). Serena, now wearing a new purple color, attracts the attention of Gilead Commander Wharton, played by Josh Charles, who is the father-in-law to Nick (Max Minghella), who is now a High Commander himself. How does this third episode set Serena up in New Bethlehem?


TUCHMAN She returns to New Bethlehem very determined to be an independent voice, a woman of real influence. She's not going to get sucked into the role that Gilead has had her play before, which is either as a wife or is just someone there for a photo op. She really wants to contribute and change Gilead into the Gilead she knows it can be. And then she comes across someone who is powerful and influential, who's courting her, who seems to embrace her desire for reform, and she gets sucked back in. He's not only a good romantic match, but he's a good figure with power and influence that can help her. She loves power.


CHANG Serena is ambitious and that's even in her decision to go back to New Bethlehem. On the one hand, she felt like god has called her to this purpose. But the first thing was that she was threatened. She had to get the hell out of Gilead, and make sure that the Wheelers didn't get her baby. [When Lawrence tells her that the Eyes know where she is], she then turns it over in her mind to, “God has called me back to set things right.”

	











We see Janine (Madeline Brewer) in episode three and she is now a Jezebel. She has this reunion scene with Aunt Lydia where she sends Lydia away. Aunt Lydia (who will star in the sequel series The Testaments) has been starting to see things differently since last season. How will seeing Janine at Jezebel's continue to turn the wheels for Aunt Lydia?


TUCHMAN Janine and Lydia have a really complicated, almost mother-daughter relationship. Lydia genuinely feels love and protectiveness toward her most precious girl, Janine. And when she sees Janine in this den of iniquity, we're again chipping away at Lydia's delusions about what Gilead really is. We're taking those rose-colored glasses off that she's been wearing for so long. To see Janine suffering in this place is yet another step in her journey to stop being so willfully blind about what the truth is behind Gilead. Stop hiding behind religion. It's really about power.


The third episode sees June leaving baby Holly (formerly Nichole) with her mother and going on the rescue mission to save Luke (O-T Fagbenle) and Moira (Samira Wiley). This leads to her reunion with Nick. Nick calls June out for choosing Luke, but June makes it clear she loves them both. I've spoken with O-T about June and Nick, and he thinks people are crazy for shipping them. Because their love came from trauma, is June blinded to the red flags she should see in Nick?


CHANG I think you're absolutely right that her relationship with Nick was forged in trauma. It kept her alive and it gave her a reason to survive those horrible, horrible years in Gilead, and they have this amazing bond. Also, Nick is always there for her and always doing whatever she needs at great risk to himself. So of course, she loves him. And Luke has been so reliable and has waited for her for so long, so she has a real love for him too, but it's a different kind of love. With Nick, I think it's more lusty and passionate, and with Luke, it's the love of a super strong attachment to a husband who has stood by her. But, as you said, there are certain things about Nick that she is blind to and that our viewers and we as writers are blind to because we're invested in this romance. And that is that he is a commander in Gilead. And that's the truth of it.

	











Bruce Miller has always said he knew the show's ending from the start. Did things evolve or change at all, or was there a North Star you were working towards this season?


TUCHMAN I think the ending is true to Bruce's vision that he's had for a long time. You know, it's called the Handmaid's Tale and it ties into the telling of this story. It didn't dictate the rest of the stories that we're telling across the season and we could still lead to that ending that Bruce has always wanted. So we did get to do a lot of juicy stories for June and for our entire ensemble.


CHANG Yeah, I think he knew what that last scene should be for a long time.


What are some of the biggest themes you are tackling this season?


TUCHMAN We really wanted this season to be, as Yahlin has called it, a season of triumph and uplift. It's been a lot of dark and disturbing stories in the past, but now it's the final season and it's a season about fighting back, about defiance and resilience and courage and guts and hopefulness. It's time. Our audience has stuck with us through the darkest times and it's time for them to be rewarded for that passion and commitment they have for the show, and we're going to deliver it for them this season.


When it comes to giving your sprawling ensemble all some closure, was that the biggest challenge that you had for this final season?


CHANG That was challenging for sure. One thing we really wanted to do this season was to give a fleshed-out story arc to every one of our characters and our amazing actors. There were past seasons when they maybe got less screen time or they didn't get to have a fully fleshed-out arc and we really felt like they deserved it, and wanted to do justice by those characters. They each deserved a really good fleshed-out arc, which I think they have this season. And yes, it's always a challenge because there are so many riches and they're all so great, and there's limited time on screen. But I think we get to see that they all become even more themselves and return to inner strengths that maybe we didn't know they had. So they evolve in beautiful ways, all of them.

	











TUCHMAN I think this is a season where every character reveals who they really are. The choices that they make, they're each at a crossroad reveal. Do they have the courage and the guts, or are they more selfish and self-serving? We'll see. Everybody exposes their true self.


The Handmaid's Tale has never stopped being prophetic, but there's a sense of dejà vu with the show again releasing under Trump 2.0. How does that feel to be here, eight years later, with this Gilead story again being so timely?


TUCHMAN Never would have expected it. Yahlin joined us in the second season. I was there from the beginning and in the first, we had an election in 2016. While we were in production. It was an election with a result that most of us on the show did not expect and the show became suddenly very timely and resonated with a lot of people. Many people have called the show a cautionary tale and it seems to me that not enough people were cautioned, and here we are again after a very consequential, shocking election. I never would have anticipated that that's where we would be. But here we are.


CHANG I was working on a show where we make stuff up, right? And I just cannot believe that as a woman, I have fewer rights now than when I started on the show in 2017. I never thought that Roe v. Wade would get overturned. It seems like the stuff you would make up, especially at that time with the #MeToo movement when it seemed like society was really moving forward.

	











	Working on this show, you really have to get into the minds of authoritarians to write the characters on the Gilead side. Getting into those minds is about imagining what the worst people would do if given the reins of power. You have to imagine if you have no moral compass, if you are completely guided by avarice and selfishness and cowardice and covering your own ass, how would you act and what would you do? In that way, what's happening now feels very understandable and predictable to a certain extent.

This year's selections span 102 years, from 1913 to 2015.


													By
												

	Paul Grein



	Recordings by Amy Winehouse, Celine Dion, Elton John, Mary J. Blige and Tracy Chapman are among this year's 25 additions to the National Recording Registry, which is administered by the Library of Congress. This year's selections span 102 years, from 1913 (a recording of “Aloha ‘Oe” by Hawaiian Quintette) to 2015 (the cast album to the Broadway sensation Hamilton: An American Musical).


	The list includes three songs that reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100: Helen Reddy's “I Am Woman” (1972), which gave the women's liberation movement a theme song; Freddy Fender's country/pop smash “Before the Next Teardrop Falls” (1975) and Dion's “My Heart Will Go On,” the Oscar- and Grammy-winning smash from Titanic (1997).

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	It also includes two albums that reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 – John's hit-laden double album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (1973) and Chapman's eponymous debut album (1988). John and his longtime songwriting partner Bernie Taupin were the 2024 recipients of the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song, which is also administered by the Library of Congress.


Tracy Chapman, which spawned the hit “Fast Car” (which was revived by Luke Combs in 2024), was one of three debut albums to be saluted this year. The others are Don Rickles' comedy album Hello Dummy! (1968) and Chicago's hit-filled double album Chicago Transit Authority (1969).


	Winehouse's Back to Black, the singer's second (and, sadly, last) album, was inducted. The 2006 album spawned the smash “Rehab,” which won Grammys for both record and song of the year.


	Two double-disk jazz albums – Miles Davis' Bitches Brew (1970) and Keith Jarrett's The Kӧln Concert (1975) – were honored. On the jazz fusion classic Bitches Brew, Davis and such musicians as Wayne Shorter and Chick Corea blended jazz with rock elements. It's Davis' second album in the Registry, following his 1959 classic Kind of Blue. Davis is the only artist this year to receive a second career induction.


Charley Pride, the first Black superstar in country music, was inducted for his 1971 classic “Kiss an Angel Good Mornin',” which topped Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart for five weeks. Fender's aforementioned “Before the Next Teardrop Falls” topped that chart for two weeks.

	











	Blige's 1994 sophomore album My Life, which topped Billboard's Top R&B Albums chart for eight weeks, was inducted. The album was highly personal, with songs addressing clinical depression, struggles with drugs and alcohol and being in an abusive relationship.


The Steve Miller Band were honored for their 1976 album Fly Like an Eagle, which spawned three top 20 hits on the Hot 100, including the No. 1 smash “Rock'n Me.”


Roy Rogers and Dale Evans were honored for their 1952 single “Happy Trails,” which Evans wrote. Rogers is the only artist to have been inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame twice – first in 1980 as a member of the Sons of the Pioneers and again in 1988 as a solo artist.


Hamilton (2015) is the first Broadway cast album that was released since Sweeney Todd in 1979 to be selected. Here's a full list of all 15 Broadway cast albums in the Registry.


Vicente Fernández's enduring ranchera classic “El Rey” (1973) joined the roster of Latin recordings in the Registry. See the full list here.


	With the aforementioned Rickles album being inducted this year, this is the second year in a row that a comedy album has made the grade. Lily Tomlin's This Is a Recording was honored last year. Here's a complete list of the 14 comedy albums in the Registry.


	Two left-field selections are Microsoft's Windows reboot chime (1995), composed by Brian Eno, and David Rosenfeld's Minecraft: Volume Alpha (2011). Microsoft wanted a brief start-up sound that would play when Windows 95 booted up. They approached Eno, who came up with a sound that Microsoft designers felt conveyed the sense of “welcome, hopefulness and progress” that they desired. Minecraft is the second video game soundtrack to join the Registry, following Koji Kondo's theme from Super Mario Bros., selected in 2023.

	











	Thelma Houston & Pressure Cooker's 1975 album I've Got the Music in Me is one of this year's most surprising choices. The album was likely honored because of the unique way it was recorded: live to master disc. Pressure Cooker consisted of top session players of the era, including Michael Omartian, Larry Carlton, Tom Scott and Larry Knechtel. The title track had been a big hit in the fall of 1974 for The Kiki Dee Band. Houston went on to top the Hot 100 in 1977 with “Don't Leave Me This Way.”


	The radio broadcast of the deciding Game 7 of the 1960 World Series, in which the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the New York Yankees, was inducted. Another sports-related entry is Brother Bones & His Shadows' 1948 recording of the 1925 standard “Sweet Georgia Brown.” The Brother Bones recording was surprise hit in 1949. Three years later, the Harlem Globetrotters basketball team made it their theme song.


	Chanticleer's Our American Journey (2002) saw the acclaimed a cappella choral group taking its listeners on an eclectic musical trip across America, through its history and a variety of musical genres.


	This year's other entries, not already mentioned, are Harry Urata Field Recordings (1960-1980) and Nimrod Workman Collection (1973-1994). Musician and educator Harry Urata, confined to an internment camp after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, encountered Japanese-American workers who had processed sugar cane leaves on Hawaiian plantations since the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Like many immigrant workers, they adapted and sang old folk songs to reflect their daily circumstances. Recognizing the cultural and historical significance of the songs, Urata traveled throughout Hawaii's islands recording elderly singers who had toiled on sugar plantations. His collection features 20 open-reel tapes recorded from the 1960s to the 1980s.

	











	Born in Inez, Kentucky, in 1895, Nimrod Workman was a folk singer, coal miner and union activist. He began his work in the West Virginian mines at age 14, and he would continue for the next 42 years. After retiring from the mines, he began recording unaccompanied traditional ballads, songs of his own composition and oral history. In 1986, Workman was a recipient of a 1986 National Heritage Fellowship, the U.S. government's highest honor in the folk arts. Workman died in 1994.


	More than 2,600 nominations were made by the public this year. Chicago Transit Authority finished first in the public nominations. Other selected recordings that ranked in the top 10 of public nominations include “Happy Trails,” Goodbye Yellow Brick Road and My Life.


	Under the terms of the National Recording Preservation Act of 2000, the Librarian ofCongress, with advice from the National Recording Preservation Board, selects 25 titleseach year that are “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.” Recordings become eligible for the Registry 10 years after release, compared to 25 years for the Grammy Hall of Fame. (Which means the Hamilton cast album won't be eligible there for another 15 years.)


	“These are the sounds of America – our wide-ranging history and culture,” Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden said in a statement. “The Library of Congress is proud and honored to select these audio treasures worthy of preservation.”


	Industry veteran Robbin Ahrold serves as chair of the National Recording Preservation Board. “This year's National Recording Registry list is an honor roll of superb American popular music from the wide-ranging repertoire of our great nation,” he said in a statement.

	











	These 25 recordings bring the number of titles on the Registry to 675. This represents just a tiny fraction of the Library's vast recorded sound collection of nearly four million items.


	NPR's “1A” will feature selections from this year's induction class in its series “The Sounds of America,” including interviews with Hayden and several featured artists.


	Here's the complete list of 2025 additions to the National Recording Registry. They are listed in chronological order by release date.

The effects of Trump's policies still remain to be seen on a larger scale, but there is genuine concern.

Senior Editor, Latin


At last month's Billboard Women in Music ceremony in Los Angeles, Breakthrough honoree Ángela Aguilar took a moment to express her solidarity with the Latin immigrant community, dedicating her award to women who cross the border to the United States “with nothing but hope in their hearts, only to find themselves living in uncertainty and fear,” she said in a poignant speech that prompted a standing ovation. “You deserve safety, dignity, the right to dream.”  


	Aguilar is part of a growing group of Latin artists — including Shakira, Maná and Alejandro Fernández — who are using their platforms to speak up for immigrants after President Donald Trump took office in January and immediately launched an aggressive crackdown on immigration, pledging to carry out mass deportations.

	But it was perhaps regional Mexican artist Tony Aguirre who addressed the situation more bluntly. “I'm scared that no one will show up to my shows,” he said during an interview with a Mexican podcaster when asked how things were going with Trump as president. Aguirre tells Billboard he is genuinely worried.  


	“Regional Mexican events have been directly impacted, and it's not just me going through this, many of my colleagues feel this way,” says Aguirre, who tours mainly in the U.S. “When it all started, we were reaching out to each other just to see how things were going and everyone was saying the same thing, low attendance. People are scared to go out because of mass deportation threats, and I wanted to speak up because it seems like no one in our industry is willing to really to talk publicly about how this has impacted our industry, and it's important that we do.”  


	While the effects of Trump's policies on Latin music still remain to be seen on a larger scale, there is a real concern about the impact.  


Abel DeLuna, California-based member of the veteran Mexican music association Promotores Unidos and founder of Luna Management, is once again dealing with a situation that's historically effected regional Mexican bailes, which are small but mighty shows (and for many years the backbone of the genre) predominantly held in nightclubs catering to a specific demographic and booked by indie promoters. In 2007, Billboard's Leila Cobo interviewed DeLuna about “stepped up” immigration enforcement under the George W. Bush administration, where he said then that the immigration situation alone accounted for 20% to 25% of the drop in his concert promotion business. He relived the same scenario 18 years later when Trump took office for a second term earlier this year, with that fourth week of January and first week of February being particularly brutal. DeLuna says shows in those weeks sold only around 10% to 15% of tickets, which ultimately led him to cancel some shows in Northern California. 


	“Our people are worried,” says DeLuna, speaking over the phone just weeks after Trump took office. “Many are afraid to go out, afraid to go out to work, afraid to go to the bailes, concerts, several having to get canceled because people are not buying tickets. I don't know how long this is going to last, if it is really going to calm down soon or if it is going to go on for a long time and if it does, then our people are going to suffer a lot and the whole business is going to suffer.” 


	Low concert attendance aligns with a decrease in foot traffic in predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods around the country since Trump took office, says Maria Teresa Kumar, president of Voto Latino, a non-profit organization that aims to encourage young Hispanic and Latino voters to register to vote.  


	“People are scared that they're going to be targeted and rounded up, creating a chilling effect happening around a community that is getting internalized mentally but also physically in their decisions to not go shopping or go to concerts,” says Kumar, who in the past has teamed up with artists like Maná and Los Tigres del Norte to get Latinos more politically involved.  


	The Latin music industry thrives on a diverse fan base, and while it's reaching a global audience now more than ever, its core listeners are still Latinos, and a significant portion of them are immigrants. Just as with previous administrations, when there are increased reports of immigration raids in U.S. cities, businesses inevitably suffer. That includes everything from flower shops and restaurants in Chicago seeing a notable decline in sales to schools and churches feeling the “chilling effect,” as The New York Times put it in a report about “immigrants in hiding” over fear of deportation. 


	DeLuna says the sobering topic came up at the annual conference for Promotores Unidos, a long-standing Latin concert promotion association with more than 300 members, in Las Vegas in January.


	“[Immigration] is the most important conversation right now,” DeLuna says categorically. “With those I have talked to among the association, I recommend the same thing: We must take care of ourselves, but we have to work harder and try to do better promotion to get people to come to our events, even if that means keeping prices low. What I'm personally doing is lowering prices to see if people feel encouraged to come out.”


Enrique Ortiz of Luz Record, a management, promotion and booking agency based out of L.A., also attended the Promotores Unidos conference in Las Vegas and says that while misinformation on social media about alleged raids in certain cities has also affected concert attendance, he's been following the situation closely. “We've been noticing that ICE is arresting those with a criminal record, yes, but also those who don't [have one]. And that's concerning. It has a direct impact on all of us as managers, promoters, musicians.”  


Billboard's reporting confirms that this is an ongoing topic of conversation in important Latin music spaces and is top of people's minds — although many in the industry prefer not to speak on the record about it. Over the course of two months, Billboard reached out to more than a dozen industry leaders, from managers to agents to promoters, for this story, with the majority declining to give an interview about just how much the Trump administration could impact the business of Latin music. Some who agreed to speak on background on the condition of anonymity expressed the same sentiment: uncertainty. One source, a manager to a well-known regional Mexican act, said they had already seen the impact on live shows in certain markets, particularly concerts that mainly book more traditional (i.e. older) regional Mexican acts.


Josh Norek, president of Regalias Digitales, refuses to stay silent and blasted a wide email to his contacts in March with the subject line: “Latin music industry — the time to speak is now.”  


	“From venues and record labels to artists and crews, deportations create instability that threatens the economic power of Latin music,” Norek's email reads, with messaging crafted by Voto Latino for artists and executives to share. “If our audiences and communities are at risk, our industry suffers.” 


	Norek is particularly focused on the impact Trump's administration will have on royalties should his promise of mass deportations come to fruition. “I project in the next four years we'll see a significant decrease in earnings,” he tells Billboard. “I care tremendously on a humanitarian standpoint, but when you think about the economic impact, it's very simple math: A stream coming from Mexico is worth about 2% of a stream coming from the U.S. So, if you deport 5 million streamers and put them in places like Mexico, Guatemala or Venezuela, you go from paying $10 a month for Spotify to [the] free ad-supported tier in Mexico, and it will generate almost nothing. Meanwhile, Pandora exists only in the U.S. and if you take away those users, it will impact SoundExchange royalties. You shouldn't have to be a Democrat, Republican or independent to be thinking about the economic impact of deportations.”  


	Adding to the precariousness of it all, Trump's global tariffs, announced on April 2, could also affect the U.S. music industry, from musical instrument manufacturers to the vinyl business. They could also lead to a potential decrease in local tourism, directly impacting concert and festival attendance in the U.S.  


	“During these times [of uncertainty], people are double-thinking how to spend their expendable income and, sadly, concerts are one of those pieces that are disposable income,” adds Kumar. “It's been only two months and we're already seeing the implications in the music industry, in hospitality, retail industry — this is not tenable.” 


	Norek reached out to Voto Latino to help craft messages for industry leaders and artists to share, although the shareable posts have yet to garner wider traction. “I understand that it's tough for some people to speak out because they don't want to be demonized,” says Norek. “However, now there's just outward hostility toward Latinos and immigrants. The least we can do is show our clients that we care. This is our audience.”

""My idea was because the album is so broad, I didn't want to just be like, 'Here's the single. Here's the album,'"" Sheeran told Call Her Daddy host Alex Cooper.

	As Ed Sheeran readies the release of his forthcoming eighth album, he's revealed that fans won't be left waiting too long between singles for fresh material given the record's “broad” range of sounds.

	Sheeran's comments were made during his appearance on the latest episode of Call Her Daddy, where he spoke with host Alex Cooper about his lyrics, his favorite memory of Taylor Swift, and the embarrassing story of being caught naked in a hotel lobby.

	The conversation also switched to the discussion of Sheeran's new music, which includes the recently-released single “Azizam,” which will feature on his forthcoming album Play. While a release date for the record is yet to arrive, Sheeran used his appearance on Call Her Daddy to talk about the music that is still to come in the near future.

	“My idea was because the album is so broad, I didn't want to just be like, ‘Here's the single. Here's the album,' so there's music coming every sort of two, three weeks,” he explains. “So there's ‘Azizam' now, there's a song called ‘Old Phone' that comes out in a couple of weeks, and then after that there's another song coming. 


	“We shot all these videos and I'm less about single moments and more about, I want people to sort of feel the breadth of the record and I'm very confident that one of the songs will work, but it's more about just putting 'em out and letting people hear some of the record before it's out rather than what I've done before, which is just like, ‘Here's my first single. Here's the album,' and yeah.”


	While Sheeran has already given fans a preview of “Old Phone” by playing it live on The Tonight Show, Cooper also queried the English musician as to how his new music differs compared to what he had released on previous albums.


	“It's definitely different. I think I've been more explorative with this album,” Sheeran explained. “I kind of had an attitude of ‘Why the f–k not?' and not really felt like I have to be in a box of being a singer-songwriter, of like, ‘I have to do this or I have to do that,' and I lived in India for a little bit and worked with a load of Indian musicians and producers and blah, blah, blah. 


	“I made a song like ‘Azizam' with Ilya who's Persian and that's in that world and ‘Old Phone' I think is more in a Nashville country world and there's just lots of different moments on the record, and the record is called Play and therefore it has to be playful. It has to be celebratory.”

	











	Sheeran's forthcoming eighth LP follows on from the release of his two 2023 albums, − and Autumn Variations, which peaked at No. 2 and No. 4 on the Billboard 200, respectively. They were his first records not to peak atop the chart since the release of his 2011 debut, +, and were followed in November 2024 with the standalone single “Under the Tree,” as featured in the Netflix film That Christmas.


	As Sheeran explained during his chat with Cooper, the general vibe of Play is set to be far different to what what had arrived on his most recent albums.


	“I released two albums that kind of, well, one was the sort of main album and one sort of came off the back of it, but they were both very depressing about quite hard hitting subjects, very muted,” he added. 


	“I still think they're beautiful records, but I feel like coming out of that, of you know, going through grief and all that sort of stuff coming out, I needed to have something that felt bright and colorful and playful and that's where doing St. Patrick's Day, playing at Tootsie's in Nashville, doing the New Orleans thing, the whole record just has to feel like fun and exciting.”

HBO has picked up The Last of Us for a third season.


	The announcement comes ahead of the anticipated Season 2 debut on April 13. Deadline understands that a decision has not been made yet whether Season 3 will be the series' last.


	Creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin previously told Deadline that they were contemplating up to four total seasons to tell the story laid out across two video games. Season 2 is seven episodes, and the duo sought early on to quell any worry from fans that they would try to wrap up the behemoth that is The Last of Us Part II in such little time.


	“It can't be overemphasized how proud HBO is for the outstanding achievement we believe the second season of The Last of Us is,” Francesca Orsi, Executive Vice President, HBO Programming, Head of HBO Drama Series and Films, said in a statement. “Craig, Neil, Carolyn and the entire executive producer team, cast and crew have delivered a masterful follow-up and we're thrilled to carry the power of Craig and Neil's storytelling into what we know will be an equally moving and extraordinary third season.”

	The early renewal is a show of faith for the acclaimed series, though not entirely unexpected, given that the first season performed so well for the network. By the time the Season 1 finale aired, HBO said the season's average audience had surpassed 30M viewers, with the premiere well on its way to 40M. That's after the premiere episode brought in a same-day audience of 4.7M, which at the time was the largest debut after House of the Dragon since Boardwalk Empire launched in 2010. HBO also recently renewed hit The White Lotus for Season 4 ahead of its Season 3 premiere.

	“To see The Last of Us brought to life so beautifully and faithfully has been a career highlight for me, and I am grateful for the fans' enthusiastic and overwhelming support,” Druckmann said in a statement Wednesday. “Much of that success is thanks to my partner in crime, Craig Mazin, our partnership with HBO, and our team at PlayStation Productions. On behalf of everyone at Naughty Dog, our cast, and crew, thank you so much for allowing us this opportunity. We're thrilled to bring you more of The Last of Us!”

	











	Mazin added: “We approached season two with the goal of creating something we could be proud of. The end results have exceeded even our most ambitious goals, thanks to our continued collaboration with HBO and the impeccable work of our unparalleled cast and crew. We look forward to continuing the story of The Last of Us with Season 3.”


RELATED: ‘The Last Of Us' Season 2 New Cast: Who Is Joining The Next Installment?


	Based on Naughty Dog's award-winning video game, The Last of Us takes place 20 years after modern civilization has been destroyed. Joel, played by Pedro Pascal, a hardened survivor, is hired to smuggle Ellie (Bella Ramsey), a 14-year-old girl, out of an oppressive quarantine zone. What starts as a small job soon becomes a brutal and heartbreaking journey as they both must traverse the U.S. and depend on each other for survival.


	Season 2 picks up five years after the events of the first season, Joel and Ellie are drawn into conflict with each other and a world even more dangerous and unpredictable than the one they left behind.


	In addition to Pascal and Ramsey, returning cast includes Gabriel Luna and Rutina Wesley. Joining Season 2 are Kaitlyn Dever, Isabela Merced, Young Mazino, Ariela Barer, Tati Gabrielle, Spencer Lord, Danny Ramirez and Jeffrey Wright. Catherine O'Hara also guest stars.


The Last of Us is written and executive produced by Mazin and Druckmann. The series is a co-production with Sony Pictures Television and is also executive produced by Carolyn Strauss, Jacqueline Lesko, Cecil O'Connor, Asad Qizilbash, Carter Swan, and Evan Wells; with writer/co-executive producer Halley Gross. PlayStation Productions, Word Games, Mighty Mint, and Naughty Dog produce.

					By Jake Kanter 

International Investigations Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Brad Pitt‘s production company Plan B Entertainment is in early talks to make what could become a second season of Adolescence after the series' success on Netflix.


	In their first interview since Adolescence went off like a firework last month, Plan B co-presidents Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner told Deadline that they are speaking to director Philip Barantini about the “next iteration” of the show, which starred and was co-created by Stephen Graham.


	Gardner said they are thinking about how they can “widen the aperture, stay true to its DNA [and] not be repetitive,” but she did not wish to reveal too much about their plans. Kleiner added that they hope Graham and Jack Thorne, the British writer behind Adolescence, can reteam on the project. Warp Films and Matriarch Productions were the co-producers.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The conversations are likely to be welcomed by Netflix and the millions who have watched the series, which tells the story of a 13-year-old boy (played by breakout Owen Cooper) accused of stabbing a female classmate to death after being drawn into the online manosphere. Adolescence now sits in fourth place in Netflix's Most Popular English-Language TV list after amassing 114.5M views since its March 13 release.


	Gardner and Kleiner said they were grateful for the success, arguing that it showed that a “seemingly small, localized, emotional story” can resonate around the world. Gardner said male violence has been a societal issue for many years, and they were “humbled” to have found a key to unlock the story in the minds of millions. She added that Barantini's one-take method was an essential ingredient.

	“Phil's style of doing the episodes in one take is not a gimmick. It's very much in conversation with the subject matter,” Gardner said. “In early conversations with Stephen and Jack, they were talking about how it's too easy to look away. You can look away from the school, you can look away from the police station, you can look away from the counseling, you can look away from the family. In that kind of prismatic way of viewing, you can duck the issue. So our theory was, what would happen if you couldn't look away? And will that make the subject embed in you in a different way? That was a thrilling thing.”

	











	Plan B got the ball rolling on Adolescence after watching Boiling Point, Barantini's one-take feature about a chef, played by Graham, in the throes of a personal and professional meltdown. Kleiner said he knew quickly that Plan B wanted to experiment with the form in a TV series. Pitt also brought into the idea and was only too happy to reunite with his friend Graham after they worked together on Guy Ritchie's 2000 feature Snatch. “Brad is a massive fan of Stephen's,” Kleiner said.

As Thorne revealed in a Deadline interview last month, Plan B first pitched the series to Amazon Prime Video under a development deal with the streamer. Kleiner was diplomatic about the reasons why Amazon passed on a series that has blown up on one of its biggest rivals: “I want to be grateful to them for their good faith in helping us get underway.”


	Pitt was an enthusiastic advocate, sitting in on pitch meetings with Amazon and providing input on Thorne's pilot script, which Kleiner said the Fight Club star was “blown away” by. “He was part of the energy, drive, and impetus to get the thing off the ground,” Kleiner added.


	Netflix was the first stop after Amazon's rejection. Plan B was keen to work with Netflix UK chief Anne Mensah after they collaborated at Comcast-owned Sky on Jude Law-Naomie Harris series Third Day. Mensah is on something of a hot streak at Netflix, having delivered other hits including Baby Reindeer, The Gentlemen and Fool Me Once.

	Kleiner said Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos took an interest in Adolescence. He told Plan B in November that he had watched the series and was “personally moved by the show.” The Netflix chief also wrote an Instagram herogram when Adolescence premiered — a courtesy he does not extend to every new title.


	Gardner said she sensed the show was a hit when her daughter showed her the TikTok trend of moms reacting to Adolescence. The series has stirred political conversation in the UK, where Prime Minister Keir Starmer said it “hit home hard” in his own household. Gardner said it was refreshing to hear a politician talking about watching TV.

	So where does the show fit in Plan B's canon of content? The company is no stranger to confronting societal issues, be it the #MeToo movement with She Said or institutional racism in Nickel Boys, but Gardner and Kleiner said this is not always the intention. 


	Gardner said “complicity” is one theme she would highlight in Plan B's output. Kleiner said the company embraces a “level of ambition” that presented itself through the one-take method on Adolescence. “Look at the incredible power of UK television. There's a way things are made [there] that you know, we want to do more of, for sure. Not just in the UK but across Europe,” he added.

					By Mike Fleming Jr 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, Film


EXCLUSIVE: Briarcliff Entertainment has acquired U.S. distribution rights to The Thing With Feathers. A wide theatrical release is planned for October 31 for the debut narrative film by Dylan Southern. Pic was one of the high-profile world premieres at the Sundance Film Festival in January, with Benedict Cumberbatch starring alongside Richard Boxall and Henry Boxall. The film subsequently had its international premiere at Berlin.  


	While the acquisition marketplace was sluggish during the week or so that Sundance unfolded in Park City, deals for the most promising films with stars have been trickling in steadily. That might well be the new normal for Toronto, Sundance and Cannes. The Thing With Feathers becomes the latest example that validates Sundance as still a good launchpad for indie fare, though sellers and buyers have to be patient, and the numbers fall as time goes on.  

	











	An adaptation of the Max Porter novella Grief Is the Thing With Feathers, the drama revolves around a widower (Cumberbatch) who is left to raise two young sons after the unexpected death of his wife. The man's life is unraveling because of the grief that takes the form of an unhinged and unwanted houseguest – a crow – that taunts him from the shadows.


	“Dylan Southern has crafted something truly unique — an emotional gut punch wrapped in a dark, fantastical nightmare,” said Tom Ortenberg, CEO of Briarcliff Entertainment. “With its bold visual storytelling and powerhouse performances, The Thing With Feathers is an unforgettable exploration of grief, madness, and transformation. We're thrilled to bring this vision to audiences.”


DEADLINE RELATED VIDEO:


	The film is produced by Andrea Cornwell of Lobo Films (Love Lies Bleeding), and Leah Clarke and Adam Ackland of SunnyMarch Productions (We Live in Time, The Mauritanian), with backing from Film4 and the BFI (awarding National Lottery funding), in association with Align, Uncommon Creative Studio, mk2 Films, and Rank and File, co-produced with Film I Vast and Filmgate Films.


	In adapting the critically acclaimed book, Southern sought to preserve its poetic, fragmented, tonally adventurous storytelling, translating it to the screen through a heightened visual style that blends naturalism with the fantastic. In doing so he has created a film that playfully pushes the envelope – combining elements of psychological horror with heartrending emotional drama. The result is a hauntingly immersive and singular experience. 

	











	UTA Independent Film Group negotiated the deal with mk2 Films who also handled international sales on behalf of the filmmakers.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Kim Richards Update: Kyle & Kathy Confirm Sister Has Moved Out of L.A.","https://entertainmentnow.com/real-housewives/kim-richards-move-florida-update/","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 17:14:23 GMT","

Kyle Richards and Kathy Hilton gave an update on their sister Kim Richards. During the second part of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” reunion, the celebrity siblings addressed reports of Kim's struggles over the past year. When host Andy Cohen noted that he heard that Kim “wasn't doing well”  and was living in Florida, Hilton confirmed that her sister did make a move to the East Coast.

“She's spending time there [in Florida],” Hilton said. “You know, I think she's doing better.”

Kyle Richards chimed in to add, “Better than the last time there was stuff about her in the press, yeah.”

The reunion episode aired on April 8, hours after Kyle told fans on an Amazon Livestream that Kim was doing well.

In September 2024, TMZ reported that  Kim Richards' family had cut ties with her following an alleged relapse with alcohol.

The RHOBH reunion was taped on February 28.

It is unclear how long Kim Richards has been living outside of Los Angeles.

In January 2025, the 60-year-old former RHOBH star appeared at the fan convention, The Hollywood Show, at the Los Angeles Marriott Burbank Hotel, but reportedly flew in from out of state for the event.

While greeting fans at the convention, Richards spoke to podcast host David Yontef. The popular podcaster talked about his exchange with the former child star on his “Behind the Velvet Rope” podcast on January 24, where he noted that Kim told him she “flew in for this convention from Florida.”

Yontef noted that Kim Richards told him that she was staying with a friend in Florida but still had a house in Encino. She also told the “Behind the Velvet Rope” host that she hadn't spoken to her sisters in in a “long time.”

In an October 2024  interview with Access Hollywood, Kyle Richards said the whole family has been there for Kim. “I'm supporting her like, you know, I would any other time that my sister's gone through a difficult time,” she said. “You know my family very much sticks together in these times, even though it's obviously difficult and challenging.”

But while filming the RHOBH season 14 episode “Sutton on Trial at Sea,” Kyle hinted that her relationship with her sister was strained. During a cast trip to Saint Lucia, Kyle told co-star Dorit Kemsley that Kim was doing well after Kemsley noted that it had been a while since she'd seen all three of the sisters together.

“I know, it is nice when we're all together,” Kyle said, before admitting she hadn't seen Kim in a while. “We're just not that close, I don't see her that much, unfortunately,” the RHOBH star said.

Brittany Cartwright revealed that her son, Cruz Cauchi, has been diagnosed with autism. “The Valley” star shared her son's diagnosis in an April 9 interview with People magazine just three days before his fourth birthday.

Cartwright told the outlet that she learned of Cruz's diagnosis six months ago and wasn't surprised by the confirmation because he has been mostly non-verbal since age two. “He was talking, he was saying, ‘Mommy,' ‘Daddy.' … Then, as he got closer to 2, we started noticing that he was regressing in his speech. He stopped talking almost completely,” she said. “It can be difficult because I've never heard him say, ‘I love you.'”

In addition to going to speech and occupational therapy, Cruz is accompanied by a therapeutic aide when he attends preschool, Cartwright shared.

Cruz is the only child of Cartwright and her estranged ex-husband, Jax Taylor.

A post shared by Brittany Cartwright 💛 (@brittany)

Cartwright has been open with fans about her son not hitting verbal milestones. In a November 2023 episode of her “When Reality Hits” podcast, Cartwright admitted that she was having a difficult time with her son's delays.

“Dealing with the speech therapy has been the toughest because I really want him to be able to talk to me and tell me what he wants and his feelings,” she said at the time. “We are just not there yet, and I can't wait until the day he looks at me and says, ‘I love you.' Oh, my God, I'm going to cry.”

In the first season of “The Valley,” viewers saw Cruz working with his speech therapist Miss Dory. “I just want to make sure that we're giving him all the right tools and everything that he needs,” Cartwright said in one episode, per BravoTV.com.

After sharing Cruz's official diagnosis, Cartwright received supportive messages from fans and friends in the comment section of a video of her interview.

“I'm so proud of you ♥️,” wrote her “Valley” co-star Michelle Sanei.

“Love you and Cruz so much, so proud of you for sharing ❤️,” added Janet Caperna.

“I'm so proud of you for sharing this and being a voice for these special children 💙 Cruz is the absolute sweetest and he's the luckiest to have the greatest mama,” wrote Cartwright's publicist, Lori Krebs.

In the People interview, Cartwright expressed hope for a bright future for her son and noted, “There aren't any limitations to what he can do.”

She also said she draws inspiration for her son's future from the stories seen on the show “Love on the Spectrum.” The Netflix reality show follows people who are on the autism spectrum and are looking for love. “It is the sweetest show,” Cartwright said. “They're so positive, the way they look at life is just so full of joy and happiness, and if Cruz is anything like that, I will be so happy. I hope he falls in love one day.”

The third season of “Love on the Spectrum” dropped on April 2.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Cristiano Ronaldo takes Major Steps to Protect Family","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/cristiano-ronaldo-security-threats/","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 01:50:32 GMT","

Soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo has taken major steps to protect his family.

According to Goal.com, Ronaldo hired a “new security team” along with an “intimidating bodyguard” following threats toward his family.

The site reported that the threats were directed at both Ronaldo and his partner Georgina Rodriguez as he traveled to Saudi Arabia.

According to Goal.com, the “alarming” threats were made on social media and, as a result, Ronaldo switched up his security team.

The couple has also reacted to shield their kids, with Georgina Rodriguez leaving them off social media, according to NST.

They moved to a “more secure” compound in Riyadh, beefed up their security team with four additional bodyguards and two more security guards, built a bunker at their home, and venture out in public less, NST reported. 

According to Marca, the new security team has caused controversy with one shining a flashlight at photographers while accompanying Rodriguez to Paris Fashion Week. DailyMail.com reported that the imagery and action with the flashlight caused controversy among some of Ronaldo's Spanish-speaking fans, who took to social media to vent their concerns.

In fact, the couple moved to Saudi Arabia for security reasons, Marca reported, noting that the country is “one of the safest countries on the planet.”

According to Marca, Ronaldo's “dismissal of the previous security officials and the hiring of this new bodyguard has not been welcomed by much of Cristiano Ronaldo's close circle.” That's because they are regarded as a more “intimidating” presence that conflicts with the previous style of Ronaldo and his partner, according to Marca.

DailyMail.com reported  that the threats were serious enough that they “required police intervention.” However, the specific nature of the threats and who might have made them were not details that were released. It's also not clear whether anyone was identified or arrested in conjunction with the threats.

Ronaldo, Rodriguez, and their five kids live together in Riyadh.

According to Marca, Ronaldo's “new head of security is Cláudio Miguel Vaz, a well-known security expert.”

Vaz has “paramilitary training” and worked for “several renowned urban artists in conflicting areas of Portugal, such as the controversial rapper NGA,” Marca reported.

In addition, he has “worked with several Portuguese internationals such as Rafa Leao or Gelson Martins,” Marca reported.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Is Erika Jayne Leaving The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills?","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/erika-jayne-leaving-rhobh-rumors/","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 11:30:57 GMT","

Erika Jayne is once again at the center of swirling rumors—and this time, it's not just about courtrooms or couture. A recent event ad overseas described the longtime “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star as a “former Real Housewife,” sending Bravo fans into a full-blown frenzy over whether her diamond days are officially over. 

While Bravo hasn't confirmed anything, the timing couldn't be worse: Jayne is currently juggling mounting legal troubles, a looming $24 million lawsuit tied to her ex-husband Tom Girardi's financial scandal, and deep personal stress, including the serious health battle of close friend Teddi Mellencamp. 

Her attorney, Jim Wilkes, insists she's holding strong, despite it all. But with season rumors heating up and trials on the horizon, fans are left wondering—could Jayne's time on “RHOBH” really be coming to an end?

A post shared by Bravo Snark Side (@bravosnarkside)

As legal troubles and music drama pile up (more on that below), Erika Jayne is also confronting swirling rumors that this could be her final season on “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.”

Speculation picked up after a U.K. event advertisement for a June 3 appearance described the “Expensive to Be Me” singer as a former Real Housewife. Bravo fan account Bravo Snark Side shared a screenshot of the ad on Instagram, sparking even more questions about her future on the show.

“Erika Jayne … The iconic musician, TV star, and former Real Housewife heads to Camden.”

The fan page shared the post, wondering if this was a “typo or piping hot tea.”

Fans immediately hit the comment section to share their thoughts on her possible exit after nine seasons. While some joked not to get their hopes up, one fan was quick to point out that being a Housewife cannot be easy. 

“I'm sorry but she is fabulous. If you step back and really think about it, they ALL are. It can't be easy to be in the spotlight and live their lives so publicly while taking care of themselves and not losing their minds. Eryka Jayne has been fabulous since the day we saw her. Yes she was way too materialistic for my taste but now that reality has hit, I like her even more.”

While Jayne's future on the show may be uncertain, her troubles outside of it continue to grow. 

Attorney Jim Wilkes, who is representing Jayne pro bono in a default lawsuit in Florida, is standing firmly by her side as she continues to face mounting legal pressure and personal challenges. Speaking to The U.S. Sun, Wilkes called the Florida default judgment—a result of his own failure to appear—nothing more than a “clerical error,” insisting, “I'm fighting all the way.”

Jayne, who has spent years entangled in court battles stemming from her ex-husband Tom Girardi's legal downfall, is also grappling with emotional strain behind the scenes. “Erika is dealing with a lot of stress,” Wilkes said. “She's got a close friend that she's done the internet podcast with who's got an incredibly difficult health issue,” referring to Mellencamp's ongoing battle with Stage 4 cancer. “That's been very difficult for Erika.”

Jayne is also facing a $24 million lawsuit tied to her ex's bankruptcy, though she has never been charged with a crime and has consistently denied any involvement in Girardi's alleged misconduct. Girardi was convicted of wire fraud last year in a scheme that stole millions from clients.

“I'm stunned at how Erika has gotten through the depression of it,” Wilkes added. “It astounds me that she's done such a great job. Erika is good people.”

Though a trial is reportedly looming, Wilkes maintains confidence in her defense. “They want a trial with Erika, but the state court cases have shown no evidence. The judge even said he sees no evidence Erika was involved in anything.”

Longtime Hallmark star Brennan Elliott has been understandably quiet since losing his wife Camilla Row to gastric cancer on March 22, 2025. But on April 8, the “His & Hers” star posted an emotional thank you note on Instagram, expressing his gratitude for the countless friends, including many Hallmark stars, and fans who have supported him and his kids during such a difficult time. 

Sharing a throwback photo of himself and Row on their first date, Elliott wrote, “I know I have a lot of people to thank for the prayers and kind words since my beautiful wife camilla passed on march 22nd! The love and prayers as well messages have been overwhelming and my kids and I are so appreciative to every one of you!” 

A post shared by Professional experiencer (@brennanelliott2)

Elliott and Row, a clinical psychologist, were married in September 2011 and shared two children — Liam, 12, and Luna, 10. 

In his caption of the old photo he posted, Elliott wrote, “To think this was our first big date going to a hockey game together 20 years or so ago.! To say I miss #cami is an understatement but everyone's prayers are the wind beneath the kids and my wings and THANKYOU from the bottom of our hearts!!”

Within hours of his post, hundreds of fans and friends had filled the comment section with continued support, including his “All Summer Long” co-star Autumn Reeser, who wrote, “Loving you, sweet Brennan. ❤️‍🩹”

Cindy Busby left a string of emoji — “💖✨🙏✨💖” — and many fans left words of encouragement and comfort, including one who wrote, “Great photo. I have been widowed 10+ years. Hardest thing I have ever gone through. Give yourself grace. One day at a time.”

Someone else commented, “Peace & Comfort to you and your family. It sounds like she was an amazing woman and you have amazing memories that will keep your heart warm. Prayers for peace as you journey through grief. Know you aren't alone. There are many people that are grieving alongside you and your loved ones.”

A post shared by Professional experiencer (@brennanelliott2)

Elliott shared his wife's passing on March 22 via a heartbreaking Instagram post, announcing that she had died early that morning. 

“I know my wife @camilla_row would have wanted me to thank every person from all over the world who prayed for her over the last 8 years she suffered immeasurably trying to survive and live with #stage4gastriccancer,” he wrote. 

“Our babies and I lost our rock,” he continued, “a person who not only was the love of my life,my soulmate,my best friend and lover but the toughest strongest fearless person I have ever met in my life and the greatest mother to her babies.”

Row underwent treatment for early-stage gastric cancer in 2018, but it returned and spread in 2022, leading to a stage 4 diagnosis. Determined to beat the odds, she researched vigilantly, tried a variety of treatment options and surgeries, and told followers of her private Instagram account on January 30 that she was starting a new cancer treatment trial she called her “Hail Mary miracle treatment.”

“There were a few scary moments,” she wrote of the previous two months as she was in and out of the hospital, “but I am ready to get back to my normal, my new normal.” 

Row added, “I feel so blessed to have this opportunity to even participate in a trial, thankful to God as he paves the way for me, grateful for all of your support and prayers. ❤️ you all!”

From the very first episode of “Game Changer” — in which players were confronted with a lie detector machine that was revealed to be under the control of their significant others — the show has played with making and breaking classic game show and comedy formats. The Dropout series has continually tried to “one-up” and “yes-and” itself over the course of its run. Looking toward Season 7 of “Game Changer” on an episode of the Filmmaker Toolkit Podcast, the show's host and mostly gentle dom Sam Reich (also the show's head writer, executive producer, and Dropout CEO) wasn't sure how “Game Changer” was going to keep topping itself.

 








Related Stories The New Movie That Gets the Look of the 1960s Right: Embrace the Ektachrome How ‘Snow White's' Magical Seven Dwarfs Stack Up Against Other CG Characters from Disney Live-Action Remakes 

The answers to that worry are starting to come in, now that Season 7 has opened with “One Year Later,” wherein Reich gives players Vic Michaelis, Lou Wilson, and Jacob Wysocki one calendar year to complete a series of tasks, ranging from keeping a sourdough starter alive to getting the most followers on a Soundcloud account to taking the best candid photo of Reich himself. “Game Changer” has expanded its scope visually. The show now boasts a much larger set with multiple entrances and more space for performers to play. It's also expanded its ambitions in terms of how and when it brings in players beyond the three contestants who stand behind colorful loop-de-loop podiums each episode.

IndieWire spoke to Reich about how Season 7 has leveled up what's possible for the Dropout series, and what “Game Changer” fans, no matter how devotedly they've picked through the trailer, haven't spotted yet. It's telling that this year, Reich didn't seem worried about how Season 8 will go even bigger. Season 7 might be as appropriately ambitious as “Game Changer” wants to be. But if that's the case, Reich reckons that the show has proved they have multiple pianos worth of notes they can hit. Now all the “Game Changer” team has to do is play them.

This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

IndieWire: What has having that bigger stage space opened up for y'all?  

Reich: You'd be surprised in the past seasons how many decisions were axed because we simply couldn't elegantly get something through the stage curtain. So now that we have this grand entrance, we can wheel the most elaborate stuff out onto that stage — for instance, two jet skis. 

 










You sort of get a sense of it watching [Season 7], but the open play space and the distance between the cameras and us are so massive that to be on the stage this season, it felt a little bit like there weren't cameras in the room. They were so far away. I think that contributed to a bit of just how free we felt as performers. 

This is a byproduct of budget as well. In previous seasons of ‘Game Changer' we had our three cast members. And then anyone that we were going to surprise them with came from outside the world of the Dropout cast. And this season we have way more ‘two sides of the aisle.' There are the cast members who are in the episode, and then the cast members who we've partnered with to surprise the people who are in the episode. So it's almost like every single episode is a bit of a collaborative prank in that way. 

What was the timescale of Season 7? How do you go from ideas and budget to figuring out episodes and the spaces? I'm curious how quickly it all comes together. 

Because we're not a typical shop, it means that we can run the creative process in a pretty non-typical way. We head into every year knowing what the budget's going to be. There's also a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy there where we headed into this season of “Game Changer” with a bigger budget because last season was so successful for us. As CEO of the company, I try to be disciplined about this, but as the show is more successful, it means that we can justify spending more on it. 

 










My quote-unquote writers' room is mostly production staff. It's me, our production designer Chloe Badner, our producers Paul Robalino and Ryan Creamer. Paul and Ryan are chiefly my co-writers but we take contributions from a huge number of other supporting writers. I think there are 10-plus names of folks in the credits this year who all pitch on the show regularly. 

We'll begin that process the moment that ‘Make Some Noise' wraps. We'll solicit probably 10 pitches a piece from 10 writers, so like a hundred episode ideas that we'll then [start meeting about them] on a weekly basis. And we'll go through them slowly and meditate on them and say, well, maybe if we took this half of an idea or use this as a leaping off point, and so on. Then that'll take us basically through the summer. Then by the time I leave for the Edinburgh Fringe, which is in late August, we basically know what episodes we're going to do. And then while I'm at Fringe, I am creating loose versions of the scripts. 

You're writing while you're at Fringe? 

Yeah, this proves the masochistic creative appetite I have, but I will go and watch five or six shows a day and then I will write in my jet-lagged state from 9 p.m. or sometimes from midnight until three in the morning. I love writing at Fringe because I'm literally going off and seeing the weirdest possible theater every day and it just puts me in that head space, you know?

 










Wow. Edinburgh is magic like that. 

Yeah. Then I come back from Fringe in September and we have Alpha versions of all the scripts and then we're shooting in October, November. So that's the loose timeline. 

 There's so much we can talk about this season and we've been so good so far — even in the context of the teaser trailer, we've been so thoughtful about ‘OK, what are we giving away and what aren't we giving away?' Because our audience has a mad eye for detail, you know, we wanna make sure that we aren't spoiling too much while also giving them something to look forward to. It's a tricky balance. 

What is comforting about this season versus last season is there were these long threads where people were dissecting the [Season 6] trailer going, ‘OK, we have this episode and that episode, and here's what we know, and here's what's probably the game.' And last season I think those threads were 90 percent accurate. This year they're only 50 percent accurate. I think it's really helpful that we have a bunch of cast members in episodes where they aren't the players. 

Do you feel that the spoilers aspect of it is important for “Game Changer” specifically, as opposed to other shows where if we know who the contestants are, that isn't as big a deal? 
 










 Well, it's interesting, right? I'm sure “Taskmaster” has this to a degree with its fandom. But there's no game show I can think of where spoilers are a part of it. You know? No one is watching “Jeopardy” or “Wheel of Fortune” caring about spoilers, but “Game Changer” now — because it's striking so many notes on the piano and also because it shares a fandom with other Dropout shows — it has a fandom that really cares about the details, you know?

I think we're in this constant tightrope walk there, where we're trying to think of and cater to that audience as best as we can while at the same time we're a relatively small team and a relatively small show as compared to something on traditional streaming. So every once in a while, there's something where someone gives me way more credit than I deserve. It's like, someone will write some long and complicated post about something very poetic we did where I'm like, “Oh man, we did that because we were in a rush and for no other reason.” 

Well, that seems like it's the beauty of being a small team. You have to make the stuff for you, but then once it's out in the world, people will find things in it you absolutely did not have time to see. 

Yeah, for sure. And I do sort of love it. I'll never correct them. 

 










Of course. I feel like it's apparent on watching “One Year Later” but I'm curious, thinking about the show overall, were there things you were excited to level up for Season 7? 

Totally. I mean, there's no such thing as a completely open sandbox. “Game Changer” is a show that's dictated by its restrictions in the same way that it's easier to write poetry with rhyme than without rhyme. So this season needed to increase the size of our toolbox and I think the episodes in which we did that the most were the ones, and there are a few this season, that take place entirely outside the studio. And I was a little nervous to do that because there's a piece of that feels like, well, what even is our show if it's on the “Game Changer” stage? 

Our show is, at its heart, a very modern alt-comedy in the context of a retro ‘70s game show, right? That's the conceit. And if you take away the set, my concern was that half of the show would kind of go away. But this season I think we found some ways to do it that made a lot of sense. And I'm really eager and excited for folks to experience “Change Changer” in that new way. I think now we've earned a whole other piano's worth of notes. It's going to make next season that much easier, creatively, because now we know we can do all these different things. 

 










I mean, this is what I've been saying. I don't think next season is going to be meaningfully more ambitious. I think I'm very content to be exactly this ambitious for a while. I don't know that the show could really grow more without buckling. But we just have so many more toys to play with now than we did before. 

Toys in terms of technical tools or in terms of having proof of concept for things you want to do, or a little of both? 

I mean, I think that one is as simple as a new entrance means there's bigger stuff we can fit through there, right? Another is, you saw in the trailer, there's this giant game show wheel we built that's really complicated. You'll see when that episode comes out. The whole game rests on that wheel. And boy did we do it. The art department just absolutely killed it. And then some of the little cameos and guest appearances that we have on this season, without teasing too much, there are two cameos in this season that are people who I've wanted to get on the show for years who are finally on the show. 

And then, finally, the ability to shoot off-set if the idea is right. Our season finale takes place in front of an audience of 120 people, which is nothing we've ever done before. There are actually two episodes of “Game Changer” this season that take place in front of an audience. One of them has an audience in the studio and the other has an audience and is in a theater location. And it makes such a difference to the energy of the performers to have someone to perform to. 

 










 I mean, in early seasons of “Make Some Noise,” the players would occasionally earn crew laughs. And that felt like such a badge of pride because it was very rare. And then once that started to happen, we told the crew they could laugh, and now there is this very free vibe on both “Game Changer” and “Make Some Noise” sets where everybody feels comfortable laughing. And so you get this almost like 20 percent of a studio audience kind of feel. Which I actually like. 

I think in some ways it feels more contemporary, certainly, than canned laughter does. And it's more generous to the performers because they really do light up when they get laughs and it's nice for them to have someone to perform to. But a whole audience just does make a difference. I think that finale episode, which we shot at The Elysian here in Los Angeles, it's just electric. 

And what a trust fall for my performers. I mean, they basically walked out on stage not knowing what was going to happen in front of a hundred people. 

I can think of few things more “Game Changer” than that. And I love the inclusion of crew laughter. It feels like it's part of the series that jokes hit all the way to the edges of the set and we see those edges. 

Yeah. That's always been a little bit of a character on “Game Changer,” too, is showing the seams of production. It feels very much like shooting “Game Changer” is a character in “Game Changer.” The show has never shied away from being meta. I mean, going all the way back to Season 1 in our murder mystery episode, it was about shooting the show. It was the murder mystery. So I love that part of it. I love the mirror-maze of meta that “Game Changer” is.

Darren Aronofsky is sharing a cut and dry take on the Method acting debate: He simply “hates” the practice.

“I hate Method actors,” the auteur said during a French Cinematheque masterclass in Paris, from Variety. “[By all means], do a tremendous amount of research and really work hard, but acting's make believe. If you're going to do an intense scene, [there's nothing wrong with] keeping yourself isolated, focused and ready in between takes to maintain that emotion. It's a sport, a game — only, to be a great basketball player, you don't have to be dribbling all the time. That's not how it works. You do your homework, and get yourself ready. It's only a fake reality between action and cut.”

He added that the particular acting technique is “just something to hide behind, as opposed to doing the work and being professional.” However, the director did clarify that an all-immersive approach could be “fine, as long as it's not debilitating for the rest of the crew.”

“It's fine if that's how [these actors] want to spend their time,” Aronofsky said. “But I just encourage them to relax a bit!”

Aronofsky has collaborated with stars such as Natalie Portman, Jennifer Lawrence (who similarly said she was “scared” of working with Method actors), and Brendan Fraser. His next film, “Caught Stealing,” is led by famously Method actor Austin Butler, who rose to superstardom for fully transforming into Elvis Presley — including changing his speaking voice for years — for the eponymous Baz Luhrmann-helmed biopic.

Aronofsky deemed Butler to be his “anchor” on crime thriller “Caught Stealing,” which was adapted from Charlie Huston's book about a former baseball player who gets caught up in a world of underground crime in 1990s New York City. “We sort of built a world around him,” Aronofsky said of working with Butler. He also compared the film to his other beloved feature “Black Swan.” 

“It's just a crime caper that we tried to make really well – and that was a really fun activity,” Aronofsky said, citing how “Caught Stealing” was a “beautiful exercise” in genre filmmaking. “There's nothing wrong with taking a classic genre and just trying to make it better, and to do things with real craft.”

 










Aronofsky is rumored to be later adapting Stephen King's “Cujo” for Netflix.

Christopher Landon is revealing where he landed amid the “Scream VII” controversies in 2023. The director of the new thriller “Drop” told Vanity Fair that he and his family endured death threats and “abuse” after “Scream” franchise actress Melissa Barrera was fired by production company Spyglass for her pro-Palestine comments. According to Landon, fans conflated Spyglass' decision with his own personal politics; at the time, Landon wrote on Twitter in a since-deleted statement about Barrera's firing, “Everything sucks. Stop yelling. This was not my decision to make.”

 










After Barrera was let go, her “Scream” co-star Jenna Ortega decided to leave the franchise as well. It was originally reported that “Scream VII” conflicted with Ortega's “Wednesday” Season 2 shoot after the SAG-AFTRA strikes; Ortega recently clarified to The Cut that her exit had “nothing to do with pay or scheduling” and it was Barrera's firing that was the reason for her decision to leave. “The Melissa stuff was happening, and it was all kind of falling apart,” Ortega said. “If ‘Scream VII' wasn't going to be with that team of directors and those people I fell in love with, then it didn't seem like the right move for me in my career at the time.”

If only Landon could merely say the same: The “Happy Death Day” and “Paranormal Activity” filmmaker agreed with Ortega that without Barrera, “Scream VII” was “tumbling down in an instant.” He added that it was “devastating to suddenly cancel everything” during the prep for the project. However, it wasn't just creative frustrations that Landon had to endure: The director said that “Scream” fans were digitally attacking his family (Landon and his husband Cody Morris have two sons, ages five and eight.) The reason? Barrera being fired. 

“I did not fire her,” Landon restated. “A lot of people think I had something to do with it, and it was not my doing. I had no control of the situation at all. I think in the absence of people understanding how Hollywood works and what the hierarchy is, the fans were like, ‘That's the guy.' And so they came for me, knives out.”

Landon continued that Barrera's firing became a crux of how Hollywood was reacting to the Israel-Palestine conflict at the time in November 2023. 

 










“People were threatening to kill me and my family, to the point where the FBI was getting involved,” Landon said. “I got messages saying, ‘I'm going to find your kids, and I'm going to kill them because you support child murder.' The head of security at various studios and the FBI had to examine the threats. It was highly aggressive and really scary.” 

On December 23, 2023, Landon announced that he too was parting ways with “Scream VII.”

“They wanted me to continue on,” Landon said of Spyglass. “They basically said, ‘You can restart it. You can figure it out.' But the amount of abuse that I had to deal with — I decided I didn't want to give any part of myself to that. For me, it was not worth it. I would rather put my efforts into something else, where I could feel appreciated and respected. The hate and abuse really spoiled it for me, and I lost my love for the idea of going forward.”

Landon added, “In the midst of all the chaos, I was grieving the loss of one of my dream jobs. I went through all the stages — I was shocked, I was sad, and then I got angry. To be a part of this legacy, it was really hard to let it go. ‘Scream' was a very dark and tumultuous experience. I was gobsmacked and in shock for a while, but I'm at a place now where I can talk about it 'cause I was able to use that unpleasant experience and turn it into something positive. And that was ‘Drop.'”

 










Original “Scream” screenwriter Kevin Williamson will now be writing and directing “Scream VII.” Landon supports the film and the franchise as a whole, even after his experience with it. 

“I want ‘Scream' to succeed. Kevin probably made a banger of a movie, because he knows it better than anybody. It's going to be awesome,” he said. “There's no resentment at all. What else are you going to do? Wallow? Then they win. My best revenge was making something cool, and I feel like I did with ‘Drop.' My revenge wasn't rooted in pain or anger; it was rooted in joy and moving forward.”

Some details might be lacking in Patricia Riggen's (“The 33,” “Lemonade Mouth”) Prime Video action outing “G20”. Like, hey, what political party does our red-dressed heroine president (billed by some as a “warmonger”) but also, notably, a woman of color, obsessed with a plan to help failing African countries, identify as? But for audiences willing to put this and other queries to the side, the streaming feature delivers.

Mostly, “G20” has two major points in its favor, right out of the gate: a super-fun premise for an action film (what if money-mad mercenaries seized the 20 most powerful leaders of the world and demanded some really insane shit?) and a star both so good and so classy that it never feels as if she's punching below her weight class. Star and producer Viola Davis brings gravitas and charisma to every role, and so while she's thrilling to watch in the non-action moments afforded to her President Danielle Sutton, there is something special about seeing her, oh, choke a bad guy out with the barrel of a submachine gun. She can have it all!

 








Related Stories ‘The Studio' Gets Closer to Real Life: Hershey Chocolate Movie in the Works with Finn Wittrock and Alexandra Daddario Hilary Swank: Hollywood Was ‘More Patriarchal Than Ever' at the Start of My Career 

Not that it's been easy. When we first meet President Sutton, she's preparing for her first G20 Summit and juggling some relatable family problems. Her husband Derek (Anthony Anderson) is devoted — we soon learn Danielle rocketed to fame as a young soldier, captured in an iconic photo while saving a small child during an attack on Fallujah; Derek was the medic who healed her after. Her kids, though, aren't as easy. Smart Serena (Marsai Martin) is almost 18 and itching to be her own person. Typical teen problems made all the worse by her mom's job, while younger brother Demetrius (Christopher Farrar) is just trying to ride this whole thing out.




			Popular on IndieWire		






When Danielle drags the entire family to Cape Town for the summit, we know something messy is afoot, mostly thanks to a jittery opening sequence involving obvious baddies (like “The Boys” star Antony Starr) and a fat crypto wallet, two things that don't seem like they'll mesh well with the prez. She's got some aces up her sleeve, though, like her own hyper-motivated personality (with some refreshing physical fitness to boot) and devoted Secret Service agent Manny (Ramon Rodriguez, the film's sneaky breakout). But she's got stuff on the line, too, like her Together Plan, which hinges on bringing digital currency to African farmers that could really benefit from the ease of such tech-forward banking. What could go wrong?

 










Even before the action kicks in, EGOT winner Davis finds texture and emotion in the smallest of scenes. The set of her jaw during a tense family dinner sequence, the way she prepares to face a crowd in an elevator, even the second she pauses in the middle of a busy ballroom to wonder about the probability of success of that much-heralded Together Plan, Davis makes every scene count. That's the pleasure of casting such a star in a genre that can be intensely rewarding if treated with respect. And that's before she shoves a baddie's face into a hot grill, a “Sudden Death”-esque moment that will delight the pickiest of action fans.

Davis hasn't been shy about her intent with the film: She wanted to see if she could star in an old-school action outing, the kind of thing that Bruce Willis or Sigourney Weaver (two names the star and producer threw out during a Tuesday night introduction to the film) might have taken on in the '80s or '90s. With that in mind, she absolutely delivers. Yet, fans of those sorts of films might get antsy, waiting for the action to really heat up. Stay patient, it does, and what a treat to see not only a woman kick ass, but to do it while wearing sensible sneakers and a well-placed pair of Spanx.

Once the 20 world leaders (and staff, spouses, and security) all turn up for a pre-summit cocktail party, Rutledge (Starr) and his band of AI-obsessed cryptobros move in. Hired as private security for the event (no wonder Danielle sniffed at the news that the BlackRock-esque group was running the show in Cape Town), they've got the run of the place, and the kind of shaky plan and awkward motivations traditional to the genre. All you need to know: They're mad at the world leaders, they want everyone to yank their money from the stock market and put it into crypto (good God), and they're more than happy to utilize deepfakes to sell their plan to the world.

 










And, no, they never saw President Sutton coming. When their initial attack proves to be so messy (a constantly shaking camera keeps both the audience and the baddies unclear of what's really happening) that Danielle and some other heavy hitters can sneak away, their aims become fixated on her. Trawling through the bowels of the luxury resort, the prez has some allies with her (Manny, the Chinese First Lady, the spunky head of the International Monetary Fund) and some duds (Douglas Hodge as the British Prime Minister, cast here as a moron with some wonderful comic relief).

Their mission? Live or something? Ultimately, it results in a series of hand-to-hand battles and lobby-set shoot-outs that are remarkable in how unremarkable they would have been three decades ago. We used to get movies like this once a week! We used to be a proper country!

Still, the script (from Caitlin Parrish & Erica Weiss, plus Noah Miller & Logan Miller) can get bogged down with too much extra stuff. While a subplot involving the president's family works — it adds to her character, and will also obviously tie into her primary plot, that's clear the moment we realize Serena is a would-be hacker — other bits and bobs get lost along the way. Consider smarmy tech bad guy Bousquet, who disappears throughout the film (fine, acceptable), or Danielle's close friend and treasury head Joanna (Elizabeth Marvel) who does the same (criminal, for many reasons). 

 










And while Antony Starr makes for a good baddie, the unevenness of his performance rankles. Sure, he's fully bonkers by the final act, but that sort of unhinged energy would have been more welcome much earlier. You've taken the twenty most important people on Earth hostage, can't you have a touch more fun with that? That's the big ask of such films: tucking majorly worrying world events (a stock market crash? in this economy?) alongside ass-kicking adventure. Davis, at least, understands the assignment.

“G20” will start streaming globally on Prime Video on Thursday, April 10.

Don't fear, Season 2 will not be the last of “The Last of Us.” IndieWire can announce that HBO has renewed the hit series for a third season ahead of its Season 2 premiere. 

“The Last of Us” stars Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie. The Season 2 logline reads: “Five years after the events of the first season, Joel and Ellie are drawn into conflict with each other and a world even more dangerous and unpredictable than the one they left behind.” Season 2 debuts Sunday, April 13 at 9:00 p.m. ET/PT on HBO and will be available to stream on Max. 

 










Gabriel Luna, Rutina Wesley, Kaitlyn Dever, Isabela Merced, Young Mazino, Ariela Barer, Tati Gabrielle, Spencer Lord, Danny Ramirez, Jeffrey Wright, and Catherine O'Hara also star in the seven-episode Season 2. Craig Mazin and video game creator Neil Druckmann are co-showrunners for the series. “The Last of Us” is based on the acclaimed video game franchise developed by Naughty Dog for the PlayStation consoles, with Mazin and Druckmann writing and executive producing. The series is a co-production with Sony Pictures Television and is also executive produced by Carolyn Strauss, Jacqueline Lesko, Cecil O'Connor, Asad Qizilbash, Carter Swan, and Evan Wells, with writer/co-executive producer Halley Gross.

“It can't be overemphasized how proud HBO is for the outstanding achievement we believe the second season of ‘The Last of Us' is,” Francesca Orsi, Executive Vice President, HBO Programming, Head of HBO Drama Series and Films, said. “Craig, Neil, Carolyn, and the entire executive producer team, cast and crew have delivered a masterful follow-up and we're thrilled to carry the power of Craig and Neil's storytelling into what we know will be an equally moving and extraordinary third season.” 

Mazin, the creator, executive producer, writer, and director, added, “We approached Season 2 with the goal of creating something we could be proud of. The end results have exceeded even our most ambitious goals, thanks to our continued collaboration with HBO and the impeccable work of our unparalleled cast and crew. We look forward to continuing the story of ‘The Last of Us' with Season 3!”

Druckmann continued, “To see ‘The Last of Us' brought to life so beautifully and faithfully has been a career highlight for me, and I am grateful for the fans' enthusiastic and overwhelming support. Much of that success is thanks to my partner in crime, Craig Mazin, our partnership with HBO, and our team at PlayStation Productions. On behalf of everyone at Naughty Dog, our cast, and crew, thank you so much for allowing us this opportunity. We're thrilled to bring you more of ‘The Last of Us'!”

 










Mazin previously confirmed that Season 3 will be “significantly larger” in scope. The co-showrunners are planning for at least four seasons, as Mazin told Deadline in 2024.

“I love making the show,” Mazin said. “The scope of this thing is at times absolutely massive. And Season 3 promises to be just as big if not bigger. I don't see a world where we go through and we go, that's shorter than we thought. We are committed to delivering people great seasons and arcs, and HBO was amazing about this. They let us pick that natural spot. Instead of us having to figure out how to create seasons around an artificial number, we create the length of the seasons around the story and how we are telling it.”

With the globalization of content on streamers, local and specific stories tend to resonate widely. In Canada, that's true of Netflix-hosted second-window runs of series like “Schitt's Creek” and “Kim's Convenience,” so it was only a matter of time before the streamer invested in a unique Canadian story of its own.

Enter “North of North,” a brand-new Inuk comedy from Stacey Aglok MacDonald and Alethea Arnaquq-Baril that filmed in Iqaluit, Nunavut (the largest and northernmost territory of Canada), last year. The project is a co-commission from Netflix and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), in association with the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN).

“North of North” is a series of firsts. It's the first original scripted Canadian commission from Netflix, the first scripted series to film in Nunavut, and the first project to capture the everyday joys of a historically misrepresented culture.  

The eight-episode series revolves around a young Inuk mother named Siaja (Anna Lambe) who realizes she needs a fresh start, so she blows up her life to forge her own path, despite the expectations of her community. There's laughter, but this is also a series about representation and community empowerment. It takes place during the celebratory spring, and Siaja works at the community center, where everything happens.

“For us, community centers are the only building in town where you can do big gatherings or weddings or elections or funerals,” Arnaquq-Baril told IndieWire during a set visit. “You name it, and anything that requires a big space happens at the community center.”

From the beginning, production challenges included procuring resources and filming during suboptimal weather. Where possible, materials had to be shipped by sea during the short thaw to save on expensive airfreight. For consistency during reshoots, production brought dump trucks full of snow in from surrounding areas.

Some sets were constructed in Toronto, disassembled and shipped out and have now been preserved for a potential second season. They flew empty generators in and found locals to rev them up. Production had to pause twice when a housing and mining convention came to town because there wasn't enough hotel space to accommodate everyone.

 










“There are only a limited number of resources in town, and sometimes things just aren't available,” said production designer Andrew Berry. “And we can't suck up all of that resource so that it's not here for the community. We had to bring up our own everything.”

When the series was first developed with CBC, the limited budget left producers with few options. The initial thought was to film in Sudbury, Ontario, and on a soundstage in Toronto. However, that created practical problems, like avoiding trees or flying 100 extras down south.

“We also thought there was no way we could make an Inuit-led show about the Arctic and shoot it in southern Ontario,” said executive producer Miranda de Pencier. “It was just not going to happen.”

Partnering with Netflix and its hefty (but undisclosed) boost to the budget helped bring production to where it needed to be physically, but it was the community that pushed this series to the finish line. Production borrowed and transformed the Iqaluit Curling Rink into a studio that housed built sets, but they also went into real locations and homes for an integrated feel. Costume designers relied on social media to source people flying into Iqaluit to bring certain items from Ottawa or Toronto. The crew worked with a local cab company to figure out transportation, including on filming days when portable washrooms weren't practical because the pipes would freeze.

 










“The first four episodes were hard because we really had to work out a lot of logistics,” said Anya Adams, who directed the first two installments. “Once we did that, it was also helping the community understand what we were doing so that they could get behind us and not feel impacted.”

Aglok MacDonald and Arnaquq-Baril live in Nunavut, and they had many important conversations with their neighbors about what was required and how they wanted to give back. They prioritized hiring and training locals where possible, held training workshops to help youth tell their own stories, used an all-female team of Indigenous directors, including Adams and Danis Goulet, and went to work on a production studio with public and private funding.

“The studio is separate from the show but made possible by the show,” said Aglok MacDonald. “Filming in the curling rink is a one-time thing. It's used a lot by the community, and we can't take it away on an ongoing basis. So we urgently got down to fundraising to build the studio.”

Arnaquq-Baril adds that, with “North of North,” many people could see the immediate impact on the community, both financially and in terms of creating a platform. “Being able to keep going is important,” she said. “We were determined to use this as an opportunity where others can innovate and do their own projects, even if it's not the same scale as the project we have.”

 










The co-showrunners have worked extensively with de Pencier in the past on projects like “The Grizzlies” and “Throat Song.” She recalls them saying early on that they didn't want anyone from the south coming to the north without creating something lasting.

“They were the ones who said there's enough coming and going. People pop in and do something, and then they disappear, and nothing changes,” de Pencier said. “They said, if we're going to put energy into these projects, you have to invest in the future.”

Lambe, who was born in Iqaluit, also appreciates the co-showrunners' community-oriented approach. It was part of what attracted her to the series. “It's not just about how can we showcase our community in a way to the world that allows people to see us authentically, but also how can we empower and support our community members to get involved in an industry that has often exploited and or left them out of the conversation?,” she told IndieWire. “So to see how this industry has grown so much, in my lifetime living here, is unbelievable.”

“North of North” starts streaming on Thursday, April 10 on Netflix.

Like a feather in the wind or the global stock market, all of us are subject to stochastic drift. Originating in advanced statistics, the term refers to the way in which randomness works upon a system, how the trajectory of a line sways as it's affected by unanticipated events. For Sam Barker, the metaphor of a winding path has been meaningful in recent years.

After an extended period as a label runner and concert booker, the Berlin-based musician entered the spotlight with 2018's Debiasing EP and 2019's Utility, two records that articulated a weightless, kick-drumless vision of techno. What should have been a dizzying ascent was cut short by the pandemic: tour cancelled, label shuttered, and hard-won contacts with booking agents broken off. At his lowest moment, the artist filled out paperwork at a job center and weighed leaving the music industry behind. “It was quite remarkable how the rug could be pulled from everything in such an all-encompassing way,” he reflected in an interview with Tone Glow. “This made it quite hard to engage in a rule-based or goal-based approach because it seemed like every goal was changing from one week to the next.”

Barker's second LP, Stochastic Drift, is both a synthesis of his wilderness years and a thrilling inflection point. In a field of brilliant ambient techno producers, he's delivered his most dazzling and definitive statement to date. The strict parameters that guided his early records' zero-gravity rush have dissolved into freeform experimentation, allowing his tracks to billow and burst as the mood demands. Across the album, Barker blurs analog and mechanized instruments into gauzy clouds, jazzy ambiance, and elegant percussion. He navigates extremes, toggling between aural chaos and hyper-mediated technology by harnessing randomness for all its power.

On early solo releases, Barker committed himself to restricting his own talent with an intensity that would make Brian Eno blush. In interviews, he could occasionally sound like a level-headed startup founder, phrasing his ideas in terms of inputs and outputs and making a cool yet impassioned case for techno disruption. The difference was that Barker was concerned with scrambling expectations rather than optimizing outcomes. Taking inspiration from engineering, probability theory, and social psychology (and titling most tracks after related concepts), he set applied sciences to a dancefloor pulse. The continually cresting trance of “Hedonic Treadmill” or “When Prophecy Fails” was a product of limitation, ingeniously making up for the tracks' lack of thump with pillowy texture, glassy melodies, and ceaseless forward motion.

Barker wields a similar palette of icy synths on Stochastic Drift, but the record diverges in how he applies them to its canvas. The constantly shifting, knife-point fineness Barker honed on Utility has been compared to the “pointillist trance” of Lorenzo Senni. On Stochastic Drift, instead of clustering rave stabs into the shape of an off-kilter dance track, his approach is open and airy. The more fitting fine-arts comparison is Cy Twombly: that of an artist carving a vast horizon from a frenzy of subtle and streaky mark-making. Lead single “Reframing,” the only track here with a drop, hews closest to a trance blueprint. Even then it's far from conventional. Barker withholds payoff for several beats past the song's peak and when it finally detonates, it sings rather than explodes. His mastery of the stereo field is remarkable, milking the resonance out of each fleck and dash that crosses the mix.

Where he once leveraged the forward thrust of trance to nudge his songs into gear, Barker now allows them to gradually assume their own shapes. Repetition that first scans as monotonous gradually becomes mesmerizing as stray sounds cohere into brilliantly busy compositions. On “Force of Habit” and “Difference and Repetition,” he sets distended synth loops rolling into motion, cycling through phasing as scattered drums and flashing keys highlight distinct parts of the curvature. With their initially awkward gait, these songs can occasionally resemble the lurching vaporwave of Giant Claw or early Oneohtrix Point Never, although Barker's ear for smoothness means that they merely sigh rather than gasp.

He reaps the greatest rewards of his newly loosened style in the album's final stretch. “Fluid Mechanics” definitively adds “jazz musician” to the producer's repertoire as Barker structures the interplay between understated drums and slanted synths with a stern but twinkling piano. Each time its melody rounds the bend, the underlying music surges to the fore with tidal intensity, leaving a sea spray of dubby reverb in its wake. The closing title track is structured around a virtuoso programmed drum solo that blurs the distinction between man and machine in a fistfight of roiling toms. It is the most obvious instance of Barker's use of (handmade) mechanized instruments, and also his most inspiring. By situating his art in a language of scientific and mechanical processes, Barker highlights his own human capacities: The record's complexity is a counterpoint to the thoughtlessness of AI generation, pairing extraordinary musicianship with the creative agency required to make the most of automation.

Barker would probably balk at mapping biography too closely onto his music. But despite their technical bent, many of his titles can be read as analogies for personal growth amid emotional duress. In this light, the staggered pulse of “Difference and Repetition” and “Force of Habit” reflect a brain stumbling over itself in real time, while the lucid, chiseled climaxes of “Positive Disintegration” and “Reframing” could be understood as hard-won revelations. In a press release accompanying the album, Barker cited scholar and statistician Nassim Nicholas Taleb's concept of “antifragility” as a source of inspiration. To be antifragile is to benefit from chaos, to thrive on adversity, and grow in proportion to your experience. Stochastic Drift is the sound of an artist and his work fracturing again and again, becoming more durable every time.

Do you want to throw your phone into a blender? Do you want to squeeze out five full seconds of your own attention without the heat of a blinking cursor, a twitching ad, an ambient anxiety underscoring every sentence? You can yearn for the apocalypse, or, maybe more pointedly, for the year 2010. Sleigh Bells are there with you, spiraling and scrolling. Consciousness might be a bit much right now, the band says. They're grasping for a pause button.

Sleigh Bells got so much right. They mashed together frenetic beats and airy synths and hulking drums; they were loud and dense and frenetic, tightly controlled but impossible to predict. The more albums they made, the more they strayed from what worked. Bitter Rivals smashed through the soundboard, like the band had turned every dial up to its loudest setting and hoped the noise would be enough. Jessica Rabbit slipped between genres instead of breaking them apart, sometimes filtering the chaos into cookie-cutter electro-pop. Texis, the band's 2021 release, could sound like diluted versions of early demos. It should be a relief that Bunky Becky Birthday Boy, their latest album, presents itself as something new. But the record doesn't shape-shift as much as it leans into some of their most abrasive instincts.

Bunky Becky is a nickname for singer Alexis Krauss' late dog, Riz. “We wanted the track to sound like a dog having the best moment of her life without any of the burden of self consciousness,” Derek Miller, the guitarist and producer of the group, wrote of the lead single in a press release—a cute concept that veers into Mickey Mouse Clubhouse territory as the duo chants “Bunky Becky Birthday Girl!” Sleigh Bells' songs have rarely rewarded close attention to the lyrics—their best music is physical enough to distract from the occasional clunker—but these songs are tepid enough to leave you fixated on phrases like, “I tell you, ‘I love you'/'Cause you're a cool one forever” and “The moment is real, the moment is magic.” The chief offender is “Life Was Real,” which applies the choppy Sleigh Bells dynamic to “Sk8er Boi”-style guitars. “Life was real and dark and crazy,” Krauss sings, before sneering, “Arrest me, sad face!”

The emoji might've worked with more weirdness surrounding it. Bunky Becky Birthday Boy is clean and crisp where it should spin out, bubbly where it should be brash. The inventiveness that animated Treats shows up only in a handful of moments in the back half: the 15 seconds of quasi-rap that make “Blasted Shadow” catchy instead of merely tolerable, or the first 30 seconds of “Badly,” which sound like 100 gecs—a band clearly indebted to Sleigh Bells, and currently outdoing Sleigh Bells at their own schtick. Even tracks that circle around a hazily imagined apocalypse—“This summer might be your last!”—can't summon more than half a head bob. There's enough energy pumping through these songs to move the 32-minute album along, but it feels like you're slouching through the moving walkway at an airport.

“Hi Someday” is an exception. The song has a slick internal momentum—it revs, rather than just announcing that it's revving. The machine-gun drum fills and blitz of twinkly synths serve a clear purpose, bludgeoning the listener with the weight of trudging through yet another day. The nebulous nihilism that Sleigh Bells toy around with for the rest of the album crystalizes here: “Every day is just like some day,” Krauss repeats, a banal koan that slices sharper each time, until the beat builds and she pleads, “Some day soon!” The track is a demand for a release, for relief; it's also the closest Sleigh Bells comes to delivering it themselves.

The death toll of the roof collapse at a Dominican nightclub has risen to 113, and is expected to climb as emergency crews continue to search the rubble more than 24 hours after the disaster. Dominican public figures from the worlds of music, politics, and sport are among those who were killed when the ceiling caved in an hour into merengue singer Rubby Pérez's midnight headline show at the Jet Set club. Pérez himself and his saxophonist, Luis Solís, were confirmed dead early this morning (April 9), and Major League Baseball has paid tribute to former players Octavio Dotel and Tony Blanco. Dominican officials have not commented on potential causes of the collapse, which also injured more than 255 survivors.

Pérez has been a merengue luminary for decades, playing in bands including Los Juveniles del Sabor in the 1970s after studying music at the National Conservatory of Santo Domingo. He sang on hits with the Wilfrido Vargas Orchestra that helped make merengue an international phenomenon, before launching a solo career in 1987. Popular throughout his life, he released several platinum albums and, as his legacy grew, headlined U.S. venues including Radio City Music Hall and Madison Square Garden. In 2010, the Committee of Latin American Political Parties in the United States recognized Pérez for helping victims of that year's Haiti earthquake.

7.1

Genre:

Experimental

Label:

One Little Independent

Reviewed:

April 9, 2025

In the videos released before A Requiem, bodies assume strange poses, moving in slow motion if at all—otherwise hanging, suspended, like a museum piece or an effigy left behind after a ritual. Penelope Trappes' music has the same energy, tapped from some eternal source—like the Bandorai of the opening track, a ritual invocation of the ancient Celtic priestesses. On “Bandorai,” Trappes mourns the loss of the past while navigating the tumult of her present, an uncomfortable push-and-pull that defines her gothy fifth album, which combines drone, modern classical, and neofolk.

Most of Trappes' solo music falls under the ambient umbrella. Her trilogy of self-titled records exploded dream pop into something cold and occluded—music that billowed outwards instead of inviting you into its seductive embrace. A Requiem is different, less dissolute. Here, the songs snap back into (soft) focus on an album that interrogates Trappes' own cross-generational trauma and family strife. It's a lot for 34 minutes, but she comes out the other side renewed, having passed through a period of intense introspection and psychedelic therapy.

To record A Requiem, the Australian-born, Brighton-based musician traveled to Glasgow, where she connected with her Celtic ancestry in a way she never had before. She has said that the music is rooted in the British Isles, though those links are not always apparent—some tracks are devoid of words, in favor of primordial keens and wails, while others draw out words like “ocean” or “home.” With its deep exhales and arch vocals, A Requiem reminds me most of late period Coil, when the UK group decamped from London to the Somerset countryside and made music to soundtrack nightly walks in the pitch-black forest. Trappes' compositions are just as environmental, descending like a shroud of mist.

Trappes works out her demons in real time, alternating between brighter passages like “Anchor Us to Second Floor” and heavier centerpieces like “Sleep,” which moves with the halting clank of some eldritch monstrosity. She commands a choir of ghosts with a quiet-loud dynamic worthy of Scott Walker's 1995 masterpiece Tilt. The other highlight, “Red Dove,” reminds me of James Holden's The Inheritors, built around an arpeggiated synth that sounds more medieval than modern, underlining the song's grotesque chorus: “Wash it down/With violent hope.”

The album lurches toward resolution in the stunning “Torc,” where the sound design comes to a head. A crackling noise resembles rain, but as it grows more intense, it could be a funeral pyre, burning what came before and letting loose a cleansing, perfumed smoke. “Torc” turns the album's leaden drones into a synth-string overture worthy of a Hollywood blockbuster before the album closes on a Sigur Rós-ian note with the gorgeous “Thou Art Mortal,” sung in Gaelic rather than Hopelandic.

The emotional pull of A Requiem is stronger than Trappes' past material. She draws from sources older than ambient music, opting for a more intuitive style—you can hear it in the simple, moaning melodies, particularly the cello, which Trappes didn't know how to play when she picked it up for this album. Feeling her way in the dark, she illuminates certain corners before letting the darkness cloak her again. Sometimes it can feel melodramatic and less polished, but that's part of the approach: There are bound to be uncomfortable moments listening to someone else's therapy, but there are also passages of profound beauty and clarity amid the maelstrom.

Last month, Miley Cyrus announced her new album, Something Beautiful, and, soon after, released the opening song, “Prelude,” and the title track. That first song, “Prelude,” was co-written by Model/Actriz frontman Cole Haden. In a new statement to Pitchfork, Haden reflected on his experience working with Cyrus. He shared:

When Miley asked me to write poetry for Something Beautiful, we had already known each other for some time—both as friends and admirers of each other's work. Early in the process of developing the album, she invited me over for a kiki to play me demos and share her vision for the project. The album I heard then, albeit unfinished, already had an identity that felt complete. What touched me most deeply about this collaboration was the profound trust she placed in me, believing I could add something meaningful to it.

As someone who rarely writes for others, I took my time to really internalize what this album means to me, so that what I wrote could speak the same language that Miley had already written.

When I eventually sent my work back to her, it became the opening of the album. I was deeply honored that Miley chose to start her album with words I had written. It's a reminder of the interconnectedness of art and creation—how, through collaboration, we give life to something that is not just ours but belongs to everyone who experiences it.

Miley Cyrus and Shawn Everett are Something Beautiful's executive producers, and they both co-produced “Prelude” with Michael Pollack, Jonathan Rado, and Maxx Morando. The new album is out on May 30.

Model/Actriz are readying their sophomore album Pirouette, which follows their fantastic 2023 debut, Dogsbody. It comes out on May 2.

	Another key recession indicator is rearing its head as President Donald Trump's administration enacts reciprocal tariffs on large swaths of goods imported into the United States. On Wednesday morning, the price of U.S. Treasury bonds took a nosedive, while yields spiked — a sign that bond holders are dumping their debt and attempting to lower any risk in their books.


	Trump isn't bothered. 


	“BE COOL!” the president wrote on Truth Social Wednesday morning. “Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!” 


	“THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!” he added in a subsequent post.


	But financial markets and investors are struggling to keep a level head as Trump seems hell bent on destabilizing the global economy, despite his repeated assurances that all will be well and Americans will soon be richer than ever.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Since Trump's tariff announcement last week, markets — both national and international — have whipsawed through record breaking daily highs and lows — with the Dow Jones dropping 10 percent in the last month alone. In the first two months of his presidency, Trump has already managed to wipe out any post-election investor enthusiasm, and markets are now teetering on the brink of a historic collapse as his tariffs take effect. Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have been jacking up their odds of a recessions since Trump's tariff announcement last week.

	











	One of the only things keeping markets from a full blown collapse has been the White House's claim that over 70 countries have approached the administration hoping to negotiate deals and exemptions from Trump's tariff bonanza. The president may be blowing them off, though. According to a Wednesday report from Politico, several nations have expressed frustration with the White House's lack of real engagement on trade negotiations. “I'm not sure … how receptive the Commerce Department, the [U.S. trade representative], is in getting our Cabinet secretaries to meet with counterparts. Many of us have already written to them asking for meetings,” one Philippine official told Politico, adding that they and other countries “are all waiting for the reply.”

	“Even if you have a meeting, apart from a nice tweet, you don't get anything,” another diplomat said.

	











	At an annual National Republican Congressional Committee dinner on Tuesday night, Trump all but admitted that crafting deals with interested trade partners is not his primary focus at the moment. 


	“These countries are calling us up, kissing my ass — they are — they are dying to make a deal. 


	‘Please, please make a deal. I'll do anything. I'll do anything, sir,'” Trump said during his speech at the event. 


	“We don't necessarily want to make a deal with them. We're happy the way we are taking our $2 billion a day, but they want to make a deal with us. I know what the hell I'm doing. I know what I'm doing, and you know what I'm doing, too. That's why you voted for me,” he added. 


	The instability in the bond market is also raising red flags for economists and analysts who say the sell-offs may be a sign of an implosion in the treasuries so-called “basis trade.” To avoid a full economic lecture, basis trading is an investment strategy in which an investor buys an asset or commodity, and then sells a related derivative of that commodity in order to take advantage of the market difference between the price of the two.

	In the context of treasury bonds, large hedge funds have for years now been purchasing bonds as safe collateral for potentially risky investments. At the same time, they will sell futures contracts on bonds in order to collect on the difference — the basis. It sounds fine in theory, but it's contingent upon a slow and stable market, and any large swing can be devastating. As Bloomberg's Matt Levine wrote in 2023: “The obvious objection is that if you have $550 billion of Treasuries backed by $10 billion of your own money, and the value of Treasuries drops by 2%, then all of your money is gone, you have to dump Treasuries, everyone else is dumping them at the same time and there is a crisis. This is an exaggeration, because if the value of Treasuries drops by 2% then probably you made 2% on your futures and you're more or less fine, but still there is not a ton of margin for error.” 


	While a full blown Treasuries market collapse has yet to manifest, signs that the basis trade could cause a domino effect collapse akin to the 2008 financial crisis have reared their head before. In 2020, when the Covid pandemic caused widespread market instability, hedge funds took a beating after major international banks and other investors dumped their Treasury bonds in order to access liquid funds. International investors are no doubt spooked, and the Treasuries market — a pillar of the global economic system — is looking a little too shaky for comfort. 

	











	It doesn't help that on Wednesday morning, China leveled another round of retaliatory tariffs against the United States, bumping up their penalties on goods imported from the U.S. from 34 to 84 percent, compared to the 104 percent Trump is charging on Chinese imports.

	As if firing tens of thousands of veterans from federal service, gutting Veterans Affairs benefits, and slashing Medicare and Social Security weren't enough, Donald Trump is now moving to deport veterans — many of whom have risked their lives for a country that's now kicking them to the curb like trash.


	As I write this, Jose Barco, a U.S. Army veteran and Purple Heart recipient, sits in a Texas detention center awaiting deportation to a country that won't even take him. Barco was born in Cuba and his father fled to Venezuela for amnesty. The Venezuelan government is claiming his birth certificate is a fake, alleging it looks too new to be real. 


	Barco — a veteran of two combat deployments to Iraq, who put his life on the line for a country that now refuses to recognize him as one of its own — is caught in limbo as the Trump administration decides what to do with him. What they do know is that they don't want him in the United States.


	Barco came to the U.S. at the age of four. He enlisted in the Army and served in Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 506th Infantry Regiment — the kind of unit that saw the worst of Iraq during the height of the insurgency. In 2004, he earned a Purple Heart after an explosion launched him through the air and into a wall, leaving him with a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and severe burns. He was later diagnosed with PTSD. TBI and PTSD are the very conditions that Trump, through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is neglecting by slashing critical mental health services and eliminating over 80,000 jobs at the VA.

	While serving, Barco tried to file for citizenship. His commanding officer helped him complete the application. Then it vanished. No chain of custody. No record. A lost folder with a soldier's future inside it. What should've been a straightforward path to naturalization became an invisible trap door leading to exile.


	When he returned stateside, Barco's untreated brain trauma turned to instability. He committed a violent crime in 2008. He fired a random shot, which he says he doesn't recall, into a group of people and injured a pregnant teen. He paid for it with 15 years of his life behind bars for attempted murder. His sentence was reduced for good behavior, and he was granted his release after his first parole hearing.

	Barco was honorably discharged. He was diagnosed with serious physical and mental injuries. He was promised a path to citizenship. And yet, immediately after his release from prison in January, ICE scooped him up and put on a plane to Venezuela — a country he hasn't seen since he was a toddler and which refused to accept him.


	Now he is stateless, a man with no nation. The United States of America — the same nation he fought and bled for — has denied him the basic dignity of belonging.


	Barco's story is a cautionary tale of abandoning due process. It isn't just about him; his is the story we know of. There are about 40,000 foreign nationals currently serving in the U.S. military. This is about the hundreds of deported veterans now scattered across 40 countries. This is about the failure of a country that thanks you for your service one day and deports you the next. This disregard for service has never been more egregious than under Trump, whose indifference toward the dismantling of the VA — and the callous, senseless firing of thousands of veterans at the hands of Elon Musk and DOGE — is willfully doing more harm to our veterans than any other administration in the modern era. Some are trying to intervene on Barco's behalf, arguing that he should be transferred to a VA facility for medical care, yet nothing has materialized as of today. 


	Barco's story, however flawed he was as a citizen, sheds light on the wider problem with Trump's lawless second term. If Trump can do this to a war hero, he can do it to anyone. He can ignore the Constitution and run again. He can suspend habeas corpus, jail protesters, and detain American citizens. He can pivot hard toward a more fascist and authoritarian America. Republicans in Congress will cheer him on. The mass protests across the country are a powerful start, but they are not enough to ensure America doesn't backslide into the very despotism it was founded to resist.

	Even if Democrats take power in 2026 or 2028, the party seems unwilling to dismantle the system of unlimited money in politics ensuring another Elon Musk can buy influence. Nor, outside a few, are they offering voters something other than “Republicans lite.”

	Cameron Allen is close to the Democratic Party's ideal voter. A millennial lawyer from Kentucky, Allen was part of the wave of energized younger Democrats who sent Andy Beshear to the governor's office in 2018 and mobilized behind Joe Biden's 2020 campaign. Allen detests Donald Trump and opposes the Republican Party's slide into the gutter of authoritarianism. But ask Allen about the Democratic Party and the room temperature drops.


	“Being a Democrat is the most depressing thing in the world,” Allen laments in a phone call. “You wake up thinking the people in charge must either not care at all, or they're so incompetent they don't know how to adjust for the moment. Last year, we talked so much about this being our big fight against authoritarianism. Instead, it feels like we went right back to normal after November.” 


	Allen's grim view of the Democratic leadership is shared by millions of voters across the country. A Quinnipiac survey published on January 29 revealed a Democratic Party more unpopular than at any time in the poll's history. By mid-March, those numbers had collapsed even more, after a national NBC News poll found Democrats at their lowest favorability in history. Only about a quarter of registered voters now say they view Democrats in a favorable light. Yikes.

	











Trump's popularity has plummeted in recent weeks as the cost of his incoherent policies starts to bite into Americans' savings. That might tempt some Democrats to mistake Trump's tanking popularity with a rise in their own support, but nothing could be further from the truth. Democrats can't take Trump's momentary unpopularity as an excuse to avoid being the party their voters want them to be.

	Democrats have struggled with a credibility crisis, of varying degrees, since it became clear that White House officials had misled the party and the American people about former President Joe Biden's fitness for a second term. But that alone didn't slap Democrats with political pariah status. Voters are so frustrated because Democratic leaders — especially Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer — seem to lack the fighting spirit this moment demands.

	“Swing voters swing because they think both parties have something to offer, and they think Democrats are better at checking corporate power and protecting personal rights than Republicans,” says Evan Roth Smith, a pollster and co-founder of consulting firm Slingshot Strategies. “One of the problems the Democratic Party has is swing voters just don't see us as the party they need us to be at this moment, so they have no reason to come back.”

	











	Nowhere is that more clear than in the near-supermajority of Democrats and left-leaning independents who say the Democratic Party is too soft on Republicans. That wasn't always the case: Back in 2017, during Trump's first term, a CNN poll found that 74 percent of Democrats and Dem leaners wanted Congress to engage in bipartisan cooperation. By March 2025, that number had flipped, with 57 percent of respondents saying Democrats should use any means necessary to stop Trump's extreme agenda.


	A big part of that disconnect boils down to personal political strategies. When Schumer bucked House Democratic leadership (and enraged millions of Democratic voters) to provide the crucial votes for the GOP's spending bill last month, averting a government shutdown, he acted based on a set of political rules that have guided his senate career since 1998. 


	Schumer cherishes his political rules, including a die-hard belief that voters reward the party that acts like “the adult in the room,” a strategy Schumer and Democratic leaders argue paid electoral dividends between 2018 and 2022. But the strategy of bipartisan camaraderie with the right has evaporated in the blaze of Trump's extralegal kidnappings, ruinous trade wars, and mass firings of federal employees. In a flash, the same strategy that once seemed mature now looks like dangerous appeasement.

	Some Democrats are done waiting on leadership to understand the new political landscape in which we now live. Progressive politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Gov. Tim Walz are barnstorming the nation to sell a brand of populism that borrows liberally from Trump's throw-the-bums-out rallies. Their message that greedy oligarchs and compromised Republican lawmakers are picking voters' pockets is clearly resonating: Over 30,000 Coloradans turned out for Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez's rally on March 22, the largest crowd of either politician's career. 


	That idea clashes with corporate-aligned centrists who believe the party should adapt to last year's electoral defeat by once again trying to appeal to voters outside the traditional Democratic base — the mythical “persuadable Republican” swing voter that Democrats have spent nearly a generation trying to will into existence. But before Democrats can hope to evangelize to last cycle's new Trump voters, they'll need a base that trusts them. That will take time, and attempting to build a 2026 campaign message without solidifying the base will likely end up as a political trainwreck.

	











	There are also those Old Guard Democrats who view anything Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez touch as fatally tainted by “the left,” and dismiss the current surge in populism as a fad. That's not the case for Rep. Pat Ryan, a 34-year-old New Yorker who made national headlines by focusing populist rhetoric less on broad social issues and more on Americans' worsening financial future. 


	Ryan's “patriotic populism” eschews traditional left-right ideological concerns to drive home an unapologetically anti-elite message that wouldn't necessarily be out of place at a MAGA rally. And Ryan isn't shy about dismissing his party's fixation on progressive politics. “First and foremost, if you're using the words ‘moderate' or ‘progressive,' you're missing the whole f***ing point,” Ryan tweeted last November. “It's not ideological. It's about who fights for the people vs. who further empowers and enables the elites.”


	For Roth Smith, Ryan's message fits into a landscape of voter rage that some Democratic lawmakers have spent months trying to mainstream. Rep. Al Green's viral disruption of Trump's address to Congress last month, over Republicans' proposed cuts to Medicaid, generated immediate headlines and cheers from voters — only to be immediately deflated by Democratic leaders more interested in preserving decorum than in scoring much-needed political points.


	“Rep. Al Green did it exactly right by raising concerns about saving Medicaid, but the decorum issue overtook him, so Democrats didn't get the benefit from that,” Roth Smith says. 


	He sees Trump's current self-inflicted economic crisis as a chance to reset Democrats on a more combative footing: “Schumer needs to exercise power at a moment when the politics are clearly on our side — like right now with the economy. If Schumer's excuse for the government funding vote was that he wanted to wait for the right political moment to attack, he'll need to show that by actually going on the attack. That's what voters want to see.”


	Some Democrats are already getting the message — and enjoying huge boosts in national attention and voter approval. On Monday, Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz added 50 names to his list of holds on Trump administration nominees, bringing the total to more than 300. Sen. Cory Booker basked in the positive glow of his record-setting, 25-hour speech on the Senate floor, which didn't derail any Trump policies but gave weary Democrats an opportunity to rally behind Booker's striking image of vocal resistance. 

	











	Those efforts might seem performative, but that kind of obstructive performance is exactly the kind of action voters have been clamoring for since last year's presidential campaign. It's also a tactic Republicans understand well because they perfected the model. GOP voters have long understood that it feels good to soak your enemies even if those efforts only succeed in delaying inevitable losses. With a party as down-and-out as today's Democrats, those morale-boosting moments matter just as much to voters as tangible victories.


	Despite a bruising loss and the fracturing of the Democratic coalition last year, Democratic leaders still feel they know what voters want better than the voters themselves — so Schumer and others have largely ignored the base's growing calls to embrace the politics of obstruction and frustration. That approach may feel downright Trumpian to Schumer, but a party in such dire straits with its own voters is in no position to ignore them.

	Marginalized and lectured to by a party that can't seem to seal the deal, many previously enthusiastic voters are weighing whether supporting the Democratic Party in its current form is akin to rewarding bad behavior. 


	Allen, the young Kentuckian who seemed like the Democratic Party's future just a few years ago, puts it more directly. “I shouldn't be angrier about the state of our country than the people I elected to protect it,” he tells me. “What kind of system is that?”

T
he What About Bob? production crew were deep in the woods of the tiny Virginia town of Moneta when they heard a frightening sound they couldn't quite identify. They were over three months into shooting the 1991 Bill Murray–Richard Dreyfuss comedy about a mentally ill man who becomes obsessed with his tightly-wound therapist — way past the scheduled completion date — and things had been extremely tense from the beginning. But nothing prepared them for this.


	“It sounded like an animal was being slaughtered,” says set photographer Barry Wetcher. Eventually, Wetcher says, they realized the noise was coming from a man — specifically, the film's director, Frank Oz. A celebrated voice actor on Sesame Street and The Muppets, Oz also had a stellar career as a filmmaker by that point, having directed fan-favorite films such as Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and Little Shop of Horrors. (Following What About Bob?, he would also direct In and Out and Bowfinger, among other films.) But this production clearly was pushing him to his limits. “He wasn't screaming at anyone in particular,” Wetcher says. “He was just screaming.”

	











	The plan for the night was to film the climactic scene where Dr. Leo Marvin (Dreyfuss) takes Bob Wiley (Murray) into the wilderness and straps 20 pounds of explosives to his chest in a last-ditch attempt to finally remove the patient from his life. “Death therapy, Bob,” says a crazed Marvin. “It's the only cure.”

	Things were only slightly less charged when the cameras weren't rolling. Murray and Dreyfuss grew to despise each other as their time in Moneta dragged on, eventually reaching a point where they didn't even communicate when the cameras were off. If this wasn't enough of a headache for Oz, he was fighting his own war with producer Laura Ziskin about nearly every aspect of the movie, including how to end it. On that night in the woods, Oz finally hit his breaking point. 


	“Remember in the old Woody Woodpecker cartoons, where the old thermometer goes up and up and up and up and then explodes?” Oz asks as he munches on oatmeal at an Upper West Side diner late in 2024. “That's what I saw at that moment. And I remember kicking over a garbage can and shouting, ‘Children! Children!' I walked to my trailer and I just couldn't believe what was going on. I was so upset. I remember Richard knocking on my door, and I said, ‘Richard, go away. I don't want to talk to you now. Go away!'”

	Of course, all of this was hidden from the public when the film hit theaters on May 17, 1991. It was the top movie at the box office that weekend, and ultimately grossed $64 million ($150 million in 2025 dollars). “In this splendidly cast film, Murray and Dreyfuss play off each other to their maximum advantage,” wrote Hollywood Reporter critic Duane Byrge. “Murray does what he does best, to shine on and ultimately destroy authority figures, while Dreyfuss‘ portrayal of the runty doctor is splendidly Napoleonic.” 


What About Bob? had a long afterlife on cable and home video, and is generally seen as one of Murray's greatest onscreen achievements, just one notch below Groundhog Day and Rushmore. “Not everything holds up,” Murray told Variety's Rebecca Rubin in January, noting that he'd recently re-watched What About Bob?. “I hadn't seen it for 15 years. I saw it and said, ‘God damn, it was funny.'”


	Murray may be able to look back at the movie and laugh today, but most Nineties cinephiles know the humor came at a considerable cost. Stories have emerged over the years about Murray chucking a glass at Dreyfuss' head, tossing Ziskin into the lake, and causing general mayhem on the set. But most of the participants have stayed silent, and the full story of the production has never come out — until now. Rolling Stone spent the past several months conducting extensive interviews with members of the cast and crew and, with the help of her former assistant Blair Richwood, combing through the archives of Ziskin, who died from breast cancer in 2011.

	While Murray did not respond to interview requests, this story includes detailed accounts from Richard Dreyfuss, Julie Hagerty (who played Leo Marvin's wife, Faye), Charlie Korsmo (the Marvins' son Siggy), Kathryn Erbe (daughter Anna Marvin), director Frank Oz, screenwriter Tom Schulman, casting director Glenn Daniels, and staff photographer Barry Wetcher. It's the story of a painfully funny movie that required a lot of pain to bring to life. 


On Aug. 14, 1983, a new novel named August appeared on the New York Times bestseller list alongside Stephen King's Christine, Nora Ephron's Heartburn, and the illustrated novelization of Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. Written by Judith Rossner, it chronicles a tumultuous, five-year relationship between a disturbed New York teenager named Dawn Henley and her psychoanalyst, Dr. Lulu Shinefield, who has significant psychological issues of her own. Its title refers to the Shinefields' yearly August vacation in the Hamptons, and how Henley deteriorates when her doctor is away. It spent 19 months on the Times bestseller list. 












Two of its readers were screenwriter Alvin Sargent (Julia, Paper Moon, Ordinary People) and producer Laura Ziskin (Eyes of Laura Mars, No Way Out), who felt that August's central idea of a patient cracking up when their therapist goes on vacation would make a funny movie. They wrote up a 14-page treatment in 1987 called What About Bob?, creating characters and a story that, other than its original seed, was completely different from August. It begins with a group of shrinks at a marina talking about the tragedy of Dr. Marvin, a once distinguished colleague who lost his mind when a patient became obsessed with him and his family. The story then unfolds in flashback. 


Sargent and Ziskin wrote out a handful of scenes with bits of dialogue that wound up in the finished movie largely intact (“They can turn a perfectly peaceful household into an insane asylum!”), but it ends with a series of rough thoughts and questions, like, “How does Bob get to stay or does he go?? I think he should stay in the house or move in somehow…How does he drive the Doctor crazy?”


To answer these questions and get their treatment turned into a complete screenplay, Sargent and Ziskin turned to Tom Schulman after falling in love with his spec scripts for the boarding school drama Dead Poets Society and the black comedy Second Sight. Neither movie had been made at that point, and they had no way of knowing Dead Poets Society would become a beloved Robin Williams classic that would earn Schulman a Best Original Screenplay Academy Award. (It hit theaters the same month as Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, based on another Shulman script.) At the time Sargent and Ziskin came to him, he was a relative unknown who loved their idea and desperately wanted to find a way to make it work.


Tom Schulman (Screenwriter): I felt right away that the therapist needed to be at the high point of his career. I figured he had a book coming, was going to be on a show like Good Morning America, and this guy Bob would come into his life and essentially destroy every bit of success he had just had. There needed to be some ego on his behalf to get destroyed.


He had equally vivid ideas about the patient, Bob Wiley, who was named after Wile E. Coyote due to his tenacity and relentless spirit.


Schulman: I felt that Bob needed to be multi-phobic, just have an array of phobias and problems, really unable to even get from his apartment to a shrink's office. I felt like the Marvin character would have another shrink refer Bob to him, a shrink who just wants to get rid of this patient. I thought Marvin ought to have a book with a reasonable idea that seemed like it could help Bob. So [that book], Baby Steps, came to me as that kernel of a thing that Bob would at least at first think, “Oh my God, I'm cured.” But nothing lasts long.

	











Schulman stuck with Ziskin and Sargent's idea of telling the story via flashback.


Schulman: It started with a group of psychiatrists in a boat on Lake Winnipesaukee telling stories of the worst doctor-patient situation they'd ever heard of. One of them says, “You've heard nothing until you heard about what Leo Marvin had to deal with.” Another one says, “That was his house over there. There's just the chimney, the whole house is gone.” The story launches from there.


In his original draft, the first thing we learn about Bob Wiley is that he compulsively swallows toothbrushes. “In three excruciating swallows, like a mouse going down the throat of a snake, the toothbrush disappears down his throat,” he wrote. “Bob pounds his chest, swallowing as he does. Then, delicately, he belches. He takes a deep breath, relaxes somewhat, and opens the medicine cabinet. There sit ten packaged toothbrushes. Bob opens one.” This idea was ultimately discarded after much fiery debate on the set (more on that later), but Schulman also came up with a simple idea for Bob that wound up driving much of the story.


Schulman: I realized that the most important thing for him to do would be to constantly interpret all of Marvin's efforts to get rid of him as forms of therapy. There was no hope for Marvin in that sense.


He also realized he had to find a way to make the audience root for Bob and against Marvin, even though what Bob is doing — stalking his therapist and his family on vacation — is wildly inappropriate and could be the plot of a horror movie if presented differently.


Schulman: Marvin has to be an egomaniac, so that we are really rooting for him to be taken down a notch. And Bob has to be sympathetic, just needy in a way that makes us want someone to help him.


After selling the movie to Disney's Touchstone Pictures, the search started for a director. Notes from Laura Ziskin's archives reveal they considered Milos Forman, Steve Kloves, Arthur Hiller, Danny DeVito, and Carl Reiner before settling on Frank Oz. Despite being best known for voicing Yoda, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, and Cookie Monster and his pioneering puppetry work with Jim Henson, Oz was also a successful director. He was on a hot streak in the late Eighties after helming The Muppets Take Manhattan, Little Shop of Horrors, and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.


Frank Oz (Director): I remember it starting with [Disney CEO] Jeffrey Katzenberg calling me to ask if I was interested. This was after Dirty Rotten Scoundrels came out, and around the time Jim [Henson] died. And I would get a lot of scripts, mostly comedies, from my agents. This was one of the scripts that I felt I could do something with, because, from my viewpoint, I feel like comedy is often pushed too hard. I felt the script needed grounding, and I like doing that.

	











Bill Murray was everyone's first thought to play Bob Wiley. But his last two movies were the blockbusters Scrooged and Ghostbusters II, and he was an extremely hot commodity. 


Schulman: Alvin, Laura, and I pretty much insisted that they go out to Bill first. There was nobody else in my mind who would have worked. And Bill said yes. But then Bill and the studio got locked in a battle over his fees, which went on for maybe six or eight months. They went back and forth, getting closer and closer, but then reaching a place where they were just deadlocked. And then the studio started coming up with other options.


One name they tossed around was Robin Williams.


Glenn Daniels (Casting Director): Robin Williams could have worked in anything because he was brilliant.


Oz: I think that Bill was the best choice, but I could have worked with Robin Williams. I could imagine a version of the movie with Robin Williams in my brain.


Richard Dreyfuss (Leo Marvin): It doesn't seem like Robin would have done that. I don't know. It seems too easy for him.


It became a moot point once Murray and Disney struck a deal. Finding the right Dr. Marvin, however, took a bit more thought. Ziskin's notes show that both Jack Nicholson and Michael Caine were considered at one point.


Schulman: We talked about Alan Arkin at one time, who I thought would've been great. I also vaguely recall Woody Allen's name coming up for Dr. Marvin, but I thought it would be a bad idea. Woody was essentially a very likable guy. And yes, he's associated with psychiatry because of all his neuroses, but it still felt wrong.


Charlie Korsmo (Siggy Marvin): I think the tone would've been totally wrong if they cast Woody Allen. He could do miffs, not volcanic.


Oz: I remember being in the Four Seasons, and I auditioned several people for Dr. Marvin. I also remember speaking to Bob Newhart and Richard Benjamin for the part.


Daniels: I don't see Bob Newhart and Bill Murray as having enough friction between them. I don't see them as that far apart from each other.


Dreyfuss: I wouldn't have been surprised if they'd used Bob Newhart, but I'm better.


Daniels: Richard Dreyfuss was very well-respected at the time. He was an Oscar winner [for 1977's The Goodbye Girl], and it was interesting to cast him in a comedic role, because he usually did drama.


Oz: I'd never worked with Richard before. It was Jeffery [Katzenberg], I think, who wanted Richard. So I met Richard and we talked about it. I found him to be brilliant. He felt that in the original script, Marvin was made a fool too often, and he was right.

	











Finding the right actress to play Leo's wife, Faye, also took a bit of work.


Daniels: A lot of women who came in who were hot at the time. The first one that comes to my mind is Anne Archer, and she had just come off of Fatal Attraction. She came in and she was completely unfunny. So we realized that we needed somebody who was really good at comedy, but wasn't going to steal the screen from Bill or Richard and also be believable as the mother, et cetera, et cetera. And we settled on Julie Hagerty pretty soon. Frank and Laura and myself discussed it, and we were all big fans of hers. She is like Diane Keaton in that she comes with her own neuroses that usually works.


Julie Hagerty (Faye Marvin): I remember Frank Oz asking me to come audition in an empty theater where I read with Bill and Richard. I was really nervous at first, but then we started playing and it was fun. 


Oz: I tend to work collaboratively. I wanted to figure out who Bill and Richard liked, since they'd have to work with them. I was trying to decide between Julie and somebody else, and Richard kept telling me that Julie was fantastic. That put me over the line. 


Glenn Daniels read with many young actresses for the part of Anna Marvin, Faye and Marvin's teenage daughter.


Daniels: One of them was a young lady named Gwyneth Paltrow. She was brought into my office by Boaty Boatwright, who was a talent agent for many, many years. She came to prominence for casting [Mary Badham as] Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird. And she showed up at my office with Gwyneth without even a phone call. She just said, “Read her.” Gwyneth hadn't done anything at that point. Nothing. And as Boaty and I were talking, she just looked like a deer in headlights. I had no idea what she was doing there. But anyway, I read her and she wasn't funny, and it was a comedy. I had to tell Boaty it wasn't going to work. I wound up talking to maybe a hundred girls, and nobody seemed to fit in. And then my assistant said to me, “What about Kathryn Erbe?” And I said, “Well, I don't know who she is. Have her come in.'”


Kathryn Erbe (Anna Marvin): I auditioned for it at two different points. The first came when I was still an undergrad drama major at NYU. And then I graduated, went to L.A. for a sitcom [Chicken Soup starring Jackie Mason and Lynn Redgrave], that only ran 12 episodes. When they called me back for a second audition, I was doing Grapes of Wrath on Broadway. I thought [the part] had gone away at this point, but I remember riding my bike over there and seeing them all. And I got it.

	











Child actor Charlie Korsmo was given a three-picture deal with Disney after his breakthrough role as the Kid in Warren Beatty's Dick Tracy. It meant he didn't have a choice when the studio told him he had the role of Siggy Marvin.


Korsmo: James Cameron had just offered me the role of John Connor in Terminator 2. But Disney exercised their option and I had to do What About Bob? instead. The first time I heard about the movie is when I was told I couldn't do Terminator 2, but possibly could if they finished the movie just on time. But we ran a month and a half over. I loved Terminator, so I was pissed from day one. I just wanted to get out of there so badly to do T2 instead.


The remote Virginia town of Moneta was home to a mere 236 people when the What About Bob? cast and crew arrived in the summer of 1990 after filming for a few days in New York City. The scenes take place in Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire, which is 750 miles to the north, but few viewers would notice the difference. 


Erbe: It was a tiny, tiny, tiny town. We spent most of our time on this beautiful property on Smith Mountain Lake that had lots of different sized and shaped condos. No one was there, because it was the end of summer into fall. And so we all had our own apartments. Mine was bigger than my one back home in New York City, and it had a balcony looking onto the water. Bill had a great big one, and he had a boat. He took us waterskiing. We went waterskiing to the full moon at night once.


Dreyfuss: We were right at the water's edge. We loved being there. 


Barry Wetcher (Set Photographer):  It wasn't like when you're shooting in Philadelphia and you can go out to dinner in a great restaurant. We were all pretty much prisoners, so to speak. If I recall correctly, it was the moonshine capital of the U.S., because it was a dry county, meaning they can't sell alcohol. And we all had houses around the lake. Bill would often throw a party on Friday or Saturday nights, and he would somehow get us alcohol. Those parties are my most pronounced memories of that movie. We also had great tennis tournaments. 


Hagerty: There was one little place to eat if you left the community, then you were still in the middle of nowhere.


Erbe: I spent a lot of time with Julie and her dog, Raisin. We smoked and drank and shopped and ate, and we went horseback riding. We found this place that would take us on trail rides. We did that by the moonlight, too, and went and had a campfire dinner with a can of beans and the fire. It was awesome. We drank moonshine. It really was so fun, and we weren't working as much as all those guys were.

	











Korsmo: Julie and Katy Erbe weren't actually that far apart in age. Julie Hagerty always plays these sweet fragile women, but she's kind of a brassy lady in real life. So they were always hanging around and smoking together even though they were playing a very prim and proper mother and daughter. They seemed like biker girls.


Erbe: We'd be at the one bar/restaurant, and Charlie would be there doing his homework. That's probably where he was seeing me and Julie smoke. He just was a lovely kid, such a lovely kid. His humor was very dry and very funny.  He was always studying. He had to continue his schoolwork when we'd be off at night. I remember wishing that he could come have more fun with us.


Hagerty: Charlie was going from movie to movie at the time, and he wanted a dog really bad. He would come into my camper when we were working and play with my dog, Raisin, and we would make frozen pizza rolls for lunch.


Everyone had memories of fun (or just plain weird) interactions with Bill Murray. One example: On Oct. 4, 1990, MC Hammer — then at the peak of his fame — played a show 40 minutes away from set in Roanoke, Virginia. According to Wetcher, Murray rented a bus and took the crew.


Wetcher: I remember Bill got up on stage and was rapping with Hammer. It was fun.


Daniels: Bill used to call me “Mr. White,” and to this day I have no idea why. During the shooting of the movie, he used to call me at my New York apartment at 3 a.m. He'd go, “But Mr. White, listen…” And he wanted me to meet some person, usually a young lady the next day in my office for some role that didn't exist. I guess he was flexing his muscles or trying to impress them. But I got at least a half a dozen of those calls during the time I was on the film.


Erbe: One day, we were shooting the scene at the general store in Moneta, and they had to stop traffic on this two-lane road. A camper pulled up, and the family inside saw Bill Murray. They went, “Hey, Bill!” And he walked over, opened the door, got in, and he left with them. It took a long time to get him back.


Korsmo: The two people that people ask me most about are him and Robin Williams, who I worked with on Hook.  And they're exactly the opposite. Robin Williams in real life, at least post-cocaine and everything, was nothing like the manic wild man he played onscreen. He was this quiet, reserved, introverted, very gentle guy. And Bill Murray acts like he's onscreen all the time. I don't know if he's putting on a show or not, but if he is, he's putting it on all the time.

	











Erbe: Julie and Bill and I went into Roanoke one weekend day — and I knew he was a big star, of course, and was a huge fan of his work, but didn't fully appreciate how beloved he is by the people. And they literally carried him away. We lost track of him and just went on with our day. He just got carried away by the crowd of people.


Korsmo: I remember sitting in my trailer when we came back to do reshoots. I see him walking across the field. He sees me from a hundred yards away and he doesn't say anything. He just starts walking towards me. And when he gets to my trailer, he punches the screen out. He sticks in his hand and goes, “Korsmo, good to see you.” And then he walks away. That's the kind of thing he would do in Stripes or something, but that's what he does in real life, too.


Dreyfuss, meanwhile, had his own eccentricities, particularly when it came to his love of the Civil War.


Korsmo: He's a real history buff, and I was also very interested in the Civil War at the time. But he's like a Civil War reenactor, and I think he was skeptical of me. One of the first times we talked about it, he just asked me to name three generals. He was testing whether I knew anyone other than Lee and Grant, I guess. I think I went with [William] Rosecrans just to let him know I'm on his wavelength. I think he took me more seriously after that.


Oz: On [Richard's] birthday, Laura arranged for maybe a dozen Civil War reenactors to come galloping onto the set. 


Hagerty: It was a total surprise to him. 


Dreyfuss: The day before that, I marched with the Southern contingent at the recreation of the Battle of Cedar Creek. It was a great honor. 




They arrived on the set without a script anyone loved.


Oz: Everybody had their own idea about what the script should be. It felt like there was my version, there was Laura's version, there was Richard's version, there was the Disney rep version. I felt I was cobbling together different versions to shoot every day.


Schulman: I liked the whimsy of opening the movie with Bob swallowing a toothbrush.

	











Oz: Is that grounded? No. That is dishonest, unless you create a world in which people can eat things like glass or toothbrushes. But that's not the world of this movie. The world created was a believable world. I like my movies to be grounded, and trust that it'll be funny because of the actors.


Oz also dumped the entire framing device where the story was told in flashback, along with early scenes that would introduce Bob's inattentive mother and flaky, Neil Diamond-obsessed ex-wife, who Schulman had included to convey how desperately Bob needed a family that cared about him. A tiny wink to the toothbrush bit remains, where Bob borrows Leo's toothbrush and never returns it.


Schulman: It turns out, that old adage “less is more” is true. Just by the way Bob reacts to seeing the pictures of Marvin's family on his wall gives you that sense of what he needs. And then he's constantly like, “Aw, the fam.”


Oz: Every decision I make has to grow from how I see the whole movie. It is almost like sculpting an elephant, where you remove all those things that don't look like an elephant. At one point, I remember saying to Bil and Richard, “If we weren't all such big fuckin' stars and big-time people supposedly, we would do what students do and just go page by page and order room service and work on it all day.” And that's what we did. We went page by page all together.


They still left a lot of room for improv, most notably during the family dinner scene where Bob orgasmically moans over the food before performing the Heimlich maneuver on Dr. Marvin. 


Oz: The dinner scene is one of my favorites. That's because you don't hire Bill Murray to read lines. You hire Bill Murray because of Bill Murray. He's brilliant. So you just let him fly. So all that moaning was from Billy. It wasn't written. 


Korsmo: They just rolled film for two hours, as I recall. And that was entirely improvised. There was a lot of material they could have used, and it was funny throughout. I'm not sure how they picked “pile it high and deep” and “is this corn hand-shucked?” 


Erbe: Because our characters love Bob, Charlie and I were able to laugh. Richard wasn't allowed to. It created a nice tension. 


Korsmo: The dialogue in that scene is almost entirely Julie and Bill. The two kids are just sitting there reacting to it, and Richard Dreyfuss is just sitting there seething. But they literally went on for two hours doing that scene, and every time they'd swap out film, everyone would break out laughing.

	











After the meal, Bob, Faye, Anna, and Siggy joyfully wash dishes while singing “Singin' in the Rain.” Leo watches, simmering with rage.


Hagerty: We just started throwing the dishes around, and I can't believe that none of us dropped one. It was so fun. We were throwing them and catching them, and Frank let us do that. He knew what he could get, and the fact that he got it from all of the performances, he's a wonderful director of letting you play.


Oz: The process was not tightly directed. It was all of us playing around. With Bill, everything was improv. We established this when we worked together on Little Shop of Horrors. Billy just improv'd that whole scene, and that was the agreement we had, that he didn't have to stick to lines. I didn't want him to. 


The scene where Bob is tied to the mast while sailing with Anna and her friends was also largely improvised.


Oz: It was Bill's idea to just keep saying, “I'm sailing. Sailing!” I'm not sure if the “ahoy” was scripted or not.


Erbe: That was a really long day. At one point, Bill started singing “Brandy (You're a Fine Girl).” It was hilarious.


For the scenes where Bob spends the night with the Marvins before the Good Morning America shoot, Murray and Korsmo were given permission to lob whatever insults they felt like while jumping up and down on their beds.


Korsmo: I remember Bill getting very sweaty when we did that. They gave us some things they wanted to make sure we said. And then we just spent 45 minutes yelling the dumbest things we could come up with at each other.


As Dr. Marvin correctly surmised after their one and only proper therapy session, Bob has an “extreme need for family connections.” He gradually heals as the Marvin family embraces him. Dr. Marvin, meanwhile, grows increasingly unhinged by Bob's constant presence.


Oz: The idea was as Billy gets healthier, Dr. Marvin gets crazier. But we shot the movie out of order. And so I had to chart Dr. Marvin's craziness. So, for instance, if he starts at zero in the beginning and he ends up 100 percent crazy at the end, then I had to go through each scene. I'd say, “In this scene, he's five percent more crazy,” and then 10 percent more crazy and 15 percent more crazy and 20 percent, 30 percent. 


Dreyfuss: I don't think Bob is ever sane, though. He is insane from the beginning to the end.


Oz: It's weird that Richard thinks that. Because if that's the case, there'd be no satisfaction from the audience. I find that odd.

	











After the disastrous Good Morning America interview, Leo finally throws Bob out of the house. The kids are confused and ask him why he did it. “You think he's gone?” Leo roars. “You think he's gone?! That's the whole point. He's never gone!”


Oz: Richard was fucking brilliant that scene. He was insanely brilliant.


Erbe: There was just a lot of room for Bill to improvise when Richard would open the door and see him, and he would say a different thing every single time, and none of it was scripted.


When Leo realizes that Bob won't leave unless he's somehow restrained, he commits him to an insane asylum. But Bob is released within hours after he charms the staff. During their drive back to the house, Leo slams on the brakes. His line in the script simply reads, “Get out of the car.”


Dreyfuss: I didn't say, “Get out the car.” I said, “GETOUTOFTHECAR!!” [as one long, slurred syllable of uncontrolled rage]. I didn't have to think. I just did it. 


The hilarity of that moment embodies the great work Dreyfuss did throughout the entire shoot.


Korsmo: I think he's the funniest part of the movie. Dr. Marvin is this petty little man who is sitting on a volcano of anxiety and anger, which is naturally funny to me. Maybe I relate to it more later in life.


Hagerty: I don't think anybody else could have done that besides Richard Dreyfuss. He was so genius in that part.


Oz: Richard was fabulous. He was essentially the straight man to Bill in the movie, and the straight man doesn't get the credit. It's not fair.


Dreyfuss: I don't have the slightest idea how I created that character. Any time anyone has ever asked me why I did such and such in building a character, I always say, “I don't know.” And I don't know. I just do what I do, and you either get it or you don't. I thought What About Bob? was, as written, very funny. And so I just did it.


But Oz's warm feelings toward his cast were apparently not entirely mutual.


Dreyfuss: I went out to dinner once with one of the crew, and I said, “What do you think of Frank Oz as a director?” And he said, “Hmmmmm.” I didn't think that he thought very much of Frank. And the other person said, “Master close-up/master close-up over the shoulder…Master close-up/Master close-up over the shoulder… A monkey could direct that way.” So, they didn't think very much of him. I thought that he actually could direct if he bothered to direct, but he didn't really do that. He refused to give me any direction.


Hearing this read back to him, Oz breaks out in uncontrollable laughter.












Oz: That's great, hysterical! That's how he saw it. That's all there is to it. Look, every set has a culture and a dynamic of its own, and there I have had difficulties. Those bad situations are cracking me up because they show our frailty as human beings and our imperfections… the egos and the fears, the insecurities when you get in a crucible that's so pressurized. Making a movie like this, we're talking about millions and millions and millions of dollars. We're talking about stars believing that it better work, because the next paycheck won't be good if it doesn't. Richard Dreyfuss was not trying to be bad. Everybody believes they're doing the best thing for the movie and they're trying their very best. That doesn't mean that what they're doing is the best for the movie, but they honestly believe it.


Laura Ziskin and Alvin Sargent's original story treatment from 1987 had Dr. Marvin suffering a complete breakdown at the end, and Bob, 100 percent healed, becoming Leo's therapist. “Remembert, one day at a time,” Bob tells him. “One step at a time. Baby steps. Little baby steps.” The final scene is the group of shrinks from the beginning marveling at the crazy saga while riding in a boat together. 


Tom Schulman's 1990 script changed the plot so that Dr. Marvin loses his medical license after trying to murder Bob, and is institutionalized. Upon his release, he learns that Bob and the Marvin family have rented a lakeside cottage together. Bob is now a forever part of Leo's life. Leo silently watches Bob and his family play volleyball together. “A zombie would seem more alive [than Leo],” Schulman wrote. It also ends with the doctors on the boat. “Wait a minute,” one of them says. “You're not telling me that Bob Wiley is Dr. Robert S. Wiley, the psychologist?!”


These endings left nobody completely satisfied, creating conflict that lasted throughout the entire shoot. A tense meeting between Schulman and Murray before cameras started rolling portended many difficult days to come. 


Schulman: The day before we were supposed to leave for the set, I met up with Richard and Bill in Bill's hotel room. Bill turned to me and said, “Where's that ending you're supposed to be working on?” And I said, “It's up in my room.” And he said, “Well, why isn't it in here?” And I said, “Because it's up in my room.” He said, “Well, go get it.” And I said, “OK.” When I got there, I got a call from the studio saying, “Bill doesn't want you on the set.” I was like, ‘What?” I tried to talk to him about it, but never heard back. And so I never stepped foot on the set.


Hagerty: I remember at one time having five different scripts in my house. There were different writers and different endings. There were a lot of different opinions.

	











Schulman: They called in Elaine May at one point. She had this idea that when Bob comes out of that burning house, Marvin looks at him and goes, “Oh, my God, you're alive. Thank God you're alive,” and hugs him. And then you would cut to the next summer, and Bob and Marvin and their family would be in a little boat on the lake, talking about last summer and what a disaster it could have been, but things all worked out…This is what Disney wanted, a happy ending.


Oz: That ending would have made me vomit. Happy endings make me vomit anyway. I don't think it's about happy endings. I think it's about satisfying endings. The protagonist can die, not so happy. But if he dies for a greater cause, that can be satisfying. I think “happy” is a misnomer.


Schulman: Disney said to me, “Will you write that happy ending [where Leo forgives Bob and they become friends]?” And I said, “No. Absolutely not, because it doesn't work. You haven't laid the [groundwork] for this. You haven't set up anything earlier in the movie that's going to make this work. It's going to be a disaster.” So they said, “Well, that's what we're going to do.” 


Dreyfuss: That ending would have been crap. Anyone who would have said that in front of me would have received a, “Crap.”


Korsmo: [That ending] just negates everything that came before, basically.


Oz: Nobody was ever happy with the ending, none of us. So it got to the point where we had one terrible night where everybody met for the ending, and it was an explosive night. From that moment on, I had to shoot two endings. We shot my version, which Bill agreed with, though I can't remember the details. And we shot Laura's version, which Richard agreed with. One of them was the ending on the boats. 


Schulman: We showed both endings to a test audience. I snuck down to the front of the theater at the end of the movie and looked back. Couples were looking at each other going, “What the hell happened?” It was like looking at people watching Springtime for Hitler. They just didn't work. 


Oz: Both endings were scrapped, and we finally just punted and reshot the ending in California.


They settled on an ending where Leo was indeed committed to an insane asylum, but leaves in a near-catatonic state to attend a wedding between Bob and Leo's sister, Lily. At the end, Leo awakes from his stupor to voice his objections. “Dad's back!” Siggy exclaims. Title cards reveal that Bob went back to school to become a therapist. He wrote a bestseller called Death Therapy. Leo sued him over the rights.












Korsmo: They toyed with the idea of having Richard Dreyfuss in a Hannibal Lecter-like bite mask, with the bars over his mouth. But they decided that was too dark, I guess. And they kept pushing people to give more broad performances. At the end, I  jump up and yell, “Dad's back!” And [Oz] kept wanting that to be bigger and bigger. It's the last thing anybody says in the movie, but I eventually sarcastically did a take, “Dad's back!” And that's the one they used.


Oz: This was another version of Laura's ending. I felt, and I still do, that the ending's too cartoonish. It's not true to the world which the characters inhabit. All of the sudden, Marvin wakes up and it just seems…It just didn't feel honest to me. It didn't feel honest to the world which the characters inhabited. 


Korsmo: The final ending's not a dark or sad ending, but it's consistent with everything that came before. It's not, “Suddenly we've all accepted this. Ha, ha, ha. Wasn't I a fool?” It's still Bob intruding on Leo's life and ruining it, basically.


The most well-known aspect of the What About Bob? production is the notorious feud between Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss. But in reality, it wasn't just a battle between the two stars. It was actually a multifront war that placed Frank Oz and Bill Murray on one side, and Richard Dreyfuss and Laura Ziskin on another. The roots of the Murray-Dreyfuss feud, unbelievably, go all the way back to the May 13, 1978, episode of Saturday Night Live, which Dreyfuss hosted just weeks after winning a Best Actor Oscar for The Goodbye Girl. Murray was in the SNL cast at the time.

Replying to @kq0717  s3e19 5/13/78 Host Richard Dreyfuss  #snlclassic #snl #saturdaynightlive 


Dreyfuss: I recognized back then that he didn't seem to like me, but he didn't seem to like anybody. I saw him interact with the other Saturday Night Live cast members… but that was none of my business. Bill had this really sarcastic attitude. He was sarcastic to everybody. 


Erbe: Bill and Richard have two distinct personalities with two different styles of work and two different styles of comedy. 


Hagerty: Whatever the underbelly of [the feud] was, it all worked. Whatever happened worked on the screen. It's just life. I mean, not everybody gets along, but when you come to work, you come to work and do your job. 


Korsmo: I heard there was a lot of tension going with producers and the rest of the creative team, particularly Laura with the director. And I guess there was also a lot of tension between Richard and Bill. That I did not know at the time. Everyone was fairly protective of me.


Wetcher: Bill was fun. He could be difficult — not for me, not for the crew per se. He's really kind of a crew person. 


Erbe: Bill brought a boombox to the house set. And he'd play music in between setups, which was really good for morale, just keeping everybody up.

	











Daniels: Apparently Laura made the decision that they were going to work on Columbus Day, and Bill didn't want to work on Columbus Day.


Wetcher: Bill said [the request] was for the crew. And I remember the AD [assistant director], Jimmy Skotchdopole, came back onto set and said, “Disney said no.”


Dreyfuss: I walked in and said to Laura, “What's going on?” And she looked up at me and she said, “Hold me.” So  I put my arms around her. Bill had gone to her about the day off, she had said no, he had said, “Please.” And then she said, “I don't want to ask them for something I know that we won't get.” And so she said, “I'll ask. I won't get it, but I'll ask.” And she came up to him a few minutes later and said, “You're not going to get it.” Bill said, “We don't know that.” And he reached up and he took her glasses, the ones that she was wearing on her nose. And he said, “You don't know that.” And he tore her glasses off her face and crushed them into separate parts and threw them into her face, which I thought was pretty wacky.


Korsmo: I remember hearing he broke her glasses. 


Oz: I thought at the time he crushed her glasses for personal reasons, but it makes sense to hear it was for the crew. He really cared about the crew.


At another point, cast and crew confirm, Murray threw Laura into the lake.


Erbe: I just remember Laura ending up in the water.


Wetcher: He picked her up and took her along the dock, which was by the house we were shooting. And I just remember he threw her in the lake. I don't really remember why he did that. I didn't think it was mean-spirited.


Korsmo: That was, I guess, supposed to be funny, but I don't think she thought it was funny.


Oz: It was couched in the celebration of her birthday, but she didn't appreciate it. 


Schulman: Laura was a wonderful person. In the world of Hollywood, she was a force of nature. She willed every movie that she did into existence. 


Erbe: I just loved her. She was so alive and vibrant and enthusiastic and such a supporter of me. 


Dreyfuss: She was powerful. That's what I remember.


Hagerty: She was a powerhouse. She was on the set every day, and a woman producer of a big movie. I'm sad she's not here on the earth anymore.


Korsmo: She was pretty inclusive and respectful even though I was only 11 years old. But at the same time, I knew she was not beloved on the set. Tension followed her everywhere she went.  


Oz: I wanted to make the best movie possible. But I think she saw things maybe that I didn't see, [and] vice versa.

	











Korsmo: I think she had in mind a sort of darker, more neurotic, New York therapy comedy kind of thing. And she was pretty insistent on it, even though I don't think that was anyone else's view of the movie at that point, besides maybe mine.


Wetcher: There seemed to be two camps, so to speak, where it was Bill and Frank versus Laura and Richard. It seemed like Laura and Richard were on the same page about the script, and Bill and Frank were on another page, and that accounted for a lot of tension.


Oz: The tensions were so crazy, and there were different camps. But I don't deal with camps. I don't like that on my set. 


Everything came to a boil after they made the decision to film the two completely separate endings, tacking weeks onto the shoot. By this point, summer was turning into fall and temperatures were plunging.


Erbe: The leaves were turning, and they had to paint them green. We had layers and layers of long underwear underneath our clothes, and we were putting ice cubes in our mouths so we didn't have fog coming out of our mouths when we talked.


Oz: It was supposed to be summertime and here was Thanksgiving coming. 


Wetcher: We all heard about a script meeting where Bill threw a glass at Richard.


Oz: What happened that night is etched into my memory. I got in a room with Bill and Richard to try and solve a script problem. We had several drafts that various people liked. Bill left the room and came back about 20 minutes later. Bill said something, I'm not sure what it was, but he was obviously in a dark mood. And Richard said, “Is that Bill talking or is that Bob Wiley talking?” And I remember Bill grabbing a glass and saying, “This is Bill talking.” And he heaved the glass about 10 feet up in the air against a huge high fireplace and glass scattered all over the room. And I remember Richard going, “Whoa,” and standing up and leaving.


Murray confirmed the incident in a recent interview with The New York Times, stating: “I did fire a glass, but I threw it at the ceiling. We were in a townhouse on the set of What About Bob? and I did not fire it at anyone. I threw it up in a far corner of the townhouse, assuming it might break upon contact with the ceiling and the walls, but I didn't throw it at anyone. If I'd thrown it at Dreyfuss, I'd have hit him.”


Dreyfuss: Talking about [the glass incident] is childish. And I'm an adult, so I stopped talking about it. You're the first person I've talked to about it for years. And I don't like me talking about it.  The fact was, we made a very funny movie, and that was more important than not liking one another.

	











Oz: One night, maybe a week later after he threw the glass, Bill was concerned that Richard was screwing with him. It got really bad.


They were filming the “death therapy” sequence in the woods, where Leo straps explosives to Bob and tries to murder him.


Oz: Laura came to me and said that Richard thinks I'm spending more time on Bill's ending. I'm not sure if that was the words, but that was the intent. She was attacking my integrity, and I don't allow that, because I was doing my very best. Even though I disagreed with the ending, I was doing my very best. And I totally fuckin' lost it.


After screaming like a wild animal in the woods, Oz called his lawyer at 2 a.m. and said he could no longer work with Laura.


Oz: I said, “This is ridiculous. I can't do it.” And Laura was… Rest in peace. Laura was wonderful. When she was on your side, she was ferociously on your side. But when she's not on your side, she was ferocious in another way. It was not good. It got to the point where it was her or me. I said, “I'm not going back to the set if she's there.” And so, she had to leave. I'm sure she'd have her own version of all this, and it's really not fair since she's not here to defend herself. She might have a whole different view of me and that might be justified. I don't know. But we had a dinner break around 2 a.m. that night. Laura came to me with her teeth gritted and said, “Well, good luck to you.” 


There have been rumors that Dreyfuss was “barely” willing to speak to Oz after he forced Ziskin off the set. He slightly disputes that notion. 


Dreyfuss: You should take out the word “barely.” We weren't talking. That's it. 


Wetcher: They only communicated to each other through AD Jimmy Skotchdopole. It got really ugly.


Oz: We still had to finish the scene that night. We were outside in the forest. I was in my director's chair. I said to Jimmy, “Give me a flag over here and a flag over there and flag over here. And I boxed myself in so I wouldn't be seen. And I said, “Jimmy, I'm going to give you instructions to tell Richard. OK? And I'm not going to talk to Richard.”


Schulman: From what I heard, Bill and Richard never spoke again after the glass incident besides as their characters. But it really worked well onscreen since there was so much hostility.

	











Oz: Unfortunately, I agree. Not unlike Dr. Marvin and Bob, the personalities of Richard and Bill also need each other in that Richard is more structured and Billy is more lax. That conflict which is the essence of drama also was there for comedy. So that enhanced it.


Dreyfuss: I don't think it helped the end result. Nope. It was childish.


Wetcher: Bill and Richard, aside from whatever personal shit was going on between them, they pulled it off. They pulled it off.


Oz: Two days or so before we wrapped, we were shooting Dr. Marvin's office since we filmed the movie out of order. And I remember sitting there between takes, and after all this hell we gone through, Billy says, “Frank, wouldn't it be amazing if this movie turned out to be good?” It just cracked me up so much.


Dreyfuss: I think it's like that Cary Grant and Frank Capra movie, Arsenic and Old Lace. They really didn't get along during the shoot. I don't know why. I don't know anything about it, but I know that they didn't get along. And it's hysterical.


Ziskin became a Hollywood powerhouse in the years that followed, producing giant hits like As Good As It Gets and the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man trilogy. She married her What About Bob? writing partner Alvin Sargent in 2010, one year before she died from breast cancer. When digging through her archives recently, Ziskin's former assistant, Blair Richwood, found a letter Ziskin wrote to Frank Oz shortly after he kicked her off the set. The letter cc'd Jeffrey Katzenberg, and film executives Donald DeLine and David Hoberman, but Oz has no memory of ever receiving it. Rolling Stone has been given permission to run it in full so that Ziskin's voice can be a part of this story.


	Frank:


	I'm told you are in distress over what occurred Friday night. For the record, let me give you my point of view about what happened.


	I supported you strongly and vocally in the meeting with Richard last Sunday —  because I would do that in any event and because I agree with “your” version of the ending.

	











	I agreed with [co-producer] Bernie [Williams] at 5 a.m.. and after the incident with Bill, that we had no choice but to shoot two versions if we wanted to get on with things. I was disappointed that you subsequently re-wrote the version you had fought for so hard on Sunday, but that was your choice and I still feel structurally that it is probably better than the so-called A version. You called me to the set Friday night to tell me there was a lot of tension between Bill and Richard. I advised you to just have Richard do the speech both ways and to downplay characterizing things as Version A and Version B. After you decided not to to shoot the speech 2 ways, and even though you said you could just cut out of it, Richard came to me, upset, feeling that he had been “shined on” to some degree. In retrospect I think he just needed to blow off steam. But the actor came to the producer and expressed some feelings; you had already told me there was a lot of tension and I felt you should probably have the information you as the director would be aware of the actor's state of mind — since you all have to keep working together and hopefully successfully. I did not do anything to deserve your “response,” but I know how pressured you feel and everybody loses control on occasion.


	It's unfortunate for everyone that you are unable to speak to me about what happened, about the movie, etc.


	I am not “against” you — I am for you and for our film. We have certainly had our disagreements — and I'm sure you recognize that the resolution of all those disagreements has often resulted in better work for the picture.


	I'm told that you feel I have been crawling all over you. I made a conscious effort to stay off the set as much as possible last week. I'm sure you are aware that other than suggesting the line about “He left. You mean he was leaving,” I did not try to comment on the ending unless you asked my opinion. On Friday, I came to the set because you called me there.


	Be that as it may.  For your sake and mine, I wish you only the best in completing the film. I look forward to seeing it cut together.


	Regards,


Oz: Wow. I can understand her point of view. Although, in the letter, she is missing some of her behavior that was not kind to me and was detrimental to the movie. But we all have our own memories.




When shooting finally ended in the fall of 1990, the cast and crew all went their separate ways. Most of them haven't spoken to each other in decades.


Hagerty: You don't always keep up with everybody because everybody comes together and then everybody goes off and has their life. It's sort of a mystical, magical kind of work when you come and go out of people's [lives], like we're gypsies. God, I haven't seen Katie in forever and ever. Please tell her I said hello.


Erbe: That's really good to hear. I'll try to reach her.

	











Korsmo: I don't keep in touch with anybody. And it's partly my fault. Frankly, Robin [Williams] did more to stay in touch with me after Hook than I didn't stay in touch with him, which was foolish of me, because he was a very good man, and I wish I'd reached out to him more over the years.


Korsmo largely retired from acting after What About Bob?, though he did appear in the 1998 Jennifer Love Hewitt movie Can't Hardly Wait. By that point, he was a student at MIT. He attended Yale Law School afterward, joined the Federalist Society, and is currently a professor of corporate law and corporate finance at the Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Cleveland. He's still a little pissed about missing out on the chance to star in Terminator 2: Judgement Day. 


Korsmo: I joke that of course after working with me on T2, obviously James Cameron would've cast me in Titanic, too. Leonardo DiCaprio would be teaching law in Cleveland right now.


Oz: I last saw Bill when he auditioned for Indian in the Cupboard. He really wanted that role. I was very grateful he was willing to audition. It's not that he wasn't great. He just wasn't who I saw. There's so many talented, brilliant actors who I had to say, “No, it's not going to work,” just because it wasn't who I saw, the character as I saw it. We haven't spoken since. As a matter of fact, I got an award at Disney last summer and there was a video segment where Steve Martin, Robert De Niro, and Bill said nice things about me. I sent Bob a thank you note and was able to thank Steve since I know him so well, but I wasn't able to find Bill so that I could thank him. He's elusive.


Dreyfuss hasn't communicated with Murray since filming wrapped.Dreyfuss: Why would I do that? We left on bad terms. Oh, yeah, one day I decided to make up with Bill, about 15 years after the movie came out. I went to a restaurant that his family ran and told his brothers that I was looking to make up with him, but he was not there.


Does he hope to ever have the chance to sit down with Bill and make peace?


Dreyfuss: No.


Oz still hopes he'll have the chance to hash things out with Dreyfuss.


Oz: Years later, I wrote to him and said what a brilliant job he did. He didn't get the attention, I think, that he should have gotten because he was not the lovable character. I wanted to let him know how highly I thought of his work. I did never did hear back. I'm not sure why. Maybe he was appreciative of it. Maybe he still had a problem with me. I don't know. But he had a reason to have a problem with me. It was a tough shoot, and my job was to keep going forward. 


Dreyfuss: I did get the letter. I thought it was great. But have we been in touch? No.


The passage of time has allowed them all to realize that they made something very special, even if the process was often maddening. 


Hagerty: I don't know if it's a perfect storm or just a perfect situation. It was perfect writing, perfect chemistry. It was like one of those wonderful, wonderful explosions of everything working right.

	











Schulman: A lot of people tell me it's their favorite comedy, which is always wonderful to hear. People will immediately say, “Baby steps,” or things like that. It's great that it's remembered.


Erbe: People talk to me about it all the time. It's a movie that families watch over and over again together. I think it's about family and about misfits, and it has a good heart.


Hagerty: It's a really wonderful, odd family movie that does talk a lot about family dynamics and visitors to your home. I mean, have you ever had a visitor where you go, “Oh my God, I wish they'd go away”?

Dreyfuss: It's a very funny movie. And that's due to Bill first and everyone else second. Bill is a hysterically funny guy. Even if you're angry at him, he still makes you laugh. That's an amazing talent.


Oz: We all have imperfections. And they come out when we're in this heightened crucible of making a movie. But when you think of the world outside, we're so lucky that we get to do what we do. We're so lucky, so fortunate. And within this crucible, all this nonsense happens. Looking back, it's just so funny to me. [Laughs hysterically.]

Liam Payne‘s friend has pulled his defamation lawsuit against the late singer's father, Geoff Payne. Roger Nores — who was acquitted of an involuntary manslaughter charge in Payne's death investigation — asked the court to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit on Wednesday, Rolling Stone can confirm.


	In his original filing, Nores had alleged that Geoff made false and defamatory statements about him in sworn declarations to an Argentine prosecutor investigating Liam's death, causing him damages of over $10 million.


	Speaking to Rolling Stone at the time, Nores said Geoff “need[ed] to backtrack on his statements,” which led to his original charge. Now, in an email sent to Richard Bray, Liam's estate attorney, Nores writes that Geoff “doesn't need to apologize.”


	“I'll always remember when [Geoff] came to me the first night at the ranch after I had picked them up at the airport, how he asked me to promise I would never give up on Liam, no matter what,” Nores wrote in the email, obtained by Rolling Stone. “I kept that promise right until the end, and it was pretty hard.” 

	











	“In spite of how everything turned out and Geoff saying in his statement to the police [that] ‘this is all Roger's responsibility,'” he added, “I would have done this 100 times over because I loved Liam with all my heart and I miss him everyday.”


A lawyer representing Geoff in the Florida case and attorneys representing Liam's estate did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment.


	In his original lawsuit, Nores claimed that the father of the One Direction star made “false” and “misleading” statements and omitted information in his “sworn declarations” to Argentine officials while characterizing Nores' involvement in Liam's life. Although the statements made by Geoff were given in another country, the lawsuit claimed that they were “accessed by persons in the Palm Beach County/Florida” area and caused injury in said places.


	Nores had claimed that Geoff's statements impacted him and his reputation in “mega proportions with extensive damages.”


	In a response to the lawsuit dated Jan. 10, Liam's estate declined to retract the declarations and accused Nores of “seeking to interfere with a police investigation by pressuring [Geoff] to change his evidence,” adding that they would “bring his actions to the attention of the Argentinian authorities.”

	Liam's estate had also slammed the lawsuit's intent of donating proceeds of the lawsuit damages to Liam's son as “pointless,” adding that the lawsuit causes Liam's child with Cheryl Cole more “irreparable damage.”


	Nores was acquitted of an involuntary manslaughter charge last month, despite a denied appeal from the prosecutor overseeing the case. The new update comes several months after Rolling Stone published an investigation into the tragedy of Liam, including a statement from his ex-fiancée, Maya Henry, breaking her silence on his death. Liam died in mid-October after falling from the third-floor balcony of the CasaSur Palermo hotel in Argentina.

	They say nothing forms stronger bonds than the shared experience of combat, and that the feeling of deep fraternity forged under fire is as close, if not closer, than the love one harbors for family and country. Warfare understands this. A movie about a single siege on a single day in 2006 — one given a stunning sense of verisimilitude by filmmaker/real-life participant Ray Mendoza, and a hyperventilating sense of dread by his co-director/longtime apocalypse-channeler Alex Garland — this extraordinary portrait of a military firefight works double-time to recreate what it's like to be in “the shit.” You get the sheer tedium before the storm, the tsunami of chaos and noise once things go down, the way that survival instincts honed by training automatically kicks in for these soldiers, and the shock of seeing a friend become a fatality within a split second. War is hell, the film reminds you, while also being kind enough to hold the door for viewers as it ushers them into the scalding heat.

	











	Yet what this film really nails is the battalion camaraderie that goes beyond spending hours, days, weeks with the same folks and flips into something else entirely once shots are fired. From the second you meet the Navy SEALs who will have to scrap their way out of a house in Ramadi, Iraq, that's surrounded by insurgents, you're encouraged to see them as a stand-alone entity — many faces, numerous limbs, all one organism. Never mind that these dudes are whooping, hollering and jumping up and down in a state of hormonal overload, all over a music video resembling a cheesy '80s aerobics instructional. They're still functioning in perfect sync long before the melee starts. So many war movies play up the visceral aspects of battle, emphasizing the rush at the expense of context and any human toll attached to the carnage. Everything gets reduced to hardcore war-nography. Mendoza and Garland have bigger, bolder aims. Their goal is pure unit-cohesion porn.

	After playing voyeur to the commandos' after-hours endeavors, Warfare flips to a complete 180 scenario; instead of a loud, raucous scream-along in a fluorescently lit room, we find ourselves watching these same soldiers silently moving down a dark street in unison. The mission is to infiltrate a residential apartment in the middle of the night, much to the freaked-out occupants' dismay, and set up camp on the second floor. Ground forces will be passing through this hot spot the next day. These SEALs, along with a few marines and two translators, are here to ensure everybody enters and exits Ramadi without incident.

	Once daylight comes, we get a better look at the individual soldiers, some of which are distinguished from others courteous of familiar, famous faces. The cast is like a roll call of Next-Gen Hollywood circa 2025: There's Will Poulter (Midsommar, Death of a Unicorn), running point on the whole operation, and Joseph Quinn (Stranger Things, George Harrison in the upcoming Beatles' biopics) as a petty officer keeping watch on the perimeter. Over in the next room, Cosmo Jarvis (Shōgun, The Alto Knights) is manning a sniper rifle trained on some shady looking locals. Shooting the shit with a fellow grunt in the kitchen is Michael Gandolfini (The Many Saints of Newark, Saturday Night). Kit Connor (Heartstopper), Noah Centineo (To All the Boys) and Charles Melton (May December) all report for duty as well.  As for Mendoza's screen counterpart, he's played, in a especially strong turn, by Reservation Dogs‘ D'Pharoah Woon-A-Tai. 


	Hints of personalities, personal histories, in-jokes and longstanding tensions occasionally surface, but the men you see here are all functioning as cogs in the military's well-oiled machinery. Who's-who stats are almost beside the point. It's Jarvis's sharpshooter, however, that's reporting what appears to be communications between various parties throughout the neighborhood. They were expecting some sort of possible attack, especially once civilians begin leaving the streets in droves. The live grenade that gets lobbed through the sniper's perch is still a surprise. Suddenly, enemy shooters on roofs surround the troops. Plans for air support had been scuttled for various reasons, but several armored transports are on the way to evacuate them from the area. Once these tanks show up, however, everything goes completely FUBAR.

	From here, Warfare sticks to what feels like a rescue procedural in real time, as the men tend to the wounded, mourn fallen comrades, co-ordinate countermeasures and, to put things in less military-jargon terms, keeps their collective asses out a sling. As anyone familiar with Garland's work can tell you, he specializes in both intellectually challenging thrills and highly visceral chills, though mileage may vary on how effective his signature combo works in something like, say, last year's provocation-bait Civil War. (That project, by the way, was where the writer-director met Mendoza, who consulted on the film's climactic White House showdown.) 


	You can't discount Mendoza's contributions, of course, given that his boots were literally on the ground that day. It's Garland's ability to add a sense of distance to scenes brimming with exhilaration — and vice versa — that helps make his partner's eye-witness accounts incredibly effective here, however. You never forget you're watching actors, albeit rigorously trained ones, yet the filmmaking lends a feeling that they've somehow stepped into in-progress war reportage rather than onto a set. Ditto the ambiguity that's also part and parcel of his storytelling. There are some that will inevitably view this as more romanticized, pro-military propaganda, and others who will easily characterize this as more of an anti-war parable. The movie itself may come to praise these men rather than bury them, but the lens with which you process this true story through nonetheless remains subjective. Tipping hands remain off the scales.

	The only agenda in Warfare, in other words, is to give you a sense of not just what happened but how everything felt while it was happening. A tall order, to be sure, but one that Garland, Mendoza, their cast and the crew pull off shockingly well. Yes, authenticity is key, as well as the sheer battering the film puts you through — the sensory overload (or post-explosion, the partial sensory muting), the emphasis of shock over awe. You will assuredly leave the theater shook. But pay attention to that opening series of title cards, which start out as a list of scene-setting stats: This was the mission, here is the date, these were the people involved. 


	Then a disclaimer mentions that this look back was compiled through various interviews with those who survived that harrowing attack. “This film uses only their memories,” reads the next card. It's their version of what happened, their traumatic recollections, their emotional conflicts, their gratitude for each other and for still drawing breath. They are now the ones controlling the narrative. And we are now the ones bearing witness.

CHILLING new UFO footage shows a US warship facing off with two ""Tic Tac"" aircraft as four mysterious objects were spotted darting around the destroyer.

The objects are captured taking off in a ""sychronized"" flight off the coast of southern California - stunning sailors aboard the USS Jackson who claim they saw four in total.

New bombshell footage shows the unbelievable moment two of the UFOs burst from the ocean during the February 2023 incident.

Their shape resembles a 2004 sighting of a Tic Tac shaped UFO in the same waters, with the incident investigated by a top secret government program.

One of the stunned sailors told News 8 Now: ""All we witnessed was all four of them.

""All in synchronous, jetting into the abyss. 

""All four, all timed together and all left. And we were like holy s***.

""The second they left, maybe three, four seconds pass, I run to my station and I look at my radar, they're all off radar. That's it, they all zoomed off.

""But it's clear that they're in communication with one another and synchronized like three, two, one countdown. Let's all go. I think unless there's some level of like one entity controlling all four and then they all leave at the same time.""

And former defense department analyst Marik Von Rennenkampff added fuel to the UFO fire after analyzing flight data from the exact time and location of the sighting - concluding there were no US aircraft in the area.

He said: ""I don't think it's ours. I suspect there are better places for us to showcase that kind of equipment to unwitting sailors. 

""That just doesn't make sense.""

The latest incident with the chilling footage bares similarities to the infamous Nimitz incident a whopping two decades prior.

Several pilots encountered the unknown, flying object as it sped over the pacific near Mexico on November 14, 2004.

Pilot David Fravor was one of four people in two fighter jets sent to monitor the object after it was spotted by his bosses on board the USS Nimitz.

He told CNN at the time that they came across a disturbance above the water that was causing the sea to foam and ""a white object, oblong, pointing north"".

He added: ""It had no wings. So you think, 'okay, it's a helicopter', but there's no rotor wash in the water, there's no rotors and when helicopters move from side-to-side they're kind of slow then pick up speed going the other way.

""This was extremely abrupt - like a ping pong ball bouncing off a wall. It would hit and go the other way and change directions at will.

""Then the ability to hover over the water then start a vertical climb from zero up to about 12,000ft and then accelerate in less than two seconds and disappear is something that I've never seen in my life.""

When asked about those who may be sceptical of the claim, he replied: ""It's easy to doubt what we can't explain and this isn't the first account of people seeing a UFO.

THE Tic Tac UFO is a mysterious flying object that U.S. pilots and experts have claimed to have witnessed over the last few decades.

The first famous sighting with footage took place off the San Diego coast in 2004, after pilots on the USS Nimitz carrier strike group detected the object.

Commander David Fravor believed it to be something beyond human technology - as it possessed extreme acceleration and no visible propulsion.

Then in 2015, pilots on the USS Roosevelt off the East Coast captured footage of unidentified moving objects.

They also showed no means of propulsion and moved at high speeds.

Speculation online has caused alien fanatics to look for more Tic Tac-shaped space paraphernalia, including a Russian military base which appeared to be a Tic Tac UFO ""charging hub"".

The Pentagon has also acknowledged other declassified videos of encounters, but have been unable to explain them.

""In this situation you're talking about four people, all eyeballs on, ranging in experience from relatively new in a fleet squadron... to myself who had over 16 years of flying.""

And fellow F-18 pilot Lietenant Chad Underwood flew out and caught the object on video which was published by the New York Times in 2017.

This sparked a mixture of uproar and intrigue on how much the government knows of UFOs.

At the time, the sighting didn't get looked into on a large scale - until the Defense Intelligence Agency looked into it in 2008.

Both Fravor and Underwood expressed how they couldn't believe the similarities between the infamous Nimitz incident and the latest sighting - therefore questioning whether the UFOs were returning or never left at all.

   09:22 EDT 09 Apr 2025, updated  13:09 EDT 09 Apr 2025    By BETHAN SEXTON FOR DAILYMAIL.COM and CHRIS MELORE, ASSISTANT SCIENCE EDITOR FOR DAILYMAIL.COM  

Four eerie UFOs have been caught on a US naval camera emerging from the ocean and taking off in a 'synchronized' flight off the coast of southern California.

The objects were recorded by stunned sailors who said they spotted the group of UFOs during the incident aboard the USS Jackson.

The newly obtained footage shows the moment two of the UFOs emerged from the ocean during the incident on February 15, 2023. 

Their shape appeared strikingly similar to a 2004 sighting of a 'tic tac shaped' UFO in the same waters, which was previously investigated by a top secret government program.

The never-before-seen video was obtained by journalist George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell, co-hosts of the Weaponized Podcast, who revealed it to the public on Tuesday.

Knapp and co-host Jeremy Corbell spoke to Navy personnel who said they watched as four Tic Tac-shaped UFOs that emerged from the ocean in a military-controlled area known as Warning Area 291.

Corbell noted that this is the same area of the Pacific where other Navy sailors have reported seeing strange, unidentified craft over the years - including the now-infamous 2004 Tic Tac sighting by the USS Nimitz.

A combat information center (CIC) operator on board the Jackson who witnessed the incident spoke with the podcast, saying that seeing a UFO over the Pacific isn't really shocking for Navy personnel, but seeing a whole formation take off out of the water was jarring.

'All in synchronous, jetting into the abyss. All four, all timed together and all left. And we were like holy s**t,"" the anonymous CIC operator told the Weaponized podcast.

'The second they left, maybe three, four seconds pass, I run to my station and I look at my radar, they're all off radar. That's it, they all zoomed off,"" the sailor continued.

'But it's clear that they're in communication with one another and synchronized like three, two, one countdown. Let's all go. I think unless there's some level of like one entity controlling all four and then they all leave at the same time.'

After seeing the craft come out of the ocean, the crew of the Jackson captured the Tic Tacs on a specialized heat sensor called Safire that could track their movements at night.

Shockingly, none of the craft seen in the Safire images was producing any kind of heat trail as they were moving through the air - meaning they were using a totally unknown form of propulsion.

Corbell added that even if the UFOs were just hovering over the Pacific, the Safire camera should have been able to see some kind of heat from an engine - but there was nothing.

Former defense department analyst Marik Von Rennenkampff analyzed flight data from the time and location of the sighting and concluded there were no US aircraft in the area.

'I don't think it's ours. I suspect there are better places for us to showcase that kind of equipment to unwitting sailors. That just doesn't make sense,' Von Rennenkampff said. 

The incident echoes the infamous, 'Nimitz incident' two decades prior, when Navy pilots saw two UFOs flying at incredible speeds in the same area.

At least six pilots encountered the mysterious object as it flew at speed over the Pacific near Mexico on November 14, 2004. 

Top Gun fighter pilot David Fravor was flying a training exercise off the coast of San Diego when he was re-routed to investigate a strange object spotted on radar by warships protecting his aircraft carrier, the Nimitz. 

He found was a roughly 40ft white object with no windows or wings, shaped like a Tic-Tac, flitting about above the sea that was roiling below it, disturbed by something large submerged beneath the surface.

Commander Fravor told Congress in 2023 that as he circled the object, it turned to mirror his movements, then shot off past him at thousands of miles per hour, somehow stopping a second later at a secret pre-designated rendezvous point 60 miles away, that only he and a handful of Navy staff on his ship were given ahead of their training exercise.

Fellow F-18 pilot Lieutenant Chad Underwood then flew out and caught the object on video – footage that was published by the New York Times in 2017, igniting a firestorm of intrigue about the government's knowledge of UFOs.

The way it moved has led to speculation that it was a UFO and it has become a key piece of evidence for those who believe in extraterrestrials. 

A source who investigated the incident for the Department of Defense previously  told DailyMail.com that they were briefed about sonar data from a nearby submarine that tracked the UFOs moving at more than 460 mph underwater during the shocking encounter. 

At the time, the sighting went largely uninterrogated, until the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) learned about it in 2008.

Fravor and Underwood both said they were shocked by the similarities between the Nimitz incident and this latest sighting raising questions over whether the UFOs returned or never left.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

In 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) released a report detailing recently declassified information on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP).

Since then, the Department of Defense has released annual reports on UAP through the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). Nevertheless, there is still a lack of publicly available scientific data.

To address this, a new study led by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) and the Galileo Project proposes an All-Sky Infrared Camera (Dalek) to search for potential indications of extraterrestrial spacecraft.

The study was led by Laura Domine, a member of the Keto-Galileo Postdoctoral Fellowship at Harvard University and a researcher with the Galileo Project.

She was joined by fellow researchers from the CfA, the Galileo Project, the Whitin Observatory, the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies, and Atlas Lens Co.

The paper summarizing their proposal was presented at the 2025 Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2025 LPSC), which took place from March 10th to 14th in The Woodlands, Texas.

The instrument they describe in their paper is nicknamed Dalek, given its resemblance to the machine antagonists from the Doctor Who franchise (image above). This instrument builds on recommendations made by NASA in a 2023 independent study, where they stated:

""Purpose-built future sensors for UAP detection should be designed to adjust on millisecond timescales to aid better detection. In lockstep, alert systems should detect and share transient information quickly and uniformly… Multisensor platforms are important for providing a complete picture of a UAP event. An object's motion should be recorded, as well as its shape (imaging data), color (multispectra or hyperspectral data) and any sounds and other characteristics.""

Their paper details this multimodal, multispectral ground-based observatory, the first instrument to undergo commissioning at the Galileo Institute's development site, and the calibration process.

Professor Avi Loeb, the Frank B. Baird Jr. Professor of Science at Harvard University, the Director of the Institute for Theory and Computation (2007-present) within the CfA, is also the Head of the Galileo Project (2021-present). As he told Universe Today via email:

""Often U.S. government data is classified, either because it was collected by classified sensors or because it is not fully understood and could potentially be relevant for national security. When in doubt, the data is not released to the public or the scientific community. However, the sky is not classified, and so the Galileo Project is operating an all-sky observatory at Harvard University and constructing two other observatories in Pennsylvania and Nevada that are searching for anomalous objects in the infrared, optical, radio, and audio bands.""

As Loeb detailed, these three observatories detect about 100,000 objects per month each and have already obtained data on about 1 million objects. This is the largest database systematically assembled on NEOs, which the Galileo Project analyzes using machine-learning software.

This software consists of a You Only Look Once (YOLO) model for object detection and a Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT) algorithm for trajectory reconstruction.

These algorithms are trained on familiar objects (planes, drones, balloons, birds, satellites, etc.), which allows them to sort through all observed UAPs and detect outliers. In addition, the paper contains a rundown of the observatory's first five months of operation.

As the team stated in their paper, roughly 500,000 objects were detected in this period. About 16% of the trajectories they reconstructed (~80,000) were flagged as outliers at a 95% confidence level and manually examined with infrared images.

From these, 144 trajectories remained ambiguous, which they state are likely mundane objects that cannot be further classified without information, distance, and other sensor data. Said Loeb:

""In the first five months of commissioning data reported in this paper, we studied half a million objects and assessed our ability to classify them without distance information. In the future, we hope to measure distances to objects based on triangulation by multiple detectors spaced apart within each observatory. This will allow us to determine the velocity and acceleration of various types of objects and clearly identify anomalous ones.""

By comparison, classified studies performed by governmental agencies such as the AARO - which can often leverage distance estimations from radar data and multiple sensors - reported that ∼3% of the cases brought to their attention remained ambiguous.

The ultimate goal, said Loeb, is to find the few (if any) outliers that could be considered evidence of a technologically advanced species (aka. technosignatures). Said Loeb:

""Our goal is to check if there are any objects which display anomalous flight characteristics or shapes. Even if one in a million happened to show abilities beyond human-made technologies, it would constitute the biggest scientific discovery ever made. Such an object could suggest the existence of an extraterrestrial technological civilization from which we can learn about more advanced science and technology than humans developed over the past century.""

The full version of their paper was published in the journal Sensors.

Liam Coen was one of the top head coaching candidates on the market this year after an impressive year as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' offensive coordinator. The Jaguars showed strong interest in Coen during their search for a head coach, setting up an interview with him on Wednesday.

He turned down that opportunity and was set to sign a lucrative three-year deal with the Bucs to make him the highest-paid coordinator in the NFL, but he never put pen to paper.

That's when the Jaguars pulled the “break glass in case of emergency” card and fired GM Trent Baalke, making one last push to hire Coen as their head coach. Fast-forward to Thursday and they've landed their guy.

According to reports, Coen is expected to be hired as the Jaguars' next head coach. It was a bizarre turn of events, particularly considering the Buccaneers were unable to reach Coen on Thursday after he left to take the interview with the Jaguars.

Furthermore, his contract with the Buccaneers was reportedly contingent on him not taking a second interview with Jacksonville – but he never signed it, so he never breached the contract.

Coen had two different stints with the Rams. He was the assistant wide receivers coach from 2018-2019 before being promoted to assistant quarterbacks coach in 2020. He then left for Kentucky in 2021, returned to the Rams as Sean McVay's offensive coordinator in 2022, went back to Kentucky in 2023 and then landed with the Buccaneers in 2024.

So, yeah, he's made a few stops in the last five years.

Useful quantum networks are hobbled by the problem of decoherence from environmental ""noise."" But a new breakthrough could change that.

Scientists have discovered a groundbreaking method to shield quantum information from ""noise"" — and it could finally let us build practical quantum computers.

Quantum computers rely on quantum entanglement, the connection between the quantum properties of two particles that are shared instantaneously across time and space. This enables quantum computers to perform faster calculations than their traditional counterparts because they can process information in parallel rather than in sequence.

But maintaining this ""coherence"" is difficult due to ""noise"" from the outside world, as interactions with loose particles, rays of light and even minute changes in temperature can break the entanglement and disperse the information within. That's why the error rate in qubits is much higher than in conventional bits in classical computing.

""Basically even though companies claim [they have] 1,000 qubits, very few of them are useful. Noise is the reason,"" study co-author Andrew Forbes, a professor of physics at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa told Live Science. ""Everyone agrees that there is no point in pushing for more qubits unless we can make them less noisy.""

Now, by encoding the information in the topology (or the properties that stem from the shape) of two entangled photons, a team of physicists has found a way to preserve quantum information, even amid a storm of noise. The researchers published their findings on March 26 in the journal Nature Communications.

In much the same way that traditional computer bits are the basic units of digital information, qubits encode quantum information. Like bits, qubits can exist as a 1 or a 0, representing the two possible positions in a two-state system.

Thanks to the bizarre rules of the quantum world, qubits can also exist in theoretically infinite superpositions of the two classical states. And when they're entangled inside quantum computers, their ability to crunch numbers grows exponentially.

But this quantum daisy chain is fragile: Even when housed inside extremely cold and highly insulated cryostats, current quantum computers are still infiltrated by tiny disturbances that rapidly disrupt the delicate processes within.

The typical strategy for preventing quantum decoherence is to preserve entanglement, but this has so far only enjoyed relative success. To look for a way around this, the researchers behind the new study sought to preserve information even in systems that had already been partially decohered.

""We decided to let the entanglement decay — it is always fragile so let it be so — and instead preserve information even with very little entanglement,"" Forbes said.

For their solution, Forbes and his colleagues turned to a type of qubit known as a ""topological qubit"" that encodes information in the shape made by two entangled particles. They settled on a quasiparticle known as an optical skyrmion, a wave-like field formed between two entangled photons.

—Scientists create world's 1st chip that can protect data in the age of quantum computing attacks

—Radical quantum computing theory could lead to more powerful machines than previously imagined

—Qubits are notoriously prone to failure — but building them from a single laser pulse may change this

After exposing the skyrmions to varying levels of noise, the researchers found that the patterns and information coded within remained resilient far beyond the point where non-topological systems would decohere.

""It turns out that so long as some entanglement remains, no matter how little, the topology stays intact,"" Forbes said. ""The topology only disappears when the entanglement vanishes.""

The scientists believe their approach could play a key role in making quantum computers and networks that can overcome noise in any environment. Their next step will be to create a ""topological toolkit"" that can encode practical information into a skyrmion and get it out again.

""Once we have this, we can start to think about using topology in practical situations, like communication networks and in computing,"" Forbes said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo+site:livescience.com","The de-extinct dire wolves are neither de-extinct, nor dire wolves. Discuss.","https://www.livescience.com/animals/extinct-species/colossals-de-extincted-dire-wolf-isnt-a-dire-wolf-and-it-has-not-been-de-extincted-experts-say","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 14:36:20 GMT","

Scientists recently revealed that they have ""brought back"" extinct dire wolves thanks to genetic engineering — but experts say the newly created animals are only like dire wolves in appearance.

In an announcement on Monday (April 7), scientists revealed to the world that they have ""brought back"" long-extinct dire wolves with genetic engineering.

Researchers with the biotechnology company Colossal Biosciences shared images of three adorable, snow-white pups, which they said mark the ""world's first de-extinction.""

Dire wolves (Aenocyon dirus), which were made famous by the HBO television series ""Game of Thrones,"" went extinct at the end of the last ice age. By creating lookalike pups, Colossal's CEO Ben Lamm said the company has ""made healthy dire wolf puppies"" and resurrected these predators after more than 10,000 years of extinction.

But many experts say the language used by Colossal to describe their creation is misleading. ""What Colossal have produced is a gray wolf with dire wolf-like characteristics,"" Nic Rawlence, an associate professor and co-director of the Otago Palaeogenetics Laboratory at the University of Otago, told the New Zealand Science Media Center (NZ SMC). ""This is not a de-extincted dire wolf, rather it's a 'hybrid.'""

To make the pups, scientists extracted DNA from two prehistoric dire wolf fossils: a 13,000-year-old tooth discovered in Sheridan Pit, Ohio, and a 72,000-year-old inner ear bone from American Falls in Idaho. Using this DNA, the researchers pieced together a partial dire wolf genome, which they then compared with the genomes of the dire wolf's closest living relatives, including wolves, jackals and foxes.

Based on their results, the scientists selected the gray wolf (Canis lupus) as an egg donor to ""bring back"" dire wolves — despite the two species not actually being that closely related, experts said.

Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

""New information shows that the original dire wolf itself was not really a wolf,"" David Mech, an adjunct professor specializing in wolf ecology and behavior at the University of Minnesota and senior research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, told Live Science in an email.

Evolutionarily speaking, dire wolves split from wolves roughly 6 million years ago, forming an entirely separate group from modern-day gray wolves. ""Dire wolves are in their own genus, so a very different species,"" Philip Seddon, a professor of zoology at the University of Otago, told NZ SMC. ""The African jackal might be more closely related to dire wolves.""



De-extinction requires egg cells from a living animal to hold and ""grow"" the genetic material of the animal scientists want to create. Having selected gray wolves to perform this step, Colossal scientists then collected cells from gray wolf blood samples and modified them to resemble the cells they found in the dire wolf fossils. Using CRISPR gene-editing technology, the team made a total of 20 edits in 14 genes that they identified as important in giving dire wolves their distinctive traits.

Next, in a similar process as the one used to clone Dolly the sheep in 1996, the scientists inserted the modified cells' DNA into gray wolf egg cells, whose own genetic material had previously been removed. At this point, the gray wolf egg cells contained all the genetic information required to build wolves with some of the defining characteristics of dire wolves. The egg cells were then left to mature in the lab, and the resulting embryos were implanted into the wombs of domestic dogs, which are technically a subspecies of the gray wolf.

Colossal's first ""dire wolf"" puppies, Romulus and Remus, were born Oct. 1, 2024, meaning they are now 5-month-old adolescents. According to Colossal, they are being held and continually monitored in a nature preserve surrounded by 10-foot-tall (3 meters) fencing.

""They will live out their life in a luxurious preserve under human care,"" Bridgett vonHoldt, a professor of evolutionary genomics and epigenetics at Princeton University who collaborates with Colossal on this project, told Live Science in an email. ""As many have seen with previously cloned animals, their health always remains unpredictable and of potential concern.""



A third pup, Khaleesi, was born Jan. 30, 2025. It's unclear how dangerous these animals are, but their behavior is unlikely to differ dramatically from that of a captive gray wolf, especially as they have been constantly surrounded by humans, vonHoldt said. ""Lots of captive wolves are handled by humans. Some remain submissive with their humans even as adults while others mature into a more aloof, standoffish animal. I expect the DW [dire wolves] will be no different.""

Romulus, Remus and Khaleesi will not be released into the wild, but in the future, Colossal said it will consider options to introduce animals into ""secure and expansive ecological preserves potentially on Indigenous land.""

But some experts doubt very much that these introductions would be successful. ""Any release to the wild would be fraught with negative PR and legal consequences, which would probably also be the case with any of the other types of newly created animals,"" Mech said.

Regarding the dire wolf specifically, Mech said there is a question mark over how they might fit into modern ecosystems. ""They occupied an entirely different ecological niche than exists today,"" he said.

Many experts have criticized Colossal's announcement, but some have also praised the technological breakthroughs the company made along the way. ""Certainly, this involves advances in genetic technology, and these might have applications for the conservation of existing species,"" Seddon said.



One species that is already benefiting from Colossal's breakthroughs is the red wolf (Canis rufus), the world's most endangered wolf. The company announced the birth of two litters of cloned red wolves on Monday, boosting the number of red wolves held in captivity in the U.S. and offering new hope for the species.

—Most complete Tasmanian tiger genome yet pieced together from 110-year-old pickled head

But at the end of the day Colossal's claim that it has resurrected the dire wolf is spurious, Seddon and others said. ""Colossal compared the genomes of the dire wolf and the gray wolf, and from about 19,000 genes, they determined that 20 changes in 14 genes gave them a dire wolf,"" Rawlence said.

Moreover, Colossal's ""dire wolves"" aren't technically the world's first de-extinction. In 2003, scientists in Spain cloned an extinct wild goat species known as the bucardo, or the Pyrenean ibex (Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica). A baby goat was born, but it died seven minutes later due to a lung defect.

The announcement on Monday means that ""we have GMO wolves and might one day have GMO Asian elephants, but for now extinction really is for ever,"" Seddon said.
