                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI co-founder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever's new AI startup, Safe Superintelligence (SSI), is using Google Cloud's TPU chips to power its AI research, part of a new partnership the companies announced on Wednesday in a press release. Google Cloud says SSI is using TPUs to “accelerate its research and development efforts toward building a safe, superintelligent AI.” In October, Google Cloud said it would be the primary computing provider for World Labs, founded by ex-Google Cloud AI chief scientist Fei-Fei Li. It's unclear if SSI has struck partnerships with other cloud or computing providers. SSI came out of stealth in June 2024, months after Sutskever departed from his role as OpenAI's chief scientist. The company has $1 billion in backing from Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, DST Global, SV Angel, and others. Since SSI's launch, we've heard relatively little about the startup's activities. Before co-founding OpenAI, Sutskever spent several years at Google Brain researching neural networks. Sutskever later joined an employee movement to reinstate Altman as CEO.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NSO Group's notorious spyware Pegasus was used to target 1,223 WhatsApp users in 51 different countries during a 2019 hacking campaign, according to a new court document. At the time, WhatsApp said around 1,400 users had been targeted. Now, an exhibit published in the court document shows exactly in what countries 1,223 specific victims were located when they were targeted with NSO Group's Pegasus spyware. There are also victims in Western countries like Spain (12 victims), the Netherlands (11), Hungary (8), France (7), United Kingdom (2), and one victim in the United States. “Numerous news articles have been written over the years documenting use of Pegasus to target victims around the world,” said Runa Sandvik, a cybersecurity expert who's been tracking victims of government spyware for years. Contact Us Do you have more information about NSO Group, or other spyware companies? Another piece of data that shows the scale of the government spyware problem is that the hacking campaign targeting WhatsApp users occurred over a period of only two months, “between in and around April 2019 and May 2019,” as WhatsApp wrote in its original complaint. It's possible that a government customer could be using Pegasus to target someone outside of the country. As CTech noted, Syria appears on the victim list, but NSO Group cannot export its technology to Syria, a country that's sanctioned by countries all over the world. The number of victims also gives an insight into who may be NSO Group's highest-paying customers. Companies like NSO Group, and other predecessors like Hacking Team and FinFisher, determine what price to offer their surveillance products to their customers in part by the number of targets that can be concurrently infected with the spyware. Mexico, for example, was reported to have spent more than $60 million on NSO Group's spyware, according to a 2023 New York Times article that cited Mexican officials, which could explain why there are so many Mexican targets in this list. Last year, WhatsApp scored an historic victory when the judge presiding over the lawsuit ruled that NSO Group had breached U.S. hacking laws by targeting WhatsApp users.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Trump's seeming determination to keep Chinese EVs out of the US is not stopping BYD's expansion plans, with the EV giant announcing today that it is bringing its premium sub-brand Denza to Europe. Sitting between the BYD main brand and its luxury high-end marque Yangwang, Denza is aiming to slot right into the premium auto market. The customers of Audi, BMW, and Mercedes all seem likely targets, even if Denza's executive vice president Stella Li was reluctant to confirm that to journalists at the brand-hosted launch in Milan, Italy. Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association, has told Reuters that Trump's sweeping (and now paused) tariffs are expected to have a major indirect impact on export sales—particularly in Southeast Asia nations which were hit with some of Trump's heftiest levies. By rolling out another brand in Europe, not only will BYD continue its march toward worldwide dominance in the auto sector, it can potentially offset these Southeast Asian export losses. By contrast, Tesla's revenue for the year was $97.7 billion, and its deliveries declined for the first time last year by 1.1 percent. Moreover, the vast majority of BYD's shipments last year were to domestic customers, with a mere 10 percent exported overseas. It is no surprise then that investors and analysts are bullish on BYD's growth potential—and Denza launching in Europe is just the latest illustration of this. Denza's Z9GT is launching in Europe to take on BMW, Audi, and Mercedes. The plan, Denza claims, is to eventually roll out a range of vehicles across all categories, mirroring what it has already done in China. Denza was originally founded in 2010 as a joint venture between BYD and Mercedes-Benz, launching its first car into the Chinese market in 2014. Now wholly owned by BYD, it went through a significant rebrand in 2021, with Wolfgang Egger—who previously led design teams at Audi and Lamborghini—joining at the helm as chief designer. At its heart is Denza's own e3 Platform, which brings a number of headline features. As well as allowing drivers to toe in and toe out of tight spaces, it also allows the car to “crab walk”—where the auto seemingly glides in a sideways motion—up to an industry-leading angle of 15 degrees. Aside from a stiffening boon to the chassis, this ensures a fully flat floor and helps to create an additional 15-millimeter vertical space in the cabin for as much room inside as possible. Front seats will get 12-way electric adjustment and 10-point massage and heating, along with a supposedly world-first execution of active side bolsters, which share their air tanks with the car's air suspension for additional support during cornering. The Z9GT will offer a choice of powertrain at launch, either pure electric—launching first in November—or Super DM hybrid, which will come with a 2-liter turbocharged petrol engine and follow in February 2026. Of course, price will be a huge factor in how successful Denza is in its ambitions against its well-established, better-known competition. Denza and BYD are staying tight-lipped on pricing for now, so we'll expect to hear more as we get closer to the Z9GT's launch later this year. A quick and simple answer: “We don't have any plans to launch any consumer car in the US,” Li says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now the company is launching a program to fix how AI models are scored. The new OpenAI Pioneers Program will focus on creating evaluations for AI models that “set the bar for what good looks like,” as OpenAI phrased it in a blog post. “Creating domain-specific evals are one way to better reflect real-world use cases, helping teams assess model performance in practical, high-stakes environments.” Many widely-used AI benchmarks measure performance on esoteric tasks, like solving doctorate-level math problems. Others can be gamed, or don't align well with most people's preferences. Through the Pioneers Program, OpenAI hopes to create benchmarks for specific domains like legal, finance, insurance, healthcare, and accounting. “We're selecting a handful of startups for this initial cohort, each working on high-value, applied use cases where AI can drive real-world impact.” Companies in the program will also have the opportunity to work with OpenAI's team to create model improvements via reinforcement fine tuning, a technique that optimizes models for a narrow set of tasks, OpenAI says. But partnering with customers to release AI tests may be seen as an ethical bridge too far. Google is allegedly paying some AI staff to do nothing for a year rather than join rivals</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Research out this week might help you plan your own version of the Ozempic diet, with the results of a survey revealing the foods that people tend to avoid, or eat less of, once they start taking GLP-1 drugs. They found that people were most likely to reduce their consumption of certain food groups, such as soft drinks and beef. Notably, though, people's desires for these foods didn't completely go away. Ozempic and Similar Drugs Could Help Ward Off Dementia, Study Suggests According to the study researchers, however, there's still a lot we don't know about exactly how GLP-1 drugs change people's behavior and eating patterns. All of the respondents were asked to estimate their daily caloric intake over the past seven days, along with questions about how much they desired specific food groups. As expected, people on GLP-1 therapy appeared to eat less overall than others and less than they did prior to starting the medication. The researchers estimated that people taking GLP-1 drugs ate between 720 and 990 fewer calories than before they started treatment. They also observed that GLP-1 users tended to consume fewer processed foods, sugar-sweetened beverages, refined grains, and beef. “In conclusion, this study provides evidence that GLP-1s support weight management through calorie reduction and influence food consumption patterns by diminishing intake of high-calorie and processed foods,” the researchers wrote in their paper, published last month in the journal Food Quality and Preference. Interestingly enough, though, people taking GLP-1 drugs still reported having a high desire for these foods. That suggests, the researchers say, that GLP-1s might change people's eating patterns by enhancing their taste sensitivity and/or altering their pleasure response to food. But more research is needed to work out the “specific physiological and metabolic pathways” affected by GLP-1 use, they add. Either way, these findings should help inform people about what to expect when starting GLP-1 therapy, not to mention the junk and snack food industry. Some companies have already started to prepare for this impact, with the launching of less sugary products aimed at people taking GLP-1 drugs.

A new review of clinical trial data finds evidence that GLP-1 drugs can meaningfully reduce dementia risk in people with type 2 diabetes. Stanford Medicine researchers have identified a promising, naturally occurring molecule that could help people lose weight—without the nauseating symptoms now commonly seen with GLP-1 drugs. New research suggests humans and labradors might be predisposed to gaining weight for similar reasons. A new case study is the latest to suggest that GLP-1 therapy can tamp down people's unhealthy cravings of drugs like alcohol and cocaine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A newly discovered asteroid is on track for a close brush with Earth—and it might even slam into the Moon. Recently, astronomers got a closer look at the giant space rock, revealing its violent origin story. Using the Keck Observatory on Maunakea, Hawaiʻi Island, a team of astronomers was able to identify the physical properties of asteroid 2024 YR4 and uncover its potential origin. It also likely originated from an asteroid family in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter—an unlikely place for Earth-crossing asteroids to come from. “The shape of the asteroid provides us with clues as to how it formed, and what its structural integrity is,” Bryce Bolin, research scientist with Eureka Scientific, said in a statement. “Knowing these properties is crucial for determining how much effort or what kind of technique needs to be used to deflect the asteroid if it is deemed a threat.” This research is set for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Shortly after its discovery, NASA designated it a potentially hazardous object, with a nearly 3% chance of hitting Earth on December 22, 2032. After giving us quite the scare (or something to look forward to), NASA removed 2024 YR4 from its naughty list when calculations showed that the asteroid had a near-zero chance of hitting Earth. Earth Is Safe From Menacing Asteroid—but Our Moon Might Take the Hit If it does hit, the asteroid will not alter the Moon's orbit, and instead leave behind a fresh and sizable impact crater. “If it does, it would give scientists a rare chance to study how the size of an asteroid relates to the size of the crater it creates—something we haven't been able to measure directly before.” It has a flattened, irregular shape, and is about the same density as a solid rock, according to the new study. The asteroid spins in a retrograde direction once every 20 minutes. Larger asteroids that are 100 meters (328 feet) or more are often called “rubble piles,” and are the remaining fragments that broke off from a larger parent asteroid in the aftermath of a collision. Rubble piles are, as the name suggests, broken-off pieces that clump together to form a loosely held asteroid. There are often large boulders that sit at the top of rubble pile asteroids. At its smaller size, 2024 YR4 may have once been a boulder that sat on the surface of a large rubble pile asteroid, according to the study. As their orbits evolve, the asteroids are then kicked off onto a trajectory that sends them toward Earth. Since then, the space rock has moved away from us, and its next close approach won't be until December 2028. Ground-based telescopes from the International Asteroid Warning Network have been tracking the asteroid, but it will be too faint to observe until June 2028, according to NASA. “The data from our study will be used to assess the physical properties and shapes of potentially impacting asteroids, providing a great test case on the kind of rapid response observations that are necessary to characterize a potential threat like this object,” Bolin said. “The physical information about an asteroid's physical property (rubble pile vs solid rock) is crucial for planning mitigation efforts if necessary.” Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

The new feature could also be used by creators and brands to launch promotions or marketing campaigns in a fun way. As for regular users, the new feature could be a fun way to share content with specific friends. It's worth noting that the new test feature is somewhat similar to Instagram's “Reveal” feature that lets you post a hidden Story for your followers to uncover by sending you a DM. That feature launched last year as a way to create more intimate connections on the app and boost engagement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saturn's moon Titan is often pegged as one of the worlds in our solar system where life could theoretically exist. A new analysis concludes that is indeed possible, albeit incredibly unlikely. Titan is known for being the only moon in the solar system with a dense atmosphere, and it also has bodies of liquid, including liquid water hidden under deep shells of ice. But alas, with all that going for it, an international team of astronomers determined that conditions on Titan would only be able to sustain enough biomass to equal one moderately chunky cat. While the Cassini probe continued its journey through space, collecting data on Saturn and its moons, the Huygens lander separated to get an even closer look at one in particular. When it descended through the atmosphere and landed on Titan on January 15, 2005, it became the first human-made object to do so. However, just as an egg yolk is not a chicken, organic compounds don't necessarily indicate that life can form. To explore the possibility of microbial life on Titan, Antonin Affholder, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Arizona, led a team to assess how likely that scenario might be. They did so by assuming that if life did arise on Titan, it would survive by one of the most primitive processes known: fermentation, in which an organism converts organic compounds to energy without using any oxygen. Yes, the process you nonchalantly toyed with to make sourdough during covid-19 is a sign of life—life you used to make your avocado toast, but still, life. They determined that the organic compound most likely to be involved in Titan fermentation is glycine, an amino acid valuable to building protein. Glycine has been found on Titan's surface, but scientists wondered whether enough of it could make its way to the moon's liquid oceans. Again, that's the weight at which most house cats are put on a diet. “There has been this sense that because Titan has such abundant organics, there is no shortage of food sources that could sustain life,” said Affholder in a statement. “We point out that not all of these organic molecules may constitute food sources, the ocean is really big, and there's limited exchange between the ocean and the surface, where all those organics are, so we argue for a more nuanced approach.” “Such a tiny biosphere would average less than one cell per liter of water over Titan's entire vast ocean,” he concluded.

That's the advice right-to-repair advocates are giving anyone worried about how the tariffs will hit their wallets—and collections of electronic gadgets. Trade tariffs touch nearly every product, especially when they're as widespread and sky-high as the ones president Trump announced on April 3. Components used to assemble devices are usually built in manufacturing plants in countries like China, Vietnam, Taiwan, and Cambodia, which are now being hit with tariffs of 30 to 50 percent. While the price increases as a result of this have not yet gone into effect—and are difficult to fully predict—these economic proclamations have already had broad repercussions. The economic turmoil and uncertainty make the prospect of buying a new device, especially an already pricey smartphone, laptop, or gaming console, seem like it's going to become a lot more expensive. And if buying something new becomes harder and harder, it makes more sense to keep what you already have going strong. “Right to repair could not have come sooner,” says Kyle Wiens, CEO of the repairability company iFixit. Right-to-repair efforts—actions by consumer advocates intended to raise public awareness and force companies to make devices more repairable—have been in the works for decades. In recent years, the push has made great strides. In 2024, the European Union instituted a ruling that requires companies to make devices more repairable. As tariffs kick in and a global trade war ignites, the parallels start to feel very similar. “We don't know what's going to happen,” Wiens says. Wiens suggests that people should prepare for new device prices to increase by 50 percent or more. If you apply that same logic to the stuff you already have, it means that hanging onto your smartphone or laptop for another couple of years may be a much better investment then trading it in for something new. “So durable goods—microwaves, toasters, cell phones, Nintendo Switches, whatever it is, they're worth 50 percent more now than you thought they were.” The tariff era will require a shift in how products are produced and reduced. Wiens says he has also been talking to workers at electronics recycling facilities and telling them not to harvest discarded products if they're still working. “Hey, whatever you are going to shred, stop shredding it,” Wiens says. “Whatever materials you're going to export, stop exporting it. That product's going to have more value than you thought.” Like Wiens, Proctor believes that repair makes society more resilient and will help people get through this where it can. “It's going to be very disruptive in the short term,” Proctor says. But I do know that a more resilient society is better.” Leo Gebbie, a principal analyst at the research firm CCS Insights says that another segment of the market that could benefit from higher tariffs are secondhand markets that sell used devices, like Backmarket. They've been doing quite well even before the tariffs were announced, with secondhand devices frequently bought and sold within the US. “There is a strong supply of secondhand iPhones within the US, so for US consumers there shouldn't be a need to import those devices from elsewhere and have them subject to tariffs.” Backmarket in particular seems to be well aware of its place in this trend, as right now it is cheekily offering a Recession Special where customers can use a code (ELON) to save 10 percent on their purchase. However, if demand for secondhand devices goes up, there could be a knock-on effect where more phones being sold in the US could lead to prices being raised across the board—including in European markets that have tended to have stronger demand for used devices than the US. The automotive industry (which is bound to feel its own impacts from the tariffs) offers an example of how to care for products long term. Does anyone throw away a car because the windshield's broken? Wiens, who runs a business that sells tools meant for repairing devices, says he will also directly feel the effects of the tariffs and be forced to pass the increased cost onto customers. Even then, he hopes that a silver lining in the tariff chaos will be consumers changing their buying habits. “And so then you say, well, if we're going to stop buying new things, what do we do with the stuff?

The manufacturer clarifies that this wiggle room is standard, falls within their specifications, is intended to improve cable seating, and reduces wear based on their data. It is important to clarify these subtle nuances, especially considering how reports of RTX 50-series GPU connectors melting continue to surface, even when users follow the guidelines. While it might seem counterintuitive that loose terminals would benefit such high-power connectors, they accommodate minor misalignments and relieve stress. Assuming the terminals were completely rigid, repeated forceful insertions and removals to achieve perfect contact would induce unwanted wear, thus reducing the connector's lifespan. For a more visual demonstration, we can refer to an X-ray shot shared by Jonny Guru, Corsair's PSU expert and renowned hardware enthusiast. Corsair uses three different vendors for the cables supplied with its PSUs. Some are rated at 0.25mm and 0.55mm, with the majority being 0.44mm. If you find your terminals have too much wiggle room, it's best to contact customer support. RTX 50 reference GPUs cannot detect if each 12V pin is making proper contact. Potential suspects here are internal breaks in the pins or a connector that's not seated correctly. As these topics are closely related, many unsuspecting consumers might mistake the intentional play for a faulty cable or a potential fire hazard, hence Corsair's clarification.

The stock price around this time was $23.96, allowing him to buy 1,043,406 shares. However, Intel's stock price at the time of writing is $18.90, putting the value of Mr. Tan's investments at less than $20 million. However, this recent drop has nothing to do with his performance, as he has only been on the job for around one month. Instead, this dip is part of the market chaos brought on by Trump's tariffs, with Intel and many other chip companies hitting record lows. Some analysts wonder if Tan will purchase more Intel stock at this low price or if the company will launch a stock buyback plan to help reverse this trend. Is he buying more at this lower price, or will Intel announce a buyback like Broadcom to shore things up?$INTC pic.twitter.com/7errZwLUBNApril 8, 2025 It's unlikely that cash-strapped Intel will copy this strategy, though. Aside from that, it would be better for the company to focus on its 18A process node, which has already entered risk production, instead of playing with its stock price. The $5 million reduction in value might seem like a significant sum, but CCN estimates that the Intel CEO is worth at least $593.2 million, which is just a drop in the bucket for him. We'll have to wait and see how the tariffs will play out before we can truly determine if Mr. Tan lost a lot of money today, but hopefully, Intel and the rest of the industry will be able to bounce back from this chaos.

The $600 Ryzen 9 9900X3D is the fastest 12-core gaming chip on the market, but its high price point exposes it to competition from both higher- and lower-cost chips, making it hard to recommend unless it sees a significant price cut. Pricing makes other 3D V-Cache processors the better alternative Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. The Ryzen 9 9900X3D leverages the same game-boosting 3D V-Cache technology as its X3D counterparts to deliver impressive Intel-beating gaming performance while still maintaining most of its performance potential in productivity applications, thus reducing the trade-offs of selecting one of AMD's gaming-specific processors. We've put those claims to the test.Intel isn't much of a contender, as it faces a vexing issue with its latest lineup of chips — it has no single chip that can compete with the Ryzen 9000X3D processors in both gaming and productivity work. The new Core Ultra chips aren't as fast as their prior-gen counterparts in gaming, but they serve up impressive performance in productivity applications. AMD's goal is to master both disciplines — gaming and productivity — with its dual-chiplet X3D processors, but that's a challenge. AMD also added full overclocking support this time around, which we've tested, allowing you to eke out more performance in gaming and productivity work.If you're looking for a quick take on performance, see the image album below, which breaks down performance in gaming and productivity applications. These overall measurements are backed up by our benchmarks and power testing on the following pages, so be sure to check those out. As you can see, the Ryzen 9 9900X3D is compelling, but its counterparts retain distinct advantages. That makes the 9900X3D a better all-rounder than any competing Intel chips, but its real competition comes from within AMD's own lineup. Just as we saw with the last-gen model, the Ryzen 9 9900X3D faces a conundrum due to its price point. As with the prior-gen Ryzen 9 7000X3D chips, the new 9900X3D uses two compute dies, with one die featuring a 3D-stacked V-Cache chiplet that increases L3 cache capacity to 128 MB. Overall, the Ryzen 9 9900X3D is built on the same foundation as the Ryzen 9 9900X; it just has a single L3 SRAM chiplet placed under one of the compute dies.The Zen 5-powered Ryzen 9 9900X3D has 12 active cores and 24 threads spread evenly across the two compute chiplets (six active cores and two deactivated cores per chiplet). AMD's newly-revamped chipset drivers, which we covered in depth here, do a better job of pinning the gaming code to the single compute die with the cache.While gaming, this technique essentially creates a six-core 12-thread processor with 3D V-Cache. Meanwhile, both the 9950X3D and 9800X3D operate as eight-core 16-thread chips while gaming, so they obviously have an inherent advantage in gaming performance, which is reflected in our benchmarks.The 9900X3D's other cores kick in during productivity work, giving you 12 cores and 24 threads to chew through more computationally demanding work faster than you can with the eight-core 9800X3D. Both chips have the same 5.5 GHz base clock. Paul Alcorn is the Managing Editor: News and Emerging Tech for Tom's Hardware US.

U.S. President Donald Trump stated that TSMC would be hit with tariffs as high as 100% if it failed to construct production sites in the U.S., reports Reuters. He also denounced a $6.6 billion financial package provided to TSMC to build fabs in Arizona under the CHIPS Act enacted by the former President Joe Biden, arguing it was unnecessary. Trump says that when he threated Taiwanese chipmakers with massive import duties on their products in the U.S., TSMC agreed to increase its investments in its American operations from $65 billion till 2030 to $165 billion over an unspecified amount of time. TSMC's original plan included four chip production modules at its Fab 21 site near Phoenix, Arizona. The new plan is to build semiconductor chip production modules, two advanced packaging facilities, and an R&D center in the U.S. This time around Trump mentioned "$200 billion in Arizona," which is higher than $165 billion that TSMC committed to spend in March. Considering that now Trump mentions $200 billion and up to 100% import tariffs, this might be seen by TSMC and other semiconductor companies as another threat from the U.S. administration. This comment is made as the industry braces itself for Trump's 'chip tariffs' that are starting 'very soon'. the same industry that is trying to digest the 20% tariff on lithography equipment crucial for chip production that U.S. chipmakers (including but not limited to Intel and TSMC) will have to pay from now on. Perhaps, now the most important fab tools got 20% more expensive for producers of semiconductor, Trump mentions $200 billion instead of $165 billion. The CHIPS Act has attracted over $450 billion in planned private investments in the U.S. from companies like Intel, GlobalFoundries, Micron, Samsung, SK hynix, Texas Instruments, TSMC, as well as their peers from the supply chain, according to SIA.

Intel is introducing new compliance policies for its suppliers, now that the U.S. has imposed new 25% tariffs on aluminum and stainless steel and eliminated all exemptions -- materials that are of surprising importance to the semiconductor industry. In fact, Intel uses quite a lot of metals beyond its semiconductor production facilities. Intel's integrated heat spreaders (IHS) use nickel-plated copper or aluminum for cheap SKUs, and CPU sockets and stiffening frames use stainless steel, as do brackets for various add-in-boards (accelerators, graphics cards, ethernet cards, etc. Since Intel uses quite a lot of aluminum and stainless steel, the company has implemented strict requirements for suppliers shipping products containing steel or aluminum into the United States due to updated U.S. tariff regulations effective March 12, 2025. To comply with customs and avoid shipment delays or penalties, Intel requires suppliers to provide detailed information about the materials used in their products. Intel has made available an official affidavit form that suppliers must complete and submit to the provided email address to support customs clearance.

Suppliers using third-party manufacturers or brokers or purchasing ready-made items from local markets are still responsible for tracing and reporting this information. The lack of traceability does not exempt a product from compliance as suppliers must take steps to gather the data regardless of how the item was acquired. Even parts like warranty replacements or tools and pre-facility kits are subject to these duties, with metal value defined by its purchasing price before any processing. Intel emphasizes working closely with the supply chain to maintain transparency and regulatory compliance, encouraging all partners to use official channels and documentation to support smooth and lawful importation.
