                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal has agreed to pay $11 million to settle a class-action lawsuit over his promotion of the failed Astrals NFT project. A Florida federal judge approved the settlement on April 1, with the order becoming public just this week on April 8, according to court documents. Investors who bought Astrals NFTs or the project's GLXY tokens between May 2022 and January 15, 2024, will now be eligible for compensation from the settlement fund. Judge Federico Moreno previously acknowledged that plaintiffs had made a plausible case that the former NBA star acted as a seller under securities law. The next shot – Shaquille O'Neal and #Astrals NFTs + $GLXY tokens. Judge Moreno ruled these fees were “fair and reasonable,” and noted that none of the plaintiffs objected to the amount lawyers would receive. Court papers indicate that O'Neal urged potential investors to “hop on the wave before it's too late,” something that came to haunt him in court. Astrals were released in April 2022, providing 10,000 one-of-a-kind 3D avatars designed by artist Damien Guimoneau. O'Neal reportedly continued to support the project publicly even after the major cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapsed in November 2022. The court did throw O'Neal one small victory, dismissing claims that he was a “control person” within the project—a designation that would have suggested he held actual power over its operations rather than just serving as its famous face.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTC) retained its positions and market depth, while Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins saw an outflow of liquidity. On the positive side, Q1 arrived with a trend of improved policy climate for crypto, especially for the US market. Despite the improved regulatory climate, most assets did not revisit their all-time highs. The Bitcoin market earned its support from US-based platforms. Cex.IO, Kraken, and Coinbase made up to 60% of available BTC liquidity. Ethereum (ETH) liquidity lost 27% for the same period, reacting more to negative events. As of April 6, 1% ETH liquidity had fallen to $243M, with ongoing selling from whales. Those top 50 assets started the year with $1B in available liquidity, losing 30% on average. Some sectors and narratives saw a more significant outflow. The market depth for SHIB, PEPE, RNDR, and FIL decreased by nearly 50%, while some funds flowed into TAO, ONDO, and XRP. The outflow from the altcoin markets came from US-based traders, who also focused more closely on BTC. Meme tokens saw the biggest outflow of liquidity, caused by a general outflow from risky assets, as well as from negative events linked to highly volatile tokens. As a result, volatility increased, and traders quickly repriced risk. Announcements on tariffs were one of the strongest factors for market shifts. The most awaited ETF are for Solana (SOL) and XRP, but new products have been proposed for LTC, DOGE, as well as legacy networks like Avalanche (AVAX). Stablecoins may continue growing in Q2, on track to expand to their predicted level of $400B by the end of the year. Stablecoins are expanding liquidity, but mostly serve as a way to quickly lock in gains. So far, BTC has lagged behind actual gold, but a weakening US dollar may boost the digital gold narrative.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>XRP, Solana and Dogecoin Lead Altcoin Comeback After Trump Tariff Pause A trio of the top crypto assets by market cap jumped nearly 10% in an hour after President Donald Trump elected to hit pause on his aggressive tariff plan for the next 90 days. “I have authorized a 90-day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered reciprocal tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately,” the President posted on Truth Social. The Nasdaq is up more than 10%, with crypto stocks surging as a result. Gains in altcoins are following in-step, buoyed by the aforementioned trio but extended to other notables like Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), and Sui (SUI), all of which now boast daily gains of at least 10%. Meme coins too are leaping forward, led by flatulence-themed Solana meme coin Fartcoin, which is now up 28% in the last day at $0.725—a gain of 259% in the last month. Other notables on Solana like BONK and WIF have jumped 14% each as well, outperforming even the President's official token TRUMP, which has only gained 8.1% to $8.25 in the last 24 hours. Ethereum meme coins Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) are up more than 10% as well, outperforming the meme category as a whole, which is up 8.5% in the last 24 hours according to CoinGecko. DOGE is furthest away, down 78% from its peak of $0.73 in 2021. The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's cooling futures market has paved the way for a strong price recovery. Bitcoin's (BTC) futures market reflects a possible price cooldown after the cryptocurrency's multiple weeks of correction. Data from CryptoQuant indicated that the BTC-USDT futures leverage ratio with respect to open interest (OI) has halved since peaking in early 2025. Thus, the current market conditions indicate a healthier market reset, which is not overheated and could potentially pave the way for a steady price recovery. Related: Bitcoin futures divergences point to transitioning market — Are BTC bulls accumulating? In an X post, Sina, the co-founder of 21st Capital, presented an update on his Bitcoin Quantile Model and said that “Bitcoin is getting significantly de-risked here.” The analyst explained that Bitcoin might have already completed 75-80% of its correction, declining from $109,000 to $74,500. However, the likelihood of an immediate recovery remains low, as Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. expects BTC to move sideways in the “volatility corridor.” The volatility corridor identified a price range of $75,000 to $96,000, outlined with the help of short-term holders' realized prices over different time periods. Adler Jr. said that it was possible that BTC would consolidate between these levels over the next few weeks but warned that the price must hold a position above the 365-day simple moving average.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pakistan reportedly announced plans to allocate excess power to Bitcoin mining and AI infrastructure, just days after appointing Binance founder Changpeng Zhao as strategic crypto advisor. Pakistan will channel part of its surplus electricity into powering Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, a significant shift in energy and tech policy aimed at turning excess capacity into economic opportunity, according to a report from Reuters. The announcement was made Wednesday by Bilal Bin Saqib, head of Pakistan's Crypto Council and adviser to the finance minister, who also noted that talks have been held with several mining firms. Pakistan's energy sector has long struggled with structural challenges, including high electricity tariffs and chronic overcapacity. The announcement comes just two days after the government appointed Changpeng Zhao (CZ), founder of Binance, as Pakistan's new strategic advisor on crypto. JUST IN: 🇵🇰 PAKISTAN APPOINTS BINANCE FORMER CEO CZ AS STRATEGIC ADVISOR ON CRYPTO pic.twitter.com/oWBoBDWjLg The initiative is being led by Saqib, who in a March 25 interview with Bloomberg invited global firms to explore the country's potential for Bitcoin mining. Saqib also praised recent developments in U.S. crypto policy under President Donald Trump, whom he described as the “biggest, bullish catalyst for crypto in history.” He added, “I think Trump is essentially flipping the script. Trump signed the executive order instructing regulatory bodies to accommodate digital assets, forming the White House crypto advisory team, creating a US strategic Bitcoin reserve.” Trump is making crypto a national priority and every country including Pakistan will have to follow suit or will be at the risk of being left behind.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly central to the global digital economy, decentralized alternatives are beginning to challenge the dominance of corporate-led AI development. As reported by Coinbase, the network offers an estimated annual reward rate of 17.52%, making it a cutting-edge technological platform and an attractive economic opportunity. Modular, independent communities within the network that focus on specific digital commodities. Each subnet operates autonomously, establishing its unique incentive structures and performance benchmarks. Their outputs are evaluated by validators, who rank the quality of each submission. Seth Bloomberg, an investment partner at Crucible Labs, told Forbes, “Crucible acts as a validator—not a subnet—unlike inference-focused subnets such as Manifold or Chutes.” While subnets ensure data accuracy and model performance, Bloomberg emphasized that harmful or illicit content must be moderated at the application layer. With the introduction of Dynamic TAO, each subnet now has its unique token, which miners receive as a reward. Bloomberg says that today, Bittensor hosts over 80 subnets, from experimental projects refining their incentive mechanisms to mature systems actively generating revenue and serving end users. This model redefines what it means to “mine” in the blockchain context. With TAO emitted daily, participants, which include miners, validators, and subnet creators, can earn real income based on their contributions. Underperformers may be de-registered and required to re-enter the system. This ensures that performance, not capital or central authority, dictates success. According to Bittensor's whitepaper, the system includes strong safeguards against collusion and manipulation. This rewards only peers whose evaluations align with the broader network. In contrast to centralized platforms like OpenAI or Google, where access is gated, and development occurs behind closed doors, Bittensor enables global collaboration through an open-source protocol. With growing concerns about centralized AI's ethical and regulatory pitfalls, ranging from data privacy to monopolistic control, Bittensor's model offers a compelling alternative.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Virgil Griffith, a former Ethereum developer jailed for attending a crypto conference in North Korea in 2019, was released from prison and is on his way to a halfway house, according to his lawyer, Alexander Urbelis. Urbelis, general counsel of the Ethereum Name Service who has also been serving as Griffith's outside counsel, posted a photo of the newly released Griffith and his parents on X on Wednesday, standing in front of FCI Milan, the low-security Michigan prison where Griffith served a portion of his 56-month sentence. “I am so pleased to report that VIRGIL IS OUT!” Urbelis wrote. Griffith was arrested in November 2019, seven months after returning from the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, where he had attended a crypto conference. While at the conference, Griffith gave a presentation on Ethereum and explained how cryptocurrency could be used to evade sanctions against the country. The New York judge overseeing the case sentenced him to a $100,000 fine and 63 months, or a little over five years, imprisonment — a fraction of the possible 20 year sentence he faced if he went to trial and lost. Urbelis told CoinDesk that Griffith's legal team has hopes he will soon be moved from his halfway house in Baltimore to home confinement. “But the long-term consequences persist: Virgil will have to endure burdensome probation for several years, the conditions of which are not yet known," Urbelis said. "And on top of that, the Department of Commerce placed severe export restrictions on Virgil that will extend until 2032 and which would make his life very difficult.” The Department of Commerce's restrictions prohibit Griffith from participating either directly or indirectly in any transaction involving software or technology that will be exported from the U.S., Urbelis said, making a return to working in the crypto industry difficult, if not impossible. Griffith is seeking a pardon from President Donald Trump's administration, which Urbelis said was an “ongoing process” they had made “great progress” on. Trump has pardoned a number of people convicted on crypto-related criminal charges, including Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht and former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes and three people convicted of violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). Still more convicted crypto criminals, including former FTX CEO and fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, are hopeful for pardons of their own.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US Treasury will re-evaluate regulations that may be hindering innovation in blockchain, stablecoins, and emerging payment technologies, said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the American Bankers Association conference on Wednesday. 🇺🇸 JUST IN: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says the US government is reviewing “regulatory barriers to blockchain, stablecoins, and emerging payment systems.” pic.twitter.com/G0dctlPSIC The review potentially leads to removal or modification of the current measures as part of the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to encourage innovation, investment, and competitiveness, especially in fintech and crypto-related areas. “We will take a close look at regulatory impediments to blockchain, stablecoins, and new payment systems,” Bessent asserted. One of the key priorities of the current administration is to stimulate economic growth through aggressive deregulation efforts aimed at reducing government oversight and regulatory burdens across industries. The goal is to create a more balanced regulatory environment that fosters economic growth and benefits “Main Street,” not just Wall Street, according to the Treasury Secretary. “Under President Trump's leadership, the Treasury Department and I will deliver that to you.” Mark Uyeda, the acting chair of the US SEC, has recently instructed staff to review regulatory statements concerning crypto, including digital asset investment contract analysis and Bitcoin futures under the Investment Company Act. The move aligns with Executive Order 14192, which aims to reduce regulatory burdens and encourage economic growth by potentially modifying or rescinding certain SEC rules. These reviews could lead to more streamlined regulations for crypto companies.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has signaled a major policy shift toward fostering innovation in financial technology, saying the Trump administration will "take a close look at regulatory impediments to blockchain, stablecoins and new payment systems." What Happened: The remarks came during his keynote address at the American Bankers Association conference in Washington. Under President Trump's leadership, the Treasury Department and I will deliver that to you." The announcement comes at a time when the administration is recalibrating its stance on both domestic financial regulation and international trade strategy. He acknowledged that while America's military relationships with its allies have been strong, economic cooperation has not always kept pace. But we can probably reach a deal with our allies," Bessent said. "Then we can approach China as a group." He issued a sharp warning to the European Union, which recently announced tariffs on approximately €21 billion ($23.2 billion) of U.S. goods in response to metal-related disputes. In particular, Bessent criticized signs of an EU pivot toward Beijing, noting that such a move "would be cutting your own throat." Bessent emphasized that China stands alone in escalating trade tensions with the U.S., while several Indo-Pacific countries, including Japan, Vietnam, South Korea, and India, have initiated or expressed interest in trade negotiations with Washington. A Vietnamese delegation is scheduled to arrive in D.C. this week, he noted. In a Fox Business interview, Bessent labeled China as "the worst offenders in the international trading system." "What Beijing should not do is try to devalue their way out of this," he said, warning that such a move could trigger a chain reaction.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WLFI sells Ethereum at a loss amid tariff tensions and market volatility. World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the DeFi project partly owned by US President Donald Trump‘s family, has begun offloading some Ethereum holdings amid the top asset's recent price struggles. On April 9, blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain, citing data from Arkham Intelligence, reported that a wallet linked to the DeFi venture sold 5,471 ETH for approximately $8.01 million at an average price of $1,465. The sale marks a significant setback for the firm, considering WLFI previously spent $210 million to accumulate 67,498 ETH at an average of $3,259 per coin. Based on current prices, Lookonchain stated that the firm is staring at an unrealized loss of about $125 million. World Liberty Financial has yet to comment publicly on these sales. Market analysts have attributed the slump in part to geopolitical tensions, including the ongoing Trump tariff dispute, which has triggered uncertainty in traditional and crypto markets. Despite ETH's downturn, WLFI secured a significant vote of confidence from DWF Labs. Onchain data shared by the pseudonymous crypto analyst ai_9684xtpa revealed that the Web3 market maker subscribed to 250 million WLFI tokens for $25 million USDC. Notably, this comes a few days after Lookonchain reported that DWF Labs had received 1 million USD1, the stablecoin launched by the Trump-backed project, for market-making purposes. The digital asset has drawn considerable attention since its launch, with WLFI recently submitting a proposal to airdrop USD1 to its token holders. This initiative aims to test WLFI's distribution model and reward early adopters ahead of the stablecoin's public rollout.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new bill introduced in the State of New York could mark a significant turning point for the integration of blockchain technology in democratic processes. On April 8, State Representative Clyde Vanel introduced bill A07716, a legislative initiative that pushes to explore the use of blockchain to enhance the security of registri elettorali and risultati delle elezioni. This is a decisive step that could redefine the relationship between technology and democracy in the United States. Objective: understand if, and to what extent, this technology can improve the reliability and security of the State's voting system. The interest in blockchain applications for voting is not an absolute novelty. In the past, systems capable of using decentralized networks have already been experimented with to ensure transparency, traceability, and trust in the entire electoral process. Even overseas, the topic has sparked debate. About a year ago, Brian Rose, former independent mayoral candidate of London, stated that voting on blockchain could represent a true revolution for modern democracy. “Wouldn't we all sleep better at night if that identity and that vote could really be proven?” On one hand, the introduction of blockchain in electoral processes promises greater reliability, but on the other hand, there is a fundamental limitation. In other words, technology can protect data from tampering after recording, but it cannot guarantee that the original data, once entered, is correct, authentic, or free from human or digital manipulations. Deputy Clyde Vanel has now built a reputation as one of the most active supporters of regulation and technological promotion in the State of New York. He is not new to legislative proposals regarding cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and protection of digital investors. Last March, Vanel proposed another bill to establish criminal penalties against fraud in the crypto field. The deputy's vision has also been felt in public policies. In fact, as early as January of the same year, Vanel recalled how New York had become the first state to establish a task force dedicated to criptovalute. This is aimed at delving into the use, regulation, and definitions related to the world of digital finance. According to Vanel, who in the past has urged for greater participation of the blockchain industry in discussions with legislators, the sector needs to educate the regulators to promote a greater balance between technological innovation and public interest. An idea that today is reflected in its latest proposal on electronic voting, in search of a more secure, transparent, and futuristic model. If the bill is approved, New York could become the pioneer state of a digital transformation in American electoral systems. Consequently making any attempts at fraud more difficult and increasing citizens' trust in democratic mechanisms. However, in-depth analyses, rigorous testing, and expert opinions will be needed to transform a technological promise into a solid and widely adoptable solution. Or if it will remain, for a little while longer, a technology waiting for its opportunity. And New York seems intent on leading the way.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Newswise — Researchers from Shanghai Jiao Tong University have developed Dynamic-EC, a new blockchain storage method that significantly reduces storage overhead—by up to 42%—and increases data processing speeds by 25%. However, high storage costs and slow processing speeds have limited its adoption. Dynamic-EC addresses these barriers, making blockchain systems more affordable, efficient, and scalable. Dynamic vs. Static Encoding Current blockchain storage methods such as BFT-Store and Partition Chain reduce storage costs compared to traditional full replication methods but rely on static encoding schemes. These static methods always assume the worst-case scenario, using unnecessary extra storage. Dynamic-EC, however, uses a unique approach: it dynamically adjusts the redundancy levels based on real-time network risk. By monitoring node reliability through an innovative reputation system, it allocates storage resources only when necessary. Additionally, data writing latency—the time needed to process and store new information—was reduced by up to 25%, resulting in faster blockchain performance. Smart Adaptation to Real-Time Risks Dynamic-EC integrates an advanced node reputation evaluation system, classifying nodes into trustworthy, risky, or malicious categories based on past actions. It actively adapts data redundancy based on actual threats observed in the network. This real-time adaptability conserves storage resources and optimizes performance. “Dynamic-EC is an important step forward because it demonstrates that blockchain systems can be both highly secure and highly efficient,” said Professor Minyi Guo, lead researcher from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. “By dynamically adapting storage redundancy according to real-time risks, we've created a smarter blockchain that minimizes waste and maximizes performance—critical factors for blockchain's widespread adoption.” With substantial improvements over static encoding methods, Dynamic-EC represents an essential advancement in blockchain technology. This innovation moves blockchain closer to mainstream adoption by significantly improving its affordability, security, and operational efficiency.

The chase for Alexander Ovechkin collectibles remains hot after his record-setting 895th goal Sunday, which moved him ahead of Wayne Gretzky as the NHL's all-time leading goal-scorer.

But it isn't all sticks, jerseys and pucks.

NHL Breakaway, the official digital collectible (NFT) platform of the NHL (much in the same vein as NBA TopShot), has created a 1/1 NFT in honor of Ovechkin's landmark goal and is selling it via auction at Heritage.

The pre-sale estimate for the NFT is $25,000, and bidding has topped $7,500 with two weeks remaining.

The platform launched in 2023 and is also selling digital packs dubbed “The Gr8 Chase” for $8.95.

As of early Wednesday, the platform had sold 3,000 of the 8,888 total packs created.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The odds of an emergency Federal Reserve interest rate cut have jumped sharply on Polymarket and Kalshi as Donald Trump's trade war intensifies. A Polymarket poll with over $360,000 in assets shows that these odds have surged to 31%, up from 15% on April 1. Top Wall Street firms like JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs have all raised their recession forecasts. As a result, an emergency interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve is increasingly viewed as a likely response to ease borrowing costs and inject liquidity into the economy. Bitcoin (BTC), Cardano (ADA), and Ripple (XRP) have entered a bear market this year, mirroring the broader downturn in equities. The Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 indices have all fallen over 20% from their 2024 highs, officially entering bear territory. History shows that risky assets like stocks and crypto do well whenever the Federal Reserve implements an emergency interest rate cut. Bitcoin soared from below $4,000 in March 2020 to over $69,000 a year later.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>9th April 2025 – (New York) Cryptocurrency expert Joao, known for accurately predicting significant market movements, has turned his attention to XRP, suggesting that the altcoin may face further declines following its recent crash below the $2 mark. Joao's insights come as part of a broader examination of XRP's potential trajectory, warning that the price might slip below $1, inducing further pain for holders. On his TradingView platform, Joao shared an ominous outlook, describing a potential long-term distribution phase that could be the most turbulent scenario for XRP. His accompanying chart detailed a “radical distribution scheme” that could extend into late 2025, demonstrating the analyst's concern about the altcoin's current market dynamics. Joao explained that XRP could first exhibit signs of weakness, potentially dropping below levels last seen during the COVID-19 market plunge, with the price possibly approaching $0.10. In the first scenario, dubbed Scheme 1, Joao predicts that XRP could dip to $0.10 before staging a bounce back to around $0.40, which he identifies as the final point of significant selling pressure. Conversely, in Scheme 2, Joao suggested a more dramatic outcome, where XRP could experience a rally between $5 and $6.80, with an average peak anticipated around $5.5 to $5.7. Such an outcome would likely incite a wave of euphoria among traders. However, Joao cautioned that this scenario is just one of several extreme possibilities, emphasising that XRP's future price movements will heavily depend on various factors, including Bitcoin's performance, the activities of market makers, overall supply and demand, public interest in digital assets, and broader macroeconomic conditions. Adding to the chorus of caution, fellow crypto analyst John highlighted a bearish trend for XRP. John pointed out a bearish engulfing pattern that appeared on XRP's weekly chart in late March, which has reinforced his outlook for a potential decline. He indicated that should this scenario unfold, the predicted move for XRP could see it fall to approximately $0.65, further exacerbating current concerns among investors. Analyst CasiTrades noted in a post on X that following the significant market downturn on Black Monday, April 7, where the price dipped to around $1.61, this level has become a formidable barrier. This drop not only established new extremes on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) but also narrowly missed major support levels, raising concerns among traders. She posited that this price action aligns with the development of a Wave 3 pattern, which could set the stage for a break through all-time highs (ATHs). If the altcoin were to achieve such a rally, it would not only signify a critical breakthrough of its ATH resistance but could also propel XRP to unprecedented heights.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The department won't pursue cases it feels are better left to financial regulators, focusing instead on crimes committed with cryptocurrency. In a memo sent to staff members Monday night, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the department will no longer pursue cases that he described as better left to financial regulatory agencies. Instead, prosecutors should focus on investigating people who commit crimes using cryptocurrency, such as defrauding investors, dealing narcotics and enabling human trafficking, Blanche said. “The Department of Justice is not a digital assets regulator,” Blanche wrote. President Donald Trump vowed as a candidate to ease restrictions on crypto companies, shoring up his support and donations from tech investors and digital assets executives who said they had been persecuted by Biden administration efforts to regulate the market. Since then, the Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped more than a dozen cases against crypto firms. Meanwhile, the president and first lady Melania Trump have begun selling meme coins, a speculative venture that some industry insiders see as a conflict of interest. In his memo to the Justice Department, Blanche sharply criticized crypto regulatory efforts under President Joe Biden's attorney general, Merrick Garland. “The prior Administration used the Justice Department to pursue a reckless strategy of regulation by prosecution,” Blanche wrote, calling that push “ill conceived and poorly executed.” Blanche said the Justice Department would largely move away from pursuing litigation against crypto companies accused of violating securities, commodities or banking secrecy laws. Choi's team played a leading role in some of the department's most significant crypto cases, including against the owners of Tornado Cash — a cryptocurrency “mixer” alleged to have scrambled funds to obscure their true owners — and the prosecution of Avraham Eisenberg, who was convicted last year in a $110 million market-manipulation case in Manhattan. “It's hard to underestimate the importance this task force has had … in pursuing some really huge crypto hacks and cases,” said Yesha Yadav, a Vanderbilt University law professor who closely follows cryptocurrency and financial markets. Without this team in place, Yadav said, intelligence regarding potential cryptocurrency crimes could become “more diffuse,” making it more difficult for the government to pursue “incredibly nimble, very opportunistic actors in this space.” It was prosecuted with attorneys from the department's Market Integrity and Major Frauds Unit. The case against Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm is set for trial later this year. Prosecutors have accused Storm of knowingly profiting from criminals, including North Korean hackers. Justin D. Weitz, a Morgan Lewis partner and former Justice Department lawyer who oversaw cryptocurrency cases, called Blanche's announcement an abandonment of cases in the digital asset space. “What I see them doing here is recentering focus to be about victims and fraud instead of these technical violations,” Weitz said. If DOJ devotes resources to protect victims of cryptocurrency-related fraud and manipulation, that's going to be a good thing that will make the industry better.” Aaron Schaffer, Nitasha Tiku and Lisa Bonos contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four years after the US Department of Justice has established its cryptocurrency scam unit and watchdog, it is now disbanding the team as it tries to align with what the Trump administration wants for blockchain. Over the past years, this specific unit has focused on going against the use of crypto for different crimes, including fraud, theft, and more. Reuters reported that a new memo from the DOJ has confirmed that it is disbanding the four-year-old National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET). Previously, the NCET focused on prosecuting cryptocurrency scams, which includes fraud, money laundering, and theft, with the team able to win several cases against crypto platforms like Binance, Bitfinex, and Tornado Cash. This also goes alongside the newfound direction of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has stepped back on its crypto regulations focus, for a more welcoming experience for blockchain.

That being said, there are still massive risks tied to the cryptocurrency industry, particularly crypto scam activities that happen daily, in both domestic and foreign levels, according to Engadget. During his rise to power, the market saw an exponential growth towards new all-time highs, and last month, President Trump unveiled the US "Strategic Reserve" initiative, which also helped prices to skyrocket. Furthermore, Trump has already mobilized certain advancements for crypto, such as his previous executive order for a working committee towards regulations.
