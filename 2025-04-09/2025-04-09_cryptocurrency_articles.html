                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paul Atkins is just one oath away from taking over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as President Donald Trump's pick to oversee the nation's securities sector — including whatever role the crypto sector plays in that. A swearing-in ceremony will soon put the former SEC commission in charge of the high-profile regulator — a matter cheered on by the digital assets sector that sees him as a strong ally after his significant background advising crypto firms as a financial-services consultant in Washington. Atkins' Senate confirmation was easily cleared on Wednesday in a 52-44 vote. The SEC has thrown out almost all of its high-profile digital assets enforcement actions, and its staff quickly outlined a number of segments of the industry that it considers outside its jurisdiction — including some stablecoins, memecoins (such as the president's own $TRUMP) and proof-of-work mining. Many of the areas in which the agency has already demonstrated policy shifts overlap with Trump's family crypto businesses, including the family's memecoins and its ties to World Liberty Financial, which has pursued its own stablecoin. Atkins will be taking over those issues to apply permanent standards, potentially directed by future legislation that's now a priority in Congress. Atkins' tenure will begin with an incomplete commission, which is meant to have five members and whose sole Democrat — Caroline Crenshaw — is occupying an already expired term.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>World Food Program USA Accepts Bitcoin and Dogecoin Donations After Funding Cuts The World Food Program USA is now accepting donations in more than 80 cryptocurrencies. The push for new donations comes after the Trump administration ended funding for urgent UN food aid initiatives in 14 impoverished countries—including Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen. WFP USA's chief philanthropy and partnerships officer Dorota Amin says the nonprofit is seeking to modernize, adding: "Traditional aid systems are under immense pressure. Embracing new technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrency isn't just a choice—it's necessary." She says shrinking global humanitarian budgets have come at a time when hunger crises are deepening—and by accepting crypto donations, the organization is "tapping into a growing community of mission-driven individuals eager to create change." The WFP USA added that there are benefits for crypto donors, too. Lower transaction fees mean a greater proportion of a contribution goes toward aid, with the speed of blockchain networks enabling funds to be processed in minutes rather than days. Donations are also tax deductible, the WFP noted, enabling investors to offset capital gains. On Wednesday, the White House said that it planned to reinstate some UN World Food Programme funding, as reported by Reuters, but that it wants the organization to modify some of its programs in certain countries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin prices climbed sharply today as markets processed the latest tariff updates. Bitcoin prices rallied today, climbing over 10% in under 24 hours after President Donald Trump's announcement that he would “pause” tariffs caused an “amazing jump” in the global asset markets, according to analyst Tim Enneking. “The first was what we just witnessed: immediately concerns regarding the absurdly high tariffs have now been removed (with the major exception of China, where the tariffs actually got worse),” Enneking said after Trump posted via social media network Truth Social that while he would start imposing a tariff of 125% on China, tariffs on other countries would drop to 10%. “More importantly, however, was the fact that Trump and most (but not all) of his administration's representatives have insisted that the tariffs were immutable and not a bargaining tool,” he stated. “No one really believed that in their heart of hearts, knowing Trump's negotiating ‘style,' but the fear that tariffs were ‘here to stay come may' was starting to gain traction – and markets were pummeled as a result," Enneking added. The sign of relief from seeing a solid example of that fact can literally be heard around the world!” he said. When asked whether Trump's tariff announcement was the cause today's bitcoin gains, Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, offered a similar take. “Yes, we agree that Bitcoin's rally reflects the broader risk-on mood sparked by Trump's tariff pause, which markets interpreted as a temporary easing of trade tensions," he said via email. However, he emphasized that bitcoin has been displaying a high correlation to other risk assets like stocks. “Despite being touted as a hedge or store of value, Bitcoin continues to behave like a high-beta risk asset—often outperforming during bursts of macro optimism," said DiPasquale. Brett Sifling, wealth manager for Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, also offered his perspective on the situation, offering his views via email. “Earlier today, Trump announced a 90 day pause on most of the tariffs besides China. “This is likely a combination of short-term oversold conditions, short covering, and reassessment after the worst-case scenario was already being priced in,” said Sifling.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ETH's persistent weak performance this year has impacted investor conviction in the market, triggering significant selling pressure in the past few weeks. Verified author and on-chain expert for CryptoQuant, Darkfost, revealed that ETH's Open Interest (OI) on Binance continues to see a steady decline. It also reflects rising caution among investors and traders as the altcoin battles to sustain its bullish momentum. Darkfost highlighted that the open interest on Binance continues to drop without stopping and is now changing under its 365 Simple Moving Average (SMA). This movement implies that speculative activity is pulling back as investors might be waiting for more certain signals before making a forceful comeback to the market. After hitting an all-time high of $7.78 billion in December, the open interest on Binance has decreased by almost 50% between December and April, wiping out nearly $4 billion within the period. The chart shows that ETH's open interest on Binance is now valued at $3.1 billion, suggesting a massive shift in investor sentiment on the platform. According to the on-chain expert, Ethereum's price has been significantly impacted by this sharp drop, and there are no indications that the ongoing downward trend will be stopping anytime soon. With ETH's open interest decreasing on the largest crypto exchange and the market extremely volatile, this raises concerns about its price stability. Nonetheless, many crypto analysts are confident that a rebound could be on the horizon, which is likely to push the altcoin toward new highs. Market expert and trader Milkybull Crypto shared a post on the X platform, outlining Ethereum's potential to surge significantly in the upcoming weeks. Should this level hold, Milkybull anticipates a huge rally, putting his next target at the $10,000 milestone. Risk Warning: Trading may result in the loss of your entire capital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following the announcement, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved Fidelity, BlackRock, Bitwise and Grayscale applications to allow options trading on their spot Ether ETFs. Ethereum has seen increased buying pressure in the past few hours since President Donald Trump announced a 90-day tariff pause on 75 countries. The top altcoin jumped from a two-year low of $1,400 to above $1,650 at press time. Option trading could make an ETF product attractive as it introduces regulated risk management and hedging strategies that are important to institutional investors — especially during periods of market uncertainty like the current trading environment. “SEC has approved options trading on spot eth ETFs…Like w/ btc ETFs, expect to see a bunch of new launches from issuers — Covered call strategy eth ETFs, buffer eth ETFs, etc,” wrote Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store in an X post on Wednesday. The approval comes at a time when ETH ETF holders are seeing increased losses — down over 50% YTD — following the global risk-off sentiment across financial markets. This has largely affected flows in Ethereum ETFs, which have only recorded four days of inflows since February 20, per Farside Investors data. While ETH ETF holders lament, products betting against it have been among the top gainers across the global ETF market since January. I was sure it would be $UVIX (2x VIX), but that's #3. If the rally isn't short-lived, ETH could also reclaim $1,800 and go on to test the descending channel's upper boundary resistance. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) are trending upward but below their neutral levels. A daily candlestick close below $1,500 will invalidate the thesis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has announced a 90-day pause on his reciprocal tariffs, and the stock market is already bouncing back — from the damage caused last week when Trump announced his reciprocal tariffs. Tech stocks, like Apple, Sony, and Microsoft, shot up quickly following Trump's announcement, with Tesla rising particularly fast. As of this writing, Tesla stock was up 22.69 percent for the day. Meanwhile, Intel gained more than 17 percent; Nvidia was up by over 15 percent; and Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and more stocks were spiking as well. "I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately," Trump announced. Tariffs put on goods from countries like China, who responded with their own new reciprocal tariffs, have not been paused. In fact, Trump announced a new 125 percent tariff with China. A global 10 percent tariff, announced over the weekend, will also remain in effect. The slapdash tariff rollout has led to an extremely volatile market. Still, the news of a pause on levies for countries like South Korea and Vietnam was enough to send Apple stock flying upward. The crypto markets also reacted positively to Trump's tariff suspension announcement. Bitcoin was back up over $82,000 as of publication after spending days floundering in the mid-to-upper $70k range. According to the White House, those posts were untrue. So, while Trump's tariff pause was welcome news on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley for the moment, the fallout remains impossible to predict.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin BTCUSD staged a sharp rebound after US President Donald Trump announced a pause on tariffs for non-retaliating countries, reigniting bullish momentum and raising hopes for a potential surge toward the $100,000 mark. On April 9, BTCUSD surged by approximately 9%, reversing most of the losses it incurred earlier in the week, to retest $83,000. In doing so, the pair came closer to validating a falling wedge pattern that has been forming on its daily chart since December 2024. A falling wedge pattern forms when the price trends lower inside a range defined by two converging, descending trendlines. As of April 9, Bitcoin's price was confined within the falling wedge range while eyeing a breakout above its upper trendline at around $83,000. If it is confirmed, BTC's main upside target by June could be around $100,000. If a breakout occurs after testing the $71,100 level, the most conservative upside target for BTC could still be as high as $91,500. Bitcoin's rebound appears just before testing a critical onchain support zone between $65,000 and $71,000, reinforcing the cryptocurrency's bullish outlook toward the 100,000 mark. These metrics estimate the average price at which current, active investors bought their Bitcoin. They filter out coins that haven't moved in a long time or are likely lost, giving a relatively accurate picture of the cost basis for those still participating in the market. In the past, Bitcoin has spent about half the time trading above this price range and half below, making it a good indicator of whether the market is feeling positive or negative, according to Glassnode analysts. “We now have confluence across several onchain price models, highlighting the $65k to $71k price range as a critical area of interest for the bulls to establish long-term support,” they wrote in a recent weekly analysis, adding: Breaking below the $65,000-71,000 range could worsen Bitcoin's probability of retesting $100,000 anytime soon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal has agreed to pay $11 million to settle a class-action lawsuit over his promotion of the failed Astrals NFT project. A Florida federal judge approved the settlement on April 1, with the order becoming public just this week on April 8, according to court documents. Investors who bought Astrals NFTs or the project's GLXY tokens between May 2022 and January 15, 2024, will now be eligible for compensation from the settlement fund. Judge Federico Moreno previously acknowledged that plaintiffs had made a plausible case that the former NBA star acted as a seller under securities law. The next shot – Shaquille O'Neal and #Astrals NFTs + $GLXY tokens. Judge Moreno ruled these fees were “fair and reasonable,” and noted that none of the plaintiffs objected to the amount lawyers would receive. Court papers indicate that O'Neal urged potential investors to “hop on the wave before it's too late,” something that came to haunt him in court. Astrals were released in April 2022, providing 10,000 one-of-a-kind 3D avatars designed by artist Damien Guimoneau. O'Neal reportedly continued to support the project publicly even after the major cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapsed in November 2022. The court did throw O'Neal one small victory, dismissing claims that he was a “control person” within the project—a designation that would have suggested he held actual power over its operations rather than just serving as its famous face.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Legendary professional wrestler Ric Flair launched a tokenized sticker collection on Telegram on April 9, becoming the latest celebrity to launch a tokenized social project. Spokespeople for the project told Cointelegraph they are considering rewarding early sticker holders with future perks, though no specifics were shared. Flair told Cointelegraph that the project was launched to drive community engagement and added: The wrestler's tokenized sticker launch follows mixed-martial arts champion and Irish political candidate Conor McGregor's memecoin launch on April 5, which failed and highlights the struggle of risk-on investments and digital assets amid the recent macroeconomic downturn. Flair, who retired from wrestling in 2022, has previously ventured into the crypto space. coin (WOOOOO), a memecoin inspired by his iconic catchphrase. The token has no trading activity as of April 9, 2025, with only one address controlling over 70% of the supply, according to CoinMarketCap.The legendary wrestler has a history of merchandising his brand through various collectibles, including physical stickers available on his official online store and Amazon. Wrestling icon Ric Flair joins Telegram and touts new project. However, since then, memecoin prices have plummeted, with many top-tier memecoins such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe (PEPE) shedding approximately 70-80% of their value over the period. Crypto markets bleed amid macroeconomic downturn, particularly altcoins, memes, and other social tokens. Conor McGregor's REAL token launched amid the macroeconomic crash and failed to meet its $1 million minimum funding requirement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WLFI sells Ethereum at a loss amid tariff tensions and market volatility. World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the DeFi project partly owned by US President Donald Trump‘s family, has begun offloading some Ethereum holdings amid the top asset's recent price struggles. On April 9, blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain, citing data from Arkham Intelligence, reported that a wallet linked to the DeFi venture sold 5,471 ETH for approximately $8.01 million at an average price of $1,465. The sale marks a significant setback for the firm, considering WLFI previously spent $210 million to accumulate 67,498 ETH at an average of $3,259 per coin. Based on current prices, Lookonchain stated that the firm is staring at an unrealized loss of about $125 million. World Liberty Financial has yet to comment publicly on these sales. Market analysts have attributed the slump in part to geopolitical tensions, including the ongoing Trump tariff dispute, which has triggered uncertainty in traditional and crypto markets. Despite ETH's downturn, WLFI secured a significant vote of confidence from DWF Labs. Onchain data shared by the pseudonymous crypto analyst ai_9684xtpa revealed that the Web3 market maker subscribed to 250 million WLFI tokens for $25 million USDC. Notably, this comes a few days after Lookonchain reported that DWF Labs had received 1 million USD1, the stablecoin launched by the Trump-backed project, for market-making purposes. The digital asset has drawn considerable attention since its launch, with WLFI recently submitting a proposal to airdrop USD1 to its token holders. This initiative aims to test WLFI's distribution model and reward early adopters ahead of the stablecoin's public rollout.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new bill introduced in the State of New York could mark a significant turning point for the integration of blockchain technology in democratic processes. On April 8, State Representative Clyde Vanel introduced bill A07716, a legislative initiative that pushes to explore the use of blockchain to enhance the security of registri elettorali and risultati delle elezioni. This is a decisive step that could redefine the relationship between technology and democracy in the United States. Objective: understand if, and to what extent, this technology can improve the reliability and security of the State's voting system. The interest in blockchain applications for voting is not an absolute novelty. In the past, systems capable of using decentralized networks have already been experimented with to ensure transparency, traceability, and trust in the entire electoral process. Even overseas, the topic has sparked debate. About a year ago, Brian Rose, former independent mayoral candidate of London, stated that voting on blockchain could represent a true revolution for modern democracy. “Wouldn't we all sleep better at night if that identity and that vote could really be proven?” On one hand, the introduction of blockchain in electoral processes promises greater reliability, but on the other hand, there is a fundamental limitation. In other words, technology can protect data from tampering after recording, but it cannot guarantee that the original data, once entered, is correct, authentic, or free from human or digital manipulations. Deputy Clyde Vanel has now built a reputation as one of the most active supporters of regulation and technological promotion in the State of New York. He is not new to legislative proposals regarding cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and protection of digital investors. Last March, Vanel proposed another bill to establish criminal penalties against fraud in the crypto field. The deputy's vision has also been felt in public policies. In fact, as early as January of the same year, Vanel recalled how New York had become the first state to establish a task force dedicated to criptovalute. This is aimed at delving into the use, regulation, and definitions related to the world of digital finance. According to Vanel, who in the past has urged for greater participation of the blockchain industry in discussions with legislators, the sector needs to educate the regulators to promote a greater balance between technological innovation and public interest. An idea that today is reflected in its latest proposal on electronic voting, in search of a more secure, transparent, and futuristic model. If the bill is approved, New York could become the pioneer state of a digital transformation in American electoral systems. Consequently making any attempts at fraud more difficult and increasing citizens' trust in democratic mechanisms. However, in-depth analyses, rigorous testing, and expert opinions will be needed to transform a technological promise into a solid and widely adoptable solution. Or if it will remain, for a little while longer, a technology waiting for its opportunity. And New York seems intent on leading the way.</p>

The chase for Alexander Ovechkin collectibles remains hot after his record-setting 895th goal Sunday, which moved him ahead of Wayne Gretzky as the NHL's all-time leading goal-scorer.

But it isn't all sticks, jerseys and pucks.

NHL Breakaway, the official digital collectible (NFT) platform of the NHL (much in the same vein as NBA TopShot), has created a 1/1 NFT in honor of Ovechkin's landmark goal and is selling it via auction at Heritage.

The pre-sale estimate for the NFT is $25,000, and bidding has topped $7,500 with two weeks remaining.

The platform launched in 2023 and is also selling digital packs dubbed “The Gr8 Chase” for $8.95.

As of early Wednesday, the platform had sold 3,000 of the 8,888 total packs created.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The odds of an emergency Federal Reserve interest rate cut have jumped sharply on Polymarket and Kalshi as Donald Trump's trade war intensifies. A Polymarket poll with over $360,000 in assets shows that these odds have surged to 31%, up from 15% on April 1. Top Wall Street firms like JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs have all raised their recession forecasts. As a result, an emergency interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve is increasingly viewed as a likely response to ease borrowing costs and inject liquidity into the economy. Bitcoin (BTC), Cardano (ADA), and Ripple (XRP) have entered a bear market this year, mirroring the broader downturn in equities. The Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 indices have all fallen over 20% from their 2024 highs, officially entering bear territory. History shows that risky assets like stocks and crypto do well whenever the Federal Reserve implements an emergency interest rate cut. Bitcoin soared from below $4,000 in March 2020 to over $69,000 a year later.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>9th April 2025 – (New York) Cryptocurrency expert Joao, known for accurately predicting significant market movements, has turned his attention to XRP, suggesting that the altcoin may face further declines following its recent crash below the $2 mark. Joao's insights come as part of a broader examination of XRP's potential trajectory, warning that the price might slip below $1, inducing further pain for holders. On his TradingView platform, Joao shared an ominous outlook, describing a potential long-term distribution phase that could be the most turbulent scenario for XRP. His accompanying chart detailed a “radical distribution scheme” that could extend into late 2025, demonstrating the analyst's concern about the altcoin's current market dynamics. Joao explained that XRP could first exhibit signs of weakness, potentially dropping below levels last seen during the COVID-19 market plunge, with the price possibly approaching $0.10. In the first scenario, dubbed Scheme 1, Joao predicts that XRP could dip to $0.10 before staging a bounce back to around $0.40, which he identifies as the final point of significant selling pressure. Conversely, in Scheme 2, Joao suggested a more dramatic outcome, where XRP could experience a rally between $5 and $6.80, with an average peak anticipated around $5.5 to $5.7. Such an outcome would likely incite a wave of euphoria among traders. However, Joao cautioned that this scenario is just one of several extreme possibilities, emphasising that XRP's future price movements will heavily depend on various factors, including Bitcoin's performance, the activities of market makers, overall supply and demand, public interest in digital assets, and broader macroeconomic conditions. Adding to the chorus of caution, fellow crypto analyst John highlighted a bearish trend for XRP. John pointed out a bearish engulfing pattern that appeared on XRP's weekly chart in late March, which has reinforced his outlook for a potential decline. He indicated that should this scenario unfold, the predicted move for XRP could see it fall to approximately $0.65, further exacerbating current concerns among investors. Analyst CasiTrades noted in a post on X that following the significant market downturn on Black Monday, April 7, where the price dipped to around $1.61, this level has become a formidable barrier. This drop not only established new extremes on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) but also narrowly missed major support levels, raising concerns among traders. She posited that this price action aligns with the development of a Wave 3 pattern, which could set the stage for a break through all-time highs (ATHs). If the altcoin were to achieve such a rally, it would not only signify a critical breakthrough of its ATH resistance but could also propel XRP to unprecedented heights.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The department won't pursue cases it feels are better left to financial regulators, focusing instead on crimes committed with cryptocurrency. In a memo sent to staff members Monday night, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the department will no longer pursue cases that he described as better left to financial regulatory agencies. Instead, prosecutors should focus on investigating people who commit crimes using cryptocurrency, such as defrauding investors, dealing narcotics and enabling human trafficking, Blanche said. “The Department of Justice is not a digital assets regulator,” Blanche wrote. President Donald Trump vowed as a candidate to ease restrictions on crypto companies, shoring up his support and donations from tech investors and digital assets executives who said they had been persecuted by Biden administration efforts to regulate the market. Since then, the Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped more than a dozen cases against crypto firms. Meanwhile, the president and first lady Melania Trump have begun selling meme coins, a speculative venture that some industry insiders see as a conflict of interest. In his memo to the Justice Department, Blanche sharply criticized crypto regulatory efforts under President Joe Biden's attorney general, Merrick Garland. “The prior Administration used the Justice Department to pursue a reckless strategy of regulation by prosecution,” Blanche wrote, calling that push “ill conceived and poorly executed.” Blanche said the Justice Department would largely move away from pursuing litigation against crypto companies accused of violating securities, commodities or banking secrecy laws. Choi's team played a leading role in some of the department's most significant crypto cases, including against the owners of Tornado Cash — a cryptocurrency “mixer” alleged to have scrambled funds to obscure their true owners — and the prosecution of Avraham Eisenberg, who was convicted last year in a $110 million market-manipulation case in Manhattan. “It's hard to underestimate the importance this task force has had … in pursuing some really huge crypto hacks and cases,” said Yesha Yadav, a Vanderbilt University law professor who closely follows cryptocurrency and financial markets. Without this team in place, Yadav said, intelligence regarding potential cryptocurrency crimes could become “more diffuse,” making it more difficult for the government to pursue “incredibly nimble, very opportunistic actors in this space.” It was prosecuted with attorneys from the department's Market Integrity and Major Frauds Unit. The case against Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm is set for trial later this year. Prosecutors have accused Storm of knowingly profiting from criminals, including North Korean hackers. Justin D. Weitz, a Morgan Lewis partner and former Justice Department lawyer who oversaw cryptocurrency cases, called Blanche's announcement an abandonment of cases in the digital asset space. “What I see them doing here is recentering focus to be about victims and fraud instead of these technical violations,” Weitz said. If DOJ devotes resources to protect victims of cryptocurrency-related fraud and manipulation, that's going to be a good thing that will make the industry better.” Aaron Schaffer, Nitasha Tiku and Lisa Bonos contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four years after the US Department of Justice has established its cryptocurrency scam unit and watchdog, it is now disbanding the team as it tries to align with what the Trump administration wants for blockchain. Over the past years, this specific unit has focused on going against the use of crypto for different crimes, including fraud, theft, and more. Reuters reported that a new memo from the DOJ has confirmed that it is disbanding the four-year-old National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET). Previously, the NCET focused on prosecuting cryptocurrency scams, which includes fraud, money laundering, and theft, with the team able to win several cases against crypto platforms like Binance, Bitfinex, and Tornado Cash. This also goes alongside the newfound direction of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has stepped back on its crypto regulations focus, for a more welcoming experience for blockchain.

That being said, there are still massive risks tied to the cryptocurrency industry, particularly crypto scam activities that happen daily, in both domestic and foreign levels, according to Engadget. During his rise to power, the market saw an exponential growth towards new all-time highs, and last month, President Trump unveiled the US "Strategic Reserve" initiative, which also helped prices to skyrocket. Furthermore, Trump has already mobilized certain advancements for crypto, such as his previous executive order for a working committee towards regulations.
