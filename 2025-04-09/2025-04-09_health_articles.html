                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tim-3 is an immune checkpoint molecule involved in immunity and inflammation recently linked to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its role in the brain was unknown until now. In a paper published in Nature, researchers from Mass General Brigham used preclinical models to uncover Tim-3's role in microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, and have identified it as a promising therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer immunotherapy, and it is exciting that we might be able to repurpose them to treat Alzheimer's disease. Microglia are pivotal in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and therapeutic targeting of Tim-3 in microglia may alter them to an optimal state to fight the disease pathology in AD. " Using a mouse model of AD, the Kuchroo lab together with Oleg Butovsky lab, at the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases at BWH, determined that Tim-3 is only expressed in microglia in the central nervous system, where it helps the cells maintain a healthy state of homeostasis. Tim-3 can also, however, prevent the brain from effectively clearing out the toxic plaques that accumulate during AD. The researchers found that deleting Tim-3 helped kickstart plaque removal by prompting the microglia to eat up more of the plaques, while also producing anti-inflammatory proteins to reduce neuroinflammation, and limiting cognitive impairment. Over a half-dozen clinical trials are currently testing therapeutics that target Tim-3 to treat patients with immunotherapy-resistant cancers. Immune checkpoint TIM-3 regulates microglia and Alzheimer's disease.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investigators from Mass General Brigham and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center have developed STITCHR, a new gene editing tool that can insert therapeutic genes into specific locations without causing unwanted mutations. The system can be formulated completely as RNA, dramatically simplifying delivery logistics compared to traditional systems that use both RNA and DNA. By inserting an entire gene, the tool offers a one-and-done approach that overcomes hurdles from CRISPR gene editing technology-which is programmed to correct individual mutations-offering a promising step forward for gene therapy. CRISPR can't target every location in the genome, and it can't fix the thousands of mutations present in diseases like cystic fibrosis," said co-senior author Omar Abudayyeh, PhD, an investigator at the Gene and Cell Therapy Institute (GCTI) at Mass General Brigham and Engineering in Medicine Division in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH). "When we started our lab, one of the big things we wanted to figure out was how to insert large pieces of genes, or even entire genes, to replace faulty ones. STITCHR harnesses the power of enzymes from genetic elements called retrotransposons, which are found in all eukaryotic cells, including animals, fungi, and plants. They are often called "jumping genes" for their tendency to move around and insert themselves into the genome. The researchers recognized how the copy-and-paste mechanism they use to move could be repurposed to edit genes at specific locations. The research team, with lead study author Christopher Fell, PhD, also of the GCTI and BWH Division of Engineering in Medicine, then used a computational approach to screen thousands of retrotransposons to identify some that could potentially be reprogrammed, which they tested in the lab. The researchers plan to continue enhancing efficiency of the system and are working towards translating STITCHR for clinical applications. By studying basic biology in our cells, we can find inspiration for new tools.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>General practitioners are now "prescribing" parkrun for their patients as part of a social prescribing initiative to promote preventative care. Parkrun is an organized, timed, and free 5 km run, jog, walk, or wheel on Saturday mornings-in parks, on beaches, or on trails around the world but mainly in the UK, where it originated. Parkrun has some paid staff, but the work of setting up, timing, and result processing is done by local volunteer teams. "I love parkrun and believe that it can make a real difference to public health," writes McCartney. Prescribing is for drugs that are, in general, deemed too dangerous for the public to have direct access to. Turning parkrun into a prescription makes it less about pleasure and fun, more like work and compliance, she argues. "This approach doesn't support patient autonomy or embedding social resources for a community. Instead, it grapples with gatekeeping and-literally-medicalises a walk in the park." What's more, prescribing parkrun is not, as some researchers have described it, a "simple, cost effective solution for sustainability, improving wellbeing, reducing loneliness, and disease prevention." While some people may very much like it, get all of these advantages, regularly attend, and enjoy all the benefits that come with socialising, fresh air, and friendly venues for exercise, McCartney points out that 43% of people who register for parkrun don't attend, 22% participate only once, and people who describe themselves as physically inactive are less likely to return. The Royal College of General Practitioners' approval for "prescribing" parkrun could also be considered catnip to commercial sponsors, she adds. For example, the Advertising Standards Authority previously told Healthspan, a vitamin supplier, to change its health claims after parkrun included one of their adverts in their newsletter. But partnerships risk commercial opportunism, and medicalising exercise is a retrograde step. Prescribing parkrun: medicalising a walk in the park.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study carried out by researchers from the University of Granada (UGR), in collaboration with the Andalusian Association of Midwives, has determined that the healthcare provided by these qualified professionals has a positive impact on health and on the functioning of healthcare systems internationally. The umbrella review was based on a sample of 228,509 pregnant women, 72,388 postpartum women and 7,931 midwives from various countries, including Australia, Iran, Spain, the United States, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Canada and China. The article, which appears in Matronas Hoy, a journal published by the Spanish Association of Midwives, was written by Rafael Caparrós González, a researcher at the UGR's Department of Nursing, and his team. «Midwifery is an internationally recognised profession in all health systems and midwives are considered essential figures in the sexual and reproductive health of women throughout their lives, and in the overall health of newborns up to 28 days after birth,» says Caparrós. Midwives are also able to reduce the number of induced births. In this regard, there is scientific evidence that children born through induced labour are at a higher risk of developing neurological disorders by age 12. «In addition, according to the World Health Organization, women assisted by qualified midwives are more likely to continue breastfeeding six months after giving birth, which has been shown to be neuroprotective for babies,» adds Caparrós. This professional care also has a positive impact on perinatal mental health, i.e. the mental health of women during pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period, by reducing levels of tokophobia (fear of childbirth), anxiety, and stress, which in turn leads to less frequent use of epidurals and medical instruments during childbirth. «In Australia, it has been calculated that midwives generate savings of 12 million dollars a year. With regard to breastfeeding in Spain, the savings could reach 5.6 million euros per year for each percentage point increase in exclusive breastfeeding rates. And in England, the savings from improved perinatal mental health generate savings of approximately 6.6 million pounds per year,» the researcher concludes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cancer diagnoses traditionally require invasive or labor-intensive procedures such as tissue biopsies. Now, research published in ACS Central Science reveals a method that uses pulsed infrared light to identify molecular profiles in blood plasma that could indicate the presence of certain common cancers. In this proof-of-concept study, blood plasma from more than 2,000 people was analyzed to link molecular patterns to lung cancer, extrapolating a potential "cancer fingerprint." It carries diverse molecules such as proteins, metabolites, lipids and salts throughout the body. Some molecules carried by blood plasma indicate potential health conditions. To look for telltale chemical patterns of cancer, Mihaela Žigman and colleagues tested a technique called electric-field molecular fingerprinting that uses pulsed infrared light to profile complex molecular mixtures in blood plasma. First, the researchers used the electric-field molecular fingerprinting technique to send ultra-short bursts of infrared light through plasma. They analyzed samples from 2,533 study participants, including people with lung, prostate, breast or bladder cancer and those without cancer. Using these complex patterns from individuals with and without cancer, the researchers taught a machine learning model to identify molecular signatures associated with the four types of cancer. The computer model was tested on a separate subset of participants' samples to see how well the model could perform on unseen test data. The analytical technique demonstrated a convincing level of accuracy (up to 81%) in detecting lung cancer-specific infrared signatures and differentiating them from control samples obtained from individuals without cancer. Laser-based infrared molecular fingerprinting detects cancer, demonstrating its potential for clinical diagnostics. With further technological developments and independent validation in sufficiently powered clinical studies, it could establish generalizable applications and translate into clinical practice - advancing the way we diagnose and screen for cancer today."

As pediatricians, we have spearheaded efforts to educate parents and support vaccine recommendations, leading to significant reductions or eliminations of numerous infectious diseases in the United States. Many were alarmed by the response of Health and Human Services Head Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, who downplayed the severity of the situation by stating, "Outbreaks happen all the time... healthy children don't die from measles," and suggested that diet and vitamins could prevent infectious diseases without urging vaccination. Tables 1 and 2 show the impact of administering immunizations. The US program has achieved a level of success such that many healthcare providers have never encountered patients with several of the listed diseases. Between 1914 and 1955, seven vaccines were licensed in the US, including rabies, typhoid, pertussis, influenza, tetanus, diphtheria toxoids, and polio. In 1962, President Kennedy signed the Vaccination Assistance Act for mass immunization campaigns. At that time, only diphtheria-tetanus-polio and smallpox vaccines were available. The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) was established in 1964. It is a federal advisory committee charged to review current licensed vaccines and all newly licensed vaccines, and to make recommendations for their use to the CDC director for the US civilian population. This outbreak led to the birth of 20,000 neonates with congenital rubella syndrome, along with an increase in fetal losses (11,250) and neonatal deaths (2100). Measles remained a concern, with 500,000 cases occurring annually. However, smallpox remained an issue globally, and proof of vaccine receipt was often required for international travel. In 1966, the World Health Organization launched a global smallpox eradication program, with 44 countries participating. Over 20 new vaccines or new formulations of older ones were licensed, and ACIP recommendations for use were published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Not all licensed vaccines are recommended for routine use; many are intended for international travel or specific populations, such as military personnel or laboratory staff. Currently, there are 12 vaccines providing protection against 16 diseases on the routine childhood schedule, and four vaccines providing protection against six diseases on the routine adolescent schedule. Many, including myself, have observed the decline in cases of Haemophilus influenzae type b, invasive pneumococcal disease, rotavirus, and varicella since the vaccines were licensed. Historically, we have experienced small outbreaks, typically secondary to international travel in unvaccinated individuals. As of March 24, 2025, 350 outbreak-related cases have been reported from Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma alone. There are additional unrelated measles cases from 10 other jurisdictions. New leadership at the CDC, and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s suggestion to review the link between vaccines and autism, may unnecessarily raise parents' concerns about vaccine safety. Extensive research has consistently demonstrated that vaccines are both safe and effective. Extensive scientific research has demonstrated that there is no correlation between vaccines and autism. Conducting this study again diverts resources from essential research, such as determining the causes of autism. It may also result in lower immunization rates, potentially leading to a resurgence of preventable diseases. For the 2023-2024 school year, CDC reported US kindergarten immunization rates: DTaP (92.3%), HBV (93%), MMR (92.7%), polio (93%), and varicella (92.6%), all showing declines from 2022-2023. As the primary care provider, you are a highly trusted information source. Our goal is to prevent additional measles cases and other vaccine-preventable diseases from resurfacing.

Back pressure regulators (BPR) have, until now, been fixed and manually or electronically adjustable through the external control of gas pressure. "The wetted flow path of the Vapourtec eBPR has only Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and Perfluoroalkoxy alkanes (PFA) fluoropolymers contact surfaces," he added. The stats are impressive with Vapourtec's eBPR delivering precise control of back pressure in the range 0.5 to 20 bar (g) over a flowrate range of 0.05 ml/min to 30 ml/min. It works with fluid temperatures up to 100 C. The eBPR is available with or without an integrated user interface with both options having the choice of remotely setting back pressure by serial commands using RS232 protocols. The eBPR is a game changer when it comes to back pressure regulation offering flexibility, precise control and increased scope for novel chemistry."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oregon State University researchers have discovered a way to get anti-inflammatory medicine across the blood-brain barrier, opening the door to potential new therapies for a range of conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and cancer cachexia. The delivery method involves specially engineered nanoparticles, tiny bits of matter no larger than 100 billionths of a meter. Tested in a mouse model, the dual peptide-functionalized polymeric nanocarriers reached their intended destination, the hypothalamus, and delivered a drug that inhibits a key protein associated with inflammation. "Our work presents a significant breakthrough," said Oleh Taratula, professor in the OSU College of Pharmacy. Findings were published today in Advanced Healthcare Materials. In this study, researchers specifically looked at the hypothalamus as it pertains to cachexia, a deadly weight-loss condition associated with cancers of the ovaries, stomach, lungs and pancreas and other chronic conditions such as renal failure, cystic fibrosis, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and HIV. People with cancer cachexia will lose weight even if they eat, and not just fat but muscle mass as well. The debilitating syndrome affects up to 80% of advanced cancer patients and kills as many as 30% of the cancer patients it afflicts. Inflammation of the hypothalamus plays a pivotal role in dysregulating those patients' appetite and metabolism. As cachexia progresses, it significantly impacts quality of life, treatment tolerance and overall survival chances." Oleh Taratula, Professor, OSU College of Pharmacy But it can also deny entry to therapeutic agents. "Our nanocarriers show a dual-targeting capability, and once in the microglia, drug release is triggered by elevated intracellular glutathione levels. We demonstrated, for the first time, that nanocarriers can successfully deliver an IRAK4 inhibitor to the hypothalamus of mice with cancer cachexia." The scientists observed substantial reductions in key inflammatory markers in the hypothalamus, and the nanocarriers led to a 94% increase in food intake and significantly preserved body weight and muscle mass. And the implications extend far beyond cancer cachexia, Taratula added. "The nanoplatform's ability to deliver therapeutics across the BBB and target microglia opens new possibilities for treating neurological conditions characterized by brain inflammation, including Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis," he said. Taratula was joined in the study by College of Pharmacy colleagues Yoon Tae Goo, Vladislav Grigoriev, Tetiana Korzun, Kongbrailatpam Shitaljit Sharma, Prem Singh and Olena Taratula, and by Daniel Marks from Endevica Bio.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team of researchers from the Rice Biotech Launch Pad at Rice University has developed an implantable "cytokine factory" that safely triggers potent immune responses against hard-to-treat cancers, including metastatic melanoma, pancreatic and colorectal tumors. The study, published in The Journal of ImmunoTherapy of Cancer, details how an immunoprotected device near the tumor microenvironment containing cells engineered to locally release interleukin-12 (IL-12) - an "IL-12 cytokine factory" - successfully induces the recruitment of specialized immune cells called precursor exhausted T cells (Tpex cells). In addition to this robust efficacy signal, the IL-12 cytokine factory demonstrated safety in both mouse and nonhuman primate models. This published research will serve as the foundation for an investigational new drug application (IND) with the U.S. FDA in early 2026, and RBL LLC expects to launch an emerging biotech company centered on the groundbreaking IL-12 cytokine factory technology. "We designed the IL-12 cytokine factory to enhance immunotherapy approaches while minimizing toxicity, a critical need in the treatment of particularly aggressive cancers," said Omid Veiseh, professor of bioengineering, faculty director of the Rice Biotech Launch Pad and senior corresponding author of the publication. "IL-12 is particularly impactful compared to other cytokines, as our research demonstrates that other cytokines primarily recruit homogeneous T cell populations and show reduced efficacy over time, while IL-12 generates a more robust antitumor response by recruiting a more durable, broader repertoire of tumor-targeting T cells. "We are incredibly grateful to ARPA-H for their support in advancing this groundbreaking project and are hopeful that this technology will significantly impact the lives of cancer patients by enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy approaches in the clinic." Harnessing the cellular immune system to target solid tumors is a common but often fraught approach to fighting cancer as the associated challenge of efficacious treatment without toxicity remains elusive. Our study demonstrates not only the efficacy of this technology in preclinical models but also its safety profile, which is a critical aspect as we move toward clinical trials. This research represents an important step forward in the quest to provide more effective treatments for patients battling metastatic cancers."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recent publication in the International Journal of Cardiology, Pulmonary artery denervation in pulmonary hypertension: A comprehensive meta-analysis, has shed light on the potential of pulmonary artery denervation (PADN) as an innovative intervention for pulmonary hypertension (PH), a condition that places patients at risk for right heart failure and death. Co-authored by Dr. James Jenkins, a cardiologist at Ochsner Health, the study analyzed data from multiple clinical trials to assess the therapeutic and clinical impact of PADN in PH patients. PADN has emerged as a promising treatment, showing significant improvements in several key hemodynamic parameters and clinical outcomes. The meta-analysis, which reviewed 14 studies involving 372 patients, revealed that PADN could reduce metrics such as mean right atrial pressure (mRAP), mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Simultaneously, it improved cardiac output (CO) and performance on the six-minute walk test (6MWT), highlighting its potential to enhance overall patient health. Despite these encouraging results, the authors emphasize the importance of conducting larger-scale clinical trials to confirm PADN's efficacy, establish its safety profile, and refine treatment protocols. Future research should also investigate the procedure's long-term effects on patient outcomes and quality of life. While our findings suggest a substantial role for PADN in treatment protocols, continuous research is crucial to fully understand its broader implications and long-term benefits." As cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death globally, advancements like this represent critical progress in addressing life-threatening conditions. This study not only underscores the value of innovation in cardiology but also highlights the ongoing need for rigorous research to develop more effective and life-changing treatments for patients with complex conditions like pulmonary hypertension.
