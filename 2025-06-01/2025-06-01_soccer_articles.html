Today, U.S. Soccer announced that defenders Walker Zimmerman and Nathan Harriel along with forward Paxten Aaronson will be added to the USMNT roster. They will replace three injured players: DeJuan Jones (lower body), Sean Zawadzki (knee) and Folarin Balogun (ankle). Walker Zimmerman enters camp as one of the most experienced players, with 43 USMNT caps. Paxten Aaronson joins his older brother Brendan on the team after a successful loan stint at FC Utrecht. Nathan Harriel has excelled for the Philadelphia Union and has been in national team camps, but Harriel is in search for his first cap.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Folarin Balogun is the latest projected United States men's national team starter to withdraw from Concacaf Gold Cup duty this summer, joining the likes of Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson and Yunus Musah. Monaco striker Balogun was unable to recover in time from the ankle ailment he suffered last month playing for the French Ligue 1 club and will be replaced on USMNT coach's 27-man training camp roster by Eintracht Frankfurt winger Paxten Aaronson. Two other players were also dropped from the squad on Sunday because of injury, U.S. Soccer announced. San Jose Earthquakes fullback DeJaun Jones has what the federation called a "lower body injury," while midfielder Sean Zawadzki of the Columbus Crew has a knee problem. Philadelphia Union defender Nathan Harriel and center back Walker Zimmerman, who started three of the Americans' four games at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, were summoned to replace Jones and Zawadzki. With 43 career caps, Zimmerman becomes the third-most experienced player in camp after Tim Ream and Matt Turner. The 21-year-old had six goals and four assists in 28 games for Dutch Eredivisie side Utrecht last season while on loan from Frankfurt. The U.S. plays the first of its two Gold Cup tuneups on Saturday against Türkiye in East Hartford, Connecticut, then travels west to face Switzerland three days later in Nashville, Tennnessee. Pochettino's team opens the tournament proper on June 15 against Trinidad and Tobago in San Jose, California, then closes out group play with matches against Haiti and guest nation Saudi Arabia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. men's national team has announced three roster changes ahead of its June camp, with DeJuan Jones (lower body), Sean Zawadzki (knee) and Folarin Balogun (ankle) all departing. Walker Zimmerman, Paxten Aaronson and Nathan Harriel have been added to the roster in that trio's place. Mauricio Pochettino called in a 27-man roster for the team's upcoming friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland. That group is expected to comprise the bulk of the 26-man roster for the Gold Cup, which is due to Concacaf by Wednesday. The USMNT will face Turkey on Saturday at Pratt & Whitney Stadium in East Hartford, Conn (3:30 p.m. Pochettino's side will then kick off the Gold Cup against Trinidad and Tobago on June 15. Losing Balogun is a blow for the USMNT, with the team's forward position now in major flux. Ricardo Pepi missed out on the current roster with injury, while Josh Sargent was omitted for sporting reasons. Balogun suffered the ankle injury in training ahead of Monaco's penultimate game of the season, missing his team's last two games. The 23-year-old has yet to play for Pochettino after missing a majority of the 2024-25 season with a shoulder injury. None of the three replacements Pochettino called in are forwards, leaving Patrick Agyemang, Damion Downs, Brian White and Haji Wright to fight for minutes at the position. Aaronson is listed as a forward on the roster, but excelled this season on loan at Utrecht as a box-to-box midfielder. Zimmerman, 32, has been called into a full-strength USMNT roster for the first time since June 2023.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester City finally know every team they could face in the Club World Cup this summer after Club Leon were controversially replaced in the competition. The Mexican side were booted out after FIFA could not be satisfied that their ownership was removed enough from that of fellow competitor Pachuca in a decision upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. That left the tournament organisers scrambling to fill the final place, and a play-off was whipped up between Mexican side Club America and MLS side Los Angeles FC. It means that LAFC, part-owned by Will Ferrell and Mia Hamm and boasting players including Hugo Lloris, Olivier Giroud, and former City player Yaw Yeboah, have won the right to play in the Club World Cup, with their first game just over two weeks away. They are in Group D, alongside Chelsea, Flamengo, and ES Tunis. City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak has signalled the club's intention to have as much transfer business done as possible before they start the tournament so that the new players can have time to gel ahead of the new season. “As the defending champions coming into this new format, of course we're very excited. We're very excited to come in as champions," Al Mubarak said. "A big number of the top teams in the world will be competing in this tournament and I can assure you, we're going to give it our best shot.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid has issued an official statement this Sunday announcing Thibaut Courtois's medical leave. According to club sources, Courtois will miss the international matches with Belgium against North Macedonia and Wales, corresponding to the 2026 World Cup qualifying phase. Despite this setback, the outlook is optimistic. In Valdebebas, they trust Courtois will be fully recovered to play in the Club World Cup, which will be held from June 14 to July 13, 2025. The tournament will be one of the major challenges for Xabi Alonso in his first summer in charge of Real Madrid. Sacroiliitis is usually treated with anti-inflammatories, physical therapy, and rest. The estimated recovery time varies, but in mild cases it doesn't exceed three weeks. The Ukrainian has just completed a good season and could use this time to prove his continuity in the team. Amid a summer full of rumors about his future, the Club World Cup could be the perfect showcase for Lunin. In addition, Real Madrid is still monitoring the market, where names like Donnarumma or Chevalier have been mentioned as possible reinforcements for the future. The coaching staff isn't alarmed, although they are cautious.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LAFC ensured that Saturday night, with goals from Igor Jesus and Denis Bouanga completing an epic 2-1 comeback over Mexican powerhouse Club América at BMO Stadium. By winning the play-in match, LAFC join Inter Miami CF (host nation spot) and Seattle Sounders FC (2022 Concacaf Champions Cup winners) at this summer's Club World Cup. They'll all receive $9.55 million for participating in the marquee tournament, which is held from June 14 to July 13 across the United States, and can net additional prize money depending on results. How they qualified: LAFC beat Club América in a playoff match after fellow LIGA MX side Club León were disqualified from the Club World Cup due to FIFA's multi-club ownership rules. Schedule: Denis Bouanga and the Black & Gold visit three different stadiums in Group D, setting up shop in the southeast United States. They'll then pivot to facing ES Tunis (Tunisia) and Flamengo (Brazil). After Egyptian powerhouse Al Ahly, Inter Miami will meet Portuguese titans FC Porto before concluding group play against Brazilian giants Palmeiras. How they qualified: Seattle qualified via their historic 2022 Concacaf Champions Cup title, which was secured 5-2 on aggregate in the two-legged final vs. Mexican side Pumas UNAM. Schedule: The Sounders won't have to travel for Group B matches. Instead, they'll play all three games at their Lumen Field home.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LOS ANGELES -- Most MLS organizations would state that they have ambitions of maintaining a global reach. Indeed, two years before even kicking a ball in its 2018 debut, front office members at LAFC were already tossing around the aspirations of being a "global brand," which would have been fair to take with a pinch of salt at that moment. Yet, less than decade after those comments and just seven years since its inaugural season, the 2022 MLS Cup champions and two-time Supporters' Shield winners have punched a ticket to the 2025 Club World Cup. Thanks to a dramatic extra-time winner from Denis Bouanga, which sealed a 2-1 comeback victory against Liga MX giants Club America in Saturday's playoff, LAFC now seems primed to begin following through on its far-reaching goals. But, in truly Hollywood fashion, overcoming Club America wasn't easy for Cherundolo and company. After all, the Mexican side's XI, arguably the best in all of Concacaf, had a market value of $67.3 million (via SofaScore); LAFC's was just $29.3 million. And while technically a home game for LAFC at a sold-out 22,000 capacity BMO Stadium, the hostile setting saw the MLS team treated as visitors on their own turf. Liga MX's powerhouse clubs have significant fanbases which greatly outnumber those of MLS on either side of the U.S.-Mexico border, so Club America soared into the stadium on a sea of yellow support that obscured the usual black-and-gold decor. The night before, hundreds of die-hard aficionados had serenaded Mexico's most-successful club with music, fireworks and banners outside of their Los Angeles hotel. And, once the game kicked off, the travelling support made their presence known with intimidating smoke bombs and booming songs that surpassed those from LAFC's "3252" group. That early pressure was rewarded as Las Aguilas flexed their strength on the pitch with an opening goal from the penalty spot as former LAFC plater Brian Rodríguez struck home in the 64th minute after Mark Delgado had fouled Érick Sánchez. But, with star striker Olivier Giroud arriving off the bench, LAFC began to gather some momentum. Peppering the goal with chances, Bouanga then stepped up with an assist off a corner for Igor Jesus to head an 89th-minute equalizer that sent the playoff into extra time. "You come alive a little bit when you're down and there's a lot on the line, but our response was incredible; physically, tactically and mentally," Cherundolo said. "I think from what we can change as coaches, how we sub in, the moments you sub in, I think that was also very important to change the momentum and trajectory of the game to help our team." Bouanga and his teammates will now have a chance to shine on the biggest stage this summer and it will be another fascinating litmus test for a growing side as they face Flamengo, Esperance de Tunis, and Chelsea in Group D. Before trying to secure global domination, however, there are two MLS home games against Sporting Kansas City and Toronto FC to come before their clash with Chelsea on June 16.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If anything, it was even more egregious because this legendary Hungary side had previously destroyed West Germany 8-3 in the group stage — a huge victory, even by the standards of a World Cup that featured a record goals-per-game tally of 5.38. At that point, there seemed little chance anyone would stop the Olympic champions Hungary, let alone the Germans. But this was a remarkable triumph for West Germany, less than 10 years after the end of the Second World War. It was the first tournament they'd entered since then, having been banned from FIFA leading up to World Cup 1950. A talented striker who played three times for his country, Sepp Herberger is perhaps more notable for having served in both World Wars, although according to his own testimony he was never involved in armed conflict. In keeping with other German managers in the 20th century, he served as assistant before becoming the outright manager, leading Germany at World Cup 1938, and then having a 14-year second spell in charge from 1950 onwards. He used to motivate his players by reading out critical press reports from back home, telling them to prove journalists wrong. He was variously depicted as both a strict disciplinarian and also an emotionally intelligent father figure to the players. But Herberger was canny too, and his approach for that final was first and foremost based around stopping Hungary. West Germany's formation in the final started to resemble something like the systems we would recognise in the modern era, with left-half Karl Mai performing a man-marking job on Sandor Kocsis and ending up as more defender than midfielder. The job of tracking Nandor Hidegkuti — whose drifts into deep positions had flummoxed England in Hungary's famous 6-3 win at Wembley the previous year — was handed to midfielder Horst Eckel rather than a defender. In turn, captain Fritz Walter and Max Morlock played deep and were regularly involved in build-up play. There was an impressive level of fluidity in the side, with right-winger Helmut Rahn tending to stick to his role, but the others rotating within matches. Rahn was an explosive and unpredictable winger, somewhat out of keeping with what Herberger wanted from his players. His quality, though, was impossible to ignore and he scored twice in the final, when Herberger encouraged his players to attack down the flanks rather than through the middle. But the most-discussed element of Herberger's tactics was his team selection for the 8-3 group stage defeat by Hungary, where he made seven changes from the opening day win over Turkey. Clearly, this was not a tactical decision in the traditional sense, and there was such anger from the hordes of travelling German supporters that some called for him to resign midway through the tournament (not an entirely unlikely concept — in this World Cup, Scotland manager Andy Beattie resigned after his side's first game, a 1-0 defeat by Austria). What was the reason for his selection? It seems clear Herberger was resting his best players as he didn't think his side had much chance of beating Hungary. And, once West Germany had prevailed in the final, the story became that Herberger had fielded a weakened side to lure Hungary into a false sense of security. Fritz Walter, whose brother Ottmar played as the side's centre-forward, was a prodigiously talented inside-left who was adored by Herberger, who gave him special treatment and handed him the captain's armband. He offered to retire from the national side, but Herberger insisted he remained the side's main man. Although criticised for his sluggishness in the group stage, he came alive in the 2-0 counter-attacking quarter-final victory over Yugoslavia, and scored two penalties in the 6-1 semi-final win against Austria. But it was about more than just goals — he was the side's creative force, roughly their equivalent of Puskas. Walter had contracted malaria during his time as a prisoner of war, and found it difficult to play well in hot conditions. West Germany tended to come on strong in the second halves of matches. But there may have been a less glamorous explanation. The team officials insisted the players had been injected only with vitamin C, an explanation later ridiculed by medical experts, who said it would have been no more effective than eating an orange. Several players contracted jaundice in the aftermath, experienced further health problems, and many later admitted receiving injections at the tournament. Investigations into this continued for over half a century. A 2013 report from Humboldt University suggested the syringes contained methamphetamine, as detailed further by The New York Times. A genuinely thrilling game that featured two goals for either side in the first 20 minutes. Hungary quickly made it two after a terrible mix-up between left-back Werner Kohlmeyer and goalkeeper Toni Turek. Morlock got one back with — it must be said — the third scrappy goal of the game, turning home a deflected cross. Then Rahn arrived at the far post to fire home a deep corner, after Hungarian goalkeeper Gyula Grosics tried to claim, but was blocked off by Hans Schafer. Grosics always claimed he was fouled, but by the standards of 1950s refereeing it's not a surprise the goal was given. Hidegkuti hit the post, Kocsis headed against the bar, Turek made some fine saves, and Kohlmeyer made up for his earlier error with a couple of goal-line clearances. Comprehensive statistics aren't available, but it's fair to suspect that Hungary won on the xG. In West Germany, the defining moment was Rahm's winner in the 84th minute, when he surprised the Hungary defence by cutting inside onto his left foot and firing into the far corner — a goal that feels very modern in this age of inverted wingers. In Hungary, the defining moment came in the 86th minute, when Puskas squeezed home what he thought was an equaliser, only to be denied by an offside flag from Welsh linesman Sandy Griffiths. There are no clear television pictures to show whether the decision was correct. The final was Hungary's only defeat in a long run of 49 matches. They'd defeated the two finalists from World Cup 1950, Brazil and Uruguay, 4-2 in the quarter-final and semi-final respectively. Throw in the doping allegations, and Hungary's loss must be considered one of football's greatest injustices. Hungary never made it past the quarter-finals again, and on their most recent three appearances — 1978, 1982 and 1986 — didn't make it past the group stage. The boost to West Germany shouldn't be underestimated, both in pure footballing terms and as an important moment of renewed optimism in the post-war period. Few others around the world, though, shared their joy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea will face LAFC in the Club World Cup later this month after the MLS side booked their place at the newly-expanded competition in dramatic fashion on Saturday night. The Blues already knew that they had been placed in Group D alongside Brazilian outfit Flamengo and Tunisian team Esperance Sportive de Tunis, and they had originally been due to play Mexico's Club Leon. However, Club Leon were ruled out earlier this year due to the tournament's multi-ownership rules, meaning another club was given the chance to qualify in their place. It all came down to a play-off between LAFC and Club America on Saturday, and it appeared that the latter were going to book their spot at the Club World Cup when they took the lead in the 64th minute through a penalty from Brian Rodriguez. Reacting to the victory, LAFC's Bouanga said: 'It's simply one of the best moments of my career. It really opens up some doors for our club.' LAFC head coach Steve Cherundolo, who is due to leave the club at the end of the season, was full of praise for his team as he said: 'It's kind of a culmination of three-and-a-half years of hard work and dedication that just explodes in that moment.' Four days later, Enzo Maresca's men will take on Flamengo, before finishing their group campaign by facing Esperance Sportive de Tunis on June 25. Chelsea will be looking to add more silverware to their collection after winning the Conference League earlier this week following a 4-1 victory over Real Betis in the final. However, this year's tournament promises to be a tougher challenge due to 32 teams now competing, including Real Madrid, Manchester City and Champions League winners PSG.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Los Angeles FC secured the final spot in the FIFA Club World Cup with a 2-1 victory over Club América in a play-in match Igor Jesus tied it for LAFC in the 89th minute, slipping through traffic and converting a header for his first goal with his new club. LAFC will join English club Chelsea, Brazil's Flamengo and Tunisia's ES Tunis when group play begins in two weeks across the U.S. South. Brian Rodríguez put América ahead midway through the second half by converting a penalty kick against his former team, but Las Águilas fell short in front of thousands of supporters. One spot in the 32-team Club World Cup was open because FIFA disqualified León under its rules against participation by multiple clubs owned by the same entity. León and Pachuca are owned by the same group, and León lost its appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport four weeks ago after attempting to change its ownership structure. With a stadium full of raucous fans supporting both teams, LAFC and América were cautious in the first half, putting just one shot on target apiece. Rodríguez beat Hugo Lloris from the spot in the 64th minute, capitalizing on a penalty awarded following a video review of Mark Delgado's risky, spikes-up challenge on Erick Sánchez. Rodríguez, who came on as a halftime substitute after recently recovering from injury, spent parts of four seasons with LAFC from 2019-22 before the Uruguayan winger moved to América for a hefty transfer fee. LAFC got moving offensively when Olivier Giroud came on as a second-half substitute. LAFC cranked up its late pressure behind Bouanga and Giroud. Lloris stopped a point-blank chance for Javairô Dilrosun in the second half of extra time shortly before Bouanga's winner. Tickets for the match were distributed equally between the clubs' supporters — and América has a large fan base in Los Angeles, where Mexican teams and players are greeted with massive support whenever they visit. América fans mobbed the south stands at BMO Stadium 90 minutes before kickoff, while LAFC's famed North End crowd was packed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LAFC has secured the last ticket to the big dance, rallying to defeat Club América, 2-1, in a FIFA Club World Cup playoff that required extra time at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles. Former LAFC attacker Brian Rodríguez had given América a 64th-minute lead from a VAR-assisted penalty kick, and the Liga MX powers seemed to have done just enough to claim a win that will be worth nearly $10 million at a minimum. However, Igor Jesus' 89th-minute header leveled the scored, saving LAFC, and in extra time Denis Bouanga — the club's most important player in recent years — added to his legend by firing home the winner in the 115th minute. The win sends LAFC into the Club World Cup, where they will join English giant Chelsea, Tunisian club Esperance Sportive de Tunis, and Flamengo, arguably the most well-supported club in Brazil. LAFC and Club América were in a playoff due to a convoluted series of events that could only happen when you get Concacaf and FIFA together to sort out a new tournament format. However, Club León and Pachuca share owners, something FIFA said cannot be permitted at the Club World Cup. FIFA eventually decided that León was disqualified, and announced a playoff between LAFC (the team León defeated in the 2023 Concacaf Champions Cup) and Club América (the top-ranked Concacaf team in FIFA's rankings for Club World Cup purposes). León, Pachuca, and Costa Rican club Alajuelense all appealed, with Alajuelense arguing that as Central America's top-ranked team, they should be admitted, but all were rejected. That leaves the final spot in Group D up for grabs, with Saturday's winner claiming the place. There are 32 teams in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup that have been separated into eight groups of four for the round-robin group stage in June.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MLS side LAFC is heading to the FIFA Club World Cup this summer, booking their spot with a 2–1 win in extra time over Liga MX's Club América on Saturday night at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles. Denis Bouanga slotted his winning goal past América's Luis Ángel Malagón in the 115th minute of extra time, making LAFC the last team to qualify for the 32-team tournament, after Liga MX's Club Léon were eliminated due to FIFA's club ownership rules. Léon are owned by Grupo Pachuca, an ownership group which also controls Pachuca, another team in the new-look Club World Cup. It almost wasn't to be for the Black and Gold, though. LAFC picked up their attack after conceding, with Olivier Giroud nearly scoring on two chances after coming on in the 74th minute. With the win, LAFC became the third MLS team in the competition alongside Inter Miami and Seattle Sounders FC, and will join Group D alongside Brazil's CR Flamengo, Tunisia's Espérance and the Premier League's Chelsea, with games in Atlanta, Nashville and Orlando. The victory also secured them a massive financial boon, earning $9.55 million in prize money for qualifying and will have a chance to draw from the tournament's nearly $1 billion prize pool, should they advance further. LAFC will open the tournament on June 16 against Chelsea in Atlanta, looking for an upset against the recently crowned UEFA Conference League Champions.
