            Ukraine has carried out large-scale drone strikes against a number of airbases deep inside Russia, destroying multiple combat planes, according to a source in the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU).
    


            The attacks are the most ambitious simultaneous strikes on Russian airbases carried out by Ukraine since the war began.
    


            The SBU source said that Russian bombers were “burning en masse” at four airbases hundreds of miles apart, adding that drones had been launched from trucks inside Russia.
    


            More than 40 aircraft were known to have been hit, according to the source, including TU-95 and Tu-22M3 strategic bombers and one of Russia's few remaining A-50 surveillance planes.
    


            The airfields targeted included Belaya in Irkutsk, some 4,500 kilometers (2,800 miles) from Ukraine's border with Russia, and the Dyagilevo base in Ryazan in western Russia, about 520 kilometers (320 miles) from Ukraine, which is a training center for Russia's strategic bomber force.
    


            The Olenya base near Murmansk in the Arctic Circle, more than 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) from Ukraine, was also struck, according to the source, as well as the Ivanovo airbase, more than 800 kilometers (500 miles) from Ukraine. Ivanovo is a base for Russian military transport aircraft.

            The Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed Ukraine had targeted Russian airfields across five regions on Sunday, calling the drone strikes “terrorist attacks.”
    


            The ministry said strikes were repelled in the Ivanovo, Ryazan and Amur regions but that “several pieces of aircraft” caught fire after attacks in the Murmansk and Irkutsk regions. It added that the fires had since been extinguished.
    


            There were no casualties as a result of the attacks, the ministry continued, adding that “some participants in the terrorist attacks have been detained.”
    


            The governor of Irkutsk region, Igor Kobziev, said that drones had been launched from a truck near the Belaya base.
    


            Kobziev said on Telegram that the exact number of drones deployed had not been determined. Emergency and security services were at the site, he added.
    


            SBU drones were targeting aircraft that bomb Ukrainian cities every night, the SBU source said – estimating the damage caused to the Russian side at more than $2 billion.
    


            One video supplied by the source purportedly shows the Belaya airfield in flames and the voice of the head of the SBU, Lt. Gen. Vasyl Malyuk, commenting on the situation. “How beautiful Belaya airfield looks now. Enemy's strategic aircraft,” he says.
    


            CNN was able to confirm the location of that video, as well as two others posted on social media showing smoke rising from the Belaya airbase. It was not immediately able to independently verify other videos provided by the SBU.
    


            The SBU source said that the operation was “extremely complicated from a logistical point of view,” with the drones carried inside wooden mobile homes that had been carried into Russia on trucks.
    


            “The drones were hidden under the roofs of the houses, which were already placed on trucks. At the right moment, the roofs were remotely opened, and the drones flew to hit Russian bombers.”
    


            One video purportedly of one attack appears to show drones rising from a truck, as vehicles pass on a nearby highway. Another image shows the roof of the truck on the ground.
    


            The source added that people involved were already back in Ukraine.

            Growing up in Brazil, neuroscientist Danielle Beckman always dreamed of moving to the US for work. So, in 2017, when Beckman got the opportunity to work at the California National Primate Research Center at UC Davis, she jumped on it.
    


            “I was so excited,” she recalled. “Coming to the US was always the dream. It was always the place to be, where there's the biggest investment in science.”
    


            But months into President Donald Trump's second term, as his administration wages an unprecedented war on the country's top universities and research institutions, Beckman no longer sees the US as a welcome home for her or her research, which focuses on how viral infections like Covid-19 affect the brain.
    


            She told CNN she now plans to move and is looking at opportunities in Germany and France.
    


            Beckman is part of a growing wave of academics, scientists and researchers leaving the US in what many are warning could be the biggest brain drain the country has seen in decades.
    


            But America's loss could be the rest of the world's gain.
    


            As the Trump administration freezes and slashes billions of dollars in research funding, meddles with curricula, and threatens international students' ability to study in the US, governments, universities and research institutions in Canada, Europe and Asia are racing to attract fleeing talent.
    


            The European Union pledged €500 million ($562 million) over the next three years “to make Europe a magnet for researchers.”

Trump administration will ‘aggressively revoke' Chinese student visas in major escalation with Beijing



            A university in Marseille, France, is wooing persecuted academics under a new program called a “Safe Place for Science.” Canada's largest health research organization is investing 30 million Canadian dollars ($21.8 million) to attract 100 scientists early in their careers from the US and elsewhere. The Research Council of Norway launched a 100 million kroner ($9.8 million) fund to lure new researchers. The president of Singapore's Nanyang Technological University recently told a crowd at a higher education summit the school is identifying “superstar” US researchers and making them offers as soon as the next day.
    


            The Australian Academy of Science also launched a new talent program to recruit disillusioned US-based scientists and lure Australians back home.
    


            “We know these individuals are highly trained, talented, and have much to offer,” said Anna-Maria Arabia, chief executive of the academy, noting the program has received “encouraging interest” so far.
    


            Arabia told CNN the flood of institutions rushing to fill the void left by US funding cuts reflects a “global hunger” for science and technology professionals.
    


            “It's vitally important that science can continue without ideological interference,” Arabia said.
    


            The US has long been a powerhouse when it comes to research and development, attracting talent from far afield with its big budgets, high salaries and swanky labs.
    


            Since the 1960s, US government expenditure in research and development (R&D) has more than doubled from $58 billion in 1961 to almost $160 billion in 2024 (in inflation-adjusted dollars), according to federal data. When incorporating R&D funding from the private sector, that number balloons to more than an estimated $900 billion in 2023.
    


            The US's enormous investment in R&D has led to an outsized influence on the world stage. The US has racked up more than 400 Nobel Prizes, more than double the amount of the next country, the United Kingdom. More than a third of the US's prizes were won by immigrants.
    


            “We have been respected worldwide for decades because we have trained succeeding generations of researchers who are pushing into new territories,” said Kenneth Wong, a professor of education policy at Brown University.
    


            But Trump's second term has upended the relationship between higher education and the federal government.
    


            Trump's gutting of federal health and science agencies has led to sweeping job losses and funding cuts, including at the National Institutes of Health, which funds nearly $50 billion in medical research each year at universities, hospitals and scientific institutions.
    


            Between the end of February and the beginning of April, the administration cancelled almost 700 NIH grants totaling $1.8 billion, according to an analysis in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The Trump administration has proposed reducing the NIH's budget in 2026 by 40%.
    


            The National Science Foundation has also slashed nearly $1.4 billion worth of grants. On Wednesday, 16 US states sued the Trump administration over the NSF cuts, which they argue will impede “groundbreaking scientific research” and “(jeopardize) national security, the economy and public health.”
    


            Trump has also targeted elite universities and is in the middle of a legal battle with Harvard University over its refusal to bow to his administration's directives to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs, resulting in billions in frozen federal funding. That battle significantly escalated this month when Trump banned Harvard's ability to enroll international students – a decision swiftly halted by a federal judge hours after Harvard filed suit.
    


            This week, the White House directed federal agencies to cancel all remaining contracts with Harvard.
    


            “The president is more interested in giving that taxpayer money to trade schools and programs and state schools where they are promoting American values, but most importantly, educating the next generation based on skills that we need in our economy and our society: apprenticeships, electricians, plumbers,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Fox News this week.
    


            “We need more of those in our country, and less LGBTQ graduate majors from Harvard University.”
    


            Foreign institutions have already jumped on the chance to welcome Harvard students now caught in legal limbo. On Monday, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology said it will accept any Harvard students that wish to transfer, as well as prospective students with a current offer from Harvard.
    


            “I see this as the most significant crisis that universities are facing since World War Two,” Wong said. “We are seeing a complete reset of this collaborative relationship between the federal government and leading research institutions.”
    


            Once the beacon of scientific research, the US has now become an increasingly hostile place to study, teach, and do research. Three quarters of US scientists surveyed by the journal Nature in March said they were considering leaving because of the Trump administration's policies.
    


            Some have already jumped ship. Yale professors Jason Stanley, Marci Shore and Timothy Snyder, preeminent fascism scholars, announced in March they were leaving for the University of Toronto across the border in Canada because of Trump's affronts to academic freedom.
    


            Beckman, the Brazilian neuroscientist, said her lab has seen $2.5 million in grant funding cancelled in recent months. On top of these funding woes, Beckman said the Trump administration's crackdown on immigrants, and shifting attitudes towards foreigners in the US, has also pushed her to look for work elsewhere.
    


            “It's the first time since I moved here that I don't feel so welcome anymore,” she said.
    


            As the US research ecosystem responds to shrinking budgets and intrusions on academic freedom, early-career scientists are going to be hardest hit, Wong said. But younger researchers are also more mobile, and institutions around the world are welcoming them with open arms.
    


            “What we are losing is this whole cadre of highly productive, young, energetic, well-trained, knowledgeable, advanced researchers who are primed to take off,” Wong said.
    


            Other countries have long deprioritized investment in scientific research as the US absorbed the R&D needs of the world, Wong said. But that trend is shifting.
    


            R&D spending in China has surged in recent decades, and the country is close to narrowing the gap with the US. China spent more than $780 billion on R&D in 2023, according to OECD data. The European Union is also spending more on R&D. R&D investment in the bloc has increased from about $336 billion in 2007 to $504 billion in 2023, according to the OECD.
    


            For a couple of months, Beckman said she considered stepping away from her Covid-19 research, which has become increasingly politicized under the Trump administration.
    


            But then she started getting interviews at institutions in other countries.
    


            “There is interest in virology everywhere in the world except the US right now.”

Follow:


            Two bridges have collapsed in Russia's western regions bordering Ukraine, killing at least seven people and injuring dozens, authorities said.
    


            It was not clear on Sunday morning whether the two incidents — which both involved trains — in neighboring Bryansk and Kursk were related, or what exactly caused the separate collapses.
    


            At least seven people were killed in Bryansk when a road bridge gave way onto a passenger train late Saturday, with railway authorities citing “illegal interference.”
    


            The bridge came down in the region's Vygonichi district, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the Ukrainian border, crushing the moving train and injuring at least 66 people, including three children, Russian authorities reported.
    


            Bryansk's regional governor Alexander Bogomaz blamed the collapse in his region on an explosion, saying the bridge had been “blown up,” according to state media.
    


            Bogomaz said on Telegram that 44 people had been hospitalized, with three in serious condition, including a child. The train was carrying 388 passengers.
    


            Among those killed in the incident was the train's engineer, Russian state media outlet RIA Novosti reported.
    


            The train was traveling from the town of Klimov to the capital, Moscow, when it was hit by the debris from the bridge and derailed, according to RIA.
    


            Images of the wreckage from the Moscow interregional transport prosecutor's office show fallen earth, debris and concrete on top of what appears to be the passenger train, and derailed carriages as emergency services attend the scene.
    


            Moscow Railway said the collapse was caused by “illegal interference in transport operations,” without providing further details.
    


            Passengers were evacuated from the wreckage and were taken to a temporary accommodation center at a nearby station, according to TASS.
    


            Railway workers later discovered damage to another section of railway track also in Bryansk region, Bogomaz said, adding that there were no casualties.
    


            In another incident overnight into Sunday, a bridge collapsed in Russia's Kursk region – which also borders Ukraine – as a freight train was passing over it, injuring one of the drivers, according to the acting governor of the region.
    


            “Part of the train collapsed onto a highway that was under the bridge,” acting governor Alexander Khinshtein said on Telegram. The incident caused the train to catch fire and emergency service personnel worked to extinguish the blaze, he added.
    


            Putin received updates about the two incidents throughout the night from the Federal Security Service (FSB) and Russia's emergencies ministry, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Sunday, according to state media.
    


            State media also reported that the Russian leader had discussed the incidents on the phone with Bogomaz and the head of Russian Railways, Oleg Belozerov.
    


            In a third incident on Saturday night, a Russian military freight train was blown up near the occupied city of Melitopol in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region, according to the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine.
    


            “As a result of the explosion, the train with fuel tanks and freight cars derailed on the railway track,” the intelligence service said.
    


            The freight train was moving towards Russian-occupied Crimea via a “key logistical artery” often used by Russian forces, the authority added.
    


            Since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Kyiv has responded to Russian aggression by launching attacks using drones, artillery and troops into the Bryansk, Kursk and Belgorod regions. Pro-Ukrainian agents and sympathizers inside Russia have also carried out acts of sabotage against Russian targets.
    


            In 2023, a fire that ripped through a train as it traveled along a strategic rail tunnel in eastern Russia was attributed to the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU), according to a Ukrainian defense source.

            Early Sunday, Russia's Investigative Committee described both incidents as being caused by explosions and labeled them “terrorist” acts, state media reported. Subsequent statements from the committee removed those references, saying only that investigators were working at the scene of the incidents to establish “all the circumstances of what happened.”
    


            Andriy Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation, part of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, dismissed Russia's earlier claim, saying: “Once again, there is a temptation to portray us as a ‘terrorist country' in order to avoid dialogue.”
    


            “It seems that the Kremlin is preparing the ground for the collapse of the negotiations with a smear attack on Ukraine in the international media,” he said.
    


            On Sunday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed that Kyiv would send a delegation to the second round of planned peace talks with Russia in Istanbul on Monday.
    


            The Ukrainian leader went on to list his country's requirements in a post on X, which he said includes a full and unconditional ceasefire, the release of prisoners and the return of abducted children.
    


            Zelensky also said that Defense Minister Rustem Umerov would once more lead the Ukraine delegation.

Elon Musk has denied allegations of drug abuse following a New York Times report detailing his purported heavy use of controlled substances during Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign.

On Friday, the NYT released an article alleging that the mogul was using the substances “far more intensely than previously known.”

In a post on X on Saturday, Musk brushed off the allegations, writing: “Also, to be clear, I am NOT taking drugs! The New York Times was lying their ass off.” 

He added that he had “tried prescription ketamine a few years ago” and had publicly disclosed this fact. “This [is] not even news. It helps for getting out of dark mental holes, but haven't taken it since then,” Musk stressed.

The Times had alleged that Musk was taking so much ketamine that it was affecting his bladder, a known effect of chronic use. The article also claimed, citing sources familiar with the matter, that Musk took ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms and traveled with a daily medication box containing about 20 pills including the stimulant Adderall.

The NYT stated that it is unclear whether Musk was taking drugs when he joined the Trump administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which was tasked with slashing the federal bureaucracy. However, it mentioned that during his tenure as a public servant, the businessman “exhibited erratic behavior,” insulted cabinet members, and at one point made a controversial gesture that many interpreted as a Nazi-style salute.

On Thursday, Musk announced that he would no longer serve as a government employee. He thanked Trump “for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending” while stating that DOGE would continue its operations. 

While Trump noted that Musk “is really not leaving” and was “going to be back and forth,” the announcement came amid multiple reports of a rift between the mogul and administration officials.

In March, the NYT reported that Musk had clashed with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio over firings in his department and with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy over air traffic control regulations.

Musk also recently voiced disappointment over Trump's spending bill, which he said would increase the deficit and undermine DOGE's mission.

Washington is “vilifying” Beijing, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Sunday. The accusation follows remarks made by US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who is deliberately ignoring calls for peace from nations in the region, according to the ministry.

Earlier, Hegseth claimed that China poses a real and potentially imminent threat, and urged Washington's allies in the Indo-Pacific region to increase defense and security spending.

“Hegseth deliberately ignored the call for peace and development by countries in the region and instead touted a Cold War mentality of bloc confrontation, vilified China with defamatory allegations, and falsely labeled China a ‘threat',” the ministry said in a statement.

Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on Saturday, the defense secretary accused Chinese authorities of seeking to fundamentally alter the region's status quo and aiming to “become a hegemonic power.” Hegseth also raised the issue of Taiwan, which relies on the US for its defense - accusing Beijing of preparing to invade the territory.

The Chinese foreign ministry described the comments as “deplorable” and “intended to sow division” in the Asia-Pacific. It emphasized that the only country that “deserves to be called a hegemonic power” is the US, which it accused of undermining peace and stability in the region.

Responding to Hegseth's remarks on the self-governing island, the ministry reiterated that the issue is entirely China's internal affair. It stressed that no foreign nation has the right to interfere and warned the US against using the Taiwan issue as leverage against Beijing.

Taiwan has long been a source of discord between Beijing and Washington. While China advocates peaceful reunification, it has warned that any move toward formal independence could trigger armed conflict. Beijing contends that certain elements within the US government are pushing Taiwan toward that outcome.

China has also repeatedly criticized US-led joint military drills in the Indo-Pacific, arguing that they destabilize the region and provoke tensions over Taiwan.

In addition to geopolitical disputes, the two nations are at odds over trade. US President Donald Trump has blamed Beijing for America's significant trade deficit with China.

In May, both countries agreed to pause the tariff hikes introduced the previous month for 90 days, while maintaining a baseline 10% duty on mutual imports. Earlier this week, Trump accused China of violating that agreement.

Drawing parallels between Taiwan and the Ukraine conflict is “unacceptible,” the Chinese Embassy in Singapore said in response to remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron.

Macron had delivered a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on Friday in which he rejected those who would frame the conflict as a purely European concern. “If we consider that Russia could be allowed to take a part of the territory of Ukraine without any restriction… What could happen in Taiwan?” he said.

“Comparing the Taiwan question with the Ukraine issue is unacceptable. The two are different in nature, and not comparable at all,” the embassy said on Facebook on Saturday, reiterating that the issue of Taiwan is “entirely China's internal affair.”

Crimea voted to join Russia shortly after the 2014 US-backed coup in Kiev, and four other former Ukrainian regions did the same following referendums in 2022. Moscow has demanded that, for a viable peace deal, Ukraine must recognize Russia's new borders and withdraw its troops from Russian territory.

Taiwan has had a separate government since 1949, when nationalists retreated to the island after losing a war with the Communists in mainland China. Beijing maintains that it will achieve “national reunification” and has warned the authorities in Taipei against formally declaring independence.

Only a handful of countries recognize Taiwan as an independent country, while most states, including the US and Russia, adhere to the ‘One-China' principle. Nevertheless, multiple Western countries maintain informal ties with Taiwan.

NEW YORK, June 1. /TASS/. US Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg has acknowledged that Russian President Vladimir Putin is right that NATO is waging a proxy war with Russia.

""And he (the Russian leader - TASS) considers this a proxy war by NATO as well right now, and frankly, in a way, it is. I mean, you look at what European nations have done with support. I mean, it's clearly Putin sees that,"" Kellogg said in an interview with Fox News, commenting on Germany's possible decision to begin supplying long-range Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine.

Speaking about the progress of Russian-Ukrainian negotiations, Kellogg said as for Russia's term sheet for a memorandum the United States ""have not got it yet."" However, he said that after contacts with the Europeans in London, a 22-point document was prepared, which includes a ceasefire in the air, on land and at sea, but neither side was completely satisfied with it.

In November 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin recalled during the CSTO summit that Moscow had repeatedly warned that the use of long-range weapons of the West on Russian territory would mean direct involvement of NATO in the conflict.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Proposal to limit student loans for ‘professional programs' risks driving people away from medicine, critics say

Doctors' associations, medical schools and student advocates warn that a proposal in the Republican-led budget bill being considered by Congress restricts graduate federal student loans and could worsen a national shortage of doctors.

The new Republican proposal would limit federal student loans for “professional programs” – such as medical school – to $150,000, eliminate a federal graduate loan program and put limits on loan forgiveness.

Medical students rely heavily on federal student loans to finance lengthy and expensive educations, particularly since 2006, when Congress broadly lifted caps on borrowing limits to allow for the full cost of tuition and living expenses.

“Our organization is very concerned about this,” said Dave Bergman, a spokesperson for the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM). He said about four in five students who attend osteopathic medical schools, which grant the doctor of osteopathy or “DO” designation, use Grad Plus loans and many depend on student loan forgiveness.

The changes are part of the 1,100-page Republican-led reconciliation bill dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Donald Trump sees as core to his second term in office. The legislation passed the House last week and is now being considered by the US Senate.

“When there is a stated goal from these policymakers to increase the physician workforce, to increase the number of primary care physicians and expand access in rural and underserved areas – these policies just don't align with those priorities,” said Bergman. “It's a really bad workforce decision.”

The Association of American Medical Colleges estimates the US will face a shortage of between 37,800 and 124,000 physicians by 2034, with specialties such as primary care, psychiatry and geriatrics especially affected.

Advocates warn the curtailing or eliminating federal student loan programs could drive low-income students away from pursuing medicine as a career, make loans harder to repay, or push students into the arms of expensive private lenders, advocates told the Guardian.

In turn, these changes could also worsen the flight of doctors from lower paid specialties, especially family medicine, primary care and pediatrics, which tend to have lower match rates than higher paid specialties such as cardiology, experts said.

“I, along with many others, worry that these changes will make medical school unaffordable, turn loan repayment into a pipe dream for residents, and worsen physician shortages – especially in primary care and underserved areas,” wrote recent medical school graduate Kaley Parchinski in a Stat editorial.

An analysis by the Urban Institute, which studied the proposal when it was first introduced by Republican North Carolina representative Virginia Foxx in 2024, found the limits could affect more than 60% of students pursuing medicine and other health professions.

“At a time when our country urgently needs more doctors – especially in underserved areas – this bill would create new financial and logistical barriers that disproportionately harm low-income students,” said Dr Shannon Udovic-Constant, president of the California Medical Association, in a statement.

The limits on graduate education would join limits on student loans seeking four-year degrees in a way that critics warn could make completing college more difficult for low-income students.

Sara Partridge of the Center for American Progress said the changes risk “creating or exacerbating [shortages] in essential and medical and healthcare fields, and reducing pathways to high-paying, in-demand career fields for students in underrepresented backgrounds”.

The federal government has guaranteed student loans as a form of financial aid since 1965, part of a program called the Federal Family Education Loan program. These loans are a major payor for American medical schools, whose tuition costs have increased dramatically in cost since the mid-20th century, in line with other forms of higher education.

Because of the long training requirements for doctors, aspiring physicians often graduate with large debt burdens, and how to decrease that burden has been a subject of bipartisan debate. The median indebtedness of a medical student who carried loans was $205,000 in 2023 according to the AAMC – or more than $50,000 short of the limit placed by congressional Republicans.

House Republicans argue that uncapped student loan access has driven up the cost for expensive professional degrees, and that limiting federal loans would help drive down the cost of tuition. Dually, Republicans have argued that if students need more financing they can go to the private market.

“It is extremely costly to get a medical degree,” said Sara Robertson, spokesperson for Republicans on the House committee on education and workforce, which drove the proposal. “Reforms in the bill will help put downward pressure on prices at medical schools so that future medical students can pay lower tuition costs, thereby making medical school more accessible to individuals from all backgrounds.”

Robertson argued that, although the bill would limit how students can earn credits toward loan forgiveness during residency, it would allow them to defer interest and that private student loans would become available.

“For borrowers who do need to borrow more than the bill's loan limits, private student loans – particularly for medical students – will be widely available and often have interest rates,” said Robertson.

However, because of relatively high earnings, medical students are also among some of the least likely students to default – limiting government risk. An average of 8.15% of all student loan debt is in default at any time, according to the Education Data Initiative, while just over 1% of osteopathic medical students miss loan payments, according to AACOM.

Further, economists who have studied the issue – including those whose work Republicans have cited – warned there could be unintended consequences to altering these programs.

“The private loan market looks very different than it did in the years before Grad Plus,” in 2006, said Lesley Turner, an economist and associate professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy.

Turner and her co-authors wrote a paper which found that graduate loans, unlike loans for four-year degrees, likely raise the cost of graduate tuition. Robertson cited the paper to Axios.

Turner said the Republican bill proposes a far lower limit for federal student loans than in 2006, the time before the Grad Plus program was created. Aggregate loan limits adjusted for inflation and for health-related programs, such as medical degrees, were “almost $300,000 … so almost double the limit the House proposed.”

“This isn't going back to where we were in 2006, this is going back to that and then cutting it in half,” Turner said. “It's not clear that the private student loan market would fill in that gap.”

Turner's co-author, labor economist Jeff Denning at the University of Notre Dame, said he had “mixed feelings” about the proposal.

“Uncapped borrowing is probably not a great policy,” said Denning, “but capping it might have these unintended consequences particularly for high tuition programs including medicine.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

‘The memories preserved in countless books, photo albums, documentation – everything is gone,' says village's mayor

For weeks the weight had sat above the village, nine million tonnes of rock precariously resting on an ancient slab of ice. A chunk of Kleines Nesthorn mountain's peak had crumbled, and its rubble hung over the silent, empty streets of Blatten, held back only by the glacier. The ice groaned beneath the pressure.

On Wednesday afternoon, in an instant, it gave way. The ice cracked, then crumbled. The entire mass descended into the valley below, obliterating the village that had been there for more than 800 years.

“Blatten has been wiped away. Erased, obliterated, destroyed, stamped into the ground,” the village's mayor, Matthias Bellwald, said on Friday. “The memories preserved in countless books, photo albums, documentation – everything is gone. In short, this is ground zero for Blatten.”

Looking down from the slope above where the village once lay, you can still see the peaks of a few houses, piercing the mud. The valley is a lush sweep of green, pricked with wildflowers that have thrived on Switzerland's unusually long, warm spring. But its pasture is now bisected by an enormous brown-grey mass of dirt, ice and rock, dozens of metres thick and about two kilometres long. The avalanche hit the valley with such force it has washed up the other side like a wave in a bathtub.

Almost all of the 300 residents had been evacuated a week earlier after authorities grew concerned about the stability of the mountain. One 64-year-old man, believed to have stayed in the area, is missing. As Blatten's people shelter in the adjacent villages, gratitude for having escaped alive is mixed with grief at the enormous loss: of homes, businesses, history. “The people have lost everything, except for what they are currently carrying on their bodies,” Bellwald said. “Houses, bridges, real estate – they no longer exist.”

The scale of the glacial landslide that hit Blatten is near unprecedented in the Swiss Alps. But glaciers and permafrost are melting and destabilising across the world. As they do, terrain that was once frozen solid is crumbling and sinking. Some glacial lakes are overflowing, and rivers of ice that have endured for millions of years are cracking, shrinking and being loaded with debris. How these mixed structures of earth and ice will behave in a rapidly warming world is unpredictable. Those that collapse can send great waves of water, rock and ice downhill, obliterating everything in their path.

“What you're seeing is [happening] all over the world,” said Jan Beutel, a computer engineering scientist who specialises in seismic monitoring of mountain systems, as well as a mountaineer who knows the slopes surrounding Blatten well. He had been keeping a loose eye on the Birch glacier for weeks, and had a live stream running in the background as he worked on Wednesday – listening to its cracks and grumbles.

As the noise grew, Beutel watched the collapse in real time. “Suddenly, I saw the pixels exploding in the top half of the screen. I was just in awe,” he said. The impact was akin to a bomb going off. As the lens was obscured by the dust cloud, he searched for seismic data to estimate the size of the rockfall – and found it had registered as a 3.1-magnitude earthquake, one of the largest mass movements of earth ever recorded by the Swiss Seismological Service.

“For sure, there will be more. There will be harm to infrastructure, to livelihood, to interests,” he says. “The same thing is taking place in all mountain areas. The glaciated areas are going back. The sustained snow cover is less over the years, and permafrost is warming at a global scale.”

Stéphane Genoud, who lives in Anniviers, a short distance from Blatten, spoke during a pause from working to clear his property of broken trees – their trunks cracked by a year of unusual, sporadic dumps of snow. The Blatten disaster is only the latest and most dramatic of the changes that have transformed these valleys over his lifetime. “The change is very rapid,” he says. “We have less and less snow, the glaciers are all retreating, the ice that solidifies the rock is melting. There are routes in the high mountains that are no longer accessible.”

“An entire village disappearing under ice and rock is obviously not normal,” Genoud says. “Imagine your village disappearing, under meters of scree. There is no village. In two minutes: the village is gone.”

But he believes the collapse is part of a far larger disintegration, as global heating accelerates. “Now, with climate change, the mountain is coming down,” he says. “We are the canary in the coalmine – we are directly feeling the impact.”

Even for those who spend their careers monitoring glaciers and their retreat, these sudden, catastrophic collapses are shocking. “I've been astonished by the large-scale collapse and detachment of glaciers that has occurred in different parts of the world in recent years,” says Andrew Mackintosh, a glaciologist and professor of earth science at Monash University in Melbourne. “This is not something that I anticipated, particularly situations where entire glaciers detach and then fall into the valleys below.”

Often, the people living beneath were not as lucky as those in Blatten, which was almost completely evacuated before the collapse. During the 2002 Kolka-Karmadon glacier collapse in the Russian Caucasus mountains, more than 100 million cubic metres of ice and rock plummeted into the valley, depositing debris 130 metres thick. It completely buried the village of Nizhniy Karmadon, killing at least 120 people. In Italy, 11 died in the collapse of part of the Marmolada glacier in 2022. In Kyrgyzstan that same year, a group of British tourists were engulfed – but survived – an avalanche caused by the collapse of a glacier in the Tian Shan mountains.

For Switzerland – a country used to managing significant natural hazards from its mountains – the devastation of Blatten represents a new kind of destruction. When the Swiss president, Karin Keller-Sutter, returned from a helicopter flight over the damage on Friday afternoon, she said the sight was “apocalyptic”.

“It's practically levelled. There have always been landslides. But with those, something always remained. Here, nothing is visible any more.”

Precisely attributing the Birch glacial collapse to climate change is not yet possible: even attribution studies for extreme weather take weeks or months, and landslides add an additional, complex set of factors to analyse. A recent review of 45 studies of landslides in the alps found a clear link between the heating climate and increased smaller rockfalls or landslides – but for huge rock avalanches, there was not enough data to conclusively say. Exact attribution is almost beside the point, however, says Mackintosh: the climate crisis is already clearly destabilising alpine environments, and transforming entire ecosystems.

“The melting of mountain permafrost – frozen ground that literally glues together the high alpine summits – leads to unstable situations where whole mountain slopes can collapse under their own weight,” sayssaid Mackintosh. In temperate glaciers, this can create a kind of feedback loop: the blanket of rock that coated Birch glacier speeded its melting. “These processes lead to a condition where a catastrophic landslide of rock, ice and snow is possible, with devastating consequences.”

From the hiking tracks that twine around the mountain above Blatten, the scale of that devastation is clear. Other than a few crested rooftops, nothing remains. The valley is mostly silent, broken by birdsong and the growl of a helicopter above the debris, watching for any movement. Authorities say there is no timescale for accessing the site: it is still too unstable. The sea of rock that covers it is threaded by tracks of water. When the landslide hit, it dammed the Lonza River, which ran through the valley, and regional authorities feared “a torrential lava flow if the river overflows”. Now the water has begun to eat its way through. In Kippel, which lies just a few minutes drive from Blatten, locals gathered to watch the new flow of brown, roiling water wind through the valley below.

None of Blatten's evacuees, other than town officials, have yet spoken publicly about the loss of their town. “You can imagine, this was a very quiet, closed, introverted place even before,” says Brigitte Burgisser, who manages a meditation centre in neighbouring Kippel. “Now, there is such grief as well.”

The tiny, tight-knit community hope to rebuild – the valley without Blatten is “unthinkabl”, says Bellwald – but where or when they can do so is not clear.

For now, the only version of Blatten village that exists is invisible, Bellwald says, held in the minds of the people that have left. “We carry that with us very carefully, as a memory.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Witnesses say Israeli forces opened fire on people near distribution point run by Israel-backed foundation

More than 30 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire on Sunday as they went to receive food at an aid distribution point set up by an Israeli-backed foundation in Gaza, according to witnesses, and a hospital run by the Red Cross confirming it was treating many wounded.

Witnesses said Israeli forces had opened fire as Palestinians headed toward the aid distribution site in Rafah run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).

“My brother went to receive aid from the American distribution points in Rafah when the bullets started raining down on them,” Yarin Abu al-Naja, 44, said. “The Israeli soldiers had started shooting at the people there. My brother went with two of his friends. One of them was critically injured in the head, the other was killed, and my brother was shot in the back.

“He was transported to the hospital by a donkey cart – no ambulances can reach the area, and there were dozens of injured and dead,” Naja added. “We saw him placed on the ground. There were no available beds due to the large number of casualties and dead arriving from the same location. The scenes were horrific – people missing limbs, hands or legs, others decapitated, or with open abdomens.”

Media reports said dozens of people were being treated at the hospital after the latest incident at the controversial site in Rafah. Officials at the field hospital did not say who opened fire but added that another 175 people were wounded.

The International Committee of the Red Cross said its field hospital in Rafah received a “mass casualty influx” of 179 people and that 21 patients were declared dead upon arrival. “All patients said they had been trying to reach an aid distribution site,” it added, describing it as “the highest number of weapon-wounded in a single incident since the establishment of the field hospital over a year ago”.

Local health authorities said at least 31 of the dead were taken to Nasser hospital.

The Red Crescent also reported that a further 14 Palestinians were injured near a separate aid distribution site in central Gaza.

The Israeli forces denied “firing at civilians”, although an IDF military official admitted that Israeli soldiers fired “warning shots toward several suspects who advanced toward the troops on Saturday”, near the aid distribution site, without specifying who the suspects were.

The Israeli-backed aid foundation claimed that it delivered aid “without incident” early on Sunday and has denied previous accounts of gunfire around its sites, which are in Israeli military zones where independent access is limited.

Israeli forces had given orders that no one should approach the hub before 6am. Multiple witnesses said people had begun lining up from 5am, and dozens are said to have surged forward and started running towards it. When the crowds reached the Flag Roundabout, about 1km (0.6 miles) away, Israeli forces started shooting at the crowd, witnesses said.

“I went with my brother Shuhada to get food for our children,” Hani Baraka, 43, said. ‘‘The area was very crowded. At the start, a quadcopter drone came and gave orders, saying it was still too early to open the gates and that they would open them at 6am. It seems people moved forward earlier than the time set by the army. The soldiers panicked and began firing at the crowd. My brother was shot in the head and killed instantly.”

“On its way back, the drone hit a hanging wire and fell to the ground,” Baraka added. “People rushed toward it, and then the Israeli soldiers opened fire on us. Army snipers surrounded the area and started shooting at the crowd.”

The GHF has hired private security firms, but according to witnesses, the private contractors did not open fire on the crowd.

“Inside the gate, there were armed American soldiers, but they did not fire at us,” Baraka said. “They only threw plastic stun grenades in the square to scare people and clear the area once the aid ran out.”

Reuters footage showed ambulance vehicles carrying injured people to Nasser hospital. Other clips emerged showing people running and ducking, with apparent gunfire audible in the background. One piece of footage seems to have been filmed in the Salah al-Din Road, just south of an aid distribution site in the Netzarim corridor.

Doctors at the Nasser hospital reported chaotic scenes, with dozens of bodies being brought in.

“The situation in the hospital is catastrophic, due to the massacre of the hungry in Rafah city, near the aid distribution centre,” Dr Marwan al-Hams, 53, who is working in the emergency department at Nasser hospital, said. “Most injuries were shot in the upper parts of the body – the head, chest, and abdomen – as the Israeli army was reportedly firing from high altitudes using aircraft or quadcopters. A witness on the scene said that shots were also fired from a crane and from tanks.”

The hub is part of a controversial new aid system.

On 28 May, Hamas accused Israel of killing at least three Palestinians and wounding 46 near one of the GHF's distribution sites, an accusation the group denied. The Israeli military said its troops fired warning shots in the area outside the compound to re-establish control as thousands of Palestinians rushed to an aid distribution site.

Israel imposed a blockade on all supplies in March, saying Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters, which the group denies. Earlier this month, a global hunger monitor said half a million people in the strip faced starvation.

The IPC estimated that nearly 71,000 children under the age of five were expected to be “acutely malnourished”, with 14,100 cases expected to be severe in the next 11 months.

The UN and other humanitarian organisations have rejected the new system for food distribution, saying it would not be able to meet the needs of Gaza's 2.3 million people and allowed Israel to use food as a weapon to control the population.

The latest incident took place as Hamas and Israel exchanged blame over a faltering effort to secure a ceasefire.

Hamas said on Saturday it was seeking amendments to a US-backed ceasefire proposal, but President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff rejected the group's response as “totally unacceptable”.

Elon Musk on Saturday denied a report that he used ketamine and other drugs extensively last year on the US presidential campaign trail. 

The New York Times on Friday reported that the billionaire adviser to US President Donald Trump used so much ketamine, a powerful anesthetic, that he developed bladder problems. 

The newspaper said the world's richest person also took ecstasy and mushrooms, and traveled with a pill box last year, adding that it was not known whether Musk also took drugs while heading the so-called US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) after Trump took power in January.

In a post Saturday on X, Musk said: “To be clear, I am NOT taking drugs! The New York Times was lying their ass off.” 

“I tried ‘prescription' ketamine a few years ago and said so on X, so this not even news. It helps for getting out of dark mental holes, but haven't taken it since then,” he added. 

Musk first dodged a question about his drug use at a bizarre farewell appearance on Friday with Trump in the Oval Office in which the Tesla and SpaceX boss sported a noticeable black eye as he formally ended his role as Trump's main cost-cutter at DOGE, which fired tens of thousands of civil servants. 

News of the injury drew substantial attention as it came right after the Times report on his alleged drug use. The daily recalled erratic behavior such as Musk giving an enthusiastic Nazi-style salute in January of this year at a rally celebrating Trump's inauguration. 

Musk said he got the injury while horsing around with his young son, named X, when he told the child to hit him in the face. 

“And he did. Turns out even a five-year-old punching you in the face actually is...” he added, before tailing off. 

Later on Friday, when a reporter asked Trump if he was aware of Musk's “regular drug use,” Trump responded: “I wasn't.” 

“I think Elon is a fantastic guy,” he added.

The death toll from devastating flooding in a market town in Nigeria's north-central state of Niger rose to at least 151 on Saturday, the local emergency service said, amid efforts to find more victims. 

Torrents of predawn rainfall early on Thursday last week unleashed the devastating flood on Mokwa, about 380km west of Abuja, and a major trading and transportation hub where northern Nigerian farmers sell beans, onions and other food to traders from the south. 

Niger State emergency service spokesman Ibrahim Audu Husseini confirmed the updated fatality count on Saturday.

In addition to the rising death toll, 11 people were injured and more than 3,000 people were displaced, the official added. 

At least 500 households across three communities were affected by the sudden and intense flood that built rapidly in about five hours, leaving roofs barely visible and surviving people waist-deep in water, trying to salvage what they could and rescue others. 

Two roads were washed away and two bridges collapsed, Husseini said. 

Nigerian President Bola Tinubu in a statement on Friday night expressed condolences, and said he had directed the activation of an emergency response to support victims and “accelerate” recovery. 

Security agencies have also been asked to assist in emergency operations, which remain underway amid concerns that more bodies could be recovered in remote areas, he said. 

“Relief materials and temporary shelter assistance are being deployed without delay,” the Nigerian president said, promising “no Nigerian affected will be left behind or unheard of.” 

Flooding is common during Nigeria's wet season. Communities in northern Nigeria have been experiencing prolonged dry spells worsened by climate change and excessive rainfall that leads to severe flooding during the brief wet season.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un called the mishap a “criminal act caused by absolute carelessness.”
Ri Hyong-son, vice department director of the Munitions Industry Department of the Party Central Committee, was summoned and detained on Sunday, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.
He was “greatly responsible for the occurrence of the serious accident,” it said.
Ri is the fourth person

Khaled El-Enany, a former minister of tourism and antiquities for Egypt and now a candidate for director general of UNESCO, stressed the role the U.N. organization has played in times of crisis and the need to strengthen its funding in a recent interview with The Japan News in Tokyo. A written response was also provided after the interview.

Recent conflicts around the world, including in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip, have damaged and destroyed numerous cultural properties, while also seriously impacting many children's ability to get an education. El-Enany argued that the destruction of cultural heritage is “no longer a tragic by-product of war” but is now rather “a deliberate strategy … to erase identity.”

As for the children who lose access to education, he said they “miss the values needed to thrive in their societies,” which can put an entire generation at risk “of marginalization, of vulnerability, sometimes of radicalization.” The affected children need “pragmatic solutions,” such as distance-learning tools, as well as psychological support.

UNESCO, said El-Enany, has neither the power nor the mandate to stop wars. That means it should be focused on its roles at three levels — preventing conflicts by “fostering a culture of peace and fighting against hate”; protecting institutions and cultural assets during conflicts; and prioritizing reconstruction of “heritage sites and schools” after conflicts.

In February, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump announced it would reconsider U.S. membership in UNESCO because the agency has “demonstrated anti-Israel sentiment over the past decade,” among other reasons. The United States withdrew from the organization in 2018 during the first Trump administration and was readmitted in 2023 during the Biden administration. Nicaragua recently announced it intends to withdraw over issues related to free speech.

El-Enany expressed regret over these developments, which he said present a serious problem for funding and mean the loss of U.S. expertise. That is why UNESCO must “do everything to keep the United States,” he asserted. “The idea behind UNESCO is inclusivity, and we have to have everyone, even countries who disagree politically.”

He added that UNESCO “can offer [a] very important platform” for discussion of contentious issues.

In light of these problems, he called for strengthening UNESCO's funding to make it more diverse, flexible and sustainable, so that the organization can minimize the possible impact of withdrawals and “focus on its strategic priorities rather than constantly adapting to fragmented project-based logic.” To this end, there needs to be stronger “partnerships with the private sector and philanthropic foundations.”

UNESCO's next director general election will be appointed by the General Conference in October. Currently, two other candidates are also in the running.

A group of Russian soldiers fighting in the Kursk direction surrendered to Ukrainian paratroopers because ""abuse in units is worse than captivity,"" Ukraine's Airborne Assault Forces said in a video posted on social media on May 31.

""In their units on the territory of the Russian Federation, they were subjected to inhumane treatment, psychological pressure and threats,"" the post reads.

Russia's abuse of its own soldiers has been well documented throughout the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

An investigation by the Insider last July reported that Russia uses a systematic program of ""gulag-style"" abuse directed at its soldiers in Ukraine in order to ""maintain order"" and punish perceived offenders.

According to the Insider, the patterns of abuse of Russian soldiers in Ukraine ""borrow heavily from Soviet labor camp traditions.""

Russian units have employed ""punishment squads"" that seek out soldiers who are abusing alcohol, refuse orders, or are simply disliked, and then subject them to a variety of abuse, including beatings and ""confinement pits.""

A report in Foreign Policy in 2023 detailed a decades-long system of ""sadistic hazing"" in the Russian army that included one soldier who had to have his legs and genitals amputated after he was forced to squat in the snow for several hours.

The video released by Ukraine's Airborne Assault Forces shows at least eight Russian soldiers interviewed at an undisclosed location.

One describes being sent to the front less than a month ago and being ""blown up immediately,"" leaving just two men alive in his unit. Another said his unit was left to dig trenches and fend for themselves when they were spotted by a Ukrainian drone and ""after that everything fell apart.""

""The prisoners were provided with the necessary medical and psychological assistance,"" the military said.

Intercepted calls released by Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) suggest numerous abuses by Russian commanders against their own troops, including one incident where one lost his temper and ordered his soldiers to shoot at their own comrades in a neighbouring unit.

""F**k the 55th (an adjacent Russian unit), shoot them, that's the battalion commander's order, shoot them,"" a Russian commander can be heard saying in an audio published by HUR on April 5.

The unidentified Russian commander appears frustrated at the adjacent Russian unit for not properly following an order and revealing their positions to Ukrainian troops.

The Kyiv Independent couldn't independently verify the authenticity of the audio published by HUR.

Editor's note: This is a breaking story and is being updated.

An operation by Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) using first-person-view (FPV) drones smuggled deep inside Russian and hidden inside trucks has hit 41 Russian heavy bombers at four airfields across the country, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent on June 1.

The operation — codenamed ""Spider web"" and a year-and-a-half in the planning — appears to have dealt a major blow to the aircraft Moscow uses to launch long-range missile attacks on Ukraine's cities.

""The SBU first transported FPV drones to Russia, and later, on the territory of the Russian Federation, the drones were hidden under the roofs of mobile wooden cabins, already placed on trucks,"" the source said.

""At the right moment, the roofs of the cabins were opened remotely, and the drones flew to hit Russian bombers.""

The source said one of the airfields hit was the Belaya air base in Russia's Irkutsk Oblast, more than 4,000 kilometers from Ukraine.

Olenya air base in Russia's Murmansk Oblast, the Diaghilev airbase in Ryazan Oblast, Ivanovo airbase in Ivanovo Oblast were also targeted.

""Currently, more than 40 aircraft are known to have been hit, including the A-50, Tu-95 and Tu-22 M3,"" the source added.

The full extent of the damage caused is not known, but video provided by the source shows what appears to be a row of heavy bomber aircraft on fire at one of the airbases.

Unconfirmed videos posted on social media show FPV drones being launched from trucks parked near the airfields.

Irkutsk Oblast Governor Igor Kobzev later confirmed ""a drone attack on a military unit in the village of Sredny"" and said the ""source"" of the drones was a ""truck.""

Murmansk Governor Andrey Chibis later confirmed that ""enemy drones have attacked the territory of the Murmansk region"" but gave no further details.

Ukraine has long-struggled to target the Russian bombers used to launch mass missile targets against Ukrainian cities, as Moscow has kept them out of range of weapons Kyiv has developed itself as well as those supplied by its Western allies. 

The use of FPV drones in such a way would mark just the latest stage in the ever-evolving and still relatively fledgling world on drone warfare.

The attack was also likely highly cost effective — FPV drones can be bought for a just a few hundred dollars each but the cost of 41 heavy bombers runs into the billions.

The source said that those behind the operation have ""been in Ukraine for a long time.""

""So, if the Putin regime demonstratively detains someone, it will be another staged performance for the domestic audience,"" they said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky and SBU Chief Vasyl Malyuk personally oversaw the operation, they added.

In March, Ukraine announced it had developed a new drone with a range of 3,000 kilometers but gave no details about its type, its name, the size of its warhead, or when it would go into mass production.

The A-50 provides several critical functions for the ongoing war in Ukraine, such as detecting air defense systems, guided missiles, and coordinating targets for Russian fighter jets. 

Russia possesses fewer than ten of these planes. A-50 aircraft have an estimated price tag of around $350 million.

The  Tupolev Tu-95, the Tupolev Tu-22, as well as the Tupolev Tu-160, are all Russian heavy bombers regularly used to launch missiles at Ukrainian cities.

The Tu-95 is the oldest of the three aircraft, a Soviet-era plane that made its first flight in 1952. It was originally used to carry nuclear bombs but has since evolved to launch cruise missiles.

Each aircraft can carry 16 cruise missiles – either the Kh-55/Kh-555 or the newer Kh-101 and Kh-102 air-launched cruise missiles.

It features turboprop engines rather than jet engines, as during the Cold War, their increased efficiency allowed it to fly all the way to the United States without refueling.

The Tu-22 carries the Kh-22 missiles, which pose a particular problem for Ukraine. It is supersonic and travels at around 4,000 kilometers per hour. 

Currently, it can only be shot down with the U.S.-made Patriot air defense system and potentially the SAMP-T, a joint Italian-French system.

The Tu-160 is Russia's more modern strategic bomber, entering service in 1987. To this day, it remains the largest operational bomber in the world.

It can carry a total of 12 Kh-55 missiles and up to 24 Kh-15s.

U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg on May 27 criticized former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for comments that alluded to the threat of World War III, calling them ""reckless"" and ""unfitting of a world power.""

""President (Donald) Trump... is working to stop this war and end the killing. We await receipt of (the Russian) Memorandum... that you promised a week ago. Cease fire now,"" Kellogg said on X.

The envoy's remarks came in response to a tweet from Medvedev that referenced Trump's recent warnings to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""Regarding Trump's words about Putin 'playing with fire' and 'really bad things' happening to Russia. I only know of one really bad thing — WWIII,"" Medvedev wrote. ""I hope Trump understands this!""

Medvedev's comments refer to Trump's recent posts on Truth Social, in which he reacted to Russia's weekend aerial attacks on Ukraine, including the largest drone assault since the start of the full-scale invasion. In the posts, Trump called Putin ""crazy"" and warned him that he was ""playing with fire.""

The U.S. president has increasingly voiced frustration with stalled peace efforts, signaling readiness to walk away from the process. Despite repeated threats of sanctions, Trump has not imposed any additional pressure on Moscow to push it toward a ceasefire agreement.

Russia has repeatedly rejected Kyiv and its Western partners' proposal for an unconditional ceasefire. Following Russian-Ukrainian negotiations in Istanbul on May 16, the Russian leadership said it would present a memorandum toward a peaceful settlement.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia's delays in presenting the document are a ""mockery of the whole world.""

A pro-EU Warsaw mayor and a nationalist historian are neck-and-neck going into Sunday's vote. The result could have major implications for Poland's place in Europe. DW has the latest.

Here's the latest news and updates on Poland's presidential runoff on June 1, 2025:

With the Polish election entering its final stage, DW gives you a glimpse of the tense runoff round.

The two presidential hopefuls in Poland's runoff vote cast their ballots on Sunday.

Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski posted a photo with his wife Malgorzata Trzaskowska on X, calling on Poles to head out and vote.

""Polling stations are open until 9 pm!"" he wrote. 

Trzaskowski's rival, Karol Nawrocki, also posted ""Long Live Poland,"" accompanied by a photo with his family.  

Poland's presidential runoff has boiled down to a radically different ideological choice: a pro-European liberal versus a staunch nationalist. 

Rafal Trzaskowski is backed by the governing Civic Coalition party of Prime Minister Donald Tusk, a former European Council president. He was elected mayor of Warsaw in 2018 and re-elected in 2024.

A former deputy foreign minister, the 53-year-old has promised to soften Poland's near-total abortion ban and protect LGBTQ rights. His victory would allow Tusk to push ahead with his reformist agenda.

In 2020, Trzaskowski narrowly lost his first presidential bid to incumbent Andrzej Duda, who is finishing his second and final term.

This time around, the race is expected to be even tighter. The Warsaw mayor is pitted against Karol Nawrocki, a historian endorsed by Duda who has blocked several laws with his veto power.

The 42-year-old has positioned himself as a defender of traditional Polish values. He campaigned under the slogan ""Poland first, Poles first.""

Nawrocki, an admirer of US President Donald Trump, is skeptical of the EU. His win would be a major boost for the opposition Law and Justice party, which governed Poland between 2015 and 2023.

His supporters want stricter curbs on immigration. Nawrocki has called for border controls with Germany to keep out migrants.

Polling stations have opened across Poland in the closely fought presidential runoff.

It follows a first round on May 18, in which Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski won by a razor-thin margin. Trzaskowski earned just over 31% against nearly 30% for Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian. Eleven other candidates were eliminated.

Voting will end at 9:00 pm (1900 GMT) when exit polls are expected to come out. Final results are likely to be announced on Monday.

DW Brussels bureau chief Alexandra von Nahmen explains how the outcome will determine whether Poland embraces a nationalist path or pivots to more pro-EU policies.

Due to the presidential power to veto laws, the winner could make or break the agenda of the centrist government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk.

Rafal Trzaskowski or Karol Nawrocki? Opinion polls see both remaining candidates neck-and-neck in the runoff. 

To many Polish voters, Sunday's election is not so much about who they want, but who they don't want to see in office. 

Read more on what's at stake in Poland's presidential election.

Poland will go to the polls today to vote in a runoff presidential election between two candidates with starkly different visions for the country.

Voters will choose between pro-EU Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, backed by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, and conservative nationalist Karol Nawrocki, supported by the opposition Law and Justice party.

The winner will succeed incumbent President Andrzej Duda, who is finishing his second and final term.

Their new contract includes raises of 20 percent over four years and an additional $2,500 signing bonus.

The 196-day strike of Kaiser Southern California mental healthcare workers is over. The 2,400 therapists, psychiatric nurses, social workers and psychologists won significant gains not just for themselves but for their patients in a time of an acute national mental healthcare crisis. They are members of the National Union of Healthcare Workers.

They outlasted Kaiser, the huge California-based health maintenance organization, with six and a half months of picket lines from Modesto to San Diego. They held rallies at Kaiser's Southern California medical centers. They blockaded the Sunset Strip. They held a hunger strike, putting their own health on the line to improve care for patients and reverse Kaiser's record of misconduct.

“There's no doubt that Kaiser remains hostile to mental health care and to us, they fought us every step of the way. But this is still the best contract we've ever won, even though it took us more than six months to win it,” said Jim Clifford, a behavioral health counselor who has worked for Kaiser in San Diego since 2001.

“We didn't just regain a defined benefit pension, we got our biggest raises ever and more than double the amount of guaranteed time for patient care duties,” he said.

“These negotiations were like fighting a battle,” said Adrianna Webb, a bargaining committee member and medical social worker at Panorama City in Los Angeles.

A temporary agreement was reached on May 4 and the strike ended May 5. The four-year contract will go into effect retroactively from October 1, 2024.

The new contract includes raises of 20 percent over four years, and an additional $2,500 signing bonus. It includes a modified defined pension plan, a big step toward restoring the plan Kaiser took away, plus five hours a week of prep time.

The strikers wanted seven hours prep time for responding to patient calls and emails, making appointment notes, devising treatment plans and communicating with social service agencies. The prep time is “essential if our patients are going to get the follow-up they deserve, and pay for,” said Webb.

The strikers also sought equity with Kaiser medical workers and equity with mental health workers in Northern California, and they weren't able to achieve that.

The other big strike issue was chronic understaffing. They got no guarantee that major improvements in staffing will be forthcoming.

“Kaiser's systemic behavioral health failures have fatal consequences for communities throughout Southern California and the entire state. There is no shortage of evidence that Kaiser's mental health system is dangerously broken and has been for a long time,” said Sal Rosselli, president emeritus of NUHW.

As with other labor disputes, Kaiser's strategy was to stall. They let months pass without coming to the table. When they did come, they had nothing to offer.

The strikers faced the holidays without paychecks, though there were truckloads of toys from supporting unions.

Kaiser had plenty of money to try to starve out the strike. Its 2023 profits were $4.1 billion in 2023; it has $64 billion in the bank. Kaiser CEO Greg Adams' 2023 “compensation” was $17,268,060.

“They spent far more money trying to break us than settling with us would have cost. They paid scab therapists $13,000 a week,” said Clifford.

Kaiser claims to be union-friendly; its roots are in collaboration with unions in the nineteen forties. Tens of thousands of trade unionists are patients. But Kaiser ignored these workers demands, as well as virtually the entire Southern California labor movement's call to settle. Central Labor Councils in San Diego and Los Angeles supported the strike, as did Orange County and the Inland Empire.

“All the CLCs were extraordinary in their ongoing support,” said Rosselli. The teachers' unions, the Communications Workers, UFCW 770, Longshore workers, and nurses also came out in support.

Elected officials weighed in. California Senate President Pro Tempore Mike McGuire sent Kaiser a letter signed by 20 senators expressing concern that Kaiser was canceling therapy sessions at “an alarming rate” during the strike. They urged CEO Adams to “agree to the union's reasonable contract proposals in order to ensure the delivery of timely and appropriate behavioral health services to your patients.” Los Angeles City Councilman Hugo Soto Martinez came often to picket lines and honored the strikers at an L.A. City Council meeting.

“I'm proud that we took a stand for mental health care and made gains for ourselves and patients,” Lourdes Cortez, a social worker for Kaiser in Bakersfield. “We stood up to a behemoth, and we kept fighting for as long as it took to get a contract we can build upon.”

The topline target of the Trump proposal aims to cut $163 billion from the 2026 fiscal budget.

Progressive critics and Democratic lawmakers responded with predictable fury and contempt after President Donald Trump delivered new details for his 2026 budget request in a Friday night news dump that appeared timed to attract as little attention as possible from the voting public.

“It's telling that President Trump has chosen to release his budget on a Friday night with no fanfare whatsoever,” said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, following the administration's release of approximately 1,200 pages of budget documents. “That's probably because his budget would raise costs for working people, destroy basic services we all count on, and let our adversaries run circles around us — all while President Trump works to shower billionaires like himself in new tax breaks.”

Murray added that, for Trump, “it's no billionaire left behind — and good luck to everyone else.”

As his Republican allies in Congress continued work on a major reconciliation bill that would offer sweeping tax cuts to the nation's corporate giants and wealthiest Americans while gutting Medicaid and food assistance programs for the poor, the more detailed budget request from Trump offers a deeper look into the far-right president's desired slash-and-burn approach to the nation's social safety net, valued programs, and key institutions relied upon by tens of millions.

While the topline target of the Trump proposal aims to cut $163 billion from the 2026 fiscal budget, a lack of critical details withheld by the White House appears to be part of a concerted effort to limit public outrage over the impact it would have — on people and communities as well as the overall economy. As The Washington Post's Jeff Stein explains:

With little fanfare, the budget office released 1,224 pages that spell out its spending plans in detail, expanding on the abbreviated “skinny budget” it unveiled this month. So far, though, the administration has addressed only the portion of federal outlays known as discretionary spending, which doesn't cover programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid that make up the bulk of the federal budget.

Typically, the White House releases a comprehensive budget proposal each year that provides 10-year estimates of federal spending, revenue and deficits, as well as projections of economic growth, interest rates and other important indexes. These numbers are hotly contested and typically initiate a debate over the White House's priorities. But the Trump administration appears to be trying to avoid that debate, at least for now, by ignoring the traditional process for releasing a budget.

However, slashed funding for key programs is clear throughout the documents released by the administration, with cuts to healthcare initiatives, public education, student loan support, environmental and labor protections, food aid, and housing assistance for low-income Americans among the most prominent.

According to The New York Times:

The updated budget reiterated the president's pursuit of deep reductions for nearly every major federal agency, reserving its steepest cuts for foreign aid, medical research, tax enforcement and a slew of anti-poverty programs, including rental assistance. The White House restated its plan to seek a $33 billion cut at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, for example, and another $33 billion reduction at the Department of Health and Human Services.

Targeting the Education Department, the president again put forward a roughly $12 billion cut, seeking to eliminate dozens of programs while unveiling new changes to Pell grants, which help low-income students pay for college.

Sharon Parrott, president of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), said the updated request “confirms once again that the president continues to break his promises to lower families' costs and help people who are struggling to make ends meet.”

Parrott emphasized that the updated Trump budget request cannot be separated from what the GOP are trying to push through Congress in their spending package.

“To get the full picture of the administration's harmful agenda requires including the Trump-backed bill under consideration in Congress, which gives massive tax cuts to the wealthy, partly paid for by raising costs and taking away health coverage and food assistance from millions,” explained Parrott. “Policymakers of both parties in Congress need to see this budget, and this entire agenda, for what it is — an irresponsible tax giveaway at the expense of everyday families and investments in our future — and plan a better course for the country.”

An estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which examined an earlier version of Trump's budget, forecasted that the plan would add over $2 trillion to the federal debt over the next decade.

Rep. Brendan F. Boyle (D-Pa.), ranking member of the House Budget Committee, decried the budget request update as a “half-baked proposal” which only serves to prove Trump's determination “to make life harder for struggling families” nationwide.

“Republicans are already pushing a bill that would inflict the largest losses of health care coverage and food assistance in our nation's history,” added Boyle. “This funding request goes even further, decimating critical public- and mental-health programs and slashing housing aid, home-energy support, and job-training grants. Republicans will claim these cuts are about fiscal responsibility, yet they're happy to add trillions to the deficit to shower billionaires with tax breaks.”

For his part, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), vowed committed opposition from his party in the upper chamber.

“Trump's radical 2026 budget would be a gut punch to working families and a windfall for billionaires — raising prices for American families while hollowing out the programs critical to families across the country,” Schumer said on Saturday. “Senate Democrats will never let it become law.”

The provision will make it so only the well-to-do would be in a good position to launch legal challenges against Trump.

A single paragraph buried deep in a spending bill that passed the GOP-controlled House of Representatives earlier this month is causing growing concern among democracy watchdogs who warn the provision will make it so only the well-to-do would be in a good position to launch legal challenges against a Trump administration that has shown over and over again its disdain and disregard for oversight or judicial restraint of any kind.

Coming just about half-way through what President Donald Trump has dubbed the Republican Party's so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” — which progressive critics point out is a giant giveaway to the nation's wealthiest at the expense of the working class and the common good — the language in question is slight, but could have far-reaching impacts.

On Saturday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) noted in a detailed social media thread how the provision “hasn't gotten nearly enough scrutiny” from lawmakers or the public.

A recent piece by USA Today columnist Chris Brennan put it this way:

One paragraph, on pages 562 and 563 of the 1,116-page bill, raised alarms for reasons that have nothing to do with America's budget or safety-net programs or debt. That paragraph invokes a federal rule for civil court procedures, requiring anyone seeking an injunction or temporary restraining order to block an action by the Trump administration to post a financial bond.

Want to challenge Trump? Pay up, the provision said in a way that could make it financially prohibitive for Americans to contest Trump's actions in court.

HRW details how the provision, if included in the final legislation, “would make it more expensive to fight Trump's policies in court by invoking a federal rule that effectively punishes anyone willing to stand up against the administration.”

Anyone seeking a legal action that would involve an injunction request against a presidential order or policy, the group said, would to face a much larger barrier because Republicans would make it so that anyone challenging Trump in court in this way would “have to pay up in the form of a posted bond — something many people can't afford to do. That means only the wealthy will be able to even attempt to challenge the most powerful man in the country.”

Tucked deep in the House's budget bill is a provision that would restrict federal courts from holding government officials in contempt when they violate court orders. It's a dangerous effort by the Trump admin to make it easier to break the law.https://t.co/eSXly9mJPv

Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, was among the first to highlight the buried provision, calling it both “unprecedented” and “terrible” in a May 19 essay in which he argued that the ultimate effect of the provision is to shield members of the administration from contempt of court orders through the extraordinary limit on those who can bring challenges in the first place. Chemerinsky writes:

By its very terms this provision is meant to limit the power of federal courts to use their contempt power. It does so by relying on a relatively rarely used provision of the Rules that govern civil cases in federal court. Rule 65(c) says that judges may issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order “only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.”

But federal courts understandably rarely require that a bond be posted by those who are restraining unconstitutional federal, state, or local government actions. Those seeking such court orders generally do not have the resources to post a bond, and insisting on it would immunize unconstitutional government conduct from judicial review. It always has been understood that courts can choose to set the bond at zero.

Given his critique, Chemerinsky argued, “There is no way to understand this except as a way to keep the Trump administration from being restrained when it violates the Constitution or otherwise breaks the law. The House and the Senate should reject this effort to limit judicial power.”

Human Rights Watch appeared to agree with the profound dangers to the rule of law if the provision survives to Trump's desk for signature.

“This is yet another sign of Trump's brazen attempts to stop the judicial branch from holding him accountable,” the group warned. “This is what autocrats do. Consolidate power, increase the penalty for objecting, ultimately making it more difficult — eventually impossible — to challenge them.”

Follow:


            The lingering effects of high inflation coupled with high interest rates have made it harder in recent years for many Americans to get ahead financially.
    


            The hits just keep coming.
    


            A raft of policy moves from the Trump administration, including particularly steep tariffs that could cause prices to rise, and the whipsaw approach being taken, have stoked uncertainty and driven down sentiment to some of the lowest levels on record.
    


            That combination of higher prices, uncertainty and pessimism can be outright noxious as pullbacks in consumer and business spending can have cascading negative effects on the labor market and the broader economy.
    


            The consumers who power the US economy with their spending have been resilient to date — but they're being increasingly spread thin.
    


Debt loads are climbing, as are defaults, and indicators of consumer strain are flashing red: For example, an increasing number of people are paying for their groceries in installments.
    


            Among those feeling the biggest squeeze are student loan borrowers who have been mired in confusion since the pandemic and amid two presidential administrations' opposing desires for those outstanding balances. The prospects of sharply reduced monthly payments and, especially, debt forgiveness have faded; instead, those who have fallen behind on payments not only are seeing their credit scores tank as a result, but they also risk having their wages garnished by the government.
    


            Here's a quick look at how household finances are becoming increasingly frayed:
    


            The Covid-19 pandemic upended the US economy — but in the process, some Americans were able to swiftly pay down their debt and sock away money in savings.
    


            Stimulus checks, payment pauses (on student loans and rents, in some cases), cutbacks in travel and other discretionary spending, as well as a $430 billion “refinancing boom” helped give Americans plenty of dry powder and a leg up on their debts.
    


            The shored-up savings helped to power a post-pandemic recovery, and credit card balances shot up accordingly.
    


            The record-setting balances, on their own, weren't necessarily a troublesome indicator. Credit card use rises as the population grows, as more people shop online, and as the economy and wage gains remain strong.
    


            However, the post-pandemic recovery included a bout of decades-high inflation that the Federal Reserve tried to combat with decades-high interest rates.
    


            Where the rubber meets the road is how people were managing those rising and costly debts.
    


            By the end of last year, Americans were having greater difficulty in managing rising debt and, in some cases, hadn't been that overextended since the aftermath of the Great Recession.
    


            The share of households becoming seriously delinquent on their auto loans and credit cards hit 14-year highs.
    


            Moreover, at the start of this year, it was highly expected that student loan delinquencies would worsen.
    


            The 3.5-year payment pause ended in September 2023; however, an additional provision under the Biden administration provided a one-year “on-ramp” where borrowers were shielded from the negative effects of a missed payment. That grace period ended September 30, 2024, and missed payments started hitting credit reports.
    


            Student loan delinquencies jumped to 7.74% from 1% following the ending of a pandemic-era pause of reporting past-due loans on credit reports, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's first-quarter Household Debt and Credit Report.
    


            “Adding student loans back into the mix certainly looks like it was a bridge too far for a lot of people, when it comes to their ability to pay the bills down,” Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, said in a recent interview with CNN.
    


            And when the loans land into the serious delinquency territory (when they're late by 90 days or more), that's a major knock on people's ability to achieve other goals: Defaulted borrowers with credit scores above 620 saw average negative score changes north of 140 points, and those with scores north of 720 saw drops of 177 points on average, New York Fed research showed.
    


            In addition to the credit score impacts, those who have defaulted on their federal student loans will likely see their wages garnished by the Department of Education.
    


            “The money that has to go to student loan payments now is money that can't go to paying off credit card debt or building an emergency fund or working toward other financial goals that build a stable foundation,” Schulz said.
    


            Buy Now, Pay Later installment plans have become more widely available and adoption rates have increased as people of all ages — but especially younger adults — have grown more comfortable incorporating them into their shopping habits.
    


            At their best, Buy Now, Pay Later loans can serve as an alternative to credit cards and are used by consumers who are seeking more flexible payment options, who want to overcome a tight financial spot, or who are looking to smooth out some bigger transactions to better meet their budgets.
    


            But it's the “at their worst” part where there's greater cause for concern.
    


            Buy Now, Pay Later comes with such ease that people can quickly spend well beyond their means — especially if they start stacking multiple installment loans at the same time. A Bankrate survey conducted in May found that nearly half of all BNPL users experienced at least one problem, and overspending topped the list.

Klarna's CEO on why you should buy now, pay later



            In recent months, however, it's what people have been buying with BNPL loans that have raised red flags among economists and analysts.
    


            One in four BNPL users say the installment loans to buy groceries, according to surveys conducted in April and May by LendingTree. That's up from 14% from a year before.
    


            There was a spike in these types of purchases when inflation hit 40-year highs back in 2022.
    


            “Those loans have traditionally been thought of for clothing and gaming consoles and furniture and things like that,” Schulz said. “But when people are using them for something as basic and fundamental as groceries, it is certainly concerning.”
    


            “That hints that people are looking for whatever way they can to extend their budgets in the face of higher interest rates, higher prices at the grocery store and elsewhere, student loan repayments and just other economic headwinds people are facing,” he added.
    


            The building economic headwinds are weighing more heavily on Americans.
    


            Consumer sentiment has been freefalling in recent months, and in May remained at a near-record low, according to the University of Michigan's closely watched indicator of how people are feeling about the economy.
    


            Since 1952, when the university started tracking how Americans felt about the economy, there have been nearly a dozen recessions, several oil price shocks, a few wars, a couple of inflationary episodes, a major financial crisis and a global pandemic.
    


            Turns out, a massive trade war nearly trumps all.
    


            Trump's sweeping and steep tariffs and other policy shifts have stoked recession fears and sent sentiment readings south every month this year. The university's index of consumer sentiment is down almost 30% since January.
    


            The biggest concern for the economy is how people and businesses manage those sour feelings and to what extent they change behaviors.
    


            A pullback in spending and business investment could ultimately lead to a contraction in the economy and rising unemployment.
    


            “If [consumers are] watching the headlines to shape their sentiment, they're most likely feeling like deer in headlights — unable to move for fear the car may swerve at the last minute,” Elizabeth Renter, NerdWallet's senior economist, wrote in commentary on Friday. “Economic policy is in a state of near-constant flux, and with that, so too are consumer feelings about the economy.”
    


            The latest Commerce Department data, however, indicated that Americans' income growth was stronger than expected in April and that people bolstered their savings accounts. That could ultimately help people guard against negative effects of the tariffs yet to come, noted Gary Schlossberg, market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.
    


            “Solid income growth and a more elevated saving rate should help cushion households from the brunt of inflation's tariff-related increases in coming months, resulting in a second-half ‘soft patch' for the economy rather than a bona fide recession,” he wrote last week.

            For some small businesses, the last week brought even more twists and turns to the past two months of President Donald Trump's chaotic tariffs.
    


            The situation was already confusing, with stops and starts of tariffs at different levels. Then on Wednesday, a US court said Trump overstepped his authority in imposing most of those import levies – only for an appeals court on Thursday to pause the previous court's ruling.
    


            The confusion has made it challenging for some small companies to plan, business owners told CNN. In certain cases, they have had to consider changing their product strategy, looking into shifting their supply chains, reducing staff hours or delaying products.
    


            “My fear is, if this continues, there's going to be like the mass extinction of small businesses,” Julie Robbins, CEO of Ohio-based guitar pedal maker EarthQuaker Devices, told CNN.
    


            Trump announced blanket tariffs across the globe on April 2, and since then, his plans have changed on a regular basis.
    


            In early April, he issued a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs almost everywhere except China. Then, after ratcheting up total tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, he declared smartphones and certain other electronics would be exempt from the reciprocal tariffs. The US and China agreed in May to roll back reciprocal tariffs for 90 days. And in late May, he threatened smartphone makers like Apple with 25% tariffs if they don't make their phones in the US. He also agreed to push back levies on imports from the European Union until July 9.

            Those are only some of his changes, which can come at any time of day via the White House, social media posts or other avenues.
    


            The whiplash has been hard for companies to keep up with. Even major brands like apparel giant Gap are feeling the impact of tariffs, but small companies with far fewer resources are in an even tougher spot. The National Federation of Independent Business Small Business Optimism Index fell by 1.6 points in April, dipping below the 51-year average for the second consecutive month. The organization's chief economist, Bill Dunkelberg, cited uncertainty as a “major impediment” for small business owners in a press release.
    


            “It's the sort of more smaller, kind of more niche… brands that are going to really, really get hit by this,” Jack Leathem, an analyst at market research firm Canalys, told CNN in April.
    


            Some small business owners have had to make difficult decisions as they've grappled with the impact of tariffs. EveAnna Manley, whose company Manley Labs makes high-end electronics for recording studios, has had to cut her employees' hours by 25%.
    


            The reciprocal tariffs that China imposed on the US have been particularly challenging, she says, since China has become a major market for her business. Manley says it took “decades” for her to “get the best Chinese importers.”
    


            Overall, Manley Labs' sales are down more than 19% compared to last year, she told CNN, which has frozen the company's product development efforts.
    


            “It's just a freaking mess right now,” she said in late May, before this past week's court rulings on Trump's tariffs. “And I'm so angry that my own government has done this to me.”
    


            The best thing small businesses can do right now is to be flexible and diversify their sourcing and procurement strategies, says Tala Akhavan, chief operating officer of Pietra, a platform that helps brands with sourcing, production and logistics among other services.
    


            That's what Intuition Robotics, which makes a home robot designed to be a companion for older adults, is doing, according to chief strategy officer Assaf Gad.
    


            The company also makes money off its digital subscription accounts, according to Gad, giving it the flexibility to look into a “plan B” outside of China for producing the company's hardware. Sudden changes in tariff policies haven't really impacted the company's decisions because it's planning for the next nine to 12 months rather than the short term, he said in mid-May.
    


            Trump's tariffs have encouraged Gad to think about expanding Intuition Robotics into international markets.
    


            “Maybe this is also a good time to say, ‘Let's not put all the eggs in one basket,'” he said, “and, you know, start looking on other kind of territories that will reduce the risk for us going forward.”
    


            But for some companies, finding a plan B isn't so easy. That's the case for Sarah O'Leary, CEO of Willow, which makes wearable breast pumps and accessories. As a medical device company, Willow can't simply just move its manufacturing, O'Leary told CNN. The company had to pause exporting one product it produces in China for postpartum recovery at one point because it became too expensive.
    


            The ruling on Wednesday aiming to block many tariffs brought some relief, O'Leary said in an emailed statement on Thursday evening. But she acknowledged that there's still “so much uncertainty,” adding that “the chaos will persist.”
    


            Any tariffs, even low ones, would be difficult for a small company like hers to absorb, she said in mid-May.
    


            “We don't build our products with that much margin,” she said. “And so, unfortunately, we are in a position where we have to evaluate what we can do to survive in those contexts.”

Live Updates


            • Trump's tariffs: More uncertainty surrounds President Donald Trump's trade policy to start a new week. Trump officials say the president will speak soon with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, as trade tensions ramp back up with Beijing. Meanwhile, a legal battle is unfolding over Trump's use of emergency powers to implement tariffs.
    


            • “Big, beautiful bill”: Senate Republicans will work this week on their version of the massive spending and tax cuts package advancing Trump's domestic policy agenda. GOP leaders are trying to win over conservative critics concerned the bill will increase the federal deficit.
    


            • Foreign policy frustrations: Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff slammed Hamas' response to a US-backed ceasefire proposal for Gaza yesterday, and skepticism surrounds the latest round of Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul tomorrow. The president has faced diplomatic roadblocks as he tries to fulfill a campaign pledge to end the conflicts.
    


            Senate Democrats previewed their arguments against the massive domestic policy bill that the upper chamber will now have to address, following its passage along narrow margins in the House before the Memorial Day recess.
    


Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut called the bill an “absolute disaster” for middle class and poor Americans, focusing on the projection that millions could lose Medicaid coverage, as well as the sweeping tax cuts codified in the legislation.
    


            The Congressional Budget Office last month projected that House Republicans' changes to Medicaid, including work requirements for some recipients, would leave 7.6 million Americans uninsured by 2034.



                    “This bill is what it is. It is just an attempt to enrich Donald Trump's billionaire class, all his Mar-a-Lago friends, his corporate friends, at the expense of ordinary Americans. And they should just tell the truth about it,” Murphy said on CNN's “State of the Union.”
                





Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia criticized the work reporting requirements as an attack on the working class and said a similar program already failed in his home state.
    


            “We have seen this failed experiment in Georgia. We've got over a half million people in Georgia who are in the health care coverage gap. They are largely the working poor,” he said on NBC's “Meet the Press,” lambasting the governor-endorsed program for its low enrollment rates.
    


            “And what they're trying to do now is take this terrible experiment in Georgia, force it on the whole nation, and what we will see as a result of that is a workforce that is sicker and poorer and an economy that's weaker,” he added.
    


            Speaker Mike Johnson repeatedly denied today that the “big, beautiful bill” passed by the House last month will increase the national debt, as some Republican senators warn they won't support a policy package that is projected to add trillions to the budget deficit.
    


            “This is a reconciliation package,” Johnson said on NBC's “Meet the Press,” explaining that the bill includes “necessary expenditures” for defense and border security in the process of “reconciling a budget.”
    


            But the speaker said those concerned about adding to the deficit are missing “tremendous and historic level of spending cuts that are also in the same package.”
    


            Trump allies like Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, made the rounds on TV news shows this morning to try to win over budget hawks in the party — but they face an uphill climb with some key senators.
    


Here's why: Conservative senators like Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Rand Paul of Kentucky say the bill would increase deficits and does not contain enough spending cuts.
    


            “The problem is the math doesn't add up,” Paul said on “Fox News Sunday” last weekend.
    


            Paul said this morning that he believes he has four fellow Republicans opposed to the bill “at this point,” which would sink the package in the Senate.
    


            “I would be very surprised if the bill, at least, is not modified in a good direction,” he said on CBS' “Face the Nation.”
    


What the analysis says: The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has predicted the bill could add around $3.8 trillion to the deficit over eight years. The Joint Committee on Taxation has since increased that estimate to $3.94 trillion.
    


            Speaker Johnson brushed off those figures. “Every single time when they project economic growth, they always underestimate the growth that will be brought about by tax cuts and reduction in regulations,” he said this morning.
    


            White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended President Donald Trump's recent doubling of steel tariffs to 50%, framing the measure as a critical step to ensuring the United States is prepared in the event of war.
    


            “Chinese steel production is something like double the global capacity,” Hassett said during an interview on ABC's “This Week.”
    


            “They're doing that because it prepares them to win a war, because they're the only ones who can make steel,” he said.
    


            The top White House economic adviser added a stark warning: “If we have cannons, but not cannonballs, then we can't fight a war.”
    


            “President Trump is going to make sure that that never happens to the US,” Hassett said.
    


            Trump announced at a Pennsylvania steel plant Friday that he would set tariffs on steel imported into the US at 50% starting June 4.
    


            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused the Trump administration of trying to intimidate Democrats as confrontations with federal officials have escalated in recent weeks.
    


                    “The administration is clearly trying to intimidate Democrats in the same way that they're trying to intimidate the country,” Jeffries told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”
                





            Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler made the same allegation after he said Department of Homeland Security officials entered his congressional office without a warrant Wednesday and handcuffed a member of his staff.
    


            Responding to that incident, Jeffries said Americans “aren't interested in bending the knee to a wannabe king.”
    


            The Justice Department also recently charged New Jersey Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver in connection with a tense and chaotic confrontation outside an ICE detention facility in Newark.
    


            Jeffries, who had previously warned of a red line against charging members of Congress, said, “Let me make clear that the House is a separate and coequal branch of government.”
    


                    “We're going to continue to undertake our congressional responsibility, notwithstanding efforts by the Trump administration to try to intimidate Democrats. It's unfortunate that our Republican colleagues continue to be nothing more than rubber stamps for Trump's reckless and extreme agenda,” the minority leader added.
                





            Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought distanced himself from suggestions that he is implementing elements of Project 2025, a sweeping conservative policy blueprint he helped craft, into the Trump administration's agenda.
    


            Pressed by CNN's Dana Bash this morning on whether he is enacting elements of the controversial document — which includes proposals like eliminating the Federal Reserve and banning medication abortion — Vought was quick to respond, “Of course not.”
    


                    “I think the president was very clear with his agenda, and he is going forward with the agenda, and he has been at the helm and the originator of all of these ideas,” the OMB director said on “State of the Union.”
                





            Bash asked again whether the more extreme recommendations from Project 2025 are now part of the Trump administration's plans. Vought sidestepped, saying, “What's on the agenda is what the president has put on the agenda, most of which he ran on.”
    


Some background: Democrats used Project 2025 as a major line of attack against Trump on the 2024 campaign trail.
    


            Trump repeatedly disavowed the plan during his presidential bid, despite its architects including  dozens of former Trump officials and other allies.
    


            The president has since selected Vought, a co-author of the policy blueprint, to lead the powerful White House budget office, and his administration has embraced elements of the plan, including to alter federal health programs.
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping plan to speak “very soon,” but declined to set a date for the long-awaited, high-stakes conversation between the leaders as Trump and other top US officials appear to escalate tensions with Beijing.
    


            Trump has accused China of violating a trade agreement made weeks ago in Geneva. Bessent declined to say what consequences China would face but expressed optimism about the forthcoming call.
    


                    “We will see what the consequences are. I am confident that when President Trump and Party Chairman Xi have a call that this will be ironed out. But the fact that they are withholding some of the products that they agreed to release during our agreement — maybe it's a glitch in the Chinese system, maybe it's intentional, we'll see after the president speaks with the party chairman,” Bessent said during an appearance on CBS News' “Face the Nation,” clarifying that he was referring specifically to critical rare earth minerals.
                





            Asked when that call would take place, he declined to set a specific date, saying, “I believe we will see something very soon.”
    


            Asked whether he or other Cabinet officials have spoken with their Chinese counterparts, Bessent deferred to the president, saying, “We're going to let the two principals have a conversation, and then everything will stem from that.”
    


Top adviser expects call in the coming days: White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told ABC's “This Week” that it's the administration's “expectation” the Xi-Trump call will take place this week.
    


            Hassett clarified that he's not sure whether the meeting has been scheduled, but that “both sides have expressed a willingness to talk.”
    


            “The two of them will talk about the Geneva agreement, which we were all very favorably inclined towards, thinking this is a huge step forward,” Hassett said.
    


This post has been updated with Hassett's remarks.



            Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, directly challenged criticism from Elon Musk and several Republican senators that President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful” bill increases the federal deficit.
    


            Musk, who is exiting his formal role with the administration, has said the bill “undermines” his cost-slashing efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency and will increase the budget deficit.
    


                    “I love Elon, but this bill doesn't increase the deficit or hurt the debt,” Vought said during an interview with CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union” this morning.
                





            Vought argued that critics, including Musk, are relying on flawed analyses rooted in the Congressional Budget Office's “artificial baseline,” which, he said, fails to account for the likely extension of key tax provisions from the 2017 tax law.
    


            According to an initial projection by CBO, the bill's tax provisions would increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion over a decade. The Joint Committee on Taxation has since increased that estimate to $3.94 trillion.
    


            Vought insisted that while the bill contains some new spending, primarily for border security and defense, it represents a net deficit reduction, not an expansion.
    


Bessent defends the bill: Trump's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also sought to shore up support for the spending and tax cuts package in a TV news appearance this morning.
    


            Trump-promised provisions for no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, and deductibility of auto loans for American-made cars “have to stay in” the bill, Bessent said on CBS News' “Face the Nation” today.
    


            The treasury secretary also emphatically dismissed concerns about the possibility of US default ahead of a key debt limit deadline.
    


            “The United States of America is never going to default. That is never going to happen,” he said.
    


            Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick emphasized today that President Donald Trump's 90-day pause for tariff negotiations is a hard deadline — and vowed that despite a federal court ruling earlier this week, tariffs “are not going away.”
    


                    “I don't see today that an extension is coming. In fact, I think that's the deadline, and the president's just going to determine what rates people have. If they can't get a deal done, President Trump is going to determine what deal is going to be,” Lutnick said during an appearance on “Fox News Sunday with Shannon Bream.”
                





            The secretary predicted a “lot of deals” will be done ahead of the July deadline. The administration has repeatedly said that will be the case, but has announced few pacts with foreign partners so far.
    


            Lutnick also weighed in on a Wednesday court ruling barring Trump's global tariffs. That ruling was appealed later that day, keeping the tariffs in place while it works through the judicial process.
    


            “We're going to take that up to higher courts. The president is going to win, like he always does, but rest assured, tariffs are not going away. He has so many other authorities that even in the weird and unusual circumstance where this was taken away, we just bring on another or another or another,” he said.
    


            The Trump administration has said it is prepared to take the case all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary.
    


            And after Trump threatened to reignite a trade war with the European Union last week, Lutnick suggested talks are back on track.
    


            “I think it cost us a week, maybe,” the commerce secretary said. “But then everybody came right back to the table.”
    


            President Donald Trump is urging the Senate to retain provisions from conservative hardliners in his expansive domestic policy bill.
    


            “Congratulations to ALL on a job well done. Proud of you! Hopefully, the Senate will be there with you!” Trump wrote on Truth Social yesterday, accompanied by a photo of a post outlining the House Freedom Caucus provisions added to his “big, beautiful bill.”
    


            House Republicans narrowly passed the president's sweeping tax and spending cuts package last week after staving off a rebellion by the Freedom Caucus. The hardline caucus secured additional adjustments to Medicaid and the repealing of former President Joe Biden's clean energy tax credits, among other provisions.
    


Key promise: Later on Saturday, Trump returned to social media to spotlight a key tax cut promise from his campaign that was left out of the sweeping policy bill: no taxes on Social Security. The president suggested the measure will be implemented in a “different form.”
    


            Trump repeatedly pledged to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits while campaigning, but the House GOP-passed policy bill does not include any such provision. Instead, senior citizens would receive a $4,000 increase to their standard deduction from 2025 through 2028 under the bill.
    


            This measure is aimed at fulfilling Trump's promise, since lawmakers cannot include a more direct Social Security tax cut under the rules of budget reconciliation, which Republicans are using to advance the package without Democratic support in the Senate.
    


            The bill does fulfill Trump's campaign promises to cut taxes on tips and overtime, albeit temporarily.

            President Donald Trump made the latest move in his ever-evolving trade war Friday, announcing at a Pennsylvania steel plant that he plans to double tariffs on the alloy.
    


If you're trying to make sense of last week's tariff news, start here:



            • The steel tariffs: Trump told a crowd at the US Steel facility outside Pittsburgh that he plans to jack up tariffs on the material to 50%. Trump said he was considering a 40% tariff, but industry executives told him to go even higher.
    


            Trump on March 12 imposed sweeping 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, which was met with immediate retaliation from Canada and the European Union — and dismay from America's auto industry.
    


            More tariffs may give the moribund US steel business a much-needed boost, but they could also raise prices on a key component for construction companies and manufacturers.
    


            • Tough talk for China: The steel announcement came on the same day Trump vented frustration online about trade terms with China, claiming in a Truth Social post that China “HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,” and implying he would no longer play “Mr. NICE GUY.”
    


            Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, told reporters the administration is preparing new trade actions to target China, according to Reuters.
    


            •  Legal battles: A federal court blocked many of Trump's tariffs on Wednesday, but an appeals court quickly paused that ruling the next day. The legal battle — which centers on Trump's use of emergency powers to levy tariffs — will continue next month.
    


            The whiplash rulings underscore why, even when there's news of tariffs easing, retailers and ports cannot immediately adjust.
    


            • Wall Street tries to ignore trade war: Overall market reaction to the latest twists and turns has been relatively muted. Wall Street has started to bet that if Trump makes a trade war threat, he will eventually back down. Investors who sold at the start of May missed out on a historically strong month for markets.
    


            • Trump's “TACO” slight: Observers have coined a term for that assumption the president will eventually back down from trade threats: “TACO,” as in, “Trump Always Chickens Out.”
    


            Trump was caught off guard and angered by a reporter's question about the term this week, according to a senior White House official.
    


            Neither the Republican nor Democratic Party has consolidated a majority of the public behind its approach, with more than 4 in 10 saying neither party can get things done or has strong leadership, a new CNN survey conducted by SSRS finds.
    


            Despite those widespread doubts, Americans increasingly say they see meaningful differences between the two parties.

            President Donald Trump abruptly rescinded his nomination of tech billionaire Jared Isaacman to lead NASA yesterday.
    


                    “After a thorough review of prior associations, I am hereby withdrawing the nomination of Jared Isaacman to head NASA. I will soon announce a new Nominee who will be Mission aligned, and put America First in Space,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
                





            The shake-up comes just days before the Senate was expected to vote on the nomination of Isaacman, who has twice traveled to space on private missions and has close ties to SpaceX chief Elon Musk.
    


Records on OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan organization that tracks money in politics, show Isaacman donated to Democrats as recently as the 2024 election cycle, though he donated to Republicans in prior years. But on social media, he has largely refrained from voicing a stance on hot-button political issues.
    


            During an April confirmation hearing, Isaacman said he has “been relatively apolitical.”
    


            That posture is in line with how past NASA administrators have sought to position themselves. While the role has been filled by civil servants, engineers, scientists and, more recently, politicians — each has emphasized the importance of working across the aisle.
    


Some background: Isaacman's appointment had been met with broad support in the space community, which viewed him as a passionate leader — and his spaceflight experience as a bonus.
    


            But Isaacman, the CEO of payments platform company Shift4, was viewed with deep skepticism by Democratic lawmakers concerned he would use his position at NASA to advance Musk's personal interests.
    


            President Donald Trump's special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, didn't hold back his frustration yesterday in reacting to Hamas' response to a US ceasefire proposal for Gaza.
    


                    “I received the Hamas response to the United States' proposal. It is totally unacceptable and only takes us backward,” Witkoff said in a post on social media. “Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week.”
                





            It's the latest impasse Trump has encountered in his efforts to resolve the intractable conflict.
    


Here's where things stand:



The proposal: The latest US-backed proposal, which Israel has approved, involves Hamas releasing 10 Israeli hostages and 18 deceased hostages in exchange for 125 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences and 1,111 Gazans detained since the war began. 



            Negotiations toward a permanent ceasefire would begin immediately on the first day of the 60-day truce. The agreement would also allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza “immediately” and be distributed “through agreed upon channels,” including the United Nations and the Red Crescent.
    


Key sticking point: The draft agreement reviewed by CNN on Friday contains no intrinsic guarantee of a permanent end to the war, nor assurances that the ceasefire will be extended as long as negotiations continue. Hamas has expressed reluctance to accept a deal without those terms.
    


Counter-offer: In a statement yesterday, Hamas said it had submitted a proposal to mediators Qatar and Egypt that “aims to achieve a permanent ceasefire, a comprehensive withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and ensure the flow of aid to our people and our families in the Gaza Strip.”
    


            Witkoff's social media post indicated the details of that response were significantly different from the proposal already on the table. And an Israeli official told CNN they saw the militant group's proposal as having “effectively rejected the latest Witkoff proposal and put forward a new offer with its own conditions.”
    


Hamas responds to criticism: A member of Hamas' political bureau told CNN the US had previously come to an understanding on a ceasefire proposal with the militant group, which was then amended by Israel in a way that clashed with the terms Hamas had agreed to.
    


            “We did not reject Mr. Witkoff's proposal,” the official, Basem Naim, said.

PARIS (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin is stalling at the peace table while preparing a new military offensive in Ukraine, two senior U.S. senators warned Sunday, arguing that the next two weeks could shape the future of a war that has already smashed cities, displaced millions and redrawn Europe's security map.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal spoke to The Associated Press in Paris after meeting President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and touring neighborhoods shattered by what they called the worst Russian bombardments since the full-scale invasion began.

In Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron — who they say is “100% aligned” with them on the war — the senators warned the window to prevent a renewed assault is closing. 

A sweeping U.S. sanctions bill could be the West's last chance to choke off the Kremlin's war economy, they said — adding that they hope their firsthand findings will shift momentum in Washington and help bring a skeptical President Donald Trump on board.

“What I learned on this trip was he's preparing for more war,” Graham said of Putin. Blumenthal called the sanctions proposed in legislation “bone-crushing” and said it would place Russia's economy “on a trade island.”

“It is crunch time for Putin and for the world because Russia is mounting a new offensive,” he said. 

At the heart of their push is a bipartisan sanctions bill, backed by nearly the entire U.S. Senate but still facing uncertain odds in Washington. It would impose 500% tariffs on countries that continue buying Russian oil, gas, uranium and other exports — targeting nations like China and India that account for roughly 70% of Russia's energy trade and bankroll much of its war effort.




Graham called it “the most draconian bill I've ever seen in my life in the Senate.”

 “The world has a lot of cards to play against Putin,” he said. “We're going to hit China and India for propping up his war machine.”

With peace talks yielding little and Trump's approach to Ukraine highly uncertain, Graham and Blumenthal have stepped into the breach — blunt emissaries on a lonely mission. Political opposites moving in lockstep, they're crossing Europe, and the aisle, with the moral urgency of two men trying to forestall another Russian offensive before it's too late.

Peace talks are scheduled to resume Monday in Istanbul. But Ukrainian officials say Moscow has yet to submit a serious proposal — a delay both senators described as deliberate and dangerous.

“Putin is playing President Trump,” Blumenthal said. “He's taking him for a sucker.” The senator said Putin “is, in effect, stalling and stonewalling, prolonging the conversation so that he can mount this offensive and take control of more territory on the ground.”

Graham added: “We saw credible evidence of a summer or early fall invasion, a new offensive by Putin. ... He's preparing for more war.”

Trump has yet to endorse the sanctions bill, telling reporters Friday: “I don't know. I'll have to see it.” Graham said the legislation was drafted in consultation with Trump's advisers.

Graham backed the president's diplomatic instincts but said, “By trying to engage Putin — by being friendly and enticing — it's become painfully clear he's not interested in ending this war.”

Blumenthal hoped the bipartisan support for Ukraine at least in the Senate — and the personal testimonies they plan to bring home to Congress and the Oval Office— may help shift the conversation.

“He needs to see and hear that message as well from us, from the American people,” he said of Putin.

In Kyiv, the senators said, the war's human toll was impossible to ignore. Graham pointed to what Ukrainian officials and Yale researchers estimate are nearly 20,000 children forcibly deported to Russia — calling their return a matter of justice, not diplomacy.

Blumenthal described standing at mass grave sites in Bucha, where civilians were executed with shots to the head. The destruction, he said, and the stories of those who survived, made clear the stakes of delay. “Putin is a thug. He's a murderer.”

Both said that failing to act now could pull the U.S. deeper into conflict later. If Putin isn't stopped in Ukraine, Blumenthal said, NATO treaty obligations could one day compel American troops into battle.

After a one-hour meeting with Macron in Paris, both Graham, of South Carolina, and Blumenthal, of Connecticut, said they left convinced Europe was ready to toughen its stance.

“This visit has been a breakthrough moment because President Macron has shown moral clarity in his conversations with us,” Blumenthal said. “Today, he is 100% aligned with that message that we are taking back to Washington.”

Blumenthal pointed to the rare bipartisan unity behind the sanctions bill. “There are very few causes that will take 41 Republicans and 41 Democrats and put them on record on a single piece of legislation,” he said. “The cause of Ukraine is doing it.”

Ahead, Ukrainian military leaders are set to brief Congress and a sanctions vote could follow.

“President Trump said we'll know in two weeks whether he's being strung along,” Graham said. “There will be more evidence of that from Russia on Monday.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump faces the challenge of convincing Republican senators, global investors, voters and even Elon Musk that he won't bury the federal government in debt with his multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package.

The response so far from financial markets has been skeptical as Trump seems unable to trim deficits as promised.

“All of this rhetoric about cutting trillions of dollars of spending has come to nothing — and the tax bill codifies that,” said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank. “There is a level of concern about the competence of Congress and this administration and that makes adding a whole bunch of money to the deficit riskier.”

The White House has viciously lashed out at anyone who has voiced concern about the debt snowballing under Trump, even though it did exactly that in his first term after his 2017 tax cuts.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt opened her briefing Thursday by saying she wanted “to debunk some false claims” about his tax cuts. 

Leavitt said the “blatantly wrong claim that the ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill' increases the deficit is based on the Congressional Budget Office and other scorekeepers who use shoddy assumptions and have historically been terrible at forecasting across Democrat and Republican administrations alike.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson piled onto Congress' number crunchers on Sunday, telling NBC's “Meet the Press,” “The CBO sometimes gets projections correct, but they're always off, every single time, when they project economic growth. They always underestimate the growth that will be brought about by tax cuts and reduction in regulations.” 




But Trump himself has suggested that the lack of sufficient spending cuts to offset his tax reductions came out of the need to hold the Republican congressional coalition together.

“We have to get a lot of votes,” Trump said last week. “We can't be cutting.”

That has left the administration betting on the hope that economic growth can do the trick, a belief that few outside of Trump's orbit think is viable. 

Most economists consider the non-partisan CBO to be the foundational standard for assessing policies, though it does not produce cost estimates for actions taken by the executive branch such as Trump's unilateral tariffs.

Tech billionaire Musk, who was until recently part of Trump's inner sanctum as the leader of the Department of Government Efficiency, told CBS News: “I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.”

The tax and spending cuts that passed the House last month would add more than $5 trillion to the national debt in the coming decade if all of them are allowed to continue, according to the Committee for a Responsible Financial Budget, a fiscal watchdog group.

To make the bill's price tag appear lower, various parts of the legislation are set to expire. This same tactic was used with Trump's 2017 tax cuts and it set up this year's dilemma, in which many of the tax cuts in that earlier package will sunset next year unless Congress renews them.

But the debt is a much bigger problem now than it was eight years ago. Investors are demanding the government pay a higher premium to keep borrowing as the total debt has crossed $36.1 trillion. The interest rate on a 10-year Treasury Note is around 4.5%, up dramatically from the roughly 2.5% rate being charged when the 2017 tax cuts became law.

The White House Council of Economic Advisers argues that its policies will unleash so much rapid growth that the annual budget deficits will shrink in size relative to the overall economy, putting the U.S. government on a fiscally sustainable path.

The council argues the economy would expand over the next four years at an annual average of about 3.2%, instead of the Congressional Budget Office's expected 1.9%, and as many as 7.4 million jobs would be created or saved.

Council chair Stephen Miran told reporters that when the growth being forecast by the White House is coupled with expected revenues from tariffs, the expected budget deficits will fall. The tax cuts will increase the supply of money for investment, the supply of workers and the supply of domestically produced goods — all of which, by Miran's logic, would cause faster growth without creating new inflationary pressures.

“I do want to assure everyone that the deficit is a very significant concern for this administration,” Miran said.

White House budget director Russell Vought told reporters the idea that the bill is “in any way harmful to debt and deficits is fundamentally untrue.”

Most outside economists expect additional debt would keep interest rates higher and slow overall economic growth as the cost of borrowing for homes, cars, businesses and even college educations would increase.

“This just adds to the problem future policymakers are going to face,” said Brendan Duke, a former Biden administration aide now at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. Duke said that with the tax cuts in the bill set to expire in 2028, lawmakers would be “dealing with Social Security, Medicare and expiring tax cuts at the same time.”

Kent Smetters, faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, said the growth projections from Trump's economic team are “a work of fiction.” He said the bill would lead some workers to choose to work fewer hours in order to qualify for Medicaid.

“I don't know of any serious forecaster that has meaningfully raised their growth forecast because of this legislation,” said Harvard University professor Jason Furman, who was the Council of Economic Advisers chair under the Obama administration. “These are mostly not growth- and competitiveness-oriented tax cuts. And, in fact, the higher long-term interest rates will go the other way and hurt growth.”

The White House's inability so far to calm deficit concerns is stirring up political blowback for Trump as the tax and spending cuts approved by the House now move to the Senate. Republican Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Rand Paul of Kentucky have both expressed concerns about the likely deficit increases, with Johnson saying there are enough senators to stall the bill until deficits are addressed.

“I think we have enough to stop the process until the president gets serious about the spending reduction and reducing the deficit,” Johnson said on CNN.

The White House is also banking that tariff revenues will help cover the additional deficits, even though recent court rulings cast doubt on the legitimacy of Trump declaring an economic emergency to impose sweeping taxes on imports.

When Trump announced his near-universal tariffs in April, he specifically said his policies would generate enough new revenues to start paying down the national debt. His comments dovetailed with remarks by aides, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, that yearly budget deficits could be more than halved.

“It's our turn to prosper and in so doing, use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt, and it'll all happen very quickly,” Trump said two months ago as he talked up his import taxes and encouraged lawmakers to pass the separate tax and spending cuts.

The Trump administration is correct that growth can help reduce deficit pressures, but it's not enough on its own to accomplish the task, according to new research by economists Douglas Elmendorf, Glenn Hubbard and Zachary Liscow.

Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale University, said additional “growth doesn't even get us close to where we need to be.” 

The government would need $10 trillion of deficit reduction over the next 10 years just to stabilize the debt, Tedeschi said. And even though the White House says the tax cuts would add to growth, most of the cost goes to preserve existing tax breaks, so that's unlikely to boost the economy meaningfully.

“It's treading water,” Tedeschi said.

BEIJING (AP) — China on Sunday denounced U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for calling the Asian country a threat, accusing him of touting a Cold War mentality as tensions between Washington and Beijing further escalate.

The foreign ministry said Hegseth vilified Beijing with defamatory allegations the previous day at the Shangri-La Dialogue, a global security conference. The statement also accused the United States of inciting conflict and confrontation in the region. 

“Hegseth deliberately ignored the call for peace and development by countries in the region, and instead touted the Cold War mentality for bloc confrontation,” it said, referring to the post-World War II rivalry between the U.S. and the former Soviet Union.

“No country in the world deserves to be called a hegemonic power other than the U.S. itself,” it said, alleging that Washington is also undermining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific. 

Hegseth said in Singapore on Saturday that Washington will bolster its defenses overseas to counter what the Pentagon sees as rapidly developing threats by Beijing, particularly in its aggressive stance toward Taiwan.

China's army “is rehearsing for the real deal,” Hegseth said. “We are not going to sugarcoat it — the threat China poses is real. And it could be imminent.”




The Chinese statement said the matter of Taiwan is China's internal affair and that the U.S. should “never play with fire” with it. The statement also alleged Washington had deployed offensive weaponry in the South China Sea, was “stoking flames and creating tensions in the Asia-Pacific” and “turning the region into a powder keg.”

Spokesperson Zhang Xiaogang of China's defense ministry called Hegseth's comments a provocation and said they distorted China's policy positions. 

The U.S. and China had reached a deal last month to cut U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs from 145% to 30% for 90 days, creating time for negotiators from both sides to reach a more substantive agreement. China also reduced its taxes on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%. 

But it's uncertain if a trade war truce will last. Trump in a social media post on Friday said he would no longer be “nice” with China when it comes to trade and accused Beijing of breaking an unspecified agreement with the U.S.

Tensions escalated anew after the U.S. said on Wednesday it would start revoking visas for Chinese students studying there. 

At the Singapore forum on Sunday, Philippines Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro scoffed at the idea that the U.S. was the problem. 

The Philippines has been involved in increasingly violent clashes with China over competing claims in the South China Sea. Teodoro said what the Chinese government saw as fair might be contrary to the norms accepted by the rest of the world.

The Chinese Embassy in Singapore in separate Facebook posts described Teodoro's remarks as “groundless accusations” and argued that the South China Sea Islands are China's inherent territories.

The “troublemaker” is not China, it said, and cited what it said were recent illegal intrusions by the Philippines into the waters adjacent to two reefs. 

“Some outside power” was posing the biggest threat to peace with the deployment of offensive weapons and roping in allies for frequent military drills, it said, without naming anyone.

“Which country is coercing and bullying others, and instigating conflicts and confrontation in the South China Sea? The answer is clear to all,” it said. 

Separately, the Chinese Embassy in Singapore on Saturday criticized attempts to link the issue of Taiwan with that of the war in Ukraine after French President Emmanuel Macron warned of a dangerous double standard in focusing on a potential conflict with China at the cost of abandoning Ukraine. 

The embassy did not name Macron in its post on Facebook, but the post included a photo showing the French president at the Singapore forum.

“If one tries to denounce ‘double standards' through the lens of a double standard, the only result we can get is still double standard,” it said.

China, which usually sends its defense minister to the Shangri-La forum, this time sent a lower-level delegation led by Maj. Gen. Hu Gangfeng, the vice president of the People's Liberation Army National Defense University.

Poalnd's main candidates Karol Nawrocki and Warsaw mayor Rafał Trzaskowski cast their votes on Sunday as the country head to the polls in a decisive presidential runoff.

It follows a first round on May 18, in which Warsaw Mayor, Rafał Trzaskowski, won more than 31% of the vote and Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian, earned nearly 30%. The winner will succeed President Andrzej Duda, a conservative who is finishing his second and final term. Final results are expected on Monday. (AP video by Rafal Niedzielski)

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poles were voting Sunday in a decisive presidential runoff that could set the course for the nation's political future and its relations with the European Union.

The contest pits Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski, a liberal pro-EU figure, against Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian backed by the right-wing Law and Justice party.

The outcome will determine whether Poland takes a more nationalist path or pivots more decisively toward liberal democratic norms. With conservative President Andrzej Duda completing his second and final term, the new president will have significant influence over whether Prime Minister Donald Tusk's centrist government can fulfill its agenda, given the presidential power to veto laws.

Voting began at 7 a.m. and will end at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT), when an Ipsos exit poll is expected. Final results are likely to be announced Monday. The runoff follows a tightly contested first round on May 18, in which Trzaskowski won just over 31% and Nawrocki nearly 30%, eliminating 11 other candidates.

Katarzyna Malek, a 29-year-old voter in Warsaw, cast her ballot in the first round for a left-wing candidate but went for Trzaskowski on Sunday, viewing him as more competent and more likely to pursue stronger ties with foreign partners and lower social tensions.

“I hope there will be less division, that maybe there will be more dialogue,” she said.




The campaign has highlighted stark ideological divides. Trzaskowski, 53, has promised to restore judicial independence, ease abortion restrictions and promote constructive ties with European partners. Nawrocki, 42, has positioned himself as a defender of traditional Polish values, skeptical of the EU and aligned with U.S. conservatives, including President Donald Trump.

Nawrocki's candidacy has been clouded by allegations of past connections to criminal figures and participation in a violent street battle. He denies the criminal links but acknowledges having taken part in “noble” fights. The revelations have not appeared to dent his support among right-wing voters, many of whom see the allegations as politically motivated.

Some of those voting for Nawrocki in Warsaw dismissed those allegations, saying he shouldn't be punished for his past and that Trzaskowski has also made mistakes as mayor. 

Władysława Wąsowska, an 82-year-old former history teacher, recalled instilling patriotism in her students during the communist era, when Poland was under Moscow's influence.

“I'm a right-wing conservative. I love God, the church and the homeland,” she said, explaining that Nawrocki for her is the only patriotic choice, and accusing Trzaskowski of serving foreign interests.

“He's controlled by Germany,” she said. “I want a sovereign, independent, democratic Poland — and a Catholic one.” 

Amid rising security fears over Russia's war in neighboring Ukraine, both candidates support aid to Kyiv, though Nawrocki opposes NATO membership for Ukraine, while Trzaskowski supports it in the future.

Nawrocki's campaign has echoed themes popular on the American right, including an emphasis on traditional values. His supporters feel that Trzaskowski, with his pro-EU views, would hand over control of key Polish affairs to larger European powers like France and Germany.

Many European centrists are rooting for Trzaskowski, seeing in him someone who would defend democratic values under pressure from authoritarian forces across the globe.

Hamas is seeking amendments to the latest U.S. ceasefire proposal for Gaza, a senior official with the group told The Associated Press on Saturday, as Palestinians in the Gaza Strip expressed hope the war would stop soon.

A big blast was seen over the Gaza Strip on Saturday, lighting up the evening sky. A large explosion was captured on an Associated Press camera positioned in southern Israel. It is not yet known what caused the blast.

Relatives and supporters gathered for a weekly rally in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv on Saturday, demanding a ceasefire and a deal to return the remaining hostages held in Gaza. “For us, there is only one victory, only one path to recovery: a deal that brings back all the hostages. A deal that ends this absolute nightmare,” said Aloni Cunio, the wife of released hostage David Cunio. (AP Video: Shlomo Mor)

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Hamas is seeking amendments to the latest U.S. ceasefire proposal for Gaza, a senior official with the group told The Associated Press on Saturday, but U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff called the Hamas response “totally unacceptable.”

The latest friction in negotiations comes as the fighting nears 20 months of war, and as desperation grows among hungry Palestinians and relatives of hostages in Gaza.

The Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks, said proposed amendments focused on “the U.S. guarantees, the timing of hostage release, the delivery of aid and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.” There were no details.

A separate Hamas statement said the proposal aims for a permanent ceasefire, a comprehensive Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and an ensured flow of aid. It said 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 others would be released ” in exchange for an agreed-upon number of Palestinian prisoners.” Fifty-eight hostages remain and Israel believes 35 are dead.

Witkoff on social media instead described a 60-day ceasefire deal that would free half the living hostages in Gaza and return half of those who have died. He urged Hamas to accept the framework proposal as the basis for talks that he said could begin next week.

Israeli officials have approved the U.S. proposal for a temporary ceasefire. U.S. President Donald Trump has said negotiators were nearing a deal.




A top Hamas official, Bassem Naim, accused Israel of disagreeing with agreed-upon provisions and alleged a “complete bias toward the other side” that he said violates the fairness of mediation.

“We want the bloodshed to stop,” Motasim, a man from the Al-Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, said of the talks. ”I swear to God, we are tired.”

Palestinians in Gaza blocked and offloaded 77 food trucks, the U.N. World Food Program said, as hunger mounts following Israel's monthslong blockade of the territory. The WFP said the aid, mostly flour, was taken before the trucks could reach their destination.

A witness in the southern city of Khan Younis, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, told the AP the U.N. convoy was stopped at a makeshift roadblock and offloaded by desperate civilians in their thousands.

The nearly three-month blockade on Gaza has pushed the population of over 2 million to the brink of famine. While Israel allowed some aid to enter in recent days, aid organizations say far from enough is getting in.

Israel's military body in charge of aid coordination in Gaza, COGAT, said 579 trucks of aid had entered over the past week. The U.N. has said 600 per day were entering under the previous ceasefire that Israel ended with new bombardment.

The WFP said the fear of starvation in Gaza is high. “We need to flood communities with food for the next few days to calm anxieties,” it said in a statement. It added that it has over 140,000 metric tons of food — enough to feed Gazans for two months — ready to be brought in.

The United Nations said earlier this month that Israeli authorities have forced them to use unsecured routes within areas controlled by Israel's military in the eastern areas of Rafah and Khan Younis, where armed gangs are active and trucks were stopped.

An internal document shared with aid groups about security incidents, seen by the AP, said there were four incidents of facilities being looted in three days at the end of May, not including Saturday's.

The U.N. says it has been unable to get enough aid in because of fighting.

A new U.S- and Israeli-backed foundation started operations in Gaza this week, distributing food at several sites in a chaotic rollout.

Israel says the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation eventually will replace the aid operation by the U.N. and others. It says the new mechanism is necessary, accusing Hamas of siphoning off large amounts of aid. The U.N. denies that significant diversion takes place.

The GHF works with armed contractors, which it says are needed to distribute food safely. Aid groups have accused the foundation of militarizing aid. The GHF said it distributed 30 truckloads of food on Saturday and called it their largest distribution so far.

Israel continued its military campaign across Gaza, saying it struck dozens of targets over the past day. Gaza's Health Ministry said at least 60 people were killed by Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours.

The ministry said three people were killed by Israeli gunfire early Saturday in Rafah. Three others were killed — parents and a child — when their car was struck in Gaza City. An Israeli strike hit another car in Gaza City, killing four. And an Israeli strike hit a tent sheltering displaced people in Khan Younis, killing six, said Weam Fares, a spokesperson for Nasser Hospital.

Israel's military said several projectiles from Gaza fell in open areas.

The war began when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and taking 250 hostages.

Israeli strikes have killed more than 54,000 Gaza residents, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its tally.

A group of hostages' relatives again pleaded for a comprehensive ceasefire deal that would free everyone at once, saying the remaining hostages “will not survive continued military pressure.”

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico held its first-ever judicial elections on Sunday, stirring controversy and sowing confusion among voters still struggling to understand a process set to transform the country's court system. 

The election appeared to get off to a slow start.

Some voting centers in Mexico City, the Gulf coast state of Veracruz and the southern state of Chiapas opened with no one or only a handful of people waiting to vote. Experts had warned that turnout in the historic elections could be extremely low, due to the mindboggling array of unfamiliar choices and the fact that voting for judges is entirely new.

Mexico's ruling party, Morena, overhauled the court system late last year, fueling protests and criticism that the reform is an attempt by those in power to seize on their political popularity to gain control of the branch of government until now out of their reach.

“It's an effort to control the court system, which has been a sort of thorn in the side” of those in power, said Laurence Patin, director of the legal organization Juicio Justo in Mexico. “But it's a counter-balance, which exists in every healthy democracy.”

Now, instead of judges being appointed on a system of merit and experience, Mexican voters will choose between some 7,700 candidates vying for more than 2,600 judicial positions.

In a middle-class Mexico City neighborhood, poll workers organized the color-coded ballots by federal and local contests. Four people were waiting to vote when the location opened.




Esteban Hernández, a 31-year-old veterinary student, said he didn't agree with electing judges and doesn't support Morena, but came to vote because “since there isn't much participation, my vote will count more.”

He had studied the candidates on a website listing their qualifications and decided to pick those who had doctorates.

At the same polling place, Octavio Arellano, a 67-year-old consultant, quickly made his selections, referring to handwritten notes he carried with him. He's also a critic of the process, but voted for members of the Supreme Court, as well as disciplinary and electoral tribunals, to “influence the most important” races. He said he spoiled his votes for the local judicial positions.

At a polling place in a park in Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala, Francisco Torres de León, a 62-year-old retired teacher, came prepared, having studied the ballots and his selections. He marked all the ballots in about five minutes, but even so, said, “the process is laborious because there are too many candidates and positions that they're going to occupy.”

Hugo de León Roblero, 73, also a retired teacher, took about 20 minutes to fill out the ballots at the same polling place, but supported the process, which he said was a necessary change, “even though there's some confusion about how to vote.” 

Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum and party allies have said the elections are a way to purge the court system of corruption in a country that has long faced high levels of impunity. Critics say the vote could damage democracy and open the judicial system up further to organized crime and other corrupt actors hoping to get a grip on power. 

That process has only grown more chaotic in the run-up to the vote.

Civil society organizations like Defensorxs have raised red flags about a range of candidates running for election, including lawyers who represented some of Mexico's most feared cartel leaders and local officials who were forced to resign from their positions due to corruption scandals. 

Also among those putting themselves forward are ex-convicts imprisoned for years for drug-trafficking to the United States and a slate of candidates with ties to a religious group whose spiritual leader is behind bars in California after pleading guilty to sexually abusing minors.

At the same time, voters have been plagued by confusion over a voting process that Patin warned has been hastily thrown together. Voters often have to choose from sometimes more than a hundred candidates who are not permitted to clearly voice their party affiliation or carry out widespread campaigning.

As a result, many Mexicans say they're going into the vote blind. Mexico's electoral authority has investigated voter guides being handed out across the country, in what critics say is a blatant move by political parties to stack the vote in their favor.

“Political parties weren't just going to sit with their arms crossed,” Patin said.

Miguel Garcia, a 78-year-old former construction worker, stood in front of the country's Supreme Court on Friday peering at a set of posters, voter guides with the faces and numbers of candidates. 

He was fiercely scribbling down their names on a small scrap of paper and said that he had traveled across Mexico City to try to inform himself ahead of the vote, but he couldn't find any information other than outside the courthouse.

“In the neighborhood where I live, there's no information for us,” he said. “I'm confused, because they're telling us to go out and vote but we don't know who to vote for.”

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on senators pushing to revise the House-passed Trump spending bill as it heads to the Senate for debate.

House Republicans eked out a win in May with their advancement of President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill,"" filled with negotiations and compromises on thorny policy issues that barely passed muster in the lower chamber.

Next week, Senate Republicans will get their turn to parse through the colossal package and are eying changes that could be a hard sell for House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who can only afford to lose three votes.

Congressional Republicans are in a dead sprint to get the megabill — filled with Trump's policy desires on taxes, immigration, energy, defense and the national debt — onto the president's desk by early July.

Trump has thrown his support behind the current product, but said during a press conference in the Oval Office on Friday that he expected the package to be ""jiggered around a little bit.""

""It's going to be negotiated with the Senate, with the House, but the end result is it extends the Trump tax cuts,"" he said.

""If it doesn't get approved, you'll have a 68% tax increase,"" the president continued. ""You're going to go up 68%. That's a number that nobody has ever heard of before. You'll have a massive tax increase.""

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has an identical margin to Johnson, and will need to cultivate support from a Senate GOP that wants to put its own fingerprints on the bill.

Senators have signaled they'd like to make changes to a litany of House proposals, including reforms to Medicaid and the timeline for phasing out green energy tax credits, among others, and have grumbled about the hike to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap pushed for by moderate House Republicans.

Thune said many Republicans are largely in favor of the tax portion of the bill, which seeks to make Trump's first-term tax policy permanent, and particularly the tax policies that are ""stimulative, that are pro-growth, that will create greater growth in the economy.""

Much of the debate, and prospective tweaks, from the upper chamber would likely focus on whether the House's offering has deep enough spending cuts, he said.

""When it comes to the spending side of the equation, this is a unique moment in time and in history where we have the House and the Senate and the White House and an opportunity to do something meaningful about controlled government spending,"" Thune said.

The House package set a benchmark of $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade.

Some in the Senate GOP would like to see that number cranked up marginally to at least $2 trillion, largely because the tax portion of the package is expected to add nearly $4 trillion to the deficit, according to recent findings from the Joint Committee on Taxation.

""There's just so many great things in this bill,"" Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., told Fox News Digital. ""The only thing I would like to do is try to cut the spending, and I would love to take a little bit from a lot of places, rather than a lot from just one place.""

Others, like Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., want to see the cuts in the package return to pre-pandemic spending levels, which would amount to roughly a $6 trillion slash in spending.

Johnson has remained unflinching in his opposition to the current bill, and warned that ""no amount of pressure"" from Trump could change his mind.

""President Trump made a bunch of promises,"" Johnson said at an event in Wisconsin on Wednesday. ""My promise has been, consistently, we have to stop mortgaging our children's future. OK, so I think there are enough [Republicans] to slow this process down until the president, our leadership, gets serious about returning to a pre-pandemic level.""

Others are concerned over the proposed slashes to Medicaid spending, which congressional Republicans have largely pitched as reform efforts designed to root out waste, fraud and abuse in the program used by millions of Americans.

The House package would see a roughly $700 billion cut from the program, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and some Senate Republicans have signaled that they wouldn't support the changes if benefits were cut for their constituents.

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., warned in an op-ed for The New York Times last month that cutting benefits was ""both morally wrong and politically suicidal."" Meanwhile, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, raised concerns about what proposed cuts to the program would do to rural hospitals in her state. 

""I cannot support proposals that would create more duress for our hospitals and providers that are already teetering on the edge of insolvency,"" she said.

Just in time for hurricane season, Microsoft is unveiling a new AI-powered weather prediction system.

Infostealer malware has been on the rise recently, and that's evident from the billions of user records leaked online in the past year alone. This type of malware targets everything from your name, phone number and address to financial details and cryptocurrency. Leading the charge is the Lumma infostealer.

I have been reporting on this malware since last year, and security researchers have called it one of the most dangerous infostealers, infecting millions. There have been countless incidents of Lumma targeting people's personal data (more on this later), but the good news is that Microsoft has taken it down.

The Redmond-based company announced it has dismantled the Lumma Stealer malware operation with the help of law enforcement agencies around the world.

Microsoft confirmed that it has successfully taken down the Lumma Stealer malware network in collaboration with law enforcement agencies around the world. In a blog post, the company revealed that its Digital Crimes Unit had tracked infections on more than 394,000 Windows devices globally between March 16 and May 16.

Lumma was a go-to tool for cybercriminals, often used to siphon sensitive information like login credentials, credit card numbers, bank account details and cryptocurrency wallet data. The malware's reach and impact made it a favored choice among threat actors for financial theft and data breaches.

MASSIVE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 184 MILLION PASSWORDS AND LOGINS

To disrupt the malware's operation, Microsoft obtained a court order from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, which allowed the company to take down key domains that supported Lumma's infrastructure. This was followed by the U.S. Department of Justice stepping in to seize control of Lumma's core command system and shut down marketplaces where the malware was being sold.

International cooperation played a major role as well. Japan's cybercrime unit helped dismantle Lumma's locally hosted infrastructure, while Europol assisted in actions against hundreds of domains used in the operation. In total, over 1,300 domains were seized or redirected to Microsoft-managed sinkholes to prevent further damage.

Microsoft says this takedown effort also included support from industry partners such as Cloudflare, Bitsight and Lumen, which helped dismantle the broader ecosystem that enabled Lumma to thrive.

NEW MALWARE EXPLOITS FAKE UPDATES TO STEAL DATA

Lumma is a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) that has been marketed and sold through underground forums since at least 2022. Over the years, its developers have released multiple versions to continually improve its capabilities. I first reported on Lumma in February 2024, when it was used by hackers to access Google accounts using expired cookies that contained login information.

Lumma continued targeting users, with reports in October 2024 revealing it was impersonating fake human verification pages to trick Windows users into sharing sensitive information. The malware wasn't limited to Windows. In January 2024, security researchers found the infostealer malware was targeting 100 million Mac users, stealing browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets and other personal data.

HOW TO REMOVE MALWARE ON A PC (2025)

To protect yourself from the evolving threat of infostealer malware, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider taking these six essential security measures:

1. Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to press Windows + R, copy commands or paste anything into PowerShell. If a website instructs you to do this, it's likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.

2. Don't click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software: Many infostealer attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company's official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.

The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 

3. Enable two-factor authentication: Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.

4. Keep devices updated: Regularly updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords: If you've interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don't recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.

6. Invest in a personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from infostealer malware or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. ​Check out my top picks for data removal services here.

MALWARE STEALS BANK CARDS AND PASSWORDS FROM MILLIONS OF DEVICES

Microsoft's takedown of the Lumma Stealer malware network is a major win in the fight against infostealers, which have fueled a surge in data breaches over the past year. Lumma had become a go-to tool for cybercriminals, targeting everything from browser credentials to crypto wallets across Windows and Mac systems. I've been tracking this malware since early 2024, and its ability to impersonate human verification pages and abuse expired cookies made it especially dangerous.

A driver who crashed a pickup into a tour van near Yellowstone National Park earlier this month, causing the death of seven people including himself, had a blood alcohol level more than twice the legal limit for driving, police said Friday. 

Isaiah Moreno, 25, of Humble, Texas, was operating a Dodge Ram pickup truck on U.S. Highway 20 in eastern Idaho when his vehicle crossed the center line and collided head-on with a Mercedes tour van carrying more than a dozen people.

Both vehicles burst into flames, and Moreno, along with six people from China, Italy and California, were killed. Survivors were taken to nearby hospitals with injuries.

The deadly crash happened near Henrys Lake, about 16 miles west of Yellowstone in Wyoming. Yellowstone is one of the country's largest national parks and draws millions of visitors each year.

Moreno had a blood alcohol level of .20%, Idaho State Police said in a statement. The limit is .08%.

""This tragedy should be a wake-up call,"" police Capt. Chris Weadick said. ""No one plans to cause a crash or take a life when they get behind the wheel, but choices have consequences.""

ISP troopers responded to the collision at milepost 399. The highway where the crash happened is on a route between Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons that is open in the spring before a north-south route is plowed and the park fully opens for summer.

The victims in the tour van were named by Local News 8 as van driver Yu Zhang, 30, of Eastvale, California; Ivana Wen, 28, of Milan, Italy; Jianping Li, 71, of Guangxi, China; Xiaoming Jiang, 66, of Guilin, China; Li Nie, 64, of Arcadia, California; and Aifeng Wan, 53, also of Arcadia, California.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","‘Unbelievable' Marco Rubio becomes the tip of Trump's spear","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/world/3426846/marco-rubio-tip-trump-spear/","Sun, 01 Jun 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Secretary of State Marco Rubio‘s initial days leading U.S. foreign policy did not grab many headlines.

It seemed that the former Florida senator, overshadowed by special envoys handpicked by President Donald Trump, might have signed up to play a backup role despite the prestigious Cabinet post.

But any doubts about Rubio's power and relevance now seem farcical as he not only participates in the highest-level diplomatic negotiations abroad but is also playing an increasingly important role when it comes to domestic policy.

Rubio is the first statesman since Henry Kissinger to be both secretary of state and acting national security adviser. He's overseeing the restructuring of the United States Agency for International Development, and he's outraging universities by promising to “aggressively revoke” visas for students linked to the Chinese Communist Party.

He was even happy to take responsibility for the deportation of illegal immigrants after Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) scolded him for the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia — “that guy is a gangbanger,” Rubio shot back without a second thought.

It is becoming increasingly difficult to find a realm of national politics in which Rubio is not involved.

When Trump returned to the White House earlier this year, it seemed as though every possible Cabinet appointee was destined for a grueling confirmation process.

Former Rep. Matt Gaetz was swatted down immediately for attorney general. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth was scrutinized and accused from every angle, from his drinking habits to his tattoos, before a razor-thin confirmation. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was pilloried as a crank and a conspiracy theorist before being confirmed as the health and human services secretary.

The reason was obvious. Trump spent the four years following his 2020 defeat planning his new government and prioritizing loyalty over establishment approval. His appointees were outsiders who offended the sensibilities of career congressmen.

“We are not in a typical presidential cycle. We usually have presidents who are elected to a first term, and they may or may not get elected to a second term — there's that eight-year cycle of relevance and then off they go into retirement,” said Steve Yates, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. “In many ways, we have a year-nine president.”

Yates continued, “Under a year-nine president, a lot of it is the president saying: This is what I have in mind to do, it's extremely clear in terms of strategic direction, and I am going to have more of a Cabinet-led form of governance rather than kind of a White House think tank-like approach to policy formation.”

Rubio was the exception to the Cabinet of outsiders. The 14-year Florida senator received a unanimous 99-0 vote from his former colleagues, with the interrogations and grilling that filled his colleagues' confirmation hearings giving way to a glorified celebration of his Senate career.

Early into his tenure as secretary of state, Rubio seemed at risk of being iced out.

Trump appointed Steve Witkoff — a close, personal friend with no diplomatic experience — to serve as his special envoy to handle Israel's war with Hamas and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Witkoff, whose marching orders, by all accounts, have been to act as a simple messenger for the president, was the U.S. official photographed in Doha, Paris, Moscow, and Istanbul as he worked to make Trump's campaign promises of peace a reality.

“I think it's important to understand that Steve Witkoff doesn't appear to be calling the shots as it relates to these negotiations. He's getting instructions from Washington as he travels,” Jonathan Schanzer, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the Washington Examiner.

“I see him as an executor of the president's wishes as it relates to specific deals that the president wishes to accomplish,” he continued. “Gaza ceasefire, hostage negotiations, Iran negotiations, Russia, Ukraine, you know. This is where Steve Witkoff is playing. And these are transactions.”

The globe-trotting former real estate developer's role as a Trump surrogate on the international stage seemed to be forcing the State Department to play second fiddle.

Reports showed Rubio was carrying portfolios focusing mostly on restructuring his department and renegotiating relationships in Latin America.

“I think what the takeaway for me was that we were getting our own hemisphere in order before Rubio turned his sights on other challenges,” Schanzer said. “And so I think those were two important things that took place early on, where Rubio was taking a prominent role, but those were not headline-grabbing things.”

The White House announced on May 1 that national security adviser Mike Waltz would be stepping down from his position.

It was an ungraceful exit following reports that Waltz unintentionally added a prominent journalist to a Signal group chat planning attacks on Yemen. Trump said he would be nominating Waltz as ambassador to the United Nations.

Somewhat surprisingly, Rubio replaced him as the nation's preeminent national security official while still staying on as the secretary of state.

Seemingly overnight, Rubio leapt into national and international headlines.

He collaborated with Vice President JD Vance to quell India and Pakistan's escalating tit-for-tat conflict that presented the possibility of war between two nuclear-capable states.

He began giving updates on peace talks with Russia and Ukraine during press gaggles and issued a condemnation of Germany's intelligence agency after it designated the Trump-aligned Alternative for Germany party an “extremist group.”

He appeared on Fox News during Trump's multi-leg Middle East trip to explain to Sean Hannity why Iran will “never have nuclear weapons” and threatened to “roll [nuclear enrichment] back one way or another.”

Rubio and Vance both traveled to Vatican City to greet Pope Leo XIV after the new pontiff's election, forming a double-team of MAGA Catholics seeking to keep the administration in the Catholic Church's goodwill.

His new role at the National Security Council seemed to expand his relevance even in realms not traditionally associated with the agency.

“I think now we're actually seeing an even greater pivot because it looks like the National Security Council, which Marco Rubio runs, is now being downsized significantly,” Schanzer asserted. “And what this means is that we're likely to see more power in the hands of the secretary himself.”

Critics call the recent widespread layoffs at the National Security Council a dangerous downsizing. Rubio called it “right-sizing.”

“The NSC is the ultimate Deep State. It's Marco vs. the Deep State,” a White House official told Axios. “We're gutting the Deep State.”

Rubio's full embrace of the MAGA agenda has spoiled some of the bipartisan support that got him into the position, but he doesn't seem to care much.

When Van Hollen told Rubio that he now “regrets” voting to confirm him as secretary of state, the former senator scoffed.

“Your regret for voting for me tells me I'm doing a good job, based on what I know about your record,” Rubio responded, sparking furious accusations that he is not taking his duties seriously.

Now deputized with the president's full backing, Rubio is directing State Department resources into domestic issues with foreign angles, prepared to play gatekeeper to noncitizens believed to be disruptive or subversive to the national interest.

The State Department began its initiative with investigations into the visa status of students at Columbia University who were believed to have participated in anti-Israel protests at the campus library.

That fight expanded to a nationwide crackdown on Chinese influence in U.S. higher education, culminating in the administration's current war on Harvard University.

“Under President Trump's leadership, the U.S. State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields,” Rubio announced last week.

At the same time, Rubio is offering State Department resources and authority to complement agencies such as Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement in their mass deportation of illegal immigrants.

The new priorities were formalized in a Friday announcement from the State Department attributed to Rubio announcing a plan aimed at further developing a “more agile Department, better equipped to promote America's interests and keep Americans safe across the world.”

“Over the past quarter century, the domestic operations of the State Department have grown exponentially, resulting in more bureaucracy, higher costs, and fewer results for the American people,” Rubio wrote. “Since my first day as Secretary, I have said that this Department must move at the speed of relevancy and, in April, announced a broad reorganization of the Department to better achieve that goal.”

Rubio said his restructuring was coordinated with feedback from “lawmakers, bureaus, and long-serving employees” to serve modern concerns better.

The plan will reportedly create a new Office of Remigration to facilitate larger and more efficient deportations through the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, according to Axios.

“I think he's been clear that the policies he's addressing are, in fact, relevant to the jurisdiction of what a secretary of state has,” Yates told the Washington Examiner. “He's emphasized visas as being the purview of the Department of State. That's just empirically true. And when it's come to border and other issues, I think he's similarly emphasized his jurisdiction.”

RUBIO ANNOUNCES VISA RESTRICTION FOR FOREIGNERS ‘COMPLICIT IN CENSORING AMERICANS'

Rubio is now the poster child for the Trump administration's guiding political philosophy — breaking each facet of the executive branch out of entrenched silos and coordinating action across sectors without worrying about stepping on toes.

After all, if every Cabinet member is Team Trump, what's the problem with sharing the workload?

“If we're going to be effective, all of the president's top surrogates have to share jurisdiction on this,” Yates said. “You can't address the malign influences of the Chinese Communist Party by treating it only as a foreign policy challenge, or the issues in education as just a Department of Education challenge.”

“It's going to have to be all-hands,” he continued. “And really, it's up to the president to decide who he's most comfortable with addressing these things.”

Trump seems to agree, and there's no one he's more comfortable with than Rubio.

“Marco Rubio, unbelievable, unbelievable. Marco, when I have a problem, I call up Marco,” Trump said of his secretary of state on the same day he appointed him to head the NSC.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","US submits nuclear deal proposal after Iran increases uranium enrichment","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3427814/us-submits-nuclear-deal-proposal-iran-increases-uranium-enrichment/","Sun, 01 Jun 2025 02:24:11 GMT","

The United States has sent its first nuclear deal proposal to Iran since negotiations began in April, a move that comes after a U.N. nuclear watchdog report indicated the Middle Eastern country significantly increased its uranium enrichment over a three-month span.

On Saturday afternoon, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi acknowledged he received a U.S. proposal that was delivered by his Omani counterpart, Sayyid Badr al Busaidi, who has been mediating the nuclear negotiations between the two countries. Araghchi indicated that the proposal “will be appropriately responded to in line with the principles, national interests and rights of the people of Iran.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also revealed that a “detailed and acceptable” proposal was sent to Iran by Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump‘s special envoy to the Middle East, but declined to disclose any of its details.

“President Trump has made it clear that Iran can never obtain a nuclear bomb. Special Envoy Witkoff has sent a detailed and acceptable proposal to the Iranian regime, and it's in their best interest to accept it. Out of respect for the ongoing deal, the administration will not comment on details of the proposal to the media,” Leavitt said in a statement.

While the Trump administration was silent on the details of the document, a New York Times report described it as merely a list of bullet points, not a full draft, citing four officials familiar with the negotiations. Specifically, it calls for Iran to cease all uranium enrichment and proposes creating a regional trust to produce nuclear power that would involve Iran, Saudi Arabia, other Arab states, and the U.S., the report noted.

The news of a U.S. nuclear deal proposal comes shortly after a new report by the International Atomic Energy Agency detailed a sharp spike in uranium enrichment by Iran, which the Vienna-based agency said was of “serious concern.”

According to the Associated Press, as of mid-May, Iran has amassed over 900 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60%, which is just below the 90% needed to produce weapons. That amount was earlier  estimated to be at just over 605 pounds in February. 

In its report, the IAEA said Iran is now “the only non-nuclear-weapon state to produce such material.”

Trump has recently been hopeful about the prospects of an Iranian nuclear deal.

On Friday, he told reporters in the Oval Office he believes the U.S. has “a chance of making a deal.”

“They don't want to be blown up,” Trump added. “They would rather make a deal, and I think that could happen in the not-too-distant future. That would be a great thing if we could have a deal without bombs being dropped all over the Middle East. That would be a very good thing.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Secretary of State Marco Rubio took bold, necessary action on Wednesday when he announced that the Trump administration would be “aggressively” revoking visas issued to Chinese students who have “connections to the Chinese Communist Party or [are] studying in critical fields.” Future student visa applications from Chinese nationals will also face greater scrutiny. This is an important step toward reducing the industrial levels of espionage committed by Chinese nationals on U.S. soil every year.

Confronting this challenge is most important because China is likely to use massive military force in an attempt to conquer Taiwan by 2030. To bolster its chances of success, China is focused on stealing the most cutting-edge new U.S. technologies and then employing or altering them to boost its military. Beijing's victory over Taiwan would mean its securing of political and economic hegemony over the Western Pacific and long-standing U.S. allies such as Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea. That will significantly reduce the economic potential and political freedom of America and our allies. It will also greatly advance China's effort to secure global political hegemony by proving that Beijing, not Washington, is the ascendant global political power.

But the Chinese student espionage problem extends beyond military and security concerns.

The FBI estimates that this Chinese Communist Party-orchestrated espionage costs the U.S. economy between $225 and $600 billion per year. The challenge for U.S. authorities is that every Chinese citizen is required by law to conduct espionage if so ordered by the ruling Communist Party. One threat comes from intelligence officers and agents from the Chinese military, Ministry of State Security, and other intelligence services. These spies have shown a remarkably impressive ability to infiltrate even the most sensitive of U.S. government and research institutions.

But the United States also faces a significant threat from otherwise innocent Chinese students who are one day suddenly told to start using their U.S. campus access to start spying for the Communist Party. If they refuse to do so, students are often threatened that their family back home will face the withdrawal of benefits or even imprisonment. Incidentally, this concern underlines why tools such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Section 702 intercept authority are so crucial in helping the FBI to identify newly activated spies on U.S. soil.

To counter this threat, the first Trump Justice Department introduced the “China Initiative.” It was designed to better help identify Chinese students and academics who were using their access to high-end U.S. technology or research for purposes of espionage. Unfortunately, the Biden administration then suspended this effort in deference to the Left's fixation on political correctness. Rubio's move reflects a broader Trump administration correction of that foolish self-inflicted wound.

This doesn't mean, however, that the Trump administration's move to fundamentally restrict student visas is the correct one.

MEXICAN CARTEL MASSACRES REQUIRE STRONGER US RESPONSE

While no one is entitled to a student visa or a U.S. visa per se, the U.S. should want to attract the best minds to our shores. American students gain from the different perspectives and associated debates that foreign students bring with them. And our universities and economy at large plainly benefit from the financial outlays foreign students make to be here. Nor should the simple act of a social media post opposing U.S. or Israeli security policies be grounds alone to reject a visa, for example. And a total ban on Chinese students would be counterproductive if only in terms of reducing America's means of recruiting Chinese nationals to return home and enter government service as CIA agents. The Trump administration would thus be wrong to significantly reduce student visas on a generalized basis.

Still, if students have expressed support for a terrorist group, or if there are credible grounds to believe they may be acting in service of a hostile foreign state, they clearly should not be allowed to threaten American interests on American soil. In that regard, Rubio's special visa security focus on America's preeminent global adversary is both prudent and overdue.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The closing of Joann means the loss of another destination for creative discovery—and community.

On a trip to my local Joann craft-supply store recently, I felt a cheap thrill. An extremely cheap thrill. Huge signs posted on the front doors read STORE CLOSING and ENTIRE STORE 30%–70% OFF. One screamed NOTHING HELD BACK, which struck me as both desperate and alluring.

I walked in and wandered up and down the picked-over aisles, skimming my fingers across the flannels, fleeces, silks, and satins. Buckets of yarn beckoned. I was even tempted to add a bathrobe, one of those items that places like Joann inexplicably stock alongside craft supplies, to my cart. And soon, in true Millennial fashion, I was lost in nostalgic reverie.

When I was 10 or 11, I started a summer “business” selling friendship bracelets to kids at the local swimming pool, the crafting equivalent of running a neighborhood lemonade stand. That diversion blossomed into a lifetime love of hand-making all sorts of things: blankets, clothes, bags, and many, many hot-glued monstrosities. Since then, I've spent countless hours in craft-supply stores of all kinds, including Joann, which this weekend was expected to finish closing all of its nearly 800 stores, after twice filing for bankruptcy.

Joann's shutdown may sound trivial, or even inevitable—the chain is just the latest in a parade of stores that have marched to the graveyard of big-box brands. But many people in creative circles are worried about having fewer places to stock up. Over the past several decades, the expansion of chains such as Joann effectively snuffed out numerous mom-and-pop craft shops, and now many cities and towns may be left without easy, in-person access to a dedicated craft-supply store.

This isn't the end of crafting, obviously. People still have Hobby Lobby and Michaels. Even Walmart and Target sell craft supplies, though hard-core crafters will point out, rightly, that those chains don't come close to offering the selection of fabric and other materials that Joann did. Smaller specialty shops exist, but their products tend to be more expensive. And yes, items can be ordered online, but that's always a gamble: Crafting is an intensely tactile experience, and when you can't see or touch supplies before buying them, the reality frequently fails to meet expectations.

But the death of a reliable institution such as Joann isn't just about the demise of a business. Its closing creates ever more distance between materials and makers. Plenty of people aspire to indulge their creative side, yet some struggle mightily to find the space and time amid the pressures of day-to-day life. Joann, affordable and accessible, made all of that easier. Take it away, and people might not even try.

Read: Getting through a pandemic with old-fashioned crafts

Joann's disappearance also has, perhaps, an unintended consequence: the loss of yet another outlet for building customs and community, at a time when society could benefit from having more of both. Although crafting is frequently a solitary pursuit, even a kind of invisible labor, it can be a way to form deep, personal connections with other people. I've bonded with a friend at sewing class and spent a weekend with another making Christmas ornaments by covering plastic dinosaurs in Elmer's glue and dipping them in glitter. (Very fun, very messy.) Crafting is also, for many, a matter of family tradition. I learned to crochet from my mother, who was taught by her mother. When I crochet a blanket, I'm participating in, and perpetuating, a loving legacy. And the end result is something I can hold on to for years or even generations. One of my most treasured possessions is a pink, blue, and white afghan blanket my mother crocheted for me when I spent a winter in Chicago.

Crafting isn't necessarily a frivolous pursuit (though it can be). Indeed, it occupies a storied place in America's cultural and political history. During the Revolutionary War era, the “homespun” movement saw women spinning their own yarn as American colonists boycotted British imports. (One of the country's most famous creation myths—that Betsy Ross sewed George Washington's sketch of the first American flag—is of course a story of craft.) Sewing circles have long been a gathering space for political conversation, activism, and agitation. In 1846, Frederick Douglass wrote a thoughtful letter to an antislavery sewing circle in Massachusetts, most likely after its members had reached out to him regarding their interest in abolitionist movements. “Craftivism” has also led to significant public displays. During the AIDS crisis of the 1980s, thousands of people contributed panels to the AIDS Memorial Quilt, an homage to people who had died from the disease. In 2017, people knitted and wore pink “pussy hats” at the Women's March on Washington.

Read: The forgotten everyday origins of ‘craft'

For the talented and deeply dedicated, crafting can morph into a sustainable livelihood or be elevated to fine art. But it is also, quite simply, fulfilling. I don't know how many hours I've filled reading patterns and sewing (and tearing out) stitches. I've crafted so many handmade gifts: some truly beautiful, such as a cream-colored fisherman's afghan I loved so much, I was sad to give it away; and others, such as an uneven, lumpy quilt I sewed in my early 20s, that were cute at best.

Ultimately, losing a store like Joann means losing two of crafting's most necessary elements: inspiration and serendipity. Feeling the weight of a particular yarn, seeing the subtlety of certain colors in certain lights, spotting a finished product on a shelf—these tangible interactions are what move many crafters to experiment with something new. This rich display of possibility is part of what makes crafting feel worthwhile. Which is why, as I tried many different projects over the years, to varying levels of success, I never felt bad about giving a new medium a go. It's also why, on my recent—and most likely last—trip to Joann, as I walked toward the checkout with several skeins of discounted yarn, I stopped and picked up a beginner's cross-stitching kit. Maybe now I'll finally master it.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Our writers and editors share which films they can enjoy over and over again.

This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Welcome back to The Daily's Sunday culture edition.

Not all movies are meant to be watched twice. Some leave a glancing effect; others emanate so much intensity that the idea of sitting through them again feels unbearable. But then there are those films that draw you back in, even after you've seen it all before. So we asked The Atlantic's writers and editors: What's a movie you can watch over and over again?

Raising Arizona (available to rent on Prime Video)

I've probably seen Raising Arizona, the Coen brothers' 1987 classic with Holly Hunter and a 22-year-old Nicholas Cage, a half dozen times over the years. But I've watched the opening sequence many, many more times than that. It's a whole movie-within-the-movie, building up to the title shot with Cage's deadpan narration, rapid-cut scenes, and a jaunty musical bed that goes from whistling and humming to weird ululating. The screenwriting has some all-time great lines (“I tried to stand up and fly straight, but it wasn't easy with that sumbitch Reagan in the White House,” says Cage, with wild hair, aviators, and a 12-gauge shotgun, preparing to stick up a convenience store).

The other day, I made my 12-year-old watch it for the first time. When Cage says to his chatty prison bunkmate, incredulously, “You ate sand?!” my son nearly fell on the floor. A true marker of timelessness.

White Christmas (streaming on Prime Video)

It makes me miserable to contemplate how many people have never once seen the 1954 film White Christmas, let alone given it 10 to 20 percent of their attention while focusing on other activities, which is the ideal way to view it. Then again, the film's surprising obscurity is its hidden ace: From the moment you press “Play” on White Christmas, no one who glances at the screen will be able to predict or even comprehend any aspect of the Technicolor encephalitic fever dream exploding before them unless they have previously seen White Christmas. In any given frame, a viewer might be confronted with a horde of people cavorting inside a giant purple void, waggling tambourines adorned with women's faces; the bombed-out smoldering remains of 1944 Europe; or the virtuoso dancer Vera-Ellen, in head-to-heel chartreuse, executing pirouettes at faster-than-heartbeat speeds (for no defined reason). Muted, it makes for terrific social lubricant at a party—there's something dazzling to remark upon nearly every second if conversation lags. Don't concern yourself with the plot; the film's writers did not.

The Lord of the Rings franchise (streaming on Max)

I suppose my answer is less of a love letter to a movie than it is one to my family. My husband is the movie buff in our family—I'll rarely be caught rewatching movies. But his undying loyalty to the Lord of the Rings franchise means we've watched the trilogy together multiple times, more than once in an 11-plus-hour binge. (Yeah … it's the extended editions, every time.) The movies are a genuinely gorgeous feat of storytelling, bested only by the books; fantasy and action sequences aside, they spotlight friendship, loyalty, and the dueling motivations of pride, duty, and greed. And for our family, at least, they'll be a regular feature—I'm pretty sure it was implicit in our wedding vows that we'd indoctrinate our kids into the LOTR lore—which means that the films are about carving out time for one another as well.

— Katherine J. Wu, staff writer

All Your Faces (available to rent on Google Play and Apple TV)

I've watched the French film All Your Faces three times in the past eight months. The movie isn't a documentary, but it's based on real restorative-justice programs in France that were introduced about a decade ago.

Why did I repeatedly return to a film about an idiosyncratic feature of a foreign country's criminal-justice system? There's something about the encounter between victim and perpetrator, and the instability and unpredictability of these interactions, that surprised me each time I watched it. Equally intense was the tenderness between the instructors and the programs' participants, most evident between the characters played by Adèle Exarchopoulos and Élodie Bouchez. But it's Miou-Miou, playing an elderly victim of petty street crime, who delivers the most haunting line in the movie: “I don't understand the violence.” A mantra for our time.

— Isaac Stanley-Becker, staff writer

Little Women (streaming on Hulu)

Little Women first came to me as a comfort movie. Based on Louisa May Alcott's 1868 novel, Greta Gerwig's 2019 film adaptation features not so much plot as simply vibes: a familiar tale of four sisters and their childhood friend, scenes of a snowy Christmas morning perfect for the holidays.

But with each subsequent encounter during my lonely postgraduate months in a new city, I began to appreciate the little rebellions that make Gerwig's Little Women so special. The story is full of moments of seeing: Professor Bhaer turns around to watch Jo watching a play, Laurie gazes into the Marches' windows, and we, as viewers, feel seen by Jo's boyish brashness. But Gerwig also chooses to focus on Jo's many anxieties. Early in the film, Jo uncharacteristically dismisses her own writing (“Those are just stories,” she says. Just!); later, her monologue reveals a vulnerable desire for companionship (But I'm so lonely!). Gerwig honors the story's essence, but her version is not a granular retelling; rather, it serves as a homage to the art of writing itself—and women's mundane, humble stories, which Jo and Alcott are desperate to tell.

Essay

Diddy's Defenders

By Xochitl Gonzalez

Diddy—whose legal name is Sean Combs—has pleaded not guilty to the charges he faces of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. Many Americans have taken to the comment sections to offer their full-throated belief in his innocence. Despite the video evidence of domestic violence, the photos of Combs's guns with serial numbers removed, and the multiple witnesses testifying that Combs threatened to kill them, this group insists that Diddy's biggest sin is nothing more than being a hypermasculine celebrity with “libertine” sexual tastes.

A poem

I don't know how the beetles got in. Landed like plums rolling off a cloud, soft erasers inside their mouths, my dreams were first to go. Siphoned out via bullet holes, like honeybees

smoked out their hive, chorus of black lines, burned thick and dark, gilded grill marks, hexagon honey stuck to their eyes, there are six sides to loneliness. Ballistic blowfly,

visions of parallel lives, you hide, what you hold. Blind to the brilliance, I died with my eyes at an angle to my skull. Said I'd be right back. Nevermore. Mounds of dirt, oh ants,

no one I love, should find me here. Never had I felt the hardened wings of sudden flight, mid-run, door turned cold-angled cliff. Duck-duck,

goose. Pluck a hole in the circle's skin. Black rip in a bag. This is where memories turn corners. Finger tucked around a crescent moon, light splits and splices the room, disconnects the dots, casts a constellation onto sheetrock.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Reformed, the latest TV show featuring a charming rabbi, stands out for leavening existential depth with comedy.

In recent years, an impressive number of particularly charming actors have played rabbis on TV. Adam Brody, Sarah Sherman, Daveed Diggs, and Kathryn Hahn have all donned a kippah, wrapped themselves in a tallis, and shown how fun loving (even sexy) it can feel to carve a path between the rock of tradition and the hard place of modernity. I'm not sure why progressive rabbis are the clerics to whom pop culture tends to assign this role, as opposed to, say, quirky priests or wacky imams. Maybe Judaism is well suited as a religion that revels in questioning and doubt. Maybe rabbis are just funnier.

Add to the scroll of TV clergy Rabbi Léa Schmoll, played by Elsa Guedj. In Reformed, a new French series now streaming on Max, Léa has the joyful burden of making millenia-old rituals matter anew. Unlike many other shows that feature rabbis, this one focuses on the actual work of rabbi-ing—and it isn't easy. The drama (and sitcom-style comedy) of Reformed comes out of her struggle against both the nihilism of our fallen world, which provides no answers to the bigger questions of life, and a rigid form of Orthodoxy that provides too many easy answers.

In the middle stands utterly human Léa, who has the sweetly befuddled air, wild mane, and wide eyes of a young Carol Kane. Her shirts are often misbuttoned and half-tucked. She's perpetually late. And she is brand-new to the job, having just taken her first rabbi gig when the show opens in her hometown of Strasbourg, in eastern France. She is also a woman rabbi in a country where they are rare—the show makes a running gag of what title to use for her, because both the French word for a female rabbi, rabbine, and a stuffier alternative, Madame le rabbin, sound so unfamiliar that they regularly provoke giggles. After rabbinical school, she moves back into the book-lined apartment of her misanthropic father, a weathered Serge Gainsbourg look-alike (Éric Elmosnino, who actually played Gainsbourg in a biopic). He's a psychotherapist and a staunch atheist for whom a rabbi daughter is a cosmic joke at his expense. “There was Galileo, Freud, Auschwitz,” he declares over dinner when she discusses her new job. “I thought the problem was solved. God doesn't exist. The Creation is meaningless. We're alone. We live. We suffer.” (In French—I promise—this sounds like a very normal dinner conversation.)

Already in the first episode, in her very first interaction with a congregant, Léa has to defend one of the most primitive forms of religious practice: circumcision. A new mother asks for Léa's help in convincing her non-Jewish partner to get over his resistance to their son having a bris. She senses—after many initial bumbling missteps—that what pains the father is that his son's body will be different from his own, no longer an extension of himself. Léa reaches for a biblical story, the binding of Isaac. As they stand outside the synagogue, where the father has been nervously pacing, drinking espressos, and smoking cigarettes (again, France), she offers her explanation for God's seemingly sadistic command that Abraham sacrifice his son. This was done, she argues, not to test Abraham's faith—God, being omniscient, would presumably know Abraham's faithfulness already—but ultimately to stop Abraham's hand before he brought his knife down, proving the limits of a parent's power over their child's life.

Shira Telushkin: The new American judaism

As Léa tells it, this brutal story becomes a comforting parable about learning to stop projecting yourself onto your children, about letting them go. “The binding of Isaac is actually the moment when he is unbound from his father,” Léa says. “God says to the Hebrews, ‘Your children are not your children. They come from you. But they are not you.'”

A bar mitzvah, a wedding, a Passover seder, and two funerals will follow. And though the same dynamic repeats, Léa's confidence grows as she learns how to give sense to the rituals. “In the end, our job is about accomplishing certain gestures and trying to understand their meaning,” she says, providing a pretty good synopsis of the show. Interpretation is her creative act, and part of what makes Reformed enthralling is that she gets really good at it.

Reformed is roughly based on the book Living With Our Dead, by Delphine Horvilleur, which was published in an English translation last year. Horvilleur is a liberal rabbi (she'll even accept “secular rabbi”) who has become something of a celebrity in France. The book would not seem to be an obvious fit for adaptation into a comedy series—in it, she recounts 11 instances of mourning, and how she has worked to integrate death into her life. She also argues eloquently for her more liberal form of the religion. The birth of rabbinic Judaism after the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, in 70 C.E., was the moment, she writes, when exegesis began to trump blind obedience. The rabbis were exiled, and had no temple where they could make sacrifices to God. They invented a religion that was a form of “literal a-theism,” she writes, “a world where God doesn't intervene and where human decisions prevail when there is controversy.”

In the show, Léa has an antagonist on this point, a soulful local Orthodox rabbi named Arié (Lionel Dray) who was once her teacher. The friction in their relationship is more than just theological—their “Will they? Won't they?” sexual tension adds another sitcom element to the show (though given his black fedora and many children at home, I'm guessing they won't). They tussle in a friendly, and sometimes not-so-friendly, way about whether an “authentic” form of Judaism exists. In one climactic scene, while on an interfaith panel discussion, their argument overwhelms the event. Arié refers to Léa's approach to Judaism as “à la carte”: She picks and chooses what suits her interests. “Why not practice meditation or oriental-spirituality seminars, if the goal is to confirm one's own beliefs?” he asks her. Léa shoots back by asking him if he practices polygamy. Religion evolves, she says, and besides, “many people aspire to connect with the wisdom of biblical texts, and they have a right to it, even if you claim exclusive ownership of them.” That's fine, Arié responds, but “don't call it Judaism. Because that's not Judaism. It's something else.”

Franklin Foer: The golden age of American Jews is ending

As someone who is on Léa's side of this debate—I agree with Horvilleur that “Judaism doesn't require its adherents to pass a final exam”—I appreciated her fierce defense of this more open-ended version of the religion, as well as her look of self-doubt as she was arguing it. Judaism that tries to be alive to a changing world has an inferiority complex. It's not even a fair fight when one side takes the accommodation of reality as its mandate and the other cites the direct mandate of God. Léa's work seems more rewarding, though, because the comfort she provides feels more like grace. When she teaches a man sitting alone with his mother's coffin about the Jewish tradition of tearing a piece of your clothes when in mourning, explaining that it symbolizes “that the survivor will never be entirely whole again,” the gesture breaks the stark nothingness on the son's face.

I'm moved by watching a show that finds drama in all of this, because, at the moment, I'm helping my 12-year-old daughter prepare for her bat mitzvah. She has to write a speech responding to the section of Torah she will be reading, one that includes the biblical proscription to “not boil a kid in its mother's milk.” From this, early rabbis extrapolated the strict dietary laws that prohibit mixing milk and meat. My daughter had a different reading, though. In a commentary on the text, she found that in the ancient Near East, meat cooked in soured milk was a delicacy. Maybe God didn't intend for this to be a restriction on food at all, she wondered. Maybe he was just asking people to not show off by eating fancy dishes. Maybe he was telling them to live simply. I liked that in the old words she found her own significance, one an Orthodox rabbi like Arié would find ridiculous but that Léa would smile at.

Reformed is a lot more entertaining than this doctrinal back-and-forth would suggest. The show is ultimately about people feeling confused as they face life at the moments that most require an injection of meaning. Can religion still have purpose for those of us who don't believe? The show answers with a qualified yes—as long as it is religion that is never too sure of itself. “There are lots of rabbis full of certainties,” Arié tells Léa in one consoling moment. “Perhaps all those who are looking for something else need you.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The author of a new biography talks about the conservative journalist's life and legacy.

The June issue of The Atlantic features an excerpt from Sam Tanenhaus's long-awaited biography of the conservative intellectual and polemicist William F. Buckley Jr. That book—Buckley: The Life and Revolution That Changed America—will be published by Penguin Random House on June 3. Buckley exerted enormous influence not only on American politics but also on how political debate was waged (more and more, on television). I asked Tanenhaus to review the highlights of Buckley's 60-year career, and to explain some of the qualities of personality—incuding his sense of humor—that made Buckley such an unusual public figure.

This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Cullen Murphy: William F. Buckley Jr. died in 2008. Two generations of Americans have no real firsthand memories of him, and probably an even larger number don't fully appreciate the role he played in American political and intellectual life for almost half a century. Can you give us a quick overview of Buckley's significance and how it endures?

Sam Tanenhaus: WFB—or Bill Buckley, as all who knew him learned to say, at his insistence—was too many different people to summarize easily. He is best-known for being the architect of the modern conservative movement that remade the party of Eisenhower in the 1950s into the party of Reagan in the 1980s. That was one Buckley. He was also the author of some 50 books. His very first, God and Man at Yale, a scathing and witty critique of his alma mater published in 1951, when he was 25, laid out the lines of attack being repeated today by the Trump administration and its allies, who like Buckley say that Ivy League institutions enforce anti-American orthodoxies and through them corrupt the broader culture. Buckley was also a pioneer in the uses of media. At his peak, he was a thrice-weekly columnist syndicated in more than 360 newspapers—this at a time when most people got their information from newspapers. His TV debate-and-discussion program, Firing Line, which began in 1966 and lasted until 1999, invented the talking-head cable-news programs of our own time. Bill Buckley the literary man and editor was also a discoverer and nurturer of talented young writers whose work he published in National Review, the magazine he founded in 1955. Some of the best American writers and critics in the second half of the 20th century—Joan Didion, Garry Wills, George F. Will, Arlene Croce, John Leonard, and more—got their start writing for National Review. And this doesn't touch on Bill Buckley the sailor, skier, best-selling spy novelist. Or Bill Buckley the devout Catholic—“our pope,” as one admirer told me.

Murphy: What's astonishing to think about is how quickly he arrived on the scene with God and Man at Yale. He goes from being utterly unknown to nationally known with a snap of the fingers. Why did the book make such a splash?

Tanenhaus: Novelty and timing had much to do with it. He excelled at choosing moments, and seeing where the argument was and also where it wasn't. In 1951, McCarthyism was a potent force, and Ivy League campuses were under assault—rather as they are today. The difference was that God and Man at Yale, or GAMAY in the shorthand acronym that Buckley and his publisher used, was the first assault to come from high up inside the ivory tower. Buckley wasn't a populist scourge or congressional Torquemada. He was Mr. “White Shoe” Yale—editor of the campus newspaper, the “last man tapped” for Skull and Bones, which meant the No. 1 big man on campus. He was chosen to give the Class Day oration—that speech, delivered before 10,000 people at commencement, presaged the book. Also, he wrote with wit and style. Even as he attacked left-leaning “atheistic” professors, he learned from them. He wanted to write a book they would respect for its arguments and prose.

From the April 1968 Issue: What makes Bill Buckley run

And they did. When I was first getting to know him, he invited me to his home in Stamford, Connecticut, for lunch. I was amazed to see that the other guest was a distinguished Yale professor, Charles Lindblom, who is denounced in GAMAY. Of course, this was long afterward—40 years later. But still, I was surprised. When Buckley was out of earshot, I asked Lindblom what he'd made of the book at the time. “Oh, that was Bill,” he replied. “He had to do that to make his point.” Then he tucked into lunch on the lovely veranda with its view of Long Island Sound. I wasn't writing about Buckley yet. I was in the first stages of a biography of Whittaker Chambers. But moments like that—the sheer improbability of Bill Buckley, of which this was just one glimpse—made me wonder, Okay, this person is not like anyone else I've encountered. What makes him tick?

Murphy: Well, what did make him tick? There was his Catholicism, as you've mentioned. He was preternaturally, to use a Buckley word, congenial, and his congeniality crossed party lines. Where did his conservatism—his type of conservatism—come from? It was not a populist conservatism. It had intellectual roots.

Tanenhaus: It all began at home, the large rural estate in the northwest corner of Connecticut where he grew up, the sixth of 10 children. Later, when Bill was a fixture on TV—with his memorable voice and patrician style—many assumed he came from Old Yankee stock. He did not. His father, a lawyer and oil speculator, came from the Rio Grande Valley—in fact, from one of the frontier border towns that helped “Landslide” Lyndon B. Johnson steal a Senate election in 1948. Bill's mother came from New Orleans. This made the Buckleys “culturally southern,” according to Bill's older brother Jim, who became a U.S. senator and federal judge. That culture included southern courtliness and graces. I kept meeting brilliant people who said Bill Buckley was the “best conversationalist in the world.” This seemed extravagant—until I got it. They meant the best listener. In the book, I call it “predatory attentiveness,” the debater's habit of absorbing everything you said so it could be—elegantly most of the time, though not always—tossed back at you.

Murphy: And his conservative philosophy? Where did that come from? What were its basic tenets? And how did it take hold of a Republican Party that mostly seemed to be living in an Eisenhower mold?

Tanenhaus: The single greatest disappointment in Bill Buckley's intellectual life—letting down himself, friends and admirers, and, I increasingly feel, the country at large—was his failure to articulate a serious coherent conservative philosophy. He tried to do it, with a book he began writing in 1963 after the assassination of President Kennedy, which brought much hard scrutiny to the American right and its growing militancy. He wrote several chapters—some 60 pages—but could get no further. He kept promising himself and others that he would return to this book, but he never did, and by the end of the 1960s had given up.

I knew about this book when I began work on the biography, and wondered, like his friends, why he was not able to finish writing it. But when I read the pages he did write, which are in the enormous Buckley archive at Yale, I saw that the problem was the opposite—not that he couldn't finish but that he didn't know where to begin. The few chapters keep circling back to a single point, contained in the title, The Revolt Against the Masses. Buckley was always good at book titles, and this one extends the argument made in José Ortega y Gasset's classic The Revolt of the Masses, published in 1930, which Buckley read at Yale in a seminar taught by his mentor Willmoore Kendall. Ortega's book is a learned aristocrat's complaint about the leveling sins of democracy and modern technology, which elevated the lower orders at the expense of their betters—people like Bill Buckley, with their taste and refinement, their respect for tradition, and, in Bill's case, the age-old Catholic Church, with its high dogma and sacred rituals.

Ortega was a big influence on the first American thinker the teenage Bill Buckley met—he was a guest in the Buckley family's home in Sharon, Connecticut—the libertarian man of letters Albert Jay Nock. Any reader of Buckley can always tell when he's reaching for a big point because he'll quote Nock, usually on the debasement of American life in the modern era. Nock's most important book was Our Enemy, the State (1935). Ortega plus Nock equals aristocratic libertarianism.

From the February 2008 Issue: “We're on our way home now, duckie!”

Another component, much the finest aspect of Buckley's thinking, came from Catholic teaching, in particular belief in charity—that is, the love one extends to friends and even adversaries. Out of this came Buckley's many philanthropies. When I told him about a young writer at work on a book about a Catholic school in Harlem, Buckley sent a substantial sum the writer's way so he could finish it. He very much believed in noblesse oblige, a belief he got from his father, a political reactionary who was also exceedingly generous.

It was this idea of a kind of voluntarist society superintended by a small, enlightened group—Nock called them “the remnant”—which Buckley and his allies developed into a hard-edged attack on the New Deal “welfare state” and all its offshoots, including Eisenhower's modified version of it, sometimes called the Big Deal. Every national political leader Buckley ardently embraced for the whole of his life—in sequence, Charles Lindbergh (1939–41), Joseph McCarthy (1950s), Barry Goldwater (1960s), and Ronald Reagan (1970s–80s)—declared himself the enemy of “big government,” meaning our own federal government as it expanded under Democratic and Republican leaders alike during the period many look back on as the American Century.

Buckley absorbed this philosophy in childhood and never abandoned it, though he added a new layer during the Cold War, with the emergence of an enemy even more dangerous than the U.S. government: global communism. Defeating it—or them—became his guiding mission. That epic battle required a big military (including a costly nuclear program), and interventions across the world (including in Vietnam) as well as closer to our shores (Castro's Cuba, Allende's Chile). Closer still, and nearly as menacing, were “socialistic” elements inside America's own political, cultural, and intellectual establishment.

Put all these ideas together, and you have the ideology of the modern right through the end of the 20th century, which simultaneously opposed the encroachments of government (especially when it sought to raise up the “undeserving” at the expense of talented “individualists,” as Nock and his disciples called themselves) even as it urged that same government to wage the Cold War on every front. This ideology, sometimes called “fusionism,” was spelled out in the pages of National Review and eventually was adopted by the GOP, whose leaders saw the utility of presenting themselves to voters as more than pastel “me too” Republicans (later called Republicans in Name Only—RINOS), and instead as counterrevolutionaries determined to “roll back” statism at home and abroad.

It worked brilliantly in strategic and tactical terms, especially when the liberal Cold War consensus began to come apart in the 1960s as anti–Vietnam War protests and the civil-rights movement synchronously grew. Buckley and others argued that the increased radicalism of the left was the stepchild of a permissive, wayward consensus politics that lacked clear, coherent principles. The masses were now in control, and the only solution was to rise up against them. Buckley was not a serious political thinker, but he was a gifted enactor of political ideas as a writer, debater, and—in one pivotal chapter in the life of both him and the conservative movement—candidate for mayor of New York in 1965.

Murphy: Since you brought it up: I remember the mayoral campaign vividly. Buckley was funny, and he turned conservative politics from resolutely angry into something that could be fun. Do you think the mayoral race changed the conservative movement? Or him? Or both?

Tanenhaus: When he was asked what he'd do if he won, he said: “Demand a recount.” It was a line he'd worked out in advance. His aide de camp, a young Yale grad named Neal Freeman, pleaded with him not to use it, since it would feed suspicions that Buckley wasn't taking the campaign seriously. But one of the points Buckley wanted to make was that people were taking politics too seriously. He seldom talked about politics. He once told me he did it only when he was paid, and when he was paid, it was a lot—$11,000 per episode of Firing Line as of 1971. In 1967, Time put him on the cover—a big deal in those days. (Just ask Donald Trump.) The headline was in fact “Conservatism Can Be Fun.”

Ta-Nehisi Coates: When James Baldwin met Bill Buckley

Why did anyone care about fun? For one thing, because fun was in short supply in the politics of that time. In the span of five years, three of our greatest figures—Jack and Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King—were assassinated. We worry about violent uprisings in our moment. In the 1960s, they happened almost continually. New York, Los Angeles, Detroit, and Newark all became war zones. And here was Bill Buckley suggesting there might be another way: Ideological adversaries could talk to one another, use language as a weapon but also as an instrument of persuasion. In the course of that singular New York mayoral campaign, which one friend likened to Andy Warhol–quality performance art, Buckley articulated his ideology with remarkable flair in a city that was being undone by crime, delinquency, and out-of-control municipal spending. He summoned all the strains of conservative belief and remade the GOP into the party we knew until 2016

The luckiest turn for Buckley and New York voters during the mayoral election was a newspaper strike in the fall of 1965. This made TV the main news medium. Each of the local news stations invited the three candidates—the Conservative Party candidate, Buckley; the Republican, John Lindsay; and the Democrat, Abe Beame—into the studio for debates. They were a revelation. Here was something no one had ever witnessed before—a first-class mind and university wit talking about issues like crime in the streets and welfare rolls. Columnists like Murray Kempton and Pete Hamill were enthralled.

It wasn't just the debates. Twenty years ago I wrote an anniversary story on the 1965 campaign for The New York Times Magazine. One of the items that turned up in my research was an audiotape of a luncheon speech Buckley gave to the Overseas Press Club in October 1965. At the time, Buckley was 39. I have never heard anyone command an audience the way he does on that tape—the jokes, the erudite wit, the phrasing and polish, the mellifluous voice, the charm.

It was the mayoral campaign that persuaded Buckley—and WOR, a local New York TV network—to broadcast a regular weekly debate program beginning in the spring of 1966: Firing Line. Richard Nixon's speechwriter Ray Price—who had known and been awed by Buckley at Yale in the late 1940s—told me that Firing Line was Bill's single greatest contribution to the conservative movement and to American politics. For the first time, he brought his argument into the living rooms of Upper West Side liberals and their equivalents across the land, and many were entertained and also persuaded—not every time or in all cases, but just enough to keep listening. Liberals found themselves thinking, I don't agree with him but he's smarter than I am, and maybe I should hear him out. Getting people to listen, to drop their defenses and let you inside their minds, is the all-important first step in winning the argument. With the mayoral campaign and Firing Line, Buckley became good company.

At the same time, the mayoral race was caught up with race in the other sense—that is, racial conflict. It was the great issue in the 1965 campaign, as it was in so much of American politics in those years, and in subsequent years too. One of the things that became clear as I explored the life and times of Bill Buckley was that issues involving race made the conservative movement—that is, brought it into the mainstream. Anti-communism was a strong cause, but it was shared by many. Murray Kempton, Buckley's favorite columnist—in those days, just about everyone's favorite columnist—once pointed out that differences between the patrician Averill Harriman and the rogue Joe McCarthy were differences of taste, by which he meant Harriman's anti-communism was genteel while McCarthy's was vulgar.

Matthew Yglesias: William F. Buckley, RIP

In May 1954, at the same moment McCarthy was coming apart during the Army-McCarthy hearings—seen by as many as 20 million people in the infant days of television—the Supreme Court issued the Brown decision outlawing segregated schools. This instantly created new allegiances and new enmities—first in the '50s, when the Dixiecrats found allies among northern Republicans, and then in the '60s and '70s, when the civil-rights movement moved north, and the new “backlash politics” arose in big cities where the conflicts were different and ethnic groups clashed over schools, jobs, and housing. The same argument that landed with a thud in Buckley's debate at Cambridge University with James Baldwin—Black Americans were actually doing pretty well, and whites should stop apologizing—excited audiences a month or two later when Buckley made it in Manhattan.

Murphy: The high-water mark of Buckley's political influence may have been the election of Ronald Reagan. Would that be fair to say? What was the Buckley-Reagan relationship like?—that's the first question. And the second is related: The GOP itself is changing by the time Reagan assumes office—the conservatism, if that's the word, it espouses more and more is not an intellectual conservatism but a populist emotion. How did Buckley think about what was happening?

Tanenhaus: Yes, most would agree that in 1980, with the election of Reagan—“my favorite president,” as Buckley called him—his ideology and the movement reached their peak. It was a personal triumph for Bill, because he had been Reagan's tutor, going all the way back to 1961, when he had gone to Los Angeles to speak to conservatives and Reagan—then a TV actor and nascent right-wing activist—had been his introducer.

Today, after so many transformations and with the passage of time, few grasp how fringe a figure Reagan seemed to many, even after he was twice elected governor of California [in 1966 and 1970] and proved himself to be a responsible and sensible administrator. The fringe reputation grew out of his association with the John Birch Society, a major force in California politics despite the wacky assertions of Robert Welch, its leader—most notoriously that President Eisenhower was a Soviet agent. Buckley and company didn't know what to do about Welch. At first they prescribed an early version of “don't take him literally, take him seriously,” but once Welch became an embarrassment, Buckley huddled with Goldwater and some others. All agreed that Bill, the super-clever counterpuncher, would take apart Welch's mad theories, which he did at length in the pages of National Review in 1962, outraging many subscribers—one of many episodes that prompted Buckley's famous retort, “Cancel your own goddam subscription.”

Reagan was one of those enlisted to second the attack on Welch—and both the movement and Reagan were saved. But Buckley wanted to bring “Ronnie” along slowly. In 1968, riding high on his landslide first victory in California, Reagan was the presidential favorite of many on the right—including the campus legions who were members of the Young Americans for Freedom (one of Buckley's many suboperations). Buckley said no. Reagan wasn't ready. It was Nixon's turn.

He came to regret this—first when Nixon went to China, undermining his own long history of anti-communism, the one important conservative credential Nixon had; and later, amid the catastrophe of Watergate, set in motion by Buckley's own good friend and former boss, E. Howard Hunt. Hunt was Buckley's handler when Bill was briefly a “deep cover” CIA officer in Mexico City in 1951. He quit after eight months, having found his assignments “tedious”—always the death-knell word for him. Besides, far more stimulating work awaited him back in the U.S.: promoting the surprise best seller God and Man at Yale.

From the July/August 2009 Issue: Daredevil

But, as you suggest, Buckley's relationship with Reagan was complicated, in part because Reagan was more complicated than many realized. I myself didn't realize it until I dug into the facts of Buckley's friendship with him. These were two large figures with, shall we say, healthy egos. A colleague of Reagan's once said Reagan felt superior to everyone in any room of politicians he was in because he had the confidence of one who came from nowhere but had a successful career in Hollywood in its golden age, the 1930s and '40s. That took discipline, skill, talent. Reagan, as the nation and world eventually learned, was a master script reader and deliverer. Gore Vidal once said that Reagan was a far better actor than he was given credit for, and acting is an art. And his speaking voice was probably the best of any American politician's, then or since.

Well, Buckley was pretty good in the speaking and script department too, and in fact wrote his own scripts (including the 1,500 introductions he wrote to Firing Line episodes), and he discovered—or, rather, had the reality thrust upon him—that at a certain point, Reagan decided his tutelage under Bill Buckley was complete, and it was Reagan's turn to take over. This happened in the days following his epic landslide victory in 1980. Thrilled and excited, National Review's editors declared themselves the true victors and brashly announced, “We have a nation to run.”

That sealed it. Reagan decided not to attend the magazine's big 25th-anniversary bash at the Plaza Hotel, in New York, held in December 1980—a snub that caused Buckley acute embarrassment and haunted him all his remaining days. In fact, he was still steamed about toward the end of his life, when he was working on his final book, The Reagan I Knew, which was published posthumously in 2009. The last time I saw Buckley, at his home in Stamford in February 2008, three weeks before he died, the two people he talked about were Reagan and Henry Kissinger, who had become his closest friend—a friendship that dated back to 1954 but grew in the Nixon years and after. In 1980–81, Buckley pleaded with Reagan to bring Kissinger into his Cabinet, but Reagan wouldn't do it because Henry was so deeply disliked on the right—blamed for détente with the Soviet Union and for the China opening. Buckley himself opposed both gambits but liked and admired Kissinger anyway, in part because of his exceptional intellect. Nevertheless, he felt better about it all when, long afterward, Kissinger told him, on one of his last visits to Stamford shortly before Buckley died, that both heretical moves had originated with Nixon, who in addition to being a criminal was one of the most talented geostrategic chess players ever to occupy the White House. Reagan was very good at that too. Buckley and others were appalled when Reagan reached a truce with Mikhail Gorbachev. Reagan had gotten out in front of them all.

One of the lessons of modern politics, reinforced for me while working on this book, is that the role of intellectuals, while important, is actually different from what we—and they—may suppose. Buckley and his allies liked to think of themselves as preceptors and teachers—even visionaries and prophets—ushering in the grand ideas. Mere vote-hustling presidents were the vehicles or instruments of those ideas. In truth the relationship is generally the opposite. The charismatic leader clears the way and the “verbalists,” in the term used by one of Buckley's mentors, James Burnham, fall behind in the important but subsidiary roles of cheerleaders and publicists. This was the message the supposed simpleton Ronnie Reagan coolly delivered to the über-sophisticate Bill Buckley by deciding to skip the banquet at the Plaza.

Emma Green: In the age of Trump, no wonder Republicans miss William F. Buckley

This led to another painful irony. Once Reagan entered the White House, he didn't need Bill Buckley. Nixon had needed him, to keep the right wing in line. But Reagan came directly out of the right wing. Bill Buckley was a social ornament—especially to the ladder-climbing Nancy Reagan—but otherwise not especially useful. The journalist the Reagans cultivated was Buckley's protégé George F. Will, the king of Washington columnists. Fortunately, Buckley had so big and full a life in New York, and had so many interests and friendships of his own there, that he didn't need Reagan either.

Murphy: Reagan aside, what did Buckley think about the direction his party was going in?

Tanenhaus: Populism is a fraught subject for the whole of conservative-movement history. Lindbergh wasn't precisely a populist, but he also was not an officeholder or office seeker. But Joe McCarthy was, and he remains the most important figure in Buckley's crucial formative years. Buckley took up his cause early and defended him 'til the end of his life, though he made vague stabs at saying that maybe “Joe” had been more trouble than he was worth. In fact, Buckley was well aware that the movement needed crowd-pleasing candidates. How else to win office? The ideas and arguments—the philosophy—could be adjusted and contoured (and readjusted and recontoured) to suit each new movement tribune.

After Reagan left office, and the Cold War was won, Buckley found himself a reluctant promoter of the movement's new causes, the “culture wars,” which in the '70s included disputes about “forced” school busing and abortion and, in the '80s, revolved around the AIDS epidemic. The booming voices belonged to Pat Buchanan, Pat Robertson, Rush Limbaugh. Buckley liked them all, in particular Limbaugh. When I attended one of National Review's big events in the early 2000s, Rush was the host and man of honor. Many were surprised. They shouldn't have been. He was a rabble-rouser, but then so had been McCarthy.



I'm asked time and again what would Buckley have made of Donald Trump. My answer is, first, that backward-looking prophecy is the bane of poor historians. It's impossible to read the present into the thinking of a person who lived in an earlier time. Buckley died in 2008, at age 82. He came from a different world than our own but also helped bring our world into being, particularly the world of American conservatives. Many Buckley admirers and acolytes are now Trumpists. Is this a betrayal of Buckley and his legacy, or is it a fulfillment?

There are arguments to be made on both sides. I decided not to discuss or quote Buckley's one extended commentary on Donald Trump, a penetratingly dismissive assessment written in 2000 (and published in, of all venues, Cigar Aficionado), when Trump was toying with running for president on the Reform Party ticket invented by Ross Perot. Why did I omit this? Because it was written long before Trump emerged as a force in the Republican Party. Many who agreed with Buckley's dismissive words back then have since changed their minds. The editors of National Review vehemently opposed Trump in January 2016 but no longer do so. Would Buckley have undergone a similar revolution in his thinking? I can't say, and neither can anyone else.

Murphy: You've spent 25 years working on this book. You've had access to Buckley's papers. You've interviewed his friends and members of his family. You knew Buckley, and spoke with him often and at length. A life fuller than his is hard to imagine, and like anyone's, it had its complexities. As a person—as I understand it, and as he emerges in your book—he elicited great loyalty and affection, and returned it. What were the qualities that accounted for this?

Tanenhaus: Like most journalists who've been kicking around for a long time, I've been in the company of many prominent people. But of them all, not one (with the exception of the great Linda Ronstadt, when I got to interview her some years ago) was so natural and enjoyable company as Bill Buckley. As Garry Wills said, he was “just exciting to be with.” One reason was that the distinctions that so often place barriers between the great and the ordinary simply melted away, with no effort on his part. This may seem strange, since Buckley's speech and manner struck so many as affected or even pretentious. Nothing could be further from the truth. An interviewer asked him once about his ornate vocabulary and diction. Bill replied, “I talk to my dog the same way.” (That was Rowley, his adored Cavalier King Charles spaniel).

Ross Douthat: Cruisin' with the Right

When I first met Buckley, in 1990, he was at or near the peak of his fame. He was a best-selling author, TV star, and Manhattan socialite. He was the acknowledged leader of one of the great political movements in American history and had just seen the single great mission in his life, the defeat of global communism, achieved under American statesmen he had anointed. I was nobody, a 34-year-old barely published freelance journalist. Yet Bill Buckley treated me as his equal in every way, with no hint of pretense or condescension. He had a quality not just of courtesy but of deference I'd not encountered before or since.

This is related to something else—his utter lack of pettiness. His mortal enemy was Gore Vidal, yet I never heard Buckley speak ill of him. One of Buckley's protégés, the writer Michael Lind, told me that the only time he heard Buckley mention Vidal was to praise his brilliance as a writer. Some of this was good manners. My wife and I were recently in Sharon, Connecticut, and spoke with many there who knew several generations of Buckleys. Not once did any Buckley they knew disparage or criticize anyone in personal terms. In Bill's case this carried over into all his dealings. Courtesy was also rooted in his faith. When Bill was growing up in Sharon, every Catholic member of the household—that is, servants and groomsmen—went to church together on Sundays. They piled together into the family Buicks and drove to the modest Catholic church, St. Bernard.

Murphy: Why did you write this biography? You've been at work on it, off and on, for a quarter of a century.

Tanenhaus: Books, as you know, seem to choose authors rather than the other way around. But I can tell you the precise moment when it occurred to me to write about Bill Buckley, if not exactly why. It was in 1992. I was midway through my biography of Whittaker Chambers, and I had just read Garry Wills's wonderful little book Confessions of a Conservative, which included a tantalizing reference to a lunch with Chambers when Garry was at National Review in 1957. Wills was my idol then—as he still is—and I wrote asking if I could speak with him. This was pre-internet and pre-email. Letters were really letters signed and posted in the mail. After some weeks had passed, it seemed clear that Wills was not going to reply. I mentioned my frustration to Buckley. Not long after, the phone rang. It was Bill Buckley, and I remember his exact words. “I hadn't spoken to Garry Wills in 20 years”—because of an epic falling-out during the Vietnam and civil-rights era—“but I just got off the phone with him and he's waiting for your call.” And he was. I made the call, and Garry Wills told me about his meeting with Chambers.

I've turned that little episode over in my mind many times in the past more than 30 years, and each time I'm struck by something different: his extravagant kindness to me, the delight he plainly took in letting me know the extent of his interest in the book I was writing, the excuse he was perhaps looking for to resume a connection whose loss troubled him.

But when I think about it now, what I think of is the enjoyment it afforded Buckley too in solving my problem—the pleasure he found or created in such moments, and there were thousands like them. It is the pleasure of the artist, pleasure allied with an odd detachment. It is of a piece with the feel for comedy—his love of conversation as continual repartee and his embrace of the political life as more than the grim clash of zealotries but instead an adventure and expression of personality. The greatest work of secular religious writing is Dante's La Divina Commedia—comic because the hero reaches paradise. And Buckley, the Catholic who never knew a moment of doubt, was sure the same deliverance awaited him.

From the December 1951 Issue: The changes at Yale

Buckley was born in 1925, the same year a writer he admired and identified with, his fellow Irish Catholic romantic F. Scott Fitzgerald, published The Great Gatsby. Both Bill Buckley and Jay Gatsby turn 100 this year. The two epigraphs in my book come from Marcel Proust and John Keats. I was sorely tempted to add a third, from Gatsby:

If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away … it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.

To be in Bill Buckley's company was to feel this and also to feel—to know—that hope really is a gift, not a delusion, though Buckley knew a great deal about delusion too.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

﻿Is flying into Newark safe?

by  Devan Schwartz and  Sean Rameswaram

Air travel is such a common part of modern life that it's easy to forget all the miraculous technology and communication infrastructure required to do it safely. But recent crashes, including near Washington, DC, and in San Diego — not to mention multiple near misses — have left many fliers wondering: Is it still safe to fly?

That concern is particularly acute at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, which has recently experienced several frightening incidents and near misses in as radio and radar systems have gone dark. This has left an under-staffed and overworked group of air traffic controllers to manage a system moving at a frenetic pace with no room for error.

Andrew Tangel, an aviation reporter for the Wall Street Journal, recently spoke to Jonathan Stewart, a Newark air traffic controller. In early May, Stewart experienced a brief loss of the systems showing him the locations of the many planes was directing. When the systems came back online, he realized there'd almost been a major crash.

According to Tangel, Stewart “sent off a fiery memo to his managers, complaining about how he was put in that situation, which he felt he was being set up for failure.” Stewart now is taking trauma leave because of the stresses of the job. After many delayed flights, United Airlines just announced that it will move some of its flights to nearby John F. Kennedy International Airport. 

To understand how we arrived at our current aviation crisis, Today, Explained co-host Sean Rameswaram spoke with Darryl Campbell, an aviation safety writer for The Verge.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full episode, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

You recently wrote about all these issues with flying for The Verge — and your take was that this isn't just a Newark, New Jersey, problem. It's systemic. Why?

You've probably seen some of the news articles about it, and it's really only in the last couple months because everybody's been paying attention to aviation safety that people are really saying, Oh my gosh!

Newark airport is losing the ability to see airplanes. They're losing radar for minutes at a time, and that's not something you want to hear when you have airplanes flying towards each other at 300 miles an hour. So it is rightfully very concerning. But the thing is, what's been happening at Newark has actually been happening for almost a decade and a half in fits and starts. It'll get really bad, and then it'll get better again. 

Now we're seeing a combination of air traffic control problems; we're seeing a combination of infrastructure problems, and they've got a runway that's entirely shut down. And the way that I think about it is, while Newark is its own special case today, all of the problems that it's facing, other than the runway, are problems that every single airport in the entire country is going to be facing over the next five to 10 years, and so we're really getting a preview of what's going to happen if we don't see some drastic change in the way that the air traffic control system is maintained.

We heard about some of these issues after the crash at DCA outside Washington. What exactly is going on with air traffic controllers?

The first problem is just one of staff retention and training. On the one hand, the air traffic control system and the people who work there are a pretty dedicated bunch, but it takes a long time to get to the point where you're actually entrusted with airplanes. It can be up to four years of training from the moment that you decide, Okay, I want to be an air traffic controller. 

Couple that with the fact that these are government employees and like many other agencies, they haven't really gotten the cost-of-living increases to keep pace with the actual cost of living, especially in places like the New York and New Jersey area, where it's just gone up way faster than in the rest of the country.

This is bad at Newark, but you say it promises to get bad everywhere else too. 

The cost of living is still outpacing the replacement level at a lot of these air traffic control centers. And the washout rate is pretty high. We've seen the average staffing level at a lot of American airports get down below 85, 80 percent, which is really where the FAA wants it to be, and it's getting worse over time. 

At Newark in particular, it's down to about 58 percent as of the first quarter of this year. This is an emergency level of staffing at a baseline. And then on top of that, you have — in order to keep the airplanes going — people working mandatory overtime, mandatory six-days-a-week shifts, and that's accelerating that burnout that naturally happens. There's a lot of compression and a lot of bad things happening independently, but all at the same time in that kind of labor system that's really making it difficult to both hire and retain qualified air traffic controllers.

These sound like very fixable problems, Darryl. Are we trying to fix them? I know former reality TV star and Fox News correspondent — and transportation secretary, in this day and age — Sean Duffy has been out to Newark. He said this: “What we are going to do when we get the money. We have the plan. We actually have to build a brand new state-of-the-art, air traffic control system.”

To his credit, they have announced some improvements on it. They've announced a lot of new funding for the FAA. They've announced an acceleration of hiring, but it's just a short-term fix. 

To put it in context, the FAA's budget usually allocates about $1.7 billion in maintenance fees every year. And so they've announced a couple billion more dollars, but their backlog already is $5.2 billion in maintenance. And these are things like replacing outdated systems, replacing buildings that are housing some of these radars, things that you really need to just get the system to where it should be operating today, let alone get ahead of the maintenance things that are going to happen over the next couple of years. It's really this fight between the FAA and Congress to say, We're going to do a lot today to fix these problems.

And it works for a little while, but then three years down the road, the same problems are still occurring. You got that one-time shot of new money, but then the government cuts back again and again and again. And then you're just putting out one fire, but not addressing the root cause of why there's all this dry powder everywhere.

People are canceling their flights into or out of Newark, but there are also all these smaller accidents we're seeing, most recently in San Diego, where six people were killed when a Cessna crashed. How should people be feeling about that?

There's really no silver bullet and all the choices are not great to actively bad at baseline. Number one is you get the government to pay what it actually costs to run the air traffic control system. That empirically has not happened for decades, so I don't know that we're going to get to do it, especially under this administration, which is focused on cutting costs.

The second thing is to pass on fees to fliers themselves. And it's just like the conversation that Walmart's having with tariffs — they don't want to do it. When they try to pass it on to the customer, President Trump yells at them, and it's just not a great situation. 

The third option is to reduce the number of flights in the sky. Part of this is that airlines are competing to have the most flights, the most convenient schedules, the most options. That's led to this logjam at places like Newark, where you really have these constraints on it. Right before all of this stuff happens, Newark was serving about 80 airplanes an hour, so 80 landings and takeoffs. Today, the FAA's actually started to admit restrictions on it, and now it's closer to 56 flights an hour, and that's probably the level that it can actually handle and not have these issues where you have planes in danger.

But no airline wants to hear, Hey, you have to cut your flight schedule. We saw that with United: Their CEO was saying that the air traffic controllers who took trauma leave had “walked off the job,” which seemed to suggest that he didn't think they should be taking trauma leave because you have to have more planes coming in. That's a competitive disadvantage for him, but you also have to balance safety. It's difficult to understand. It costs a lot of money to fix. This is your textbook “why governments fail” case study and it's not really reassuring that in 24 hours I'm going to be in the middle of it again, trying to fly out of Newark.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","If you're quitting a job or anticipating layoffs, don't burn your bridges at work. Boomerang hires are increasing.","https://www.businessinsider.com/quitting-job-layoffs-boomerang-hires-rehires-increasing-2025-6","Sun, 01 Jun 2025 08:02:00 GMT","

If you're struggling to find a job, try reaching out to your former bosses, especially if you left on good terms.

An analysis of ADP payroll data showed the share of new hires in March who were boomerang workers, or former employees, increased since it cooled down in 2022, when quitting was popular during the Great Resignation. That share was especially pronounced in the information sector this year, which includes tech and media positions.

In addition to workers reaching out to former employers, companies are also being more cautious about who they're hiring. Employers may turn to past workers for an opening.

""In an era where the outlook on the jobs market is fuzzy or uncertain, it makes sense for both employers and employees to stick with what they know,"" Nela Richardson, ADP's chief economist, told Business Insider.

Are you a boomerang worker, or are you a manager who has hired a boomerang worker? Reach out to this reporter at mhoff@businessinsider.com. 

Richardson said employers may want former workers to fill open roles because they know the company culture and can be easier to onboard. Plus, companies already know the worker's performance.

""You want to get the best bang for your buck, and often it's a returning employee,"" Richardson said.

Meanwhile, job seekers are facing a grueling search for new gigs. It's taking longer for people to get hired, big company names like Walmart have announced layoffs, and some people are willing to take any job they can find or accept lower pay. Richardson said people may have quit during the Great Resignation, but were unsatisfied and have since been rehired.

Given the rise of boomerang hires, keeping on good terms with old employers could be a smart move. ""How you leave a job is as important as how you start,"" Richardson said.

Even if you're not looking for work right now, it could be crucial to think about your skills, job performance, and work relationships if the job market slows down further and if more companies decide to make job cuts.

""When I was talking with hiring managers during the Great Resignation, I think they set the scene for what we're seeing now because those managers stopped thinking about employee exits as a final goodbye and started thinking about it as a revolving door,"" Richardson said.

We are standing on the sidewalk near the McDonald's on McKean Avenue in Charleroi, Pennsylvania, a small town on the Monongahela River, about 30 miles south of Pittsburgh. Charleroi, with a population around 4,200, is the sort of insular place that might once have seemed far removed from national politics. But one consequence of the Donald Trump era is that the president's animus bears down on distant corners of the earth in a political butterfly effect: Trump billows in Tucson, Arizona in September. Eight months later, Haitian immigrants load a U-Haul in the Monongahela Valley.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The 2.8% increase in real GDP was the best since the Clinton years and certainly looks better than current prospects under Trump.

Biden's margin over the previous three presidents is so big that future revisions are unlikely to change his standing.

Photographer: Samuel Corum/Sipa/Bloomberg

The US economy did not quite manage 3% annual economic growth during Joe Biden's four years as president. Real (that is, inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product grew an annualized 2.8% from his first to last quarter in office, according to data released last week by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the average of real GDP and real gross domestic income — which some economists believe does a better job of capturing the timing of economic fluctuations — grew 2.7%.

Still, this was easily the best performance since Bill Clinton's presidency, and Biden's margin over the previous three presidents is so big that future GDP and GDI revisions (of which there will be many) are unlikely to change that.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro engaged in a testy back-and-forth with Chinese officials at a Singapore security forum on Sunday, accusing leaders in Beijing of grabbing territory in disputed waters and repressing their own people.

During a panel at the Shangri-La Dialogue, two senior colonels in the People's Liberation Army directed questions at Teodoro, asking whether the Philippines would serve as a US proxy in Asia or adopt a friendlier approach toward China.

In this article

Earnings of major U.S. companies and the uncertainty around tariffs continued to impact investor sentiment this week. While the stock market remains volatile, investors seeking consistent returns could add some attractive dividend stocks to their portfolios.

In this regard, stock picks of top Wall Street analysts can be helpful, as the recommendations of these experts are based on in-depth analysis of a company's financials and ability to pay dividends.

Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

This week's first dividend pick is Home Depot (HD). The home improvement retailer reported mixed results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 but reaffirmed its full-year guidance. The company expressed its intention to maintain its prices and not increase them in response to tariffs.

Home Depot declared a dividend of $2.30 per share for the first quarter of 2025, payable on June 18, 2025. At an annualized dividend of $9.20 per share, HD stock offers a dividend yield of 2.5%.

Following the Q1 FY25 results, Evercore analyst Greg Melich reiterated a buy rating on HD stock with a price target of $400. The analyst thinks that the risk/reward profile of Home Depot stock is one of the best in Evercore's coverage. 

Melich contends that while Home Depot's headline results appear ordinary, he believes that a notable inflection has begun. The analyst highlighted certain positives in Home Depot's Q1 performance, including stabilizing traffic, improving shrink (inventory lost due to theft or other reasons) rates, and acceleration in online sales growth to 8% after staying lower than 5% since Q3 FY22.   

""HD remains a benchmark retailer, investing in technology, multichannel and stores, even while current demand remains low,"" concluded Melich. He continues to believe that once the macro environment improves, Home Depot could be the ""next great Consumer/Retail breakout multiple stock"" like Costco in 2023 and Walmart in 2024.

Melich ranks No. 607 among more than 9,500 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 68% of the time, delivering an average return of 12%. See Home Depot Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Next on this week's list is Diamondback Energy (FANG), an independent oil and gas company that is focused on onshore reserves, mainly in the Permian Basin in West Texas. FANG delivered better-than-expected first-quarter results. However, given the ongoing commodity price volatility, Diamondback reduced its full-year activity to maximize free cash flow generation.

Meanwhile, the company returned $864 million to shareholders in Q1 2025 through stock repurchases and a base dividend of $1.00 per share. FANG's Q1 2025 capital return represented roughly 55% of adjusted free cash flow. Based on the base and variable dividends paid over the past 12 months, FANG stock offers a dividend yield of nearly 3.9%.

In a recent research note, RBC Capital analyst Scott Hanold reaffirmed a buy rating on FANG stock with a price target of $180. Hanold noted that while the company lowered its 2025 capital budget by $400 million or 10% to $3.4 - $3.8 billion, the production outlook was cut by only 1%.

The analyst stated that Diamondback's move to reduce its capital spending plan increased his free cash flow estimate by 7% over the next 18 months. Hanold thinks that the company's decision will not weigh on its operational momentum or the ability to efficiently return to its 500 Mb/d productive capacity.

Commenting on FANG's free cash flow priorities, Hanold noted that the company is tracking ahead of its 50% minimum shareholder return target, thanks to stock buybacks amid the pullback in shares, mainly during early April. He expects the company to use the remaining free cash flow to pay down the $1.5 billion term loan related to its Double Eagle-IV acquisition in the Midland Basin, which was announced in February.

Overall, Hanold's bullish thesis on FANG stock remains intact, and he believes that ""FANG has one of the lowest cost structures in the basin and a corporate cash flow break-even (including dividend) that is among the best in the industry.""

Hanold ranks No. 17 among more than 9,500 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 67% of the time, delivering an average return of 29.1%. See Diamondback Energy Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.

Another dividend-paying energy stock in this week's list is ConocoPhillips (COP). The oil and gas exploration and production company reported market-beating earnings for the first quarter of 2025. Given a volatile macro environment, the company reduced its full-year capital and adjusted operating cost guidance but maintained its production outlook.

In Q1 2025, ConocoPhillips distributed $2.5 billion to shareholders, including $1.5 billion in share repurchases and $1.0 billion via ordinary dividends. At a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share (annualized dividend of $3.12), COP stock offers a yield of about 3.7%.

Following investor meetings with management in Boston, Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta reiterated a buy rating on COP stock with a price target of $119. Mehta highlighted that management sees significant uncertainty in oil prices in the near term due to concerns about economic growth and voluntary production cuts by OPEC+. That said, the company is bullish about long-term gas prices.

Meanwhile, the analyst expects COP's breakeven to shift lower in the times ahead, with major growth projects on track. Mehta stated that while the benchmark price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil – also known as WTI – breakeven (before dividend) is in the mid $40s in 2025, he sees the breakeven heading towards the low $30s once COP's LNG spending comes down and production at its Willow project in Alaska comes online in 2029.

Commenting on COP's shareholder returns, Mehta stated that management acknowledged that their decision not to stick with the $10 billion capital return target led to short-term volatility in COP stock. That said, COP still offers a ""compelling"" return, which Mehta estimates will be 8%.

Mehta ranks No. 568 among more than 9,500 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 59% of the time, delivering an average return of 8.6%. See ConocoPhillips Hedge Fund Trading Activity on TipRanks.

House Republicans passed a multi-trillion-dollar tax and spending package after months of debate, which included many of President Donald Trump's priorities. 

Now, policy experts are bracing for Senate changes as GOP lawmakers aim to finalize the ""big bill"" by the Fourth of July.

If enacted as currently drafted, the House's ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" would make permanent Trump's 2017 tax cuts, while adding new tax breaks for tip income, overtime pay and older Americans, among other provisions.

The House bill also approved historic spending cuts to programs for low-income families, including Medicaid health coverage and SNAP, formerly known as food stamps.

""Overall, the [Senate] bill is not going to be that much different,"" said Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

But there will be ""a lot of debate"" about the Medicaid provision, as well as other changes, he said.

Here are some other issues to watch during negotiations, policy experts say.

With control of Congress, Republicans are using a process called ""budget reconciliation,"" which bypasses the Senate filibuster and only needs a simple majority vote to clear the upper chamber.

But some GOP senators have cost concerns about the House-approved bill.

""We have enough to stop the process until the president gets serious about spending reduction and reducing the deficit,"" Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said last week on CNN's 'State of the Union.'

An earlier version of the House package could raise the deficit by an estimated $3.8 trillion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. However, the agency hasn't released an updated score to reflect the bill's last-minute changes.

Other cost estimates for the House-passed reconciliation bill have ranged between $2 to $3 trillion over 10 years.

Under reconciliation, the Senate bill also must follow the ""Byrd Rule,"" which bans anything unrelated to federal revenue or spending.

After the Senate vote, House lawmakers must approve changes to the bill, which could be tricky with a slim Republican majority.

""That's where the fight is really going to happen,"" Gleckman said.

One sticking point during the House debate was the current $10,000 limit on the federal deduction for state and local taxes, known as ""SALT,"" which is scheduled to sunset after 2025.

Enacted by Trump via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, of 2017, the $10,000 cap has been a key issue for certain lawmakers in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California.

Before TCJA, filers who itemized tax breaks could claim an unlimited deduction on state and local income taxes, along with property taxes. But the so-called alternative minimum tax reduced the benefit for some higher earners.

After lengthy debate, House Republicans approved a $40,000 SALT limit. If enacted, the higher cap would apply to 2025 and phase out for incomes over $500,000.

But the SALT limit is likely to be lower than $40,000 after Senate negotiations, experts say.

Staying closer to the current $10,000 cap ""seems like a very natural place to start,"" but the final number could be higher, said Alex Muresianu, senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation.

The Senate could also expand the child tax credit further, policy experts say.

If enacted in its current form, the House bill would make permanent the maximum $2,000 credit passed via the TCJA, which will otherwise revert to $1,000 after 2025.

The House measure would also make the highest child tax credit $2,500 from 2025 through 2028. After that, the credit's top value would revert to $2,000 and be indexed for inflation.

But some senators, including Josh Hawley, R-Mo., have called for a bigger tax break. Vice President JD Vance also floated a higher child tax credit during the campaign in August.

With the House-approved tax breaks favoring higher earners, ""there's some recognition that they need to do a little more"" for families, Gleckman said.

""That's going to be a fun one to watch,"" he said of the upcoming Senate debate.

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is considering visiting Washington to meet U.S. President Donald Trump before a mid-month summit of the Group of Seven nations as he seeks a trade deal, the Yomiuri newspaper reported on Sunday.

Japanese officials see signs of progress on easing Trump's tariffs after repeated visits by top tariff negotiator Ryosei Akazawa, and say the U.S. side has shown strong interest in Japan's proposals, the Yomiuri said, citing Japanese government officials it did not name.

Economy Minister Akazawa will return to Washington for more talks later this week, after which a decision will be made on a U.S. trip by Ishiba, the newspaper said.

The White House and the Japanese prime minister's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside business hours.

Speaking to reporters upon returning on Sunday from his fourth round of negotiations, Akazawa said talks are progressing towards an agreement but that the form of negotiations before the G-7 summit was yet to be decided.

Japan, a major U.S. ally, faces what Trump calls a reciprocal tariff of 24% from next month unless it can negotiate a bilateral deal. Tokyo is also scrambling to find ways to get Washington to exempt its automakers, Japan's most significant industry, from 25% tariffs on automobiles.

Trump said on Friday he planned to double the tariffs on all imported steel and aluminium to 50%.

Akazawa declined to comment on those tariffs on Sunday. He said Trade Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent did not mention them during the most recent negotiations.

Some Japanese government officials hope an agreement can be announced in time for Trump's birthday on June 14, the Yomiuri said.

Akazawa said on Friday the two sides had ""agreed to accelerate the talks and hold another round ahead of the G-7 summit,"" to be held from June 15 to 17 in Canada.

But he said there would be no deal without U.S. concessions on tariffs, including on autos.

Ishiba has said bilateral negotiations were progressing on trade expansion, non-tariff measures and economic security, while Tokyo has mentioned possible increases in its purchases of U.S. military equipment and energy, as well as cooperation on shipbuilding and repairing U.S. warships in Japan.

Some European companies are growing wary about sending their employees to the U.S.

It comes amid volatile policymaking by the Trump administration, more stringent immigration checks, and an uptick in reports of detentions and deportations.

Some businesses CNBC spoke to, in areas including engineering and accounting, stressed that their work trips to the U.S. continued unabated. But others, usually in more politically sensitive fields, flagged employee welfare concerns.

Their responses ranged from issuing new travel guidance — such as advising workers to bring wiped electronic devices or entering the U.S. via Canada — to encouraging attendance at U.S. events or conferences online where possible.

Business travel is a significant revenue source for the U.S. economy. According to a report published by the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) last year, total spend in the sector generated a total $421 billion and $119 billion in tax revenue in 2022, the most recent year in which full data was available. That came from an estimated 429.9 million business trips supporting 6 million jobs.

Business travel is also a key revenue-maker for the aviation industry, generating between 50% and 75% of profit for airlines in many cases.

In a survey of 900 global travel buyers conducted by GBTA in April, 29% said they expected a decline in business travel volume at their companies in 2025 as a result of U.S. policy across both travel and tariffs. The survey also found a decline in overall optimism in the sector.

Any chilling effect would also come with international tourism expected to be dented this year, costing $12.5 billion in spending, due to negative perceptions of trade and immigration policy.

Border control and foreign visas have been highly charged issues since President Donald Trump took office in January, with reports of tourists being held in detention centres for long periods. The White House pledged in January that all foreigners seeking to enter the U.S. would be ""vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.""

Relations between the U.S. administration and the academic community have also soured, following moves to pause international student visa issuance and ""aggressively revoke"" visas for Chinese students, as well as the detention of some foreign students on apparently political grounds.

""We're hearing some international travellers have expressed unease about visiting the U.S. due to increased visa scrutiny, social media monitoring, and incidents of detention or deportation despite valid documents,"" said Prashray Kala, a partner at management consultancy Everest Group.

""Those with a visible online footprint are more cautious, especially with the 'Catch and Revoke' policy enhancing surveillance,"" Kala said.

Announced April 30, this policy means that anyone with a U.S. visa will lose their immigration status after one strike for any violation of U.S. law, regardless of severity.

One European fund manager who frequently travels to the U.S. for business said he was concerned immigration authorities at airports could hinder his travel plans due to a change in political attitude, rather than policy.

""Business travel on an ESTA [visa] is no longer what it used to be"", the fund manager said.

The head of an international non-government organization with headquarters in London told CNBC that they had devised a new travel protocol for the U.S.

The policy goes beyond their usual requirements for information about an employee's movements and contact details, into issues around physical and information security. The NGO produces investigative reports into topics spanning climate change, corporate malpractice and corruption.

Employees CNBC spoke to for this story requested anonymity to be able to discuss internal workplace matters.

""On one level for us as an organization, that shouldn't really require us to break into a sweat, we do that for lots of places that our staff travel to,"" the NGO chief executive said.

""But from a personal perspective, this is very illuminating — in a not very pleasant way — because these are the sorts of things I think about when I travel to, say, China or Azerbaijan, autocratic regimes. The idea that we would have to apply that approach to travel to the U.S. is something which would never have occurred to me until just a few months ago.""

Examples include taking ""burner"" phones or computers only used for the trip, and preparing employees for scenarios in which they are aggressively questioned about their travel intentions or things they have published online, they said.

Separately, an academic researcher at a university in Switzerland told CNBC that they had been provided with guidance to ideally travel into the U.S. via Canada where possible, or to attend conferences virtually to avoid any visa complications.

They noted that some of their colleagues were still making trips to the U.S. without incident, but others had been questioned at the border for longer, and some had decided not to attend summer academic conferences stateside. Visiting programs to U.S. universities have been particularly affected and even put on hold, they added.

All of those CNBC spoke to across a range of industries agreed that the prevailing climate around U.S. travel was one of uncertainty.

""There is, of course, a risk of overreacting to this ... ploughing more of our time and resources into preparing for this than actual, tangible risk warrants,"" the NGO chief said.

""There's always this question of how you separate out the outright bluster from what might be substantive and might actually be acted on. I think probably this time around, we take more of the bluster seriously.""

— CNBC's Ganesh Rao contributed to this story.

Investors always pay close attention to bonds, and what the latest movement in prices and yields is saying about the economy. Right now, the action is telling investors to stick to the shorter-end of the fixed-income market with their maturities.

""There's lots of concern and volatility, but on the short and middle end, we're seeing less volatility and stable yields,"" Joanna Gallegos, CEO and founder of bond ETF company BondBloxx, said on CNBC's ""ETF Edge.""

The 3-month T-Bill right now is paying above 4.3%, annualized. The two-year is paying 3.9% while the 10-year is offering about 4.4%. 

ETF flows in 2025 show that it's the ultrashort opportunity that is attracting the most investors. The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 T-Bill ETF (BIL) are both among the top 10 ETFs in investor flows this year, taking in over $25 billion in assets. Only Vanguard Group's S&P 500 ETF (VOO) has taken in more new money from investors this year than SGOV, according to ETFAction.com data. Vanguard's Short Term Bond ETF (BSV) is not far behind, with over $4 billion in flows this year, placing within the top 20 among all ETFs in year-to-date flows.

""Long duration just doesn't work right now"" said Todd Sohn, senior ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities, on ""ETF Edge.""

It would seem that Warren Buffett agrees, with Berkshire Hathaway doubling its ownership of T-bills and now owning 5% of all short-term Treasuries, according to a recent JPMorgan report. 

""The volatility has been on the long end,"" Gallegos said. ""The 20-year has gone from negative to positive five times so far this year,"" she added.

The bond volatility comes nine months after the Fed began cutting rates, a campaign it has since paused amid concerns about the potential for resurgent inflation due to tariffs. Broader market concerns about government spending and deficit levels, especially with a major tax cut bill on the horizon, have added to bond market jitters. 

Long-term treasuries and long-term corporate bonds have posted negative performance since September, which is very rare, according to Sohn. ""The only other time that's happened in modern times was during the Financial Crisis,"" he said. ""It is hard to argue against short-term duration bonds right now,"" he added. 

Sohn is advising clients to steer clear of anything with a duration of longer than seven years, which has a yield in the 4.1% range right now.

Gallegos says she is concerned that amid the bond market volatility, investors aren't paying enough attention to fixed income as part of their portfolio mix. ""My fear is investors are not diversifying their portfolios with bonds today, and investors still have an equity addiction to concentrated broad-based indexes that are overweight certain tech names. They get used to these double-digit returns,"" she said. 

Volatility in the stock market has been high this year as well. The S&P 500 rose to record levels in February, before falling 20%, hitting a low in April, and then making back all of those losses more recently. While bonds are an important component of long-term investing to shield a portfolio from stock corrections, Sohn said now is also a time for investors to look beyond the United States within their equity positions. 

""International equities are contributing to portfolios like they haven't done in a decade"" he said. ""Last year was Japanese equities, this year it is European equities. Investors don't have to be loaded up on U.S. large cap growth right now,"" he said.

The S&P 500 posted 20 percent-plus returns in both 2023 and 2024.

The iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF (EZU) is up 25% so far this year.  The iShares MSCI Japan ETF (EWJ) posted performance above 25% in the two-year period prior to 2025, and is up over 10% this year.

06/01 update below. This post was originally published on May 30

Bitcoin has fallen sharply since hitting an all-time high last week, down 6% despite the U.S. vice president JD Vance issuing a huge bitcoin prediction.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""

The bitcoin price has rocketed over the last two years, turbo-charged by Wall Street adoption led by the world's largest asset manager BlackRock and then U.S. president Donald Trump's embrace of the technology (with Elon Musk quietly plotting what could be a bitcoin price game-changer).

Now, as fears swirl the U.S. dollar could be teetering on the verge of collapse, a serious BlackRock warning that quantum computing could pose an existential risk to bitcoin has been escalated by a Google research paper that found encryption-breaking quantum computers could be a lot closer than previously thought.

BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has emerged as one of the most bullish voices supporting ... More bitcoin on Wall Street, helping the bitcoin price boom.

“This is a 20-fold decrease in the number of qubits from our previous estimate,” Google Quantum AI researcher Craig Gidney wrote, referring to the number of quantum computer qubits needed to break a public-key encryption algorithm similar to that used by bitcoin.

“If this is even remotely true, combined with everything else happening right now, the only safe trade are hard assets and, dare I say, gold,” investor Chamath Palihapitiya, a vocal supporter of bitcoin who claims to have first bought some when the bitcoin price was just $100, posted to X in response to the paper.

06/01 update: The bitcoin price has now plummeted by almost 10% from its all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin, falling to just over $103,000 and fast approaching the closely-watched $100,000 level.

""Next week will be critical for both the crypto market,"" analysts with 10x Research led by Markus Thielen wrote in an emailed note that suggested long-term bitcoin holders are beginning to sell.

This coming week will see slew of economic and labor market data—topped by Friday's monthly U.S. jobs report—as well as U.S. president Donald Trump's controversial ""big, beautiful"" tax bill coming to the Senate and legal back-and-forth expected over Trump's market-crashing barrage of global trade tariffs.

Meanwhile, bullish bitcoin price analysts are predicting small changes in “sentiment” could trigger outsized market swings, with huge volumes of cash still sitting on the sidelines. 

“With roughly $7 trillion still parked in money market funds and another $2 trillion in fixed income ETFs, even a modest shift in risk sentiment could redirect meaningful capital into crypto and other high-beta assets,” Matt Mena, research strategist at crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) company 21Shares, said in emailed comments.

“If bitcoin breaks out of the $105,000 to $110,000 range with conviction, we could see a sharp move to $120,000 and, more importantly, reach our previously year-end price target of $138,500 per bitcoin by the end of the summer.”

Earlier this month, BlackRock quietly added a serious warning about quantum computing to the list of risks to its huge spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).

BlackRock, which manages after around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street's campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with a fleet of funds debuting in January 2024.

The fund now holds around 3% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, worth $70 billion at the current bitcoin price, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network.

The bitcoin price has rocketed higher, hitting an all-time high of around $112,000 per bitcoin last ... More week before dropping back.

“If quantum computing technology is able to advance […] it could potentially undermine the viability of many of the cryptographic algorithms used across the world's information technology infrastructure, including the cryptographic algorithms used for digital assets like bitcoin,” BlackRock's amended regulatory filing for its bitcoin fund read.

The quantum computing risk to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has exploded recently, with tech giants including Google making strides in quantum computing research.

“At this point, no blockchain is ready to withstand a quantum attack when this becomes possible, which could very well be much earlier than 2030,” David Carvalho, the chief executive of decentralized post-quantum infrastructure blockchain Naoris Protocol, said in earlier emailed comments that warned bitcoin is “sleepwalking into a disaster.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Bitcoin's price will more than double within the next six months, swelling to $250,000, according to Bitcoin billionaire and BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, as U.S. President Donald Trump moves away from the market-rattling impact of tariffs toward other fiscal policies.

“Midterm elections are coming up in the U.S.,” he told Decrypt at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas. “While the Trump administration went hard on tariffs and was taking this market pain for the last three months, that narrative has to shift.”

Instead of pursuing trade policies that could weigh on economic growth and potentially hurt Americans' ability to afford everyday goods, Hayes—who has made his fair share of bold predictions—argued that the president will have to show he “brought goodies for the population” to help Republicans at the ballot box come 2026.

“They're going to accelerate the money printing,” Hayes said, referring to the Federal Reserve—an independent government agency that is primarily responsible for managing the U.S. money supply.

Among policies that U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has teased as fiscal stimulus, Hayes highlighted potential changes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-backed mortgage giants that have been under government oversight since the 2008 financial crisis.

If the government-sponsored enterprises are allowed to go public and raise capital again, that would inject cheap liquidity into the housing market, Hayes said. Allowing them to “lever up their balance sheets” would also make mortgages more affordable, he said. Among knock-on effects, increased housing activity could theoretically spur economic growth and support risk-on assets.

On top of that, discussions surrounding a so-called supplemental leverage ratio, or SLR, exemption for U.S. Treasuries are bullish, Hayes said. In essence, the White House wants to ease leverage ratios for banks when it comes to their exposure to U.S. debt.

“That allows the U.S. banking system to apply infinite leverage to buy treasury bonds is obviously very positive for global capital markets,” he added.

Finally, Hayes sees the government shifting from tariffs to capital controls to support American manufacturing in a more politically palatable way. Instead of taxing imports, the U.S. could tax foreign government holdings of bonds, equities, and land that stem from trade long-running trade imbalances.

How that could drive governments toward gold and Bitcoin is a central theme of his latest essay, which also predicts that Bitcoin will hit $1 million before 2028. Earlier this month, Hayes predicted that Bitcoin would hit $150,000 this year, as opposed to $250,000.

Billionaire investor Tim Draper made a similar call this month, highlighting regulatory tailwinds for the asset under the Trump administration. Bitcoin's path to $250,000 this year will also be bolstered by myriad firms adopting Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, he said.

With Congress weighing legislative initiatives that could potentially establish rules for stablecoins and create a regulatory taxonomy for many coins, Hayes also told Decrypt that Ethereum will make its own comeback this year, rising as high as $5,000.

Bitcoin advocate Max Keiser has questioned whether new Bitcoin treasury companies will show the same commitment as Strategy co‐founder Michael Saylor.

According to Keiser's May 30 X post, Saylor kept buying Bitcoin through past market drops without selling, even when his holdings were underwater. He pointed out that Strategy's imitators have yet to face a real bear market. Based on this, Keiser warned it might be unrealistic to assume these newer firms will stay steady if prices slide.

Max Keiser Raises Doubts

In a May 30 X post, Keiser wrote, “The Strategy clones have not been tested in a bear market. Saylor never sold and just kept buying, even when his BTC position was underwater. It is foolish to think the new Bitcoin Treasury Strategy clones will have the same discipline.”

The @Strategy clones have not been tested in a bear market.@saylor never sold, and just kept buying, even when his BTC position was under water.

It's foolish to think the new Bitcoin Treasury @Strategy clones will have the same discipline.

He had already compared Strategy to “the Bitcoin of BTC treasury plays,” implying that other firms will struggle to match that level of conviction. Short trades and quick flips have driven some copycats so far. Long holds in a downtrend? That's a different story.

Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Soar

Companies are jumping on the Bitcoin treasury train at a rapid pace. Based on reports, dozens of businesses announced plans to follow Strategy's lead in the first half of 2025. Some analysts now believe 50% or more of all crypto could soon sit on corporate balance sheets.

Strive, the asset management firm led by former political candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, joined on May 7. Trump Media and Technology Group confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to buy Bitcoin on May 27. Each fresh announcement drives more copycats, which adds to both hype and risk in the space.Premium Prices Alarm Analysts

Strategy's stock rose to an all‐time high of $543 on November 21, and that jump inspired rival firms to list their own Bitcoin plans. Metaplanet, for example, trades at a Bitcoin premium of $600,000. That means investors are paying nearly six times more for exposure than if they bought Bitcoin directly.

Based on reports, analysts argue such high premiums can't last forever. If Bitcoin dips or demand for stock‐based exposure weakens, those markups could evaporate. Paying $600,000 extra per Bitcoin position today might look very different if prices fall tomorrow.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum Faced With Familiar $2,800 Price Barrier","https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-face-familiar-2800-barrier-ready-breakout/","Sun, 01 Jun 2025 07:00:03 GMT","

The Ethereum market has seen a modest price decline in the past day as the broader crypto market reacts to news of US-China trade talks potentially yielding a negative result. Amidst this decline, Ethereum prices have dipped to around $2,550 before showing a minor rebound in the past few hours. 

Meanwhile, renowned market analyst with X username Daan Crypto states the altcoin now faces a major price resistance, the outcome of which is influential on the future price trajectory.


In an X post on May 30, Daan Crypto shares an insightful technical analysis that indicates Ethereum is now facing a significant price barrier at $2,800 price zone.

Notably, the popular analyst explains that $2,800 has proven to be an important price level in the ETH market regardless of the price trend. Historically, a decisive close above or below this zone has often led to significant price movement. in the corresponding direction. This instance was seen when prices traded as high as $4,000 in late 2024 followed an extended market correction which forced prices as low as $1,400.

Since the crypto market rebound began in April, Ethereum has already faced one rejection at $2,800 indicating the presence of a robust selling pressure at this price zone. With the altcoin now recovering from its most recent dip in the past week, Ethereum bulls are now expected to take another swipe at this key resistance level. Daan Crypto nudges investors to watch this price level as a successful breakout would signal major price gains ahead.

At the very least, the altcoin becomes likely to reclaim the $4,000 price zone which represents the peak price of the current bull market.


In other news, prominent blockain analytics firm Sentora reports the Ethereum network saw a 2.3% decline in weekly network fees suggesting a fall in transaction numbers as well as general network engagement.  Nevertheless, exchange net outflows of $516 million strongly indicates that ETH investors still remain bullish as they opt to move their holdings into private wallets despite the recent price fall.

At the time of writing, Ethereum continues to trade at $2,514 reflecting a price decline of 3.58% in the past day. However, market gain of 43.22% on the monthly chart respectively suggest the current market trend remains bullish. With a total market cap of $311.69 billion, Ethereum is ranked as the second-largest cryptocurrency and largest altcoin in the world.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Is $3,000 The Next Frontier For Ethereum Price?","https://blockchainmagazine.net/is-3000-the-next-frontier-for-ethereum-price/","Sun, 01 Jun 2025 05:10:23 GMT","

Ethereum price is making headlines again as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization experiences a notable surge. Investors and traders are buzzing with excitement, driven by strong fundamentals and growing institutional interest, as Ethereum continues to solidify its position in the crypto market.

The recent uptick in the Ethereum price can be attributed to several key factors. First, Ethereum's network fundamentals are showing robust growth, particularly with increased activity on layer-2 scaling solutions. These solutions enhance transaction efficiency, making Ethereum more appealing for decentralized applications (dApps) and institutional use. Additionally, spot Ethereum ETFs have seen significant inflows, reflecting heightened confidence from larger investors.

Another catalyst is the anticipation around Ethereum's ongoing upgrades, which aim to improve scalability and energy efficiency. These developments have fueled optimism, pushing the Ethereum price closer to key resistance levels. Analysts note that Ethereum's dominance in total value locked (TVL) within decentralized finance (DeFi) further supports its bullish outlook.

As of recent trading sessions, the Ethereum price has been hovering around the $2,600 mark, with brief attempts to breach $2,700.



Despite facing resistance, the price has shown resilience, supported by high trading volumes and renewed market confidence. Posts on X highlight growing optimism, with some traders eyeing a potential breakout toward $3,000, though short-term volatility remains a concern.

Let's assume that #Ethereum breaks the ascending support. Where should we expect the price in this case?

The $2,200🎯 level will be an opportunity for DCA.

Let's discuss!👇 pic.twitter.com/RlWbqw343d

— Carl Moon (@TheMoonCarl) May 31, 2025



Market sentiment is also influenced by macroeconomic factors, such as global trade policies and broader crypto market trends. While some analysts caution about possible corrections, the overall outlook for the Ethereum price remains positive, driven by strong on-chain metrics and institutional backing.

Looking ahead, traders are closely watching whether Ethereum can sustain its momentum and break through the $2,800 resistance level. A successful breakout could pave the way for a rally toward $3,000, a psychological milestone that could trigger further buying pressure. However, increased sell-side pressure near this level, as noted by on-chain analytics, may pose challenges.

For now, Ethereum's strong fundamentals, coupled with growing adoption, make it a focal point for crypto enthusiasts. Whether you're a seasoned investor or new to the space, keeping an eye on the Ethereum price is essential as the market navigates this dynamic phase.

The crypto world is buzzing again – but this time, it's not just memes or moonshots.

There's a perfect storm brewing, where global macro fears meet meme coin mania, and it's shaking up what investors consider ‘safe.'

From high-level financial warnings to playful battles between frog and dog meme coins, we're watching two powerful narratives collide. And in the middle of it all? A wave of altcoins gaining real traction.

Today's list isn't about hype alone. It's about how serious shifts in the financial system are pushing people to look for opportunity – and how some of the best altcoins are stepping into the spotlight.

It's not every day that the CEO of JPMorgan Chase sounds the alarm about the future of the U.S. dollar. But Jamie Dimon just did.

In an interview with CNBC at the Reagan National Economic Forum, he warned that if the U.S. government doesn't get its act together – specifically by fixing its mounting debt and improving relations with global allies – the dollar could lose its status as the world's reserve currency.



That would be a seismic event in finance, shaking the foundation of everything from global trade to individual savings.

At the same time, meme coins are heating up again. Pepe, one of 2023's viral sensations, is making headlines with bold plans to overtake Shiba Inu in market cap.

The project's developers have doubled down on marketing, community engagement, and token burn strategies to boost scarcity and value.

But it's not just about memes anymore. This new wave of tokens is smarter, more innovative, and backed by serious community vision – or even cutting-edge tech like AI.

Between financial uncertainty and meme-driven optimism, the stage is set. Investors are eyeing altcoins that offer more than laughs. Let's look at three of the new crypto projects gaining momentum right now.

Solaxy ($SOLX) isn't just another blockchain project – it's the first-ever Layer 2 built on Solana.

That's a big deal. Solana is known for its blazing speed and low fees, but it has struggled with congestion, scalability issues, and failed transactions.

Solaxy fixes all that. It neutralizes the weak points of Solana while supercharging its strengths, delivering a faster, smoother, and more reliable experience for users and developers alike.



At its core, Solaxy is a Web3 infrastructure upgrade. It gives developers a powerful platform to build next-gen decentralized apps and meme coins without worrying about performance bottlenecks.

Solaxy also empowers everyday meme coin traders by offering sniper bot speed – without needing any technical skills.

With nearly $43M already raised and a token price of just $0.001742, investor momentum is red-hot. But the crypto presale ends in just 15 days – so if you're looking to buy $SOLX, now's your last chance.

Mind of Pepe ($MIND) is the world's first meme coin with a fully autonomous AI agent driving its ecosystem.

And here's the urgent bit: the presale is almost over, and the token officially launches this Tuesday. With over $12M already raised and a final presale price of just $0.0037515, this is the last chance to grab $MIND before it hits the open market.



At the center of it all is a self-evolving, self-sovereign AI. It's not just for show. This AI spots trends before they blow up using hive-mind analysis, interacts with influencers, and delivers token-gated alpha to holders.

It can even launch new tokens on the fly – giving $MIND holders first-in access to fresh opportunities.

Now let's talk numbers. If $MIND hits its forecasted 2025 high of $0.00535, that's a 42.6% gain from today's price.

At today's price, that's $450. At the 2025 prediction? That becomes $642 – a 71% return on your initial investment, just by holding and staking.

Mind of Pepe isn't just a meme – it's a movement with brains, buzz, and built-in income, emerging right as Pepe aims to flip Shiba Inu and investors hunt for smarter meme coin plays.

Codename Pepe ($AGNT) is taking the chaos of crypto markets and turning it into a clear, data-driven strategy.

At the heart of Codename Pepe is its flagship utility token, $AGNT, which unlocks access to exclusive predictive analytics, market insights, governance, and staking rewards.



What sets Codename Pepe apart is its AI agent, trained to monitor everything from on-chain activity to trending memes and sentiment across social media.

It doesn't just collect data – it interprets it and translates it into actionable trading signals.

Whether it's detecting early momentum for an obscure altcoin or sniffing out whale wallet movements before a major pump, Codename Pepe delivers an edge for those who want to stay ahead of the curve.

And as more retail traders look for smarter ways to play the market, Codename Pepe is positioning itself as the ultimate tool for navigating the meme coin battlefield.

In a market where meme coins are battling for dominance and the dollar's future looks shaky, $AGNT might just be your secret weapon.

With growing fears around the U.S. dollar's long-term dominance and meme coins entering a new phase of evolution, crypto is becoming more than just a speculative play – it's becoming a strategic hedge.

New crypto projects like Solaxy, Mind of Pepe, and Codename Pepe are leading the charge, offering utility, innovation, and timely relevance in a shifting global landscape.

Coldware ($COLD) is a combination of a Layer-1 blockchain with hardware like the Larna 2400 smartphone and ColdBook laptop, which gives it real utility. It's also interesting that the team is building an ecosystem where blockchain becomes a seamless part of daily life.

Let's check out what's happening below.

Coldware, taking into consideration the crypto ecosystem, takes an encompassing approach. Instead of launching yet another token, it is building an infrastructure that allows the application of blockchain technology to real-world usage.”

The project puts together three essential elements that most other projects in crypto do not incorporate: an independent Layer-1 blockchain, user-friendly software, and hardware designed specifically for the ecosystem.

This all-in-one approach means users don't need technical skills to take advantage of blockchain, so it's a clear contrast to other developer-heavy ecosystem.

Coldware's main devices (the Larna 2400 smartphone and the ColdBook laptop) come preloaded with everything needed to access the network. Users can send payments, stake tokens, use decentralized apps, or even run a light node, all from these devices with zero extra setup or technical hassle.

For people living in the parts of the world that depend mostly on mobile internet and have very little access to conventional banking, such plug-and-play functionality is especially valuable. Coldware makes crypto real and usable for billions of people who need a real money alternative.

$COLD is the central engine behind the whole Coldware ecosystem. This is how it secures the network by staking, powers the DeFi functions of lending and liquidity pools, and serves as a method of payment across Coldware devices and apps.

Holders of $COLD also get a say in governance decisions, access premium features, and can tokenize real-world assets. In areas where banking infrastructures are unstable, $COLD serves well as a currency by guaranteeing quick and cheap transactions. What sets Coldware apart from the rest? Real, usable products. Combining hardware and software with blockchain, it is working to create an actual product that people can use.

Coldware stands apart by delivering a full-stack ecosystem—hardware, blockchain, and apps—engineered for practical use. It's a system designed for adoption, with clear steps and real products already in motion.

The Open Network (TON), an independent layer-1 Blockchain that has a symbiotic relationship with the Telegram messaging platform, experienced a brief outage that halted block production on June 1 before functionality was restored.

TON's development team announced the issue at 12:51:00 UTC and restored network functionality approximately 40 minutes after the outage was identified. TON developers wrote in an update:

The team also assured users that no funds were affected by the outage and that transactions submitted during the downtime were not at risk of loss.

Blockchain network outages typically affect higher-throughput, high-speed blockchains due to the increased technical complexity of these chains. As the sophistication of blockchain networks increases, brief outages may become more common, potentially impacting consumer confidence in cryptocurrencies.

TON experienced several outages in 2024 caused by DOGS memecoin minting

In August 2024, TON experienced several brief outages caused by high demand for the DOGS memecoin, which created network congestion that forced a chain halt.

The first outage on August 27 halted block production at workchain block 45,341,899. The network downtime lasted for several hours before validators reset their nodes at 4:00 AM UTC to restore network consensus.

At 5:30 AM UTC functionality was briefly restored before the network crashed again hours later, once again due to high traffic from users minting DOGS memecoins on the TON blockchain.

TON experienced another brief outage the following day on August 28, with block production halting at workchain block 45,350,522.

This second outage lasted for roughly six hours before the issue was fixed, and block production resumed on August 28.

Despite the brief network outages, TON continues to attract retail interest and institutional investment, particularly from large, well-known players in the digital asset space.

In March 2025, TON raised $400 million from venture capital firms, including Sequoia Capital, Draper Associates, CoinFund, SkyBridge and others.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Blockchain in Health and Fitness: Revolutionizing Wellness and the Fitness Industry","https://www.bitcoinsensus.com/learn/blockchain-in-health-and-fitness/","Sun, 01 Jun 2025 17:30:27 GMT","

The correlation between how much money you have spent on memecoins and how much you can bench press has never been stronger. 

That's because blockchain has evolved into a place where it is now capable of helping people get healthier and more active. In this article, we'll explore how blockchain in health and fitness can help you boost your wellness—bringing your crypto gains and gym gains together like never before.

Do you know what is better than a session of burpees? Well… everything. However, what if I told you that you can actually earn crypto while working out? There are several platforms out there that will let you earn tokens for physical activity, bringing together crypto and fitness in a way we never saw possible. 

For instance, Sweat Economy lets users earn $SWEAT by simply walking. The platform can be linked to Apple Health and Google Fit, allowing it to track your daily movements. Then there's Lympo, which offers $LYM tokens for completing fitness tasks and engaging with the app's health content. 

MetaGym goes a step further by offering VR workouts and rewards in $MGCN. It's built for people using fitness wearables like Fitbit or Apple Watch, and integrates health coaching. Also, OliveX is building an entire fitness metaverse, where your workouts power in-game avatars and earn token rewards.

It's certainly interesting how these platforms managed to gamify real-world activities, turning daily habits like walking, stretching, or even meditating into crypto-earning opportunities.

HealthBlocks uses the IOTA blockchain to let users securely store and share health data. It connects with wearables like Oura Rings and Garmin, rewarding users in $HEALTH tokens for completing goals and surveys.

Dotmoovs is an AI-powered app where you film your workout challenges—like soccer or dance—and it scores your moves. The better your form, the more $MOOV tokens you earn.

What's even cooler is that these platforms run on decentralized networks, meaning that user data is far more secure than traditional fitness apps. Instead of handing over sensitive health metrics to centralized companies that might sell or misuse them, users keep control of their own data, often stored on-chain or encrypted across decentralized storage systems.

“Move-to-Earn” is the DeFi trend that lets users earn digital assets simply by moving, exercising, or completing pre-determined tasks.



Getting healthy is hard. Getting crypto makes it easier.

Apps like Sweat Economy, Lympo, and MetaGym reward everything from step counts to sleep tracking. HealthHero integrates with Slack and Teams to offer corporate wellness programs where users earn points and crypto for logging healthy behaviors.

These tokens can be traded, donated, or used for discounts on wellness services. It's fitness with a financial edge.

The healthcare sector is not only one of the most important industries globally—but also one of the largest and most outdated when it comes to data management. After all, this industry endured the physical-to-digital revolution and is now entering the Web3 transformation. 

Traditional healthcare systems are plagued by stale data, inconsistent record-keeping, and security concerns. What's even more shocking is that patients have no real control over their medical information, which is scattered across healthcare businesses, hospitals, and even government files—usually in formats that don't talk to each other.

Blockchain technology drastically improves on that. Decentralized networks are capable of storing medical data in an immutable, secure, and fast format that can be accessed by anyone involved from any corner of the world. 

For example, platforms like MediBloc, Patientory, and Medicalchain are building blockchain-based systems where patients store their health records and share them securely with providers when needed. Then there's Solve.Care, which uses blockchain and smart contracts to automate care coordination, appointment scheduling, and even payments.

At its core, blockchain-based fitness tracking works the same way as regular fitness tracking applications. By this, I mean workout logging, step counting, calorie tracking, and sleep monitoring. The real difference is in how that data interacts with the system: blockchain adds a programmable, tamper-proof layer that turns raw fitness stats into verifiable, actionable outcomes.

Sure, regular apps can track your 5K run and give you a badge for it. But ultimately, these applications rely on a centralized system where a single actor controls the rewards, outcomes, and even how they store your data. Meanwhile, blockchain-based applications use dApps to cut out the middleman, meaning that any and every outcome is predetermined and automatic.

Web3 wellness projects are building entire communities and governance models around health.



Medical data is extremely sensitive and personal, and blockchain technology ensures it keeps it this way. Projects like BurstIQ, MediBloc, and Coral Health offer platforms for managing health records that patients own and control. They use blockchain to ensure:



No more calling five clinics to find your own blood test.

Don't feel like going to the gym today? Well, what if someone wired you some crypto? Sure makes working out more appealing, right? Through crypto incentives, healthy habits can now be rewarded directly with tokens, digital assets, or even access to exclusive experiences. 

Sure, don't expect to become rich off a few dumbbell sets. However, the gamification of fitness adds a new layer of incentive and reward that is not only good for your health, but also turns your progress into something you can actually own.

Let's be real, NFTs are a lot cooler now that celebrities have grown tired of them. If this technology was once seen as just a way for Logan Paul to show he has more money than you, it can now actually serve real, practical purposes for everyone. 

Want proof you did that 5K? Mint it.

Platforms like Step App and Genopets allow users to mint NFTs of achievements—everything from daily streaks to leaderboard wins. Some NFTs unlock bonuses; others just serve as proof-of-sweat bragging rights. StepHero even turns these challenges into collectible game cards, building crossover value into both fitness and gaming ecosystems.

The fact of the matter is that unique verifiable tokens on the blockchain provide a permanent record of your fitness milestones—tokens that can't be faked, duplicated, or taken away.





Everything from yoga classes to virtual therapy can now be accessed and incentivized through smart contracts and tokenized memberships.

Web3 platforms are expanding into mental health, and they can actually be super helpful to help modernize and popularize care. Web3 technology helps keep track of your mental health activities, like therapy sessions, meditation, or support group attendance.

The decentralized nature of the blockchain even allows people to take part in therapy and support groups anonymously, yet verifiably. 

The gamification aspect that we've seen before can also be useful here. Users who actively participate in mental health activities—like daily mindfulness exercises or attending virtual support sessions—can earn rewards or badges that recognize their commitment.

Here are a few in that niche:



Blockchain is connecting all these elements into unified ecosystems.

Platforms like HealthBlocks, Rejuve.AI, Solve.Care, and MetaGym are creating full-stack health systems where users:



Despite what Zuckerberg has made it look like, the metaverse can actually be really cool. Instead of just awkward virtual hangouts, it's becoming a space for immersive social, fitness, and wellness experiences. 

Be it virtual reality workouts, group fitness sessions with people from all around the world, the metaverse can transform how we stay active, and even how we interact with these activities. With blockchain, your workout progress and health info can easily travel between apps, gyms, and virtual spaces, making your fitness journey feel connected and way more rewarding.

Key Takeaways

Ethena has officially launched its natively integrated with the TON blockchain, thereby expanding its DeFi ecosystem to offer USDe and its staked variant tsUSDe to over a billion Telegram users. 

The move embeds Ethena's dollar-denominated savings straight into the wallets based on Telegram, which include TON Space, MyTonWallet, TonHub, and TonKeeper.

For this reason, it has designed access for users to retrieve, purchase, and stake USDe in an easy and safe environment while remaining within the Telegram app.

The launch comes with the promise of broader accessibility and improved financial tools for global users, especially in regions where traditional banking systems remain out of reach.

By seamlessly integrating with the wallet ecosystem of Telegram, Ethena inherits an already engaged user base and eliminates the friction usually associated with onboarding into DeFi.

To incentivize use, Ethena launched a limited 16-week campaign offering attractive annual percentage yields (APY) to users staking USDe to get tsUSDe.

The campaign starts with a 10% boosted APY, gradually declining to 5% in the final weeks, supplementing the base 8% yield of tsUSDe. Eligible users are required to hold at least 10 tsUSDe and 10 TON in qualifying wallets to receive the rewards, which are distributed weekly.

The boosted APY will be capped at up to 10,000 tsUSDe per wallet to keep it fair among all participants. These rewards will be distributed in TON, and such a campaign speaks quite well to engaging and attracting liquidity into the TON DeFi ecosystem.

USDe's earning and staking process is now streamlined for mobile users too. USDe can be acquired or transferred into the TON network via several options, including direct purchases through DeFi swaps on TON or withdrawals from centralized platforms such as ByBit and MEXC. 

Once USDe is in their wallets, users easily stake it into tsUSDe through simple, wallet-specific steps designed for a smooth experience. The process is supportive of different levels of user experience, from veteran DeFi enthusiasts to new users discovering digital finance for the very first time. 

With tsUSDe paying users every eight hours and extensive integration into the app ecosystem of Telegram, the transition of Ethena represents a landmark for bringing decentralized finance closer, simpler, and more rewarding to everyone.

Unlike cryptocurrencies  like bitcoin or ethereum, which are “fungible” and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, NFTs are unique, and it is not possible for them to be exchanged on a like-for-like basis. 

NFTs are stored on a blockchain, ensuring that the NFT not only retains its uniqueness, but in order to provide a transparent history and ‘chain' of its ownership.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","NFTs in Gaming: Are They the Future of Digital Ownership?","https://www.analyticsinsight.net/nft/nfts-in-gaming-are-they-the-future-of-digital-ownership","Sun, 01 Jun 2025 14:30:00 GMT","

NFTs have revolutionized the gaming sector since they have stepped into it with their unique approach to in-game assets.

NFTs have introduced verified ownership of players over their possessions. 

The introduction of NFTs in the gaming sector has benefited players and developers alike. 

The emergence of NFTs in gaming is a result of the revolutionary intersection of virtual gaming and blockchain technology. NFTs have brought the concept of non-replaceable assets to the gaming section. In the last few years, non-fungible tokens have made their appearance as a prominent transformative force in the virtual gaming industry. It has created new opportunities for both gamers and developers. 

The rapid growth of NFTs signifies a radical change in how players consider and interact with in-game assets. NFTs use blockchain technologies to allow players to buy, trade, or sell unique in-game assets. This unique system not only positively impacts player engagement but also generates stable revenue sources for game developers. 

NFTs mark a significant transformation in the field of digital gaming. NFTs are non-fungible tokens. So, players can't trade one NFT for another. This specific feature makes it different in contrast to other cryptocurrencies that are fungible and can be traded for one another. This concept has opened a new avenue for in-game assets. 

Conventionally, in-game assets like skins, weapons, and virtual real estate are part of specific games. These are not only confined to the respective games, but players also have limited control over these digital possessions. NFTs destroyed this traditional model and introduced verifiable ownership. Verifiable ownership of unique digital items on the blockchain provides players with total control and flexibility over their possessions.

Using NFTs, gamers can buy, sell, or trade their rare in-game assets across various platforms. This system creates an engaging marketplace where the concept of in-game possession goes beyond the boundaries of a single game. This opportunity, on the one hand, enhances gameplay experience, and on the other, it introduces new passages for monetization.

In this game, players can earn real money through in-game achievements, turning their progress into tangible rewards. Furthermore, NFTs support unique community engagement and collaboration. It creates a player-driven economy that enables players to actively participate in the gaming ecosystem. This blurs the line between developers and consumers. 

The integration of NFTs in the gaming sector not only improves player experience but also opens up new scopes for developers as well. As NFTs are getting more integrated into the gaming world, developers can now implement innovative gameplay mechanics and monetization strategies that completely fit the demand of the evolving gaming community.

The most notable part of NFTs in gaming includes the addition of real-world assets in the gaming world. This significantly encourages players to invest time and resources into the game, building long-term attachment. It is the best way to create a loyal player base. 

Moreover, developers can generate revenue through the sale of NFTs. These NFT deals let them enjoy royalties from secondary market transactions. This makes a sustainable economic model. Finally, the integration of NFTs creates a way for cross-platform interoperability. It allows assets to move seamlessly between different gaming environments without any restraints. 

To sum up this argument, NFTs are set to redefine the gaming landscape. It's true that these are generating a complete change in the realm of digital ownership. The best part is that NFTs bridge the gap between true ownership of in-game assets and innovative tools for engagement and monetization. As the technology grows, NFTs' potential in the gaming industry will become more prominent.

Wihinze aho ubika kuraba ico uteka ngo ufungure, usanze ibiraya vyawe bimaze kuzako imimeramezwa, uraheza ukabirya canke urabita?

Ibi hari benshi bakunze kuvyibazako ariko si bose bashobora guhuriza ku kintu kimwe iyo bibaza igikwiye gukorwa. Iyo ari ibiterwa nk'ibiraya, ibitunguru, n'ibindi nk'ivyo bimaze kuzana imimeramezwa, nta nyishu imwe  ihurizwako na bose y'ico vyokozwa.

Kuzana imimeramezwa ni ikintu gisanzwe cerekana ko ikiraya cawe kiriko gishaka kuvamwo ikindi giterwa gishasha.

Muri ico gihe, umumeramezwa utangura kuzana urugero runini rw'ubumara bwitwa glycoalkaloids – bufasha igiterwa kwirinda ingwara z'ifira hamwe no kuribwa n'udukoko.

Igice kimwe c'ubwo bumara citwa solanine, ni ubumara bushobora kuboneka mu biterwa vyinshi birimwo ibiraya, itomati, imyungu n'ibindi nka ben'ivyo.

End of Ibisomwa cane

Kwimbura no kubika ibifungurwa, bivanye n'uko vyakozwe, bishobora gutuma ubwo bumara bwongerekana mu biterwa, ivyo bikabangamira kiremwa muntu ndetse n'ibikoko bivyihereza.

Dr Chris Bishop, umuhinga yanditse igitabo 'Potatoes Posthaverst', akaba n'umwigisha muri kaminuza ya Lincoln mu Bwongereza avuga ati: ""Ingorane nyamukuru ni uko nko ku biraya, glycoalkaloids, ituma binatakaza uburyohe ahubwo bikarura, kenshi ubwo bumara bugatuma uwuvyihereje adahwa, ariko ntihagire izindi ngaruka zirenze aho.""

Avuga ko ubwo bumara buca bwibonekeza kubera ikiraya gihindura ibara kigasa n'urwatsi rubisi. Ari nayo mpamvu ata wari akwiye kurya ivyo biraya.

Agira ati: ""Ibiraya bisa n'urwatsi rubisi nivyo birimwo urugero runini rw'ubumara, bitegerezwa rero gukurwamwo. Hamwe woba ufise amakenga, wokeba igice c'ico kiraya cahinduye ibara akaba arico ukurako, canke aho hamaze kuza umumeramezwa. Igice gisigaye kirashobora kuribwa.""

Porofeseri Martin agira ati: ""Bitandukanye n'ibirayi, ibitunguru bijeko imimeramezwa, ntaco biba bitwaye kubifungura mu bisanzwe, kuko bitaba bifise ubumara nk'uburi mu biraya vyameze"".

""Imimeramezwa yavyo ikura iturutse mu ngaburo ibitse mw'iteke ry'igitunguru (bulb). Ariko bishobora kugira umururazi kandi bikoroha kurusha uko vyari bisanzwe"".

Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital, shared his journey into the world of Bitcoin BTC/USD that started during his brief stint at the White House. His interest in cryptocurrency has since led him to become a significant player in the digital currency space.

What Happened: Scaramucci's second encounter with Bitcoin happened in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in 2017. The meeting, attended by then-Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and officials from The Federal Reserve, revolved around cryptocurrency research and was a pivotal moment in sparking Scaramucci's interest in Bitcoin and blockchain technology.

After his departure from the White House, Scaramucci delved deeper into digital currency research, eventually becoming a crypto investor through his hedge fund. His publication, The Little Book of Bitcoin, shares stories about people's journey to cryptocurrency, reflecting his belief that most people who explore Bitcoin end up believing in it.

As per the Fortune, the book has been well-received, earning praise from Strategy chairman Michael Saylor, despite initial disagreements about investment allocation recommendations. 

According to Scaramucci, he approached Saylor to pen the foreword for his book. After reading the manuscript, Saylor called him—while sailing on his yacht—to say he was impressed overall, but strongly disagreed with the final chapter.

Saylor questioned why Scaramucci would advocate for Bitcoin with such strong conviction yet suggest only a modest investment. 

Speculate on price movements, claim up to $200 in bonuses, and start with risk-free paper trading with crypto futures on Plus500.

Saylor told him, ""You just got done telling me this is the greatest investment"" but you only recommend a 2% allocation, Scaramucci said. That feedback led Scaramucci to revise the book's conclusion.

While Scaramucci has found success in his crypto investments, he has made it clear that he has no political ambitions. He expressed hope for a resolution to the political impasse and the ongoing tariff issues with Canada.

Why It Matters: Scaramucci's journey from the White House to becoming a crypto investor highlights the growing interest and acceptance of cryptocurrencies among traditional finance professionals. 

His story, as told in his book, could inspire more people to explore and invest in digital currencies, potentially driving further growth in the cryptocurrency market.

In a significant development for the cryptocurrency world, Abstract Chain, a pioneering project in the realm of abstract crypto, has officially launched its mainnet in January 2025. Developed by Igloo Inc., the parent company of the popular NFT collection Pudgy Penguins, Abstract Chain is poised to transform how everyday users interact with blockchain technology.

Abstract Chain is dedicated to making abstract crypto more approachable and user-friendly. By addressing persistent issues such as high gas fees, complex seed phrases, and steep learning curves, Abstract aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized world of crypto. This consumer-centric approach positions Abstract Chain as a key player in the abstract crypto landscape, with a mission to democratize access to blockchain technology.

One of the standout features of Abstract Chain is its Abstract Global Wallet (AGW), which revolutionizes wallet management by incorporating passkeys, social logins, and sharded private key storage. This innovation eliminates the need for users to remember complex seed phrases, making it easier for newcomers to enter the crypto space. For example, users can onboard with just an email.

Another key aspect is Panoramic Governance, a novel mechanism that aligns incentives between users, applications, and governance participants. This ensures a balanced and sustainable ecosystem, fostering long-term growth and innovation in the abstract crypto space.

Technically, Abstract Chain leverages zkSync's ZK stack and EigenDA, providing a scalable and secure platform for developers to build consumer-facing web3 applications. These applications span immersive games like Pudgy World, social networks, and advanced trading platforms, all designed with the end-user in mind. According to CoinGecko, Abstract Chain ranks as the #49 largest blockchain by total value locked (TVL), reflecting the growing interest in abstract crypto solutions that prioritize simplicity and accessibility.

The platform's portfolio is expanding, with projects like DOGAMÍ, Playember, and ChronoForge building on Abstract Chain. This developer interest underscores the chain's potential to become a hub for innovative consumer crypto applications.

Since its launch, Abstract Chain has generated significant excitement within the crypto community. An X post by @GeckoTerminal announced tracking support for Abstract Chain, highlighting its fast, low-cost transactions and focus on gaming and social apps. Similarly, @0xCygaar on X demonstrated the power of the Abstract Global Wallet, showing how users can mint NFTs in just four clicks without paying gas fees.

However, not all feedback has been positive. An X post by @CharcoOnchain raised concerns about security, noting that 90% of coins on Abstract's homepage were honeypots, and there were issues with contract security scanners and RPC reliability. These challenges, while not uncommon for a newly launched blockchain, highlight the need for robust security measures and continuous improvement. The Abstract Chain team has been actively engaging with the community to address these issues, as evidenced by their ongoing updates and developer support.

The launch of Abstract Chain signifies a new era in abstract crypto, where technology meets usability. By simplifying blockchain interactions, Abstract Chain is paving the way for mainstream adoption, potentially transforming how millions engage with decentralized finance. Its focus on consumer-centric applications, combined with innovative solutions to longstanding crypto challenges, positions it as a leader in the evolving blockchain landscape.

As Abstract Chain continues to mature, addressing early technical and security concerns will be crucial. With projects like Pudgy World and Onchain Heroes already building on the platform, and the PENGU token rising 45% in value post-launch, the future looks promising for this consumer-focused blockchain.

Abstract Chain is more than just another Layer 2 solution, it is a gateway to a more inclusive and intuitive crypto experience. By prioritizing user experience and leveraging cutting-edge technology, it has the potential to redefine how we interact with blockchain. As the crypto industry evolves, Abstract Chain's commitment to accessibility and innovation makes it a project to watch in 2025 and beyond.

Tokenization of RWAs enables fractional ownership of physical assets on the blockchain. 

Crypto adoption grows as real-world assets become digitized and tradable. 

Blockchain ensures secure, transparent, and efficient management of tokenized assets. 

The tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) has moved from being an emerging concept to becoming a key development in the crypto and financial worlds of 2025. Tokenization refers to the process of converting physical or traditional financial assets—like real estate, gold, stocks, or even artwork—into digital tokens on a blockchain. 

These tokens can then be traded, sold, or held on digital platforms, allowing for faster transactions, more secure records, and access to previously illiquid markets. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, tokenizing real-world assets is increasingly seen as a powerful tool to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized digital economy. 

Over the past year, tokenized assets have seen explosive growth. In early 2025, the total value of tokenized real-world assets on public blockchains rose to nearly $18 billion, a sharp increase from about $10 billion in 2024. This nearly 80% surge highlights the rising trust and adoption of tokenized assets across industries. 

Looking ahead, market forecasts predict that the tokenized assets market could reach as much as $18.9 trillion by 2033. This expected growth is fueled by several key trends: 

Greater participation from banks, asset managers, and governments 

Increasing clarity in regulations related to digital assets 

Advancements in blockchain technology that make tokenization more secure and efficient 

Financial institutions and technology companies are embracing tokenization at a rapid pace. Several new platforms have been developed that allow users to trade tokenized versions of traditional assets. 

For instance, companies are now offering fractional ownership of real estate through digital tokens. This means a person can invest in a high-value property without needing to buy the whole asset, making investment opportunities more accessible. 

In addition to real estate, tokenization is being used for: 

Treasury bonds 

Fine art 

Commodities like gold and oil 

Private equity shares 

Large blockchain foundations are also working to bring billions of dollars' worth of real-world value on-chain. Some aim to handle over $100 billion in tokenized volume by the end of 2025. 

Another notable development is the creation of private blockchain networks supported by global financial firms and tech giants. These networks allow for secure, private, and efficient asset transfers between banks while maintaining compliance with local and international regulations. 

One of the biggest hurdles for the growth of tokenized assets has been regulation. In 2025, however, several countries and financial authorities have started creating clearer rules for digital assets. 

In the United States, regulatory bodies are working on formal guidelines that explain how tokenized assets—especially those considered financial securities—should be managed. The goal is to ensure investor protection while also encouraging innovation in financial markets. 

Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, the financial regulator is introducing a long-term strategy that promotes the use of tokenization in the fund management sector. This includes efforts to support investment firms that want to experiment with digital versions of traditional financial products. 

As more governments begin to provide clearer legal frameworks, tokenization is expected to gain even more momentum. 

One of the main advantages of tokenization is that it makes previously illiquid assets easier to trade. For example, real estate or fine art typically takes months to sell, and high transaction costs are common. Tokenization allows owners to sell small pieces of these assets quickly and with lower fees. 

Tokenized assets allow more people to invest in markets that were once limited to wealthy or institutional investors. Through blockchain-based platforms, individuals can invest in luxury assets, government bonds, or private equity using small amounts of money. 

Blockchain technology reduces the need for middlemen like brokers or custodians. Smart contracts—self-executing digital agreements—help automate settlements and reduce human error. This leads to faster, cheaper, and more reliable transactions. 

Each tokenized asset is recorded on a blockchain, which serves as a secure, unchangeable ledger. Every transaction is trackable, providing greater trust among participants. The transparency of blockchain reduces the chances of fraud or hidden activities. 

While the future of tokenized assets looks promising, several challenges need to be addressed for large-scale adoption. 

Despite progress, regulations around tokenized assets still vary from one country to another. This can create confusion for companies and investors operating across borders. 

Connecting existing financial systems to blockchain platforms requires significant investment in technology and training. Many financial institutions still rely on legacy systems that are not easily compatible with blockchain. 

Many potential users, including retail investors and traditional asset managers, are still unaware of how tokenized assets work. More educational efforts are needed to explain the benefits and risks of participating in tokenized markets. 

 As with any digital technology, tokenized platforms must be protected from hacking and data breaches. Strong cybersecurity measures are essential to safeguard investor funds and personal data. 

Tokenization is on track to become one of the most important advancements in both the crypto and traditional finance industries. As blockchain technology becomes more advanced and widely accepted, the boundaries between physical and digital financial systems are expected to blur. 

Future developments may include: 

Government bonds issued as tokens on public blockchains 

Real estate platforms offering live token trading 

Global stock exchanges are experimenting with blockchain-based settlement systems 

Central banks are using tokenized infrastructure for digital currencies and asset reserves 

The continued partnership between traditional financial institutions and blockchain innovators will be critical. With strong support from both public and private sectors, tokenization is likely to play a major role in building a more open, efficient, and inclusive financial system. 

The tokenization of real-world assets marks a turning point in the evolution of finance. By converting physical assets into digital tokens on blockchain networks, the financial world is moving toward a future that is more liquid, accessible, and efficient. 

Despite challenges related to regulation, technology, and education, the progress seen in 2025 points to a bright future. As institutions, regulators, and developers work together, tokenized assets may soon become a central part of how people own, trade, and invest in the global economy. 

The next big shift in crypto may not come from a new coin or meme token, but from the digitization of real-world value itself.

Ethereum offers steady growth with proven tech and strong institutional backing. 

Ozak AI combines AI and blockchain, promising high upside but with higher risk. 

Choosing between them depends on whether you prefer stability or innovation. 

As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, two names are drawing significant attention: Ethereum (ETH), a seasoned leader in the blockchain space, and Ozak AI (OZAK), an emerging project that blends artificial intelligence with decentralized technology. Each offers distinct advantages, and both are poised to play pivotal roles in the year ahead. 

Currently, Ethereum is trading at $2,634, with a market cap nearly touching $400 billion. It was established in 2015, and the whole atmosphere of supporting smart contracts is indeed the foundation on which most apps and NFTs operate in crypto. 

In 2022, the major change was introduced, switching entirely from proof of work to proof of stake, thus cutting energy consumption by 99-plus percent; it's like moving from an energy-inefficient gas tanker to a full-fledged electric vehicle. 

Since then, the road of improvements has been long. Dencun, an upgrade in 2024, helped accelerate transactions and bring down the costs. Another improvement under the name Pectra is expected to arrive in mid-2025 to smooth the process even further.  Also Read: Ethereum & XRP Face New Challenger: Can Unstaked Take Over? 

Big names in finance are paying attention too. Some analysts at Standard Chartered say Ethereum could hit $14,000 in 2025 if the upgrades go well and more institutions start using it. Others expect a more cautious range, between $4,000 and $6,500, which would still be a strong jump from today's price. 

Ozak AI is still pretty new. There's not much public data on its current price or market value, but it's getting attention because it combines two fast-growing technologies: artificial intelligence and blockchain. 

Ozak AI is thought to make the blockchain smarter using AI methods. Imagine this as the construction of a brain into the system to make decisions faster or even predict certain patterns. If the project succeeds, users will be able to automate more complicated tasks and thus enhance the functioning of applications hosted on the blockchain.

Because it's just starting, price predictions for 2025 are mostly guesses. Still, there's a lot of excitement around anything that merges AI with crypto. If Ozak AI reaches some key tech milestones, it could see rapid growth.

Ethereum is like a well-established company. It is reliable, proven, and always working to improve. Ozak AI is more like a startup with a big idea that still needs to prove it works. 

Ethereum is focusing on scaling up, handling more users, speeding up transactions, and cutting down costs. Ozak AI is trying to push boundaries by adding AI to the mix, which could be game-changing if it works. 

Ethereum already has support from major investors. Spot Ether ETFs, which allow big players to invest in ETH, have been approved and added to their credibility. Ozak AI does not have that kind of backing yet, but might in the future if it gains traction. 

Ethereum offers stability, a solid track record, and steady growth backed by institutional support, ideal for cautious investors. Ozak AI, a bold new project merging AI with blockchain, holds high-reward potential but comes with greater risk. Your choice depends on risk appetite: Ethereum is the safer bet, while Ozak AI offers exciting upside if its technology succeeds.

Uniswap's native token initially broke below its uptrend line after failing to hold momentum above the $6.00 support level. 

The decline followed the formation of an ascending channel earlier in the day, but that structure collapsed under high-volume selling, including a spike of over 1.4 million units as prices briefly touched $6.00. 

However, the breakdown proved temporary. UNI quickly reversed course and climbed back to $6.18, indicating strong dip-buying interest and suggesting the uptrend may still be intact if support near $6.05 continues to hold.

Ethereum (ETH) faced renewed downside pressure in late trading, tumbling below the $2,500 level as selling volume surged and broader risk sentiment weakened. Global trade tensions and renewed U.S. tariff risks have triggered risk-off flows, with digital assets increasingly mirroring traditional markets in their reaction to geopolitical uncertainty.

On-chain data revealed sizable inflows to centralized exchanges — most notably 385,000 ETH to Binance —a dding to speculation that institutional players may be trimming positions. Although ETH has since recovered modestly to trade around $2,506, market observers are closely watching whether buyers can defend this level or if another leg lower is imminent.

Solana (SOL) remains under pressure as macroeconomic headwinds—particularly renewed tariff concerns — rattle investor confidence. 

The token is now hovering around $154.50 after establishing a tight trading range between $152.33 and $158.06, reflecting a 3.76% swing in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model.

Although higher lows had previously suggested resilience, SOL slipped from $156.74 to $154.86 in a single hour, breaking beneath its mid-April uptrend channel.

Derivatives data reflects bearish sentiment: open interest in SOL futures is down 2.47% to $7.19 billion, while long liquidations surged to $30.97 million, indicating pressure on leveraged positions. Short liquidations remain minimal, reinforcing the downside bias.

Still, institutional interest remains evident. Circle's recent $250 million USDC mint on Solana has added liquidity and cemented the chain's stablecoin leadership, with 34% of all stablecoin volume now routed through the network. Additionally, SOL Strategies' $1 billion validator fund signals sustained long-term confidence in the protocol's scalability, even as short-term price action falters.

XRP, used by Ripple to facilitate cross-border transactions, ended May with signs of indecision. Still, activity on the dominant crypto options exchange, Deribit, suggests that bulls aren't ready to back down yet.

The payments-focused cryptocurrency formed a ""doji"" with a long upper shadow in May, a classic sign of indecision in the market, according to charting platform TradingView. 

The long upper wick suggests that bulls pushed prices higher to $2.65, but bears stepped in and rejected those levels, driving prices down to near the level seen at the start of the month.

The appearance of the doji suggests the recovery rally from the early April lows near $1.60 has likely run out of steam. Doji candles appearing after uptrends often prompt technical analysts to call for bull exhaustion and a potential turn lower.

Accordingly, last week, some traders purchased the $ 2.40 strike put option expiring on May 30. A put option offers insurance against price drops.

The overall picture remains bullish, with options open interest concentrated in higher-strike calls in a sign of persistent positive sentiment. Open interest refers to the number of active contracts at a given time. A call option gives the purchaser an asymmetric upside exposure to the underlying asset, in this case, XRP, representing a bullish bet.

""XRP open interest on Deribit is steadily increasing, with the highest concentration of strikes clustered on the upside between $2.60 and $3.0+, reflecting a notably bullish sentiment while the spot price currently trades at $2.16,"" Luuk Strijers, CEO of Deribit, told CoinDesk.

The chart shows that the $4 call option is the most popular, with a notional open interest of $5.39 million. Calls at the $3 and $3.10 strikes have an open interest (OI) of over $5 million each. Notional open interest refers to the dollar value of the number of active contracts.

""XRP option open interest is split across June and September expiries, with monthly notional volumes approximating $65–$70 million, of which over 95% is traded on Deribit,"" Strijers said.

The bullish mood likely stems from XRP's positioning as a cross-border payments solution and mounting expectations of a spot XRP ETF listing in the U.S. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency is gaining traction as a corporate treasury asset.

Ripple, which uses XRP to facilitate cross-border transactions, recently highlighted its potential to address inefficiencies in SWIFT-based cross-border payments. The B2B cross-border payments market is projected to increase to $50 trillion by 2031, up 58% from $31.6 trillion in 2024.

 Czech Justice Minister Pavel Blazek resigned following backlash over his ministry's sale of Bitcoin donated by a convicted criminal. 

Czech Justice Minister Pavel Blazek has stepped down following a scandal over his ministry's sale of nearly $45 million worth of Bitcoin donated by a convicted drug trafficker.

The controversy erupted on May 28 after the ministry posted on X that it had raised close to 1 billion Czech koruna (approximately $45 million) by auctioning off nearly 500 Bitcoin (BTC).

The funds were earmarked for projects such as digitizing the justice system, combating drug use in prisons, and improving housing for prison staff.

However, Czech news outlet Denik N revealed that the cryptocurrency came from Tomas Jirikovsky, a convicted criminal behind Sheep Marketplace, a dark web platform notorious for selling illegal goods.

In March, Jirikovsky's lawyer approached Blazek, offering one-third of the Bitcoin as a donation to the Justice Ministry. Blazek accepted without probing the cryptocurrency's origins.

“I have no way to investigate the matter, and I wasn't interested so many years after the case,” he said at a Thursday press conference, suggesting the donation reflected Jirikovsky's desire to “repent.”

However, public outcry grew over the transaction's lack of due diligence. Opposition leaders labeled it a scandal, and police have now launched an investigation into the Bitcoin's origins.

Jirikovsky was sentenced in 2017 for embezzlement, drug trafficking, and weapons violations. Since being released from prison in 2021, he has been seeking to reclaim 1,500 Bitcoin seized at the time of his arrest.

During his trial, Czech authorities suspected the funds were linked to Nucleus, another dark web marketplace shuttered just after Jirikovsky's arrest. Despite this, he maintained the Bitcoin was acquired legally, which allowed him to retain it after serving his sentence.

Facing mounting pressure and with legislative elections just four months away, Prime Minister Petr Fiala distanced himself from Blazek, a long-time political ally.

Subsequently, Blazek resigned on May 30. “I am not aware of any illegal action. However, I do not wish to damage the reputation of the government or the governing association,” he said in his statement.

On Feb. 6, Czech President Petr Pavel signed a “landmark” cryptocurrency legislation into law, providing Czechia with regulatory clarity on digital assets that are aligned with broader European Union laws. 

The new legislation simplifies crypto tax rules and implements the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation “in a way that supports innovation and development of the entire industry.”

 French prosecutors charged 25 people over a wave of crypto-related kidnappings. However, the masterminds remain at large. 

French authorities have charged 25 individuals, including six minors, over a series of kidnappings and attempted abductions linked to the country's cryptocurrency sector.

The group, aged between 16 and 23, faces charges connected to multiple plots targeting prominent crypto figures and their families, Le Monde reported, citing an announcement from the Paris public prosecutor's office on May 31.

Per the report, eighteen suspects are now in pre-trial detention, three have requested a deferred hearing, and four remain under judicial supervision.

The investigation centers on a failed May 13 abduction attempt in Paris' 11th arrondissement. The targets were the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium.

Authorities say this was not the first attempt — a similar failed plot was staged the previous day. Days later, police also foiled another operation near Nantes.

Footage of the May 13 incident, which circulated widely on social media, showed four masked attackers assaulting Noizat's daughter, her husband, and their child. The victims suffered minor injuries and were treated in hospital.

The suspects reportedly come from a wide range of backgrounds, including individuals born in the Paris region, Châtellerault, Senegal, Angola, and Russia.

Many of them were described by defense lawyers as “young profiles lured by money and caught in a situation beyond their control.”

The Paris case is part of a broader rise in crypto-related kidnappings across France this year. High-profile incidents include the January abduction of Ledger co-founder David Balland and his partner, as well as the May 1 kidnapping of the father of a crypto millionaire — an incident investigators say is linked to the current wave of attacks.

So far, police have arrested lower-level operatives and logistics coordinators, but the masterminds behind these plots remain unidentified.

The growing threat has drawn national attention. France's Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau met with crypto industry professionals in mid-May to discuss protective measures. The ministry later announced enhanced cooperation between law enforcement and crypto firms, including home security checks conducted by police and gendarmerie officers.

As reported, insurers are racing to develop new protections aimed at a growing physical threat: kidnapping for crypto.

At least three firms specializing in crypto insurance and security are now preparing tailored kidnap and ransom (K&R) policies for digital asset investors, according to a recent report from NBC News.

Likewise, executives and investors in the crypto industry are increasingly seeking personal security services. On May 18, private firm Infinite Risks International reported a rise in requests for bodyguards and protection contracts from high-profile figures in the crypto space.

 An appearance from Michael Saylor on The Joe Rogan Experience would “shatter the internet,” according to a Bitcoiner. 

Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor has publicly expressed interest in discussing Bitcoin with podcaster Joe Rogan on the world's most-listened-to podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience (JRE).

“Hey @joerogan, let's talk about Bitcoin,” Saylor said in a May 31 X post in response to a Joe Rogan fan account asking, “Who's one guest you'd love to see Joe Rogan interview that he hasn't had on yet?”

Saylor's post prompted speculation within the Bitcoin (BTC) community. Popular Bitcoiner, The Bitcoin Therapist, said, “This interview will shatter the internet.”

Crypto analyst Kook told their 164,200 X followers that “Saylor is going to Bitcoin pill Joe Rogan.” Meanwhile, crypto commentator Brandon MacDougal said, “For the first time ever, I'll be watching a Joe Rogan podcast if Saylor is there.” 

Joe Rogan, host of the JRE, has frequently discussed crypto and Bitcoin on his podcast and has made several pro-Bitcoin comments over the years. In an October 2023 episode of the JRE with OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman, Rogan said that Bitcoin fascinates him the most of all cryptocurrencies.

“The real fascinating crypto is Bitcoin. That's the one that I think has the most likely possibility of becoming a universal viable currency. It's limited in the amount that it can be,” Rogan said.

“I love the fact that it's been implemented,” he added.

Although Rogan has yet to respond to Saylor's public proposal, featuring a guest from the Bitcoin industry wouldn't be unfamiliar territory. Even in Bitcoin's early days, Rogan gave the topic airtime on his podcast.

Between 2014 and 2016, Bitcoin entrepreneur Andreas Antonopoulos made several appearances on Rogan's podcast when Bitcoin was still trading below $1,000.

Saylor's firm Strategy, holds 580,250 Bitcoin, worth approximately $60.47 billion at the time of publication, according to Saylor Tracker. 

Saylor recently speculated why Bitcoin's price is not yet $150,000. He said holders without a long-term outlook have been selling off while a new cohort of investors are beginning to enter the market.

“I think we're going through a rotation right now,” Saylor said on the Coin Stories podcast with Natalie Brunell on May 9.

In my 15 years of reviewing tech, this pellet-firing, story-telling, pretend-urinating robot attack dog is easily the strangest thing I've ever tested.

Arriving in a slightly battered box following a series of questionable decisions on Temu, I'm immediately drawn to the words “FIRE BULLETS PET” emblazoned on the box. And there, resting behind the protective plastic window with all the innocence of a newborn lamb, lies the plastic destroyer of worlds that my four-and-a-half-year-old immediately (and inexplicably), names Clippy.

Clippy is a robot dog. Of sorts. And he (my son assures me that it's a he), is clearly influenced by the remarkable, and somewhat terrifying, robotic canine creations of Boston Dynamics—a renowned company that's leading the robot revolution.

Naturally, given the $50 price tag (a little less if you don't want the—ahem—spinal-mounted pellet gun), I'm not expecting Clippy to perform miracles. But, given my track record, being served an Instagram ad promising all manner of animatronic wizardry for less than the cost of a round of drinks in a London bar, the opportunity was too tempting to pass up.

What happened, almost inevitably, was a lesson in not taking the social media ads you are served at face value. But, actually? It was also a lot of ridiculous fun.

After freeing Clippy from his box, I'm immediately met with some of the lightest, cheapest, glossiest plastic I've ever come across.

I have nothing against plastic. Remember the Nokia Lumia 920? Its polycarbonate body remains one of my favourite phone designs to this day. Sturdy, solid, and light, it was everything an object clad in plastic should be. Clippy and his accompanying remote, on the other hand, provide a somewhat Christmas cracker toy-like level of confidence in their durability.

Clippy's main body, filled with the bulk of the electronics, is weighty enough, but his four spindly legs do not give the impression that they're up to the task of supporting anything. Except, of course, that I am in ownership of the turret-toting model, which promises to lay waste to enemies by bombarding them with water-absorbent pellets (more on that in a bit).

Overall, the entire ensemble resembles an elongated CCTV camera on legs, with a turret resting on top—suitably menacing, and genuinely not far off Boston Dynamic's bona fide offering, in looks, at least.

Elsewhere, I can only assume that the controller has been pumped full of helium, such is its hollow, airy lightness. Heavily inspired by the shape of an Xbox controller, I particularly love the fact that its bumper buttons and triggers are simply formed from one immobile piece of moulded plastic. There's something quite beautiful in their utter uselessness that I enjoy very much.

As for the business end, it's an ADHD nightmare. Littered with a chaotic array of buttons in seemingly no logical order, I give credit to the designers for creating a controller that laughs in the face of muscle memory.

Initial attempts at turning Clippy on are unsuccessful. The on/off switch does nothing, and the charging light remains dead when the USB-C cable is plugged in. There are no instructions.

Opening the battery compartment reveals the culprit—the battery is disconnected. Was this to avoid it draining in transit, or to reduce the risk of spontaneous combustion? Either way, it's plugged back in. Clippy lives.

And wow, he's loud. The built-in speakers are beyond shrill. I desperately look through the carnage of controller buttons, hoping to find a volume or mute option. There isn't one.

Naturally, I press “urinate” first. Clippy's hind leg raises. That, I expected. What I didn't expect, was cheerful whistling, and the sound of water tinkling into a toilet bowl.

I look, and happen upon the “handstand” button. This, I feel, will be an impressive test of his dexterity. A handstand maneuver will surely call upon multiple gyroscopes and accelerometers, combining and crunching data from numerous sensors in real time to ensure that Clippy's body remains perfectly poised in balance.

I press the button, and Clippy immediately—and rather violently—faceplants. The force of this manoeuvre takes me off guard, and the impact is loud. I am worried.

A moment passes, his rear legs rise, and they begin to twitch. I presume this apparent seizure is meant to represent elegant scissor kicks. It's reminiscent of how ants communicate with their antennae, a form of silent communication. “Don't blame me bro, did you really expect anything else?” I can almost hear him plead. But, somehow, Clippy does return to his feet and appears unscathed, ready for more. Me? I'm not so sure.

As I mentioned, the controller has many, many buttons—no less than 17 functions in fact—and I'm not going to bore you with overly gratuitous descriptions for each one. Instead, here's a quick rundown of the main buttons, to give you a general idea of some of Clippy's talents:

Kung fu: Absolutely zero semblance of any martial art moves, or even a cheeky backflip. Instead (and completely inexplicably), some form of poolside, Lost Frequencies-esque lounge music blasts out. Clippy “dances.”

Swimming/Dance: I recently saw Usher perform live. Both of these buttons involve vigorous floor-humping that surpass even his most sexually charged efforts. A truly impressive feat. Oh, and a side note for any optimists out there, Clippy is not waterproof. Do not, I repeat do not, introduce him to water.

Push-up: Clippy blasts out push-ups while playing the guitar riff from“Eye of the Tiger.” I have no further notes.

Story: Buckle up, pressing this button results in very loud, tinny classical music blaring out over a spoken story. The narrator has an Eric Cartman-like twang to their voice, and the speaker quality means I can barely make out what's being said. The only plot I manage to grasp is about an old woman and an ageing cat. The woman scolds the cat for not being able to catch mice, as it has no teeth. The cat bestows a moral about respecting our elders for the contributions they used to make in their youth. The next story, I think, involves a pigeon. It may be injured.

Despite this clearly incredible skillset, it is interesting that Clippy's ability to be controlled or steered via the remote is … flawed. Going forward is generally fine, and there are left and right buttons which cause him to turn very slowly, often toppling over in the process. There is no reverse, so I constantly have to pick him up before he collides with walls and furniture (no collision detection cameras appear to be present). He can, at least, shake hands (or ""hadn-shake"" on the remote) like any well-trained pup.

It would also be remiss not to mention that there is an official app which lets you control your robot dog via Bluetooth. Once you figure out how to change the language to English, it's easy enough to navigate, and there are even some bonus features they couldn't squeeze onto the remote. For example, you can select different “foods” for him to eat, ranging from a bone to “Nuclear Energy Source”—all of which result in various forms of eating animations.

There's also a voice command mode, which doesn't seem to work. Despite offering all the permissions asked for (including, against my better judgement, access to my phone and files), voice commands seem to fall on deaf ears. There's also a program mode which lets you set up custom actions, though all my attempts seem to end up in more faceplants.

According to the product page, Clippy's back-mounted turret “can be loaded with water bombs to launch for fun.” The image accompanying this description is impressive. Two blue projectiles appear to blast forth from the cannon. I immediately picture an autonomous robotic guard dog patrolling the house, scanning for threats, and dispensing justice as appropriate.

The reality is a tiny packet of minuscule blue balls, about a millimetre in diameter. Once soaked in water for a few hours, they plump up, and you can load them into the turret, before firing away.

The test takes place in the makeshift bathtub firing range. I drop a few of the blue gel-like pellets into what is presumably the correct slot in the turret (I once again remind you of the lack of any instructions), and tell my son to stand back, in case the velocity rebounds anything towards our eyes.

I look down at the controller, and finally press the “attack” button. Clippy walks forward a few steps, crouches to steady his aim, and two pellets dribble out with all the urgency of a clogged ketchup bottle.

This method is repeated about ten times, with mixed results. At best, a pellet is fired relatively straight, but still not without any meaningful force—certainly not enough to even penetrate a wet square of toilet paper. We tried. After the ammo is spent, we decide that it's time to watch him faceplant again.

But should you buy this thing, as (relatively) cheap as it is? I think the answer is obvious. But while it's all too easy to slate, playing around with Clippy has taken me back to my childhood, where toys like this were life.

Clippy, as terrible as he is, has entertained my son daily, for the week that we've spent testing him. He brought him into our bedroom every morning, waking me up with a shrill, unintelligible story before blasting out a guitar riff with an enthusiasm that is already wearing thin.

It won't be long, of course, before Clippy gathers dust in some corner, replaced by the Next Thing. I imagine he'll end up in a thrift store, awaiting a new family to dazzle and confuse in equal measure. I just hope, whoever they are, that they like Survivor.

For more than 1.8 billion people in the world, there is one service that rules them all: Gmail. A primary conduit for communication, the email service that Google launched in 2004 is now as prevalent as the iPhone, a Windows laptop, and the deep blue sky.

I created my first Gmail account way back in 2005, and my current account has existed since 2012. My life revolves around email, but sometimes those revolutions can run a bit slow. Hampered by too many emails, I find myself clicking and waiting for an email to open and waiting again to see the attached files.

I knew I had to solve the problem. Google doesn't provide a lot of guidance for speeding up one's Gmail inbox, likely because the company doesn't want to admit it runs slow at times. I decided to “learn by doing” and discovered several tips and tricks that helped speed up the service.

My Gmail is severely cluttered and choking on too many emails and hundreds of labels. I needed to do major surgery. I started by disabling a few extensions and add-ons for Gmail, and then deleting a bunch of recent emails, but those actions made a negligible impact.

My theory—which I asked Google about, and which the company did not directly answer—is that Gmail has to spend extra time loading emails and running searches when it has to keep track of years and years worth of very large files. I never delete any emails, mostly because I can search for old tax forms, dig up contracts and even find old photos. It's getting ridiculous, though: I have 652,000 emails that use 162 gigabytes of storage. It was time to do something about it.

To find emails with the largest attachments, use Gmail's built-in search operators. In Gmail's search box, start by typing “in:anywhere larger:40M” and review the results. This will surface emails in any of your subfolders with attachments totalling more than 40 megabytes. In my case, I only found three emails with a massive attachment, so I tried “in:anywhere larger:25M” and then got nine emails with excessively large files. It was easy to glance through them and determine if they were worth keeping. (If you're feeling adventurous, you can also use the new Gemini AI for Gmail bot to search for emails with large attachments.)

Once you hit delete, make sure you empty the trash as well, otherwise those emails—and their large files—will stick around. On the left side, click Trash, then More, then Empty trash now.

One of Gmail's standout features is the ability to apply labels to emails to help you sort the contents of a busy inbox. But labels are just one more thing for Gmail to keep track of, and old labels that don't matter to you anymore are just clogging the pipes. There's no easy way to bulk delete labels, so you have to manually remove them. To do that, click Manage Labels in Gmail's left-hand menu bar. Scroll down to your list of labels, then select Remove label for all your unused labels. I removed 350 labels! The emails are still there, but I've shed the weight of those obsolete sorting systems I no longer need.

I also deleted very old emails. To find your oldest emails, click All mail on the left, then on the upper right click the displayed pages to see Oldest instead of Newest. Select all emails on the screen and delete them as needed, clicking through each page of emails to see more. You can also use the “older_than” search operator; type “older_than:1y” in the search bar to see all emails more than one year old. Try “older_than:2y” and so on. (The Gemini bot might also be able to help find older emails here; give it a shot if you prefer chat-style searching.)

For me, after deleting large files and labels, and deleting thousands of old emails, Gmail ran noticeably faster.

One other fix has to do with how many files you view in your inbox. It's a basic rule of computing, especially in web-based apps: showing less information on the screen means the app doesn't need to work as hard. Go to Settings, then See all settings. Look for the pop-up next to Maximum page size and select a lower number, say 25. I found this setting did help even in an older, clunky Gmail account from years ago.

I wanted to do more, and I was tempted to clear my browser cache, which is a catch-all solution for speeding up web performance. For every site you visit, files and settings are stored locally, and as those things build up over time, they can slow down your browser. There's a downside to clearing the cache, though: you'll lose all your saved sessions and you'll have to log back into all your websites, not just Gmail. Instead, it's better to clear the cache just for Gmail.

This might sound onerous, but it's easier than it sounds: To clear the cache for one site, first go to that site (in our case, Gmail.com). Then, in Chrome, press F12 (or go to View > Developer > Developer tools) to bring up the developer tools. Click on the Application tab at the top, and click Clear site data. This really sped things up for me, even more than deleting large files and labels. I was cooking with gas, but felt like things could still be faster.

This is a more dramatic solution, but it's amazing how well it works. A few years ago, I switched Gmail addresses because my old account was too clogged. I started over with a new Gmail inbox that was sprightly and trim. It felt like buying a brand new car. Of course, the downside is that you have to let everyone know about your new email address. That's easier than you think.

After creating the new Gmail address, go back to your old one. In Gmail, go to Settings and click See all settings, then scroll down to the Vacation responder. You're taking a permanent vacation from your clogged email, so set the date range to run all year long. Type a message about how you're changing emails, and include the new email address.

You can also forward all incoming messages to the new inbox. Click the Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab at the top, and type in a new forwarding email. Gmail might prompt you for verification from another device to confirm it's really you. Then, click Proceed. Gmail will also send a confirmation email from the new email address to your old one. In your old account, click that confirmation link.

You're all set! Everyone will be notified when they email your old account, and you'll receive incoming emails in your new account.

Whether you follow these tips to liven up an older Gmail account or start over with a new one, the good news is that you'll notice a speed-up either way. Even my old Gmail account is now faster than ever.

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

When she was 10 years old, Rose Yu got a birthday present that would change her life—and, potentially, the way we study physics. Her uncle got her a computer. That was a rare commodity in China 25 years ago, and the gift did not go unused. At first, Yu mainly played computer games, but in middle school she won an award for web design. It was the first of many computer-related honors.

Yu went on to major in computer science at Zhejiang University, where she won a prize for innovative research. For her graduate studies, she chose the University of Southern California (USC), partly because the same uncle—who was the only person she knew in the United States—was then working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in nearby Pasadena. Yu earned her doctorate in 2017 with an award for best dissertation. Her most recent honor came in January, when President Joe Biden, in his last week in office, gave her a Presidential Early Career Award.

Yu, now an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), is a leader in a field known as “physics-guided deep learning,” having spent years incorporating our knowledge of physics into artificial neural networks. The work has not only introduced novel techniques for building and training these systems, but it's also allowed her to make progress on several real-world applications. She has drawn on principles of fluid dynamics to improve traffic predictions, sped up simulations of turbulence to enhance our understanding of hurricanes, and devised tools that helped predict the spread of Covid-19.

This work has brought Yu closer to her grand dream—deploying a suite of digital lab assistants that she calls AI Scientist. She now envisions what she calls a “partnership” between human researchers and AI tools, fully based on the tenets of physics and thus capable of yielding new scientific insights. Combining inputs from a team of such assistants, in her opinion, may be the best way to boost the discovery process.

Quanta spoke with Yu about turbulence in its many guises, how to get more out of AI, and how it might get us out of urban gridlock. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Yu on the UCSD campus, where she is an associate professor.

When did you first try to combine physics with deep learning?

Rose Yu: It started with traffic. I was a grad student at USC, and the campus is right near the intersection of I-10 and I-110. To get anywhere, you have to go through a lot of traffic, which can be very annoying. In 2016, I began to wonder whether I could do anything about this.

Deep learning—which uses multilayered neural networks to elicit patterns from data—was getting really hot back then. There was already a lot of excitement about applications in image classification, but images are just static things. I wondered whether deep learning could help with problems where things are constantly changing. I wasn't the first person to consider this, but my colleagues and I did find a novel way of framing the problem.

What was your new approach?

First, we thought of traffic in terms of the physical process of diffusion. In our model, the flow of traffic over a network of roads is analogous to the flow of fluids over a surface—motions that are governed by the laws of fluid dynamics. But our main innovation was to think of traffic as a graph, from the mathematical field of graph theory. Sensors, which monitor traffic on highways and other roads, serve as the nodes of this graph. And the edges of the graph represent the roads (and distances) between those sensors.

Yu's interest in computers began with a gift for her 10th birthday.

A graph provides a snapshot of the entire road network at a given time, telling you the average velocity of cars at every point on the graph. When you put together a series of these snapshots, spaced every five minutes apart, you get a good picture of how traffic is evolving. From there, you can try to predict what will happen in the future.

The big challenge in deep learning is that you need a lot of data to train the neural network. Fortunately, one of my advisers, Cyrus Shahabi, had worked for many years on the problem of traffic forecasting, and he'd accumulated a vast amount of LA traffic data that I had access to.

So how good were your predictions?

Prior to our work, people could only make traffic forecasts that were reliable for about 15 minutes. Our forecasts were valid for one hour—a big improvement. Our code was deployed by Google Maps in 2018. A bit later, Google invited me to become a visiting researcher.

That's about when you began working on climate modeling, right?

Yes, that started in 2018, when I gave a talk at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Afterward, I spoke with scientists there, and we looked for a problem that would be a good testbed for physics-guided deep learning. We settled on predicting the evolution of turbulent flow, which is a key factor in climate models, as well as an area of major uncertainty.

Familiar examples of turbulence are the swirling patterns you see after pouring milk into a cup of coffee and giving it a stir. In the oceans, swirls like this can span thousands of miles. Predictions of turbulent behavior that are based on solving the Navier-Stokes equation, which describes the flow of fluids, are considered the gold standard in this field. But the required calculations are very slow, which is why we don't have good models for predicting hurricanes and tropical cyclones.

The heavy congestion of Los Angeles first inspired Yu to model highway traffic as the flow of fluids.

And deep learning can help?

The basic idea is that deep neural networks that are trained on our best numerical simulations can learn to imitate—or as we say, “emulate”—those simulations. They do that by recognizing properties and patterns buried within the data. They don't have to go through time-consuming, brute-force calculations to find approximate solutions. Our models sped up predictions by a factor of 20 in two-dimensional settings and by a factor of 1,000 in three-dimensional settings. Something like our turbulence prediction module might someday be inserted into bigger climate models that can do better at predicting things like hurricanes.

Where else does turbulence show up?

It's pretty much everywhere. Turbulence in blood flow, for instance, can lead to strokes or heart attacks. And when I was a postdoc at Caltech, I coauthored a paper that looked into stabilizing drones. Propellor-generated airflows interact with the ground to create turbulence. That, in turn, can cause the drone to wobble. We used a neural network to model the turbulence, and that led to better control of drones during takeoffs and landings.

I'm currently working with scientists at UCSD and General Atomics on fusion power. One of the keys to success is learning how to control the plasma, which is a hot, ionized phase of matter. At temperatures of about 100 million degrees, different kinds of turbulence arise within the plasma, and physics-based numerical models that characterize that behavior are very slow. We're developing a deep learning model that should be able to predict the plasma's behavior in a split second, but this is still a work in progress.

Yu and doctoral student Jianke Yang in her office at UCSD.

Where did your AI Scientist idea come from?

In the past couple of years, my group has developed AI algorithms that can automatically discover symmetry principles from data. For example, our algorithm identified the Lorentz symmetry, which has to do with the constancy of the speed of light. Our algorithm also identified rotational symmetry—the fact, for example, that a sphere doesn't look any different regardless of how you rotate it—which is something it was not specifically trained to know about. While these are well-known properties, our tools also have the capability to discover new symmetries presently unknown to physics, which would constitute a huge breakthrough.

It then occurred to me that if our tools can discover symmetries from raw data, why don't we try to generalize this? These tools could also generate research ideas or new hypotheses in science. That was the genesis of AI Scientist.

What exactly is AI Scientist—just a fancy kind of neural net?

It's not a single neural network, but rather an ensemble of computer programs that can help scientists make new discoveries. My group has already developed algorithms that can help with individual tasks, such as weather forecasting, identifying the drivers of global temperature rise, or trying to discover causal relationships like the effects of vaccination policies on disease transmission.

We're now building a broader “foundation” model that's versatile enough to handle multiple tasks. Scientists gather data from all types of instruments, and we want our model to include a variety of data types—numbers, text, images, and videos. We have an early prototype, but we want to make our model more comprehensive, more intelligent and better trained before we release it. That could happen within a couple of years.

What do you imagine it could do?

AI can assist in practically every step of the scientific discovery process. When I say “AI Scientist,” I really mean an AI scientific assistant. The literature survey stage in an experiment, for example, typically requires a massive data-gathering and organization effort. But now, a large language model can read and summarize thousands of books during a single lunch break. What AI is not good at is judging scientific validity. In this case, it can't compete with an experienced researcher. While AI could help with hypothesis generation, the design of experiments and data analysis, it still cannot carry out sophisticated experiments.

How far would you like to see the concept go?

As I picture it, an AI Scientist could relieve researchers of some of the drudgery while letting people handle the creative aspects of science. That's something we're particularly good at. Rest assured, the goal is not to replace human scientists. I don't envision—nor would I ever want to see—a machine substituting for, or interfering with, human creativity.

Unionized quality assurance testers at video game holding company ZeniMax announced Friday that they have reached a tentative contract agreement with Microsoft, which acquired ZeniMax in 2021.

This represents Microsoft's first union contract in the United States. It's been a little over two years since approximately 300 QA testers announced that they were unionizing through the Communications Workers of America, and they said they've been negotiating with Microsoft ever since.

Bloomberg reports that the contract terms include an across-the-board, 13.5% pay raise on July 1. The contract also incorporates an already-announced agreement around the use of AI. Union members are scheduled to vote on ratifying the contract on June 20.

In a statement, QA tester and union bargaining committee member Page Branson called this “a monumental victory for all current video game workers and for those that come after.”

While ZeniMax's QA workers were the first to unionize at Microsoft, other teams have followed suit, and the CWA said it now counts more than 2,000 Microsoft video game workers as members.

I was trying to figure out the difference between the Stockfish approach (minimax, alpha-beta pruning) versus Alpha Zero / Leela Chess Zero (MCTS). My very crude understanding is that stockfish has a very light & fast neural net and goes for a very thorough search. Meanwhile, in MCTS (which I don't really understand at this point), you eval the neural net, sample some paths based on the neural net (similar to minimax), and then pick the path you sampled the most. There's also the training vs eval aspect to it. Would love a better explanation.

You use the followup moves as places to search down. It's a multi-armed bandit problem choosing which move(s) to explore down, but for simplicity in explanation you can just say: maybe just search the top few, vaguely in proportion to how interesting they are (the number the net gave you, updated if you find any surprises).To search down further, you just play that move and then ask the network for the winrate (and followup moves) again. If there's any surprises, you can update upwards to say ""hey this is better than expected!"" or whatever.The key thing for training this network: spending computation from an existing network gives ycu better training data to train that same network. So you can start from scratch and use reinforcement learning to improve it without bound.

Perhaps a bit flippantly, you can think of MCTS as “vibe search”—but more accurately it's a sampling-based search. The basic theory is that we can summarize the information we've obtained to estimate our belief in the “goodness” of every possible move and (crucially) our confidence in that belief. Then we allocate search time to prioritize the branches that we are most certain are good.In this way MCTS iteratively constructs an explicit search tree for the game with associated statistics that is used to guide decisions during play. The neural network does a “vibe check” on each new position in the tree for the initial estimate of “goodness” and then the search process refines that estimate. (Ask the NN to guess at the current position; then play a bunch of simulations to make sure it doesn't lead to obvious blunders.)

Of course, beating Stockfish is almost certainly not the goal for this project, looks more like a project to get familiar with MLX.

For students and those who live on a small budget, shelling out $1,000 (or even $2,000) for a MacBook is an out-of-reach dream. Fortunately, this year's market offers a great alternative without having you compromise on performance or features: The Lenovo Ideapad, which was released this year, is currently available on Amazon for a price so cheap it's not thought to be true.

For an insane 73% discount, the 15-inch portable touchscreen computer (16GB RAM, 512GB storage) is on sale for $519, down from its regular price of $1,899. This isn't a sale, it's a clearance and Amazon seems to be clearing out its stock with a deal that makes this Windows 11 Pro laptop one of the best deals going.

See at Amazon

The Lenovo Ideapad in question is a touchscreen 15.6-inch machine, so it's perfect for work and play. Its Full HD (1920×1080) IPS display offers an anti-glare, clear view at 300 nits brightness which makes it easy to see comfortably in a bright room or outdoors. The inclusion of a responsive touch screen is the icing on the cake and makes easy navigation and instant availability of apps and features possible.

Under the hood, this laptop is powered by a 12th-generation Intel Core i5-1235U processor with 10 cores (2 performance and 8 efficiency) and 12 threads which has up to 4.4GHz available on the performance cores and 3.3GHz on the efficiency cores. With the setup, this 2025 Ideapad can easily handle demanding tasks such as multitasking with many browser windows open or using creative tools or even light gaming.

Memory and storage are two areas where this Ideapad is great, especially for its price point. With 16GB of DDR4 RAM, you'll enjoy smooth performance whether you're editing documents, streaming videos, or switching between applications. The 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD provides ample space for all your files, while also ensuring fast boot times and quick access to your data. There is also a useful selection of ports: a USB 2.0, a USB 3.2 Gen 1, a USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 (data transfer), an HDMI 1.4b port, a headphone/microphone combo port, a card reader, and a charging connector.

Lenovo Ideapad comes with Windows 11 Professional in S mode which gives a safe and optimized experience right from the box. You can turn off the S mode if you require access to additional apps beyond the Microsoft Store.

With Amazon's current promotion, you're getting a laptop that would normally cost nearly four times as much: make sure you get yours before it runs out of stock!

In the hair industry, not many companies get the respect Dyson has. Dyson is known for their vacuum expensive vacuum cleaners but they have also changed the hair dryer industry by creating salon-quality styling from home. Their latest creation, the Dyson Supersonic hair dryer, is the perfect example of their innovation.

Amazon currently has a record low price for the Supersonic Nural hair dryer that you do not want to miss, and it's probably making no profit on this device. This model usually retails for $499, but you can currently buy it for $399: That' a rare 20% discount! Significant discounts do not normally happen on Dyson products, so when it does happen, you have to jump on it!

See at Amazon

While traditional hair dryers use heavy bulky motors that are loud and clunky, the Supersonic model uses Dyson's unique digital motor that is tiny, very powerful, and is very quiet. The motor is in the handle instead of the head, which makes the hair dryer more balanced and controlled. You will have a hair dryer that feels light, is ergonomically designed to fit comfortably in your hand and will not drain you during long periods of use.

There is more: it even has intelligent heat control when using the hair dryer. It has a built-in sensor that measures air temperature more than 40 times a second and it can help prevent heat damage and helps retain your hair's natural shine. The hair dryer features Dyson's Air Multiplier technology which generates a high-speed jet of air that dries hair in less time—and less frizz—while also smoothing strands to ensure you get that professional styling every time.

On top of that, the Supersonic dryer provides magnetic styling attachments from gentle air (for relaxed or tender scalps), to styling concentrator (to focus on specific areas), to a diffuser (for curly hairs). Each attachment is easy to trade out and is designed for both usability and efficiency. The Supersonic is also made to keep the user comfortable: Thanks to the engineering of the sound profile, you can dry and style your hair at any time of the day and not disturb anyone else!

Dyson hair dryers are utilized by some of the best salons in the world and that speak for itself. Bringing that kind of luxury and performance into your home is a huge advantage, and because it is only $379 right now, you should definitely not miss it.

If you've recently searched for the Samsung Galaxy S25+ 512GB on Amazon, you might have come across something peculiar: the price is not visible. Rather it states “price hidden” until you put it in your cart. This is because of an agreement with Samsung: The manufacturer is wanting to keep price drops like this a secret – especially as it was released just a few months ago.

On Amazon, the Galaxy S25+ 512GB is on sale at its lowest point to date for a limited time only: The 512GB model can be purchased for $869 which is 22% off the original list price of $1119. It's obviously also a lot cheaper than if you get it from the official Samsung store. Make sure you grab yours before it runs out of stock!

See at Amazon

Launched at the start of 2025, the Galaxy S25+ is a more powerful phone than the regular S25 with extra features to match. Both phones have the same basics: unlocked Android, smart AI cameras, and Samsung's latest ProScaler display. But the S25+ adds more upgrades, which makes the higher price so much worthwhile. On top of that, with the current discount, le S25+ is more affordable than the standard S25.

If you're looking for differences, the Galaxy S25 has a smaller 6.2-inch FHD+ display and starts with 128GB or 256GB of storage while the S25+ offers a larger 6.7-inch QHD+ screen and storage options of 256GB or 512GB (which is the one on sale right now). The S25+ also benefits from a higher pixel density, which makes images and text appear sharper.

Beyond display and storage, the Galaxy S25+ stands out with a bigger battery (4,900mAh compared to the S25's 4,000mAh) for longer battery life for heavy users. The S25+ also supports ultra-wideband connectivity which is not available on the standard S25 and enables features like precise device tracking and secure digital car keys.

The best part of this Amazon deal is that the Galaxy S25+ 512GB now costs less than many standard S25 models, thanks to Amazon's limited-time sale. It's hard to find a better price for a top phone with all the newest features. The S25+ is unlocked, so you can use it with any carrier, and it comes with a one-year warranty for extra peace of mind.

Just keep in mind that you will need to add it to your cart to see the real price: Samsung is not allowing Amazon to disclose the full discount of the price in public.

The Straw Hat crew will only continue to grow as Netflix sets sail on One Piece‘s second season, and now we've finally got our first glimpse at one of the most important additions of all: the arrival of the diminutive crew doctor, Tony Tony Chopper.

During today's Tudum livestream event, One Piece stars Iñaki Godoy, Mackenyu, Emily Rudd, Jacob Romero, and Taz Skylar took to the stage to reveal a special sneak peek at the upcoming season, which included the first look at the live-action series' spin on Chopper. Check it out below!

Chopper will be played by Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3‘s Mikaela Hoover (she appeared there as Rocket Raccoon's rabbit friend Floor, and will continue her professional relationship with James Gunn in Superman next month, where she'll play media personality Cat Grant), who will provide both voicework and facial motion capture for the character. Introduced early on in One Piece after the events of the manga's Drum Island arc, Chopper is an aspiring medic who wants to travel the world and expand his knowledge as a doctor. Oh, and he happens to be a reindeer who ate a devil fruit that turned him into a human-reindeer hybrid, which facilitated the whole interest in a career in medicine in the first place.

Netflix is still staying mum about just when we'll be able to see One Piece‘s return, beyond the fact that it's coming next year, but Hoover is joining a veritable host of new faces that'll appear in season two, including the likes of Katey Sagal, Joe Manganiello, David Dastmalchian, Clive Russell, James Hiroyuki Lio, and more.

We'll bring you more on Netflix's plans for One Piece as and when we learn them.

New research suggests that heightened solar activity shortens the lifespans of SpaceX's Starlink satellites, and may send them careening back to Earth at greater velocities. Perhaps unintuitively, this could increase the risk of satellite debris making landfall. 

This preprint study, which has yet to undergo peer review, adds to a wealth of evidence showing that solar storms wreak havoc on Elon Musk's Starlinks. Over the last several years, the frequency and intensity of these storms have increased as the Sun approaches solar maximum—the peak in its 11-year cycle. At the same time, the number of satellites orbiting Earth has skyrocketed, largely due to the rise of private megaconstellations like Starlink. 

Solar Maximum Is Officially Here: Brace for More Stormy Space Weather and Epic Auroras

A team of researchers led by Denny Oliveira from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center tracked reentries of Starlink satellites between 2020 and 2024. This period coincided with the rising phase of the current solar cycle, when solar activity ramps up ahead of the solar maximum, which occurred in October 2024.

Over the course of those five years, 523 Starlink satellites reentered Earth's atmosphere. Oliveira and his colleagues analyzed the orbits of these satellites using a statistical technique that identifies patterns in how their rates of orbital decay and reentry change during periods of high solar activity.

The researchers found that geomagnetic activity—disturbances in the upper atmosphere triggered by solar eruptions—causes Starlinks to reenter Earth's atmosphere sooner than expected. These satellites are designed to remain in orbit for roughly five years. But during bouts of severe geomagnetic storms, their lifespans may be reduced by 10 to 12 days, Oliveira told Gizmodo. 

He and his colleagues believe this happens because geomagnetic activity heats the atmosphere and causes it to expand. This increases drag on satellites, shortening their lifespans and causing them to lose altitude more quickly as they interact with the upper atmosphere. What's more, atmospheric drag may increase the chances of satellite-on-satellite collisions, as the orbital models that guide collision avoidance measures don't fully account for the effects of geomagnetic activity. The team's findings are currently available on the preprint server arXiv.  

A difference of 10 to 12 days may not sound like a big deal, but it could make it nearly impossible for SpaceX to ensure that Starlink satellites return to Earth via controlled reentry, Oliveira explained. What's more, his analysis shows that increased drag causes satellites to reenter at higher velocities, which he believes could raise the chances of debris reaching the ground.

This may seem counterintuitive, since increasing the velocity of an object during reentry generally increases the likelihood of total disintegration. But Oliveira posits that Starlinks falling at greater speeds may have a better chance of surviving reentry due to reduced atmospheric interaction. Further research will need to confirm this hypothesis, as the study did not directly assess debris risks.

Starlinks are designed to fully burn up during reentry, but that doesn't always happen. In 2024, a 5.5-pound (2.5-kilogram) chunk of Starlink debris made landfall on a farm in Saskatchewan, New Scientist reported. In February of this year, SpaceX said it is possible for Starlink debris fragments to fall back to Earth, but claimed that this poses “no risk to humans on the ground, at sea, or in the air.”

There are now more than 7,500 Starlinks in orbit, according to Harvard University astronomer Jonathan McDowell, who tracks the constellation. Eventually, SpaceX hopes to quintuple the size of this fleet, with a goal of launching 42,000 Starlinks in total, according to Space.com. This is in addition to the thousands of other satellites currently orbiting Earth. 

“[This is] the first time ever in history that we have so many satellites in orbit at the same time,” Oliveira said. “So, now, we have satellites reentering pretty much every week. And possibly, in the next months or years, every day.” Understanding how changes in solar activity impact their lifespans and their reentries will be critical as Earth's orbit becomes increasingly crowded.

But card has 'the worst coil whine' ever.

Today, overclocking expert and TechTuber, Roman 'der8auer' Hartung, revealed the gaming performance that an Nvidia RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell graphics card can deliver. We've seen some gaming-like benchmark results for Nvidia's most powerful workstation GPU before, but der8auer also takes this $10,000 professional card though games like Cyberpunk 2077, Star Wars Outlaws, Remnant 2, and Assassin's Creed Mirage. These scores are compared with RTX 5090 and RTX 4090 cards in the same rig. The result? Der8auer crowns the RTX 6000 “the new gaming king.”

In his 15-minute video, der8auer admits he hopes to use this RTX Pro 6000 in his personal rig, and enjoy the resulting gaming sessions. Before getting into the tests, the TechTuber reminds us that this card doesn't have a Game Ready Driver, it only runs with its workstation driver. But this doesn't seem to be a big issue.

The first game dissected is Cyberpunk 2077, played in 4K with max settings (no ray tracing). Der8auer's charts show average FPS, power draw, and 1% minimum FPS for each sample. Throughout these tests, the workstation card is pitted against the RTX 5090 and 4090 - these sit among the best graphics cards of recent years.



As you can see, the RTX Pro 6000 is 14% faster than the RTX 5090, on average, and it has 13% better 1% lows in this title. However, it consumes 15% more power. If you are splurging about $10,000 on such a GPU, though, you might not care too much about the slight wrinkle in the power consumption comparison.

The gaming benchmarking showdown continued with der8auer testing the trio of graphics cards in Star Wars Outlaws (11% faster), Remnant 2 (11% faster), and Assassin's Creed Mirage (3% faster). That last result might have been “a driver thing,” pondered the video host. It looks like the previously seen 3DMark tests actually gave quite a good window onto the performance here.

If you haven't already done so, you can watch the full der8auer video above, where lots of other background details are shared. You can also see a fun comparative Cyberpunk 2077 benchmark with its most extreme settings (path tracing) and MFG turned on.

You can read our previous coverage for more in the way of tech specs, but it is worth reminding readers that the RTX Pro 6000 is based on the same GB202 GPU as the RTX 5090. However, the workstation card benefits from 24,064 shaders (rather than 21,760) as well as more TMUs, ROPs, Tensor cores and RT cores. Nevertheless, the memory configuration is probably its standout feature in the comparison with the RTX Pro 6000 packing 96GB of GDDR7 on its 512-bit bus. A consumer-grade RTX 5090 packs ‘just' 32GB.

With its FE-style cooler design the RTX Pro 6000 is nice and compact, but with it easily reaching 600W power consumption, there are a few comments made about the noise of this graphics card. Wryly, der8auer says that the fans ramp up so fast and so loud that you can't really hear the coil whine. Despite the fans, “This is the worst coil whine I've ever heard, it's insanely loud,” he observes.

The extra 64GB of VRAM costs the manufacturer about $200 more, mused der8auer, who went on to contrast the RTX 5090 at $2,000 vs the RTX Pro 6000 at $10,000. Buying more definitely doesn't equate with saving more.

The UAE wants to have chips made within its borders.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC) is reportedly in talks with White House officials to discuss the possibility of opening a chip fab in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). According to Bloomberg, the company has met several times with U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, alongside state-owned investment firm MGX, discussing plans to invest and build a plant in the country. This site would be of similar scale and size to the one the chip maker is building in Arizona, but no further details have been publicly discussed yet.

This isn't the first time that a chip maker has explored putting up a megafactory in the UAE — both Samsung and TSMC have each considered putting up their own facilities in the country in the third quarter of 2024, with senior executives from both companies visiting the area to start discussions. TSMC even went as far as starting talks with the Biden administration, which, unfortunately, led nowhere.

Sources say that Washington wanted to have sovereign control over the site, which apparently was not acceptable to the UAE government. Aside from that, the senior officials in the Trump government have two major concerns about the proposal: the first one being its negative effect on the Arizona project. The chipmaker has pledged $165 billion to expand the site, with $42 billion to be spent in 2025 alone. It's also not just about finances — the UAE does not have a ready supply of professionals capable of building and running the factory, so TSMC would have to pull out personnel from other locations. This could potentially affect operations in the U.S., especially if it loses key people to the Middle East plant.

The second, more serious concern was national security. Although the UAE currently has close relations with the U.S. - China and Iran have significant influence in the region, too. If the geopolitical weather changes and the country switches allegiance, having a chip factory outside of Washington's direct control would make it easier for its adversaries to acquire the most advanced chips that America has been trying so hard to keep them from.

Nevertheless, the UAE is still pushing hard to become a regional tech giant in the Middle East. It has already secured approval from the U.S. to acquire Nvidia AI GPUs through G42, its homegrown AI datacenter company. More recently, OpenAI announced that it will expand Stargate AI infrastructure in the country, with plans to build a 1 GW data center in Abu Dhabi.

Despite the concerns of some high-ranking officials, the UAE is still pushing hard to have its own advanced chip fab in the country. Trump's AI and Crypto Czar, David Sacks, was reportedly open to the idea, saying that the U.S. should spread its AI technology aggressively around the globe, or else it risks losing the market to Chinese companies.

However, there haven't been any further discussions about the topic yet. When asked about this possibility, TSMC told Bloomberg that it does not comment on rumors, while the White House and the office of the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East did not address the inquiries. The UAE's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and MGX also did not answer any questions about the issue.

Aiming for viable demos in 2027, commercialization before 2030

American chip giant Intel has partnered with Japanese tech and investment powerhouse SoftBank to build a stacked DRAM substitute for HBM. According to Nikkei Asia, the two industry behemoths set up Saimemory to build a prototype based on Intel technology and patents from Japanese academia, including the University of Tokyo. The company is targeting a completed prototype and mass production viability assessment by 2027, with an end goal of commercialization before the end of the decade.

Most AI processors use HBM or high-bandwidth memory chips, which are perfect for temporarily storing the massive amount of data that AI GPUs process. However, these ICs are complex to manufacture and are relatively expensive. Aside from that, they get hot pretty quickly and require relatively more power. The partnership aims to solve this by stacking DRAM chips and then figuring out a way to wire them more efficiently. By doing so, the stacked DRAM chip's power consumption is halved versus a similar HBM chip.

If successful, SoftBank says that it wants to have priority for the supply of these chips. At the moment, only three companies produce the latest HBM chips: Samsung, SK hynix, and Micron. The insatiable demand for AI chips means that HBM supply can be hard to get by, so Saimemory aims to corner the market with its substitute, at least for Japanese data centers. This will also be the first time that Japan aims to become a major memory chip supplier in over 20 years. Japanese firms used to dominate the market in the 1980s, when they manufactured about 70% of the global supply. However, the rise of South Korean and Taiwanese competitors has pushed many of its memory chip manufacturers out of the market.

This won't be the first time that a semiconductor company is experimenting with 3D stacked DRAM. Samsung has already announced plans for 3D and stacked DRAM as early as last year, while another company, NEO Semiconductor, is also working on 3D X-DRAM. However, these are focused on enlarging the capacity of each chip, with memory modules targeted to have 512GB capacity. On the other hand, Saimemory is aiming for reduced power consumption — something that data centers sorely need, especially as AI power consumption is increasing annually.

All USB-C ports need to support data, charging, and display functionality.

Microsoft promises it is “ending USB-C port confusion” with its updated Windows 11 Windows Hardware Compatibility Program (WHCP) initiative. Going forward, it pledges to ensure all USB data, charging, and display functionality “just works” on all your USB-C ports. Moreover, an additional rule means USB 40Gbps ports will be fully compatible with both USB4 and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals. The Microsoft blog indicates that these rules should already be in place with certified Windows 11 laptops and tablets that come with Windows 11 24H2 installed.

Senior Product Manager at Microsoft, Ugan S., asks readers of his blog whether they are “Tired of USB-C ports that don't behave consistently?” To illustrate the problem, he retells a story about ‘The Blank Display' and laments that such issues still happen in the present day. It isn't the USB-C port that's the problem, says the Microsoft exec, it is “the inconsistent implementations of USB-C port capabilities across the PC ecosystem.” Or in other words, not all USB-C ports are created equal.

To fix this inconsistency, the WHCP will now mandate that every USB-C port on new Windows laptops and tablets needs to support data, charging, and display functionality. This should mean no more guessing about which ports support what, and might also mean end users are happier as they can connect a charger or second display to either side of a laptop (if there are USB-C ports both side).

Microsoft put the chart above together to show the capabilities of WHCP-compliant laptops. Yes, they all support the three core functions, but their levels of support will still vary. In addition to the familiar data speed differences, USB 3.X ports won't provide as much accessory power, or support as many displays, as USB4.

On the topic of USB4, you can also see in the table that “On a WHCP-certified USB 40Gbps system, you can also plug in any USB4 or Thunderbolt 3 device and trust it will work every time on every port.”

Not mentioned yet, or hinted at in the table, Microsoft is also requiring USB-IF certified silicon in the PC. Moreover, a new Microsoft driver stack requirement means PCs are validated using Microsoft's built-in USB controller drivers. This should ensure security and feature updates arrive via Windows Update.

To wrap up its post, Microsoft explains that the Hardware Lab Kit (HLK) is behind these improvements. The process is ongoing, with WHCP updating with every Windows release, delivering fixes and enhancements.

If you're looking for a low-profile wireless gaming keyboard, you might still be looking — there aren't too many on the market, as ""gaming"" usually suggests a focus on performance, while ""low-profile"" usually suggests compromising performance for convenience and portability. But there are a few low-profile gaming keyboards out there, such as Logitech's G915 — which found its way onto our list of best wireless gaming keyboards several times over the years since it first launched in 2019.

Needless to say, it's time for an update — but Logitech knows better than to fix what isn't broken. So, it's not too surprising that the new Logitech G915 X TKL looks almost identical to the original G915 — right down to the wrapped aluminum top plate, dedicated connectivity, game mode, lighting, and media buttons, and light-up ""G"" logo in the upper left corner. But there are changes that you can't see on the surface — namely, Logitech's new low-profile switches (in linear, tactile, or clicky), which have been refined for more stable keypresses and compatibility with third-party keycaps. The new board also sports decent battery life (if you turn off the RGB backlighting), tri-mode wireless connectivity, and a slightly more solid (and heftier) case build.

The G915 X series includes both a full-size and a TKL option — we're taking a look at the TKL version, which comes in black and white and was priced at $199.99 when it launched in Sept. 2024, but now appears to have increased in price to $229.99.

The G915 X TKL is a wireless low-profile gaming keyboard with a tenkeyless (TKL) layout. This means it has a full function row, arrow keys, and a navigation cluster, but no 10-key numberpad.

The keyboard is sleek, as in slim, but it sports a pretty roomy layout, with space between the function keys and dedicated connectivity buttons and media keys located along the top. It comes in two colorways — white, which has a silver brushed-aluminum top plate and white keys with shine-through legends; and black, which has a gunmetal gray brushed-aluminum top plate and black keycaps with shinethrough legends.

The G915 X TKL looks a lot like its predecessor, the G915 TKL. The keyboard sports the same brushed-aluminum top plate — though it's now slightly thicker (1.5mm vs 1.2mm) for (slightly) more structural strength and a more premium typing experience.

The brushed-aluminum top plate wraps around the sides, giving the keyboard unique, rounded edges. It features Logitech's ""G"" logo — backlit, as this is the flagship lineup of Logitech's low-profile gaming keyboards, after all — and eight round, backlit, soft-touch buttons. The first two buttons are for switching between 2.4GHz ""Lightspeed"" wireless and Bluetooth connections — like the G515 Lightspeed TKL, the G915 X TKL can only connect to one Bluetooth device at a time, so you can really only switch quickly between two devices. (Still, that's probably all you need — how many Bluetooth devices do you need to type on at once?)

The next button turns on Game Mode, which you can set up in Logitech's G Hub software, and the last button in that cluster adjusts the brightness of the backlighting (or turns it off completely). The next four-button cluster is just media keys, and is pretty self-explanatory: rewind, play/pause, fast forward, and mute.

There's also a wide metal volume roller, which has light striations for grip and a smooth (not notched) roll. The media keys and volume roller are remappable; the connectivity/game mode/lighting buttons are not. If you're the kind of person who uses dedicated media keys and likes to switch between connections or in and out of Game Mode quickly, the G915 X TKL lays it all out there for you. But if you're like me, who almost never uses dedicated media keys or switches away from her PC, this does seem like a waste of space.

The G915 X TKL is a slim but moderate-sized keyboard. It measures 15.2 inches (368mm) wide by 5.91 inches (150mm) deep, and is 0.88 inches (22.6mm) thick at its thickest point, including keycaps.

It has the exact same dimensions as its predecessor, the G915 TKL, though the new G915 X TKL is slightly heavier at 1.9 pounds (860g), vs the original's 1.8 pounds (810g). It's surprisingly heavy for how slim it is, and the weight makes it feel like a solid, well-built board.

The keyboard may not be the most compact low-profile keyboard, but the roomier layout makes for a more comfortable typing experience — the Fn keys are spaced (in groups of four), which makes it easier to touch-type Fn shortcuts without looking at the keyboard, and the arrow keys and navigation cluster are not right up next to the alphanumeric keys.

This might not seem like a big deal, but trust me — it's much easier to switch to a roomy layout like this than it is to switch to something ultra-compact, like the perfectly-fit-together Nuphy Air75 V2.

On the back of the keyboard, you'll find four strips of anti-slip rubber and two sets of flip-out feet, which set the typing angle to 4 degrees or 8 degrees. There's also a convenient slot for storing the 2.4GHz wireless USB-A dongle, which is always handy on a keyboard that's sized for travel like the G915 X TKL is.



In the box, the G915 X TKL comes with a 5.9-foot (1.8m) USB-A to USB-C charging cable, a USB extender, and a 2.4GHz wireless USB-A dongle.

The G915 X TKL now features Logitech's new, redesigned low-profile switches in linear, tactile, or clicky. They're the same switches we saw in the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL — low-profile with a POM cross-style stem for a more stable keypress, a better typing experience, and compatibility with third-party keycaps.

Our review unit came with linear switches, which have an actuation force of 43g and actuate at 1.3mm (reduced from 1.5mm in the old switches), with a total travel distance of 3.2mm (increased from 2.7mm in the old switches). The switches feature a smooth, consistent keypress with no tactile bump or audible click, and were speedy enough for me to keep up (as much as I normally can, anyway), in fist-person shooters like Counter-Strike 2.

Gamers usually like linear switches for their speed, and I will say that the linear switches' slightly lower actuation force did seem to make a difference here — not one that was noticeable in gaming so much as it was in typing, however. My fingers were flying across the keyboard so quickly that I did initially find myself making quite a few errors, and I blame that on the lighter actuation. The linear switches have the lightest actuation force; the tactile switches have an actuation force of 45g, while the clicky switches have an actuation force of 48g. (All three switch types have the same actuation point and total travel distance.)

The keycaps also likely contributed, at least somewhat, to the learning curve on this keyboard — they're wide and flat, with lightly curved tops and that slightly gritty texture you expect from double-shot PBT keycaps.

The higher-quality double-shot PBT keycaps are definitely appreciated — while the switches have been updated to be compatible with third-party keycaps, that doesn't mean there are tons of low-profile keycaps out there — and regular keycaps won't work on a low-profile switch. The keycaps have shine-through legends, which are crisp and clear and show off the keyboard's bright RGB backlighting perfectly.

The G915 X TKL does suffer from some of the same issues as its cheaper counterpart, the G515 Lightspeed TKL, especially when it comes to sound: this is a pretty rattly keyboard, though Logitech has done a decent job of sound-dampening in the case.

The switches are factory-lubed and feel smooth, but typing on this keyboard will get you a consistent, lightweight rattling from the keycaps every time you press a key down. It's not necessarily an unpleasant sound, but it's not what most keyboard enthusiasts are looking for in a keyboard. The G915 X TKL has an aluminum top plate, so it doesn't get the same plasticky rattle as the G515 Lightspeed TKL did in our testing, but it does occasionally give some mild metallic pings. That said, typing on a low-profile keyboard always involves some sort of compromise.

The G915 X TKL is configurable with G Hub, which is Logitech's universal gaming peripheral software. You can use G Hub to customize the keyboard's lighting (and sync the lighting effects with other Logitech G products you might own), remap keys and buttons, and set up game mode.

Remapping in G Hub is more convoluted than it needs to be, but thanks to Logitech's new ""Keycontrol,"" you can map three layers deep — primary, Fn, and G-Shift. You can also save profiles in the software and on the device itself, and tie profiles to specific apps or games. The media keys and the volume roller are reprogrammable, but the first four buttons (2.4GHz wireless, Bluetooth, Game Mode, and lighting) are not.

The keyboard features bright, per-key backlighting, which looks great against the shiny, top plate. In G Hub you can customize the color of each key individually, if you want — and this includes the Logitech ""G"" logo and each of the buttons along the top.

G Hub also comes preloaded with a handful of standard effects — color cycle, breathing, audio visualizer, etc. — and allows you to create and save your own animated lighting effects, which can be layered. You can control the brightness of the backlight directly from the keyboard using the dedicated lighting button.



The G915 X TKL has three forms of connectivity — 2.4GHz wireless, Bluetooth, and wired (via USB-C). The first connectivity button toggles between 2.4GHz wireless and wired, while the second button switches to Bluetooth (and can also be held down to enter pairing mode). You can only connect to one Bluetooth device at a time, however, so this is not the keyboard for you if you have multiple phones.

Logitech rates the G915 X TKL's battery life at ""up to 1000 hours"" over 2.4GHz wireless — but that's with the backlighting off, of course. With the lighting on at full brightness you can expect to get around 42 hours, which is still pretty good — enough to get you through more than a week's worth of pretty heavy usage before you'll need to recharge.

If you were looking to replace your G915 TKL with a slightly better G915 TKL, the G915 X TKL is a solid update to the line. It features more versatile switches — though they're not hot-swappable — better battery life, and a solidly-built case — and it's speedy enough, even for competitive gamers. And while the typing experience is a little rattly, it's not bad — once you get used to the lighter-weight switches and flat, smooth keycaps, you'll be typing up a storm on this keyboard without any issues.

There are low-profile keyboards with better typing experiences, but they tend to be mediocre for gaming — the Lofree Edge and the Chilkey ND75 LP both sound and feel great, but aren't great for gaming despite their general specs (N-key rollover, 1,000 Hz polling rate) suggesting they are. While gaming peripheral software often infuriates me, it does happen to have a lot of features that are convenient for, well, gaming — and while G Hub is overcomplicated, it's a decent companion when you're, well, gaming.

Of course, if you're looking for something very similar to the G915 X TKL, just... cheaper, the less premium G515 Lightspeed TKL is the same size and thickness and costs $139.99.

There are all sorts of ergonomic input devices — from vertical mice like the Logitech Lift that keep your hand at a ""more natural"" angle, to split keyboards like the low-profile Kinesis Form. And while ergonomics is a science, there are so many different issues we can have with our keyboards and mice that there aren't really any simple solutions — it really depends on what your particular hand/wrist/movement issues are.

The Contour RollerMouse Red Plus Wireless is an interesting pitch — it's predicated on the idea that what's really messing with your joints and workflow is... moving your arm. So, instead of giving you a device that sits to the right of your keyboard, the RollerMouse Red Plus Wireless sits in front of your keyboard — sort of like a trackpad. I'm not sure I'd say trackpads are particularly ergonomic, but this isn't a trackpad: it's a wide, sensitive roller bar with six buttons and a scroll wheel that sits flush against your keyboard and lets you move your mouse... without moving your arm.

To be fair, Contour is not suggesting that simply moving your arm is what's causing your repetitive stress injury — instead, it points out that moving your arm and grabbing a mouse can put your hand in an unnatural position (which is true), and that having your arms in front of you is a more ""neutral"" position (I'm not sure that's true — is it neutral to be typing at all?) It also points out that the RollerMouse Red Plus Wireless has more buttons (more buttons than the average productivity mouse, perhaps), and that they come preloaded with common actions, such as copy and paste, to make your workflow smoother. You can, of course, program the buttons on most of the best wireless productivity mice (and many come with programs that even allow you to program buttons based on what program you're using).

The RollerMouse Red Plus Wireless isn't just an input device, of course — it's ergonomic, and what's more ergonomic than a wrist rest? The RollerMouse Red Plus Wireless does come with a removable padded wrist rest (in fact, the wrist rest is what makes it ""Plus"" — the regular RollerMouse Red comes with a smaller wrist rest), so it can also help your posture and comfort when you're typing.

If you're thinking all this sounds a bit pricey, you're not wrong — it's very pricey. The regular RollerMouse Red, which is wired and comes with a smaller wrist rest, will set you back $374 (wireless is an extra $20, at $394). The RollerMouse Red Plus Wireless, which is what we took a look at for this review, costs $409, which practically makes the $250 Asus ROG Harpe Ace Extreme look like a steal. But it's very different from typical productivity mice — maybe it's a game-changer, at least for some.

The RollerMouse Red Plus Wireless, at its core, consists of two parts: the device itself, which contains the roller bar, scroll wheel, and buttons; and the removable wrist rest, which slots perfectly over the metal chassis of the RollerMouse, with a cutout that contours around the buttons.

The RollerMouse Red Plus Wireless only comes in one colorway — the chassis is made of red plastic and silver aluminum and the roller bar features a gold-tinted bar and a black roller. The wrist rest, which will cover most of the chassis anyway, features black vegan leather over memory foam. All-in-all, it's a pretty nice-looking wrist rest (slash mouse... device) — the aluminum looks nice next to premium mechanical keyboards, and it looks professional (if not otherwise too exciting).



If a plastic-and-aluminum chassis sounds hefty, well, you're right — the RollerMouse Red Plus Wireless is heavier than the average wrist rest. The device alone weighs just over 1 pound (490.5g). With the regular, smaller wrist rest attached, it weighs 1.6 pounds (722g), and with the larger, ""Plus"" wrist rest attached, it weighs 2.06 pounds (933g).

It's also a very sturdy, well-made device: the main device features molded plastic with a machined aluminum shell, while the wrist rests are entirely aluminum, save for padding. The roller bar is lightweight and flexible, with a nubbed rubber-coated roller for precise movements and ""grip."" The only area that's a little disappointing is the button panel — it's made of a somewhat cheap-feeling silver-painted plastic, and the buttons are large but also feel a little cheap. There's also a (clickable) scroll wheel, which has a rubbery texture and is not notched.

The RollerMouse Red Plus Wireless comes with both the regular wrist rest, which is approximately 3 inches (76.2mm) deep and doesn't cover much more than the device, and the larger ""Plus"" wrist rest, which is around 5 inches (127mm) deep. The wrist rests slide onto the RollerMouse and ""click"" into place — they are designed to fit perfectly over the device, and Contour provides a flat, metal tool that you can fit into slots to sort of ""pry"" the wrist rests loose from the device, should you want to remove them for cleaning (or any reason). (I say ""pry"" because it's not really prying — there's very little resistance with the tool, but the wrist rest won't otherwise just detach from the device.)

I've never been much of a wrist rest person, but I was impressed with the RollerMouse Red Plus Wireless wrist rest. It's just a slim piece of contoured aluminum, but it feels great — it starts nearly flat near the front and gently slopes up, supporting both your palms and wrists while you're typing or using the RollerMouse. It's covered in a fairly thin layer of memory foam and leatherette, but it's just enough foam to be soft and comfortable while still retaining the full support of a rigid, aluminum wrist rest. The leatherette also feels great — soft and premium and like it should last longer than the average leatherette-covered wrist rest.



The wrist rest covers the wrist area of the device, but not the bar — the RollerMouse Red Plus Wireless, with the larger wrist rest installed, measures 6.2 inches (157.48mm) deep, so you'll need a decent amount of space on your desk to accommodate that in addition to your keyboard. The device is 16.75 inches (425.45mm) wide at the top, which makes it a little wider than most TKLs but a little shorter than most full-size keyboards. I suppose if you want to maximize the roller bar area, you probably want the roller bar to be about the same size as your keyboard — the roller bar measures 11.75 inches (298.45mm) wide, which is close to many 75-percent keyboards.

The back of the device does have little anti-slip rubber feet, though I don't think you'll really need these — not only is this device hefty enough that it won't move too much on its own, it's also designed to sit up against your keyboard — so it doesn't really have anywhere to go. The back is where you'll find the power switch, as well as a little storage compartment for the wireless dongle.

The RollerMouse Red Plus Wireless is supposed to sit with the roller bar close to level with the front of your keyboard — easy to use, but not so high that it interferes with your typing. Of course, not all keyboards have thick, hefty aluminum chassis — in fact, most don't — and so the RollerMouse comes with a pair of modular keyboard risers that you can use to raise your keyboard to the appropriate height. The risers attach to the front of the RollerMouse Red Plus Wireless (they slide into a slot at the top of the device) and are wide enough to support just about any keyboard. They have rubberized tops to prevent the keyboard from slipping, and come in two parts — short and long — that can be adjusted multiple ways to put your keyboard level with the RollerMouse, or tilt it forward or backward.

That said, if you have a keyboard that already sits level with the RollerMouse's roller bar, you can also opt to not use the risers at all.

The RollerMouse Red Plus Wireless comes in two boxes — one box has the larger, ""Plus"" wrist rest, and one box has the device with the regular wrist rest, two keyboard risers, a wrist rest removal too, and a 6-foot USB-C to USB-C cable with a USB-A to USB-C converter/extender for the USB-A dongle, as well as a USB-C to USB-A converter on the other side. The device has a USB-C charging port on its left side, so you can charge it while using it (since it sits flush with your keyboard). The charging port is a little recessed, so many USB-C cables may not fit.

The RollerMouse Red Plus Wireless is designed to be ergonomic by keeping your hands in front of you, in a central, ""neutral"" position. I'm not sure how well it achieves this, as my hands were never in a ""neutral"" position while I was using this device — they were always angled flat / parallel with my desk.

But this is not the only way the RollerMouse is supposed to help you out — it's also supposed to be easier on your hands in general, because it doesn't require the gripping or squeezing that traditional mice do, and you can use it with both hands to reduce one-sided strain.



You move your mouse using the roller bar — slide it back and forth to move left or right, and roll it up or down to move the mouse up or down, and combine those movements to move diagonally. This is surprisingly intuitive, and the roller bar is very well-made — it's lightweight, with very smooth sliding and rolling, and it's sensitive enough that you can move it fairly precisely around your desktop.

Pressing it down gently activates the primary (left) click; I found this to be very well-tuned for just the right amount of pressure where I wasn't accidentally clicking when I wanted to roll/slide, but clicking still felt almost entirely effortless. You can also adjust the click force of the roller bar, or turn off the feature entirely. Being able to click the roller bar and still move it did make it much easier to do things like highlight text or drag items on the RollerMouse Red Plus Wireless versus other types of static input devices such as trackpads or rollerball mice, where you need to hold a separate button.



There's a button panel located below the roller bar, set slightly off-center (to the left), with six buttons and a clickable scroll wheel. The top center button is mainly for adjusting on-device settings — setting DPI, adjusting roller bar click force, cycling through different modes (PC/Mac/HID) and settings for buttons, and checking the battery level.

There are two slim buttons to the side of this button — the left is labeled ""Copy"" and the right is labeled ""Paste,"" for those of you who copy and paste so often that you need dedicated buttons for those two-key commands (if you just want this functionality but not a whole $400+ input device, you can always grab Stack Overflow's April Fool's Joke-turned-real-product, The Key v2).

Under the copy and paste buttons are two large buttons for left and right click — though I'm not sure why there's a left click button when you can already left-click with the roller bar — and then at the bottom center there's a double-click button.

The buttons are all large and easy to press, with lightweight switches that, on the one hand, seem a little cheap — but on the other, are very easy to press because of this. All five of the functional buttons can be reprogrammed, as well as the roller bar click, by the way — and the double-click button comes with a handful of pre-programmed alternative actions, which you can cycle through on the device by holding down the adjustment button and clicking the double-click button. There are five LEDs above the adjustment button that light up in different colors to help you determine where you are in terms of alternate functions, DPI, battery life, etc.

In the center of the button panel, there's a smooth, clickable scroll wheel. This took me some time to get used to, because I kept expecting the roller bar to scroll (how I thought it would know when I wanted to scroll, I'm not sure), but it got more intuitive as I used it. The scroll wheel is fine — I'm glad it's smooth and not notched, for the sake of speed and ergonomics, and the center-click feels adequately tactile. Both the scroll wheel and the center-click can be reprogrammed, but the scroll wheel can only be toggled between scrolling and volume control.

I was very impressed with the roller bar of the RollerMouse Red Plus Wireless — it worked much better than I expected to, even across my four screens (moving the bar all the way to one side makes it keep going, so you can still access all areas). It was very intuitive and easy to use right away, and it did feel like it was less strain to lightly touch it instead of moving my hand to my mouse. I also didn't have any issues with precise stopping or cursor drift, which I'm always a little concerned about with these kinds of peripherals. And it didn't get in my way while I was typing, the way most laptop trackpads do.

The buttons were... fine. I didn't find them to be particularly ergonomically placed or tactile-feeling, so they weren't any better or worse than most mouse buttons. While I liked being able to left-click with the roller bar, angling my hand down to right-click didn't feel very ergonomic. The button area also just feels like the place that will have issues first in this otherwise very well-built device, but it looks like it could be replaceable. (Not that you should have to replace them, though.)

The RollerMouse Red Plus Wireless is customizable, and much of that customization can be done directly on the device itself, which is nice. Using the adjustment button, you can check the battery life, adjust the force of the roller bar click, change the cursor speed (up to 2,800 DPI), change the mode (PC/Mac/HID), and cycle through different functions for the double-click button: middle click, double click, left click, right click, and ""freeze click,"" which freezes the roller bar so you can recenter the roller.

Remembering the combination of buttons to press and what the LED colors mean can be a little tricky, though, so Contour also provides software that also lets you reprogram buttons and set up application-specific profiles. The software is fine once it's installed on your computer, but it did require two restarts for me to get it there — still, I didn't find the copy and paste buttons to be very useful, and you will need to install the software to reprogram any buttons but the double-click button.

The RollerMouse Red Plus Wireless is, as its name suggests, wireless — it comes with a USB-A dongle and wireless extender, so you can place it on your desk, near the device. According to Contour, the battery life in the RollerMouse Red Plus Wireless should last ""up to three months,"" depending on usage, which doesn't sound too unreasonable — the RollerMouse is much larger and heavier than any actual mouse, with plenty of room for a large battery. (It also doesn't move as much as an actual mouse does, but this is probably pretty minor compared to the battery size/weight.

The RollerMouse Red Plus Wireless is an interesting product — it's hard to say it's a must-buy, because I'm not sure most people's hand and wrist problems are related to moving their arm to the side. But the RollerMouse did surprise me with how comfortable it was as a wrist rest — even though I wasn't having any discomfort without a wrist rest, and how well the roller bar worked for moving the cursor around without getting in the way of my typing.

That said, while the roller bar offered smooth, intuitive, and precise cursor movement, I did not have anywhere near the amount of control as I did with a regular mouse in things like Photoshop or Blender. The mouse movement was great for regular productivity tasks (and surprisingly good for highlighting text and dragging things), but when it came to tasks where I really needed extreme control over mouse movement, such as photo editing, the RollerMouse just... didn't work, and I don't see this improving much with experience. But this is targeted at office workers, not artists, and is moot for most users.

It really comes down to whether centralizing your mouse and keyboard experience is what you're looking for — if it is, the RollerMouse Red Plus Wireless might be a good investment. If it's not, it's a very expensive, but very comfortable wrist rest. If you're having hand or wrist issues, you may want to check out a vertical mouse like the Logitech Lift or a more productivity-focused ergonomic mouse like the Logitech MX Master 3S.

Vepdegestrant, an investigational estrogen receptor (ER) degrader, known as a proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC ), outshone the commonly used selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) fulvestrant in a phase 3 trial of second-line treatment for a subset of patients with breast cancer.

The VERITAC-2 trial included patients with ER-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+/HER2-), locally advanced or metastatic disease who had failed prior treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK 4/6) inhibitors and endocrine therapy, and no exposure to chemotherapy in the advanced setting. 

Only a subset of the study cohort, those with estrogen receptor 1-mutant disease, experienced a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) when treated with vepdegestrant compared with patients treated with fulvestrant. 

“These results support vepdegestrant as a potential monotherapy treatment option for patients with previously treated ESR1-mutant ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer,” said lead author Erika P. Hamilton, MD, a medical oncologist and director of Breast Cancer and Gynecologic Cancer Research at Sarah Cannon Research Institute, Nashville, Tennessee, during a press conference for the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. The findings were simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. 

Vepdegestrant is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, but received fast-track status in February 2024 as monotherapy for this patient population. It is the first and only PROTAC ER degrader to be evaluated in a phase 3 clinical trial in breast cancer. PROTACs represent a novel class of therapeutic agents that harness the proteasome to selectively degrade target proteins.

“There's no established consensus for patients getting treatment in the second-line setting after progression on endocrine therapy and a CDK 4/6 inhibitor,” explained Hamilton. “One of the mainstays of our treatment really has been fulvestrant, which clearly has some challenges. First, it's administered intramuscularly, and second, in a post-CDK 4/6 landscape, we know that progression-free survival is very short — on the order of less than 2 months.”

Besides fulvestrant, the oral SERD elacestrant was FDA-approved in January 2023, and other oral SERDs are in development, she noted.

The new trial included 624 patients with advanced ER+/HER2- disease that had progressed following one or two lines of endocrine therapy and a CDK 4/6 inhibitor.

“They could not have received fulvestrant already or chemotherapy, and patients had to have benefited from their previous line of endocrine therapy for at least 6 months to enter the study,” Hamilton noted. 

Study participants were also stratified by the presence or absence of visceral disease, as well as the presence of an ESR1 mutation (n = 270). Such mutations are a common cause of acquired resistance found in approximately 40% of patients in the second-line setting, according to a press release from the drug developer.

Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to 28-day treatment cycles of either 200 mg oral vepdegestrant once daily, or 500 mg intramuscular fulvestrant on day 1 and day 15 of the first cycle, and then on day 1 of each subsequent cycle. 

The primary endpoint was PFS by blinded, independent central review, first in patients with ESR1 mutations and then in the entire cohort.

Key secondary endpoints were overall survival, objective response rate, and clinical benefit rate, which was defined as the rate of confirmed clinical or partial response at any time, or stable disease, nonclinical response, or nonprogressive disease for at least 24 weeks.

The study met its key primary endpoint, showing a median PFS of 5.0 months with vepdegestrant compared with 2.1 months with fulvestrant (hazard ratio [HR] 0.57; P < .001) in the 270 patients with ESR1 mutations. At 6 months, twice as many patients in the vepdegestrant arm remained progression-free compared with those in the fulvestrant arm (45.2% vs 22.7%). However, this primary endpoint was not significantly different between groups when calculated for the entire patient population (HR, 0.83; P = .07).

For the key secondary endpoints, among patients with ESR1 mutations, the clinical benefit rate was more than double in patients receiving vepdegestrant (42.1% vs 20.2%). Similarly, the objective response rate was more than four times higher (18.6% vs 4%)

Commenting in a press release, ASCO breast cancer expert Jane Lowe Meisel, MD, said that although the trial found that vepdegestrant worked better than fulvestrant in patients with ESR1 mutations, “on average, patients did not have prolonged responses on either agent, highlighting the need for combination therapies and continued development in this space.” Meisel is co-director of Breast Medical Oncology at the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia.

“Overall survival was very immature at the time of this analysis, with only 20% of the anticipated events occurring,” added lead investigator Hamilton.

Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) led to discontinuation in 3% of patients taking vepdegestrant and 1% of patients taking fulvestrant. TEAEs leading to dose reductions occurred in 2% of the vepdegestrant group and none in the fulvestrant group. 

The three most common AEs of any grade were fatigue (27% in vepdegestrant group, 16% fulvestrant group) and increased aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels of any grade (14% vepdegestrant group, 10% fulvestrant group). 

Compared to oral SERDs, vepdegestrant has a favorable side effect profile, Hamilton said.

“Oral SERDs have prominent GI side effects as their most frequent side effect.” But, across all grades, rates of both vomiting and diarrhea were only 6% with vepdegestrant. 

GI side effects tend to be more common, “in the 30% or 40% range with oral SERDs,” she told Medscape Medical News.

Study discussant William John Gradishar, MD, emphasized the importance of reducing side effects.

“ Vepdegestrant now joins a growing list of drugs that perform better than current standard of care monotherapy” in the ESR1-mutant population, he noted in the session. 

But the reality is that most of these drugs are being developed to be used in combination with targeted therapies, “and increased toxicity can be expected with doublet therapy…Quality of life measures as experienced and reported by patients are critical, and even modest changes in symptom and functional domains should not be minimized,” said Gradishar, professor of breast oncology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois. 

“Vepdegestrant has demonstrated compelling preclinical activity and encouraging early clinical data supporting its efficacy in degrading ER,” said Albert Grinshpun, MD, in an interview with Medscape Medical News.

Grinshpun, head of the Breast Cancer Service at Shaare Zedek Medical Center and The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel, said his initial takeaway from the study is that “vepdegestrant now stands alongside other oral SERDs, such as elacestrant and imlunestrant, in demonstrating superiority over fulvestrant, specifically in the context of ESR1­-mutant [disease].”

“Importantly, the treatment landscape for patients progressing on CDK 4/6 inhibitors is rapidly evolving, with a growing shift toward combination therapies rather than fulvestrant monotherapy,” he said. “In my view, vepdegestrant has established itself as a promising endocrine backbone for future combination strategies. Its favorable toxicity profile makes it particularly well-suited for pairing with a range of targeted agents or even antibody-drug conjugates, including inhibitors of PIK3CA and KAT6, in the pursuit of more effective therapeutic regimens.”

New research that used blood markers to measure linoleic acid levels and their relation to cardiometabolic risk adds evidence that this omega-6 fatty acid may help to lower risks for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The findings challenge claims that seed oils are harmful to cardiometabolic health.

Linoleic acid, which is found in vegetable oils-especially seed oils like soybean and corn oil-and plant foods, is the primary omega-6 fatty acid consumed in the diet.

There has been increasing attention on seed oils, with some claiming these oils promote inflammation and raise cardiometabolic risk. Our study, based on almost 1,900 people, found that higher linoleic acid in blood plasma was associated with lower levels of biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk, including those related to inflammation."" 

Kevin C. Maki, Ph.D., adjunct professor at the Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington and chief scientist at Midwest Biomedical Research

Maki will present the findings at NUTRITION 2025, the flagship annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition held May 31–June 3 in Orlando.

The new results are consistent with those from observational studies that have shown higher intake of linoleic acid to be associated with lower risks for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes.

""Although other studies have assessed relationships between linoleic acid and cardiometabolic risk factors, our study used objective biomarkers rather than diet records or food frequency questionnaires to assess linoleic acid intake,"" said Maki. ""We also measured a range of markers of inflammation and indicators of glucose metabolism."" 

For the new study, the investigators performed a cross-sectional analysis on data from 1,894 people in an observational cohort focused on Covid-19. They found that higher levels of linoleic acid in plasma-indicative of dietary intake-were consistently associated with lower levels of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. 

Specifically, study participants with higher linoleic acid showed lower levels of glucose and insulin as well as HOMA-IR, a biomarker of insulin resistance. They also had lower levels of inflammation biomarkers, including C-reactive protein, glycoprotein acetyls, and serum amyloid A.

""We saw consistent results across the different biomarkers measured,"" Maki said. ""People with higher levels of linoleic acid in their blood tended to have a healthier overall risk profile for heart disease and diabetes.""

The researchers say that their findings support the need for additional intervention studies to test whether increasing linoleic acid intake improves cardiometabolic risk factors and lowers the incidence of heart attacks, strokes and type 2 diabetes. Next, they plan to investigate how different types of oils with varying fatty acid content affect cardiometabolic risk factors.

Maki will present this research at 10:20-10:24 EDT on Sunday, June 1, during the Bioactives in Inflammation, Intestinal Health, Glucose and Bone Metabolism session and at 12:45-1:45 PM on Monday, June 2 during the Dietary Bioactive Components session  in the Orange County Convention Center.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Adding immunotherapy to chemotherapy after surgery improves survival in colon cancer","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250601/Adding-immunotherapy-to-chemotherapy-after-surgery-improves-survival-in-colon-cancer.aspx","Sun, 01 Jun 2025 16:39:00 GMT","

Colon cancer is the third most prevalent form of cancer in the U.S., and while screening has helped detect and prevent colon cancer from spreading, major advancements in treating colon cancer have lagged.

Now, new research led by Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center found that adding immunotherapy to chemotherapy after surgery for patients with stage 3 (node-positive) colon cancer - and with a specific genetic makeup called deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) - was associated with a 50% reduction in cancer recurrence and death compared to chemotherapy alone. Approximately 15% of people diagnosed with colon cancer exhibit dMMR and, to date, these tumors appear less sensitive to chemotherapy. The results of the multi-center study were presented during a plenary session at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago.

""The findings from our study represent a major advance in the adjuvant treatment of dMMR stage 3 colon cancer and will now change the treatment for this type of cancer,"" says oncologist Frank Sinicrope, M.D., who led the study. ""It's extremely rewarding to be able to offer our patients a new treatment regimen that can reduce the risk of recurrence and improve their chances of survival.""

Until now, the standard treatment after surgery for any stage 3 colon cancer has been chemotherapy. However, the researchers note that approximately 30% of patients experience cancer recurrence despite this treatment. 

The clinical trial enrolled 712 patients with dMMR stage 3 colon cancer that had been surgically removed and who had cancer cells in their lymph nodes. The immunotherapy given in this study was an immune checkpoint inhibitor, known as atezolizumab, which activates one's immune system to attack and kill cancer cells, which are responsible for cancer recurrence and spread. The patients - who lived in the U.S. and Germany - received chemotherapy for six months along with immunotherapy and then continued with immunotherapy alone for another six months.

Dr. Sinicrope and others previously studied patients with colon cancer whose cells are unable to repair errors during DNA replication that create a nucleotide mismatch, a condition called dMMR. They noted that these patients' tumors showed a striking increase in inflammatory cells within the tumor, including those that express the target of immune checkpoint inhibitors. This sparked the idea of using immune checkpoint inhibitors to make the immune cells more effective in attacking and killing the cancer cells.

Based on the data from this study, Dr. Sinicrope recommends this combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy treatment to be the new standard treatment for stage 3 deficient mismatch repair colon cancer. The research team plans to approach the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a nonprofit organization consisting of 33 leading cancer centers, including Mayo Clinic, with this recommendation.

The study included patients with Lynch syndrome, the most common form of hereditary colon cancer, as these patients can have tumors that show deficient mismatch repair (dMMR).

We're changing the paradigm in colon cancer treatment. By using immunotherapy at earlier stages of disease, we are achieving meaningful benefits for our patients.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Tobacco-funded research continues to appear in leading medical journals","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250601/Tobacco-funded-research-continues-to-appear-in-leading-medical-journals.aspx","Sun, 01 Jun 2025 16:22:00 GMT","

Tobacco-funded research is still appearing in highly-cited medical journals - despite attempts by some to cut ties altogether, finds an investigation by The Investigative Desk and The BMJ today.

Although the tobacco industry has a long history of subverting science, most leading medical journals don't have policies which ban research wholly or partly funded by the industry. 

And even when publishers, authors and universities are willing to restrict tobacco industry ties, they struggle to identify funding sources because tobacco companies have funded front groups and have diversified into pharmaceutical and health technology fields. 

These investments include treatments for conditions caused or aggravated by smoking, such as lung cancer, heart disease, and asthma.

These ties complicate ongoing efforts of researchers, scientific organisations and journals to distance themselves from the industry and has led to calls for journals to not only institute bans on research by tobacco companies but also on their subsidiaries.

The Investigative Desk and The BMJ searched the PubMed database and found hundreds of relationships between Big Tobacco's medical and pharmaceutical subsidiaries and medical research. 

They also checked the tobacco policies of 10 leading general medical journals and 10 journals in each of the three therapeutic areas especially affected by smoking. 

Of those 40 journals, only 8 (20%) had policies prohibiting studies wholly or partly funded by the tobacco industry. Of the 10 journals in the field of respiratory medicine, six had a tobacco policy, but in oncology only one did, and in cardiology, none had one. Among the 10 general medicine journals, only The BMJ had such a policy.

But even among the journals that have a policy, enforcement can be difficult when it involves subsidiaries or organisations associated with the tobacco companies. Last year, one of BMJ Group's titles, BMJ Open, retracted a paper after it became clear that the listed funder receives sponsorship from the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World, a group supported and fully funded by tobacco company Philip Morris International (PMI).

Dutch researcher Wytse van den Bosch had a research grant from pharmaceutical company Vectura when the company was bought by PMI in 2021. Nevertheless, his study was still published in the European Respiratory Society (ERS) journal which said the research was not in breach of its policy as the grant from Vectura was initiated in 2018.

Ruth Malone, professor of social behavioral sciences at the University of California and former editor-in-chief of BMJ Group's Tobacco Control journal, said that institutions, professionals and scientific journals should refuse involvement with the tobacco industry.

Anyone who understands the history, extent and nature of the epidemic and the tobacco industry's strategic efforts to divide the public health community knows that industry money should be rejected.""

Ruth Malone, professor of social behavioral sciences, University of California

Nicholas Hopkinson, professor of respiratory medicine at Imperial College London, notes that given the industry's ""long-standing history of dishonesty"" it is ""very straightforward"" that researchers should cut ties to companies after they are acquired by big tobacco, as otherwise they would be ""working with the tobacco industry"" and contribute to their profits.

Today, BMJ also updates its 2013 tobacco policy. In addition to excluding research funded by the tobacco industry, BMJ journals will also exclude work where authors have personal financial ties to the tobacco industry.

""The updated policy is one action BMJ journals can take to reduce the publication of content which downplays the harms of smoking or hinders the creation of a world free from the harms of smoking,"" explain editors. ""Creating a stronger firewall between the tobacco industry and BMJ content will provide space for editors to curate and publish content that is more independent and trusted, and contributes to a healthier world.""

A large prospective, randomized clinical trial in patients with advanced breast cancer has found that the use of liquid biopsy blood tests for early detection of a treatment-resistance mutation, followed by a switch to a new type of treatment, substantially extends the period of tumor control compared to standard care.

The SERENA-6 study, published June 1 in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented concurrently at the annual meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology, was conducted at multiple medical centers, principally in Europe, East Asia and the United States, including at Weill Cornell Medicine and three affiliated NewYork-Presbyterian campuses: NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, and NewYork-Presbyterian Queens. It is one of the first demonstrations that treatment switching guided by liquid biopsy results brings better outcomes for patients.

The main message here is that liquid biopsy technology allows us to intervene sooner when the tumor burden is lower and the chance of a good outcome is higher.""

Dr. Massimo Cristofanilli, study co-author, professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and an oncologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center

Dr. Cristofanilli, an expert on the use of liquid biopsy technology for cancer monitoring and early cancer detection, helped design and oversee the SERENA-6 study as a member of its steering committee.

The study, which was sponsored by Astra Zeneca, enrolled patients with advanced forms of estrogen receptor (ER) positive, HER2 receptor-negative breast cancer, which is driven by the overactivity of growth-promoting estrogen receptors on tumor cells. Standard treatment includes drugs called aromatase inhibitors that block the production of ER-stimulating estrogen hormones. However, tumors treated this way often start growing and spreading again because they develop mutations in the ESR1 gene that keep estrogen receptors active even when estrogen hormone levels are low or absent.

The trial was set up to determine if patients would benefit from early detection of ESR1 mutations with liquid biopsy-type blood tests, followed by an immediate switch to an experimental new breast cancer drug called camizestrant, which reduces the number of estrogen receptors.

The researchers screened more than 3,300 patients at 264 different clinical sites in 23 countries. The 315 who had detectable ESR1 mutations but no symptomatic or medical imaging evidence of tumor progression were randomly assigned to stop taking an aromatase inhibitor and start taking camizestrant, or to stick to standard treatment including an aromatase inhibitor.

The results showed that patients who switched to camizestrant tended to have a longer period of tumor non-progression (median 16.0 months vs. 9.2 months), and a much longer time to deterioration in their overall health status and quality of life (median 23.0 months vs. 6.4 months).

The researchers considered these differences to be both statistically significant and clinically meaningful. Camizestrant also was well tolerated, with low rates of treatment discontinuation.

Dr. Cristofanilli, who is also the scientific director of the Englander Institute for Precision Medicine and the associate director of precision oncology at the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center, said that he expects the strategy demonstrated in this study to be applicable more generally when doctors monitor for ER-positive breast cancer recurrence after treatment. He noted as well that not only breast cancer but also many other cancer types have potential treatment-resistance mutations that can be detected early with liquid biopsy techniques.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Obesity associated with anxiety and cognitive impairment in mice","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250601/Obesity-associated-with-anxiety-and-cognitive-impairment-in-mice.aspx","Sun, 01 Jun 2025 17:06:00 GMT","

With rates of obesity and anxiety both on the rise-especially among younger Americans-new research suggests that the two conditions may be connected through interactions between the gut and the brain. The study, conducted in mice, links diet-induced obesity with anxiety-like symptoms, alterations in brain signaling and differences in gut microbes that may contribute to impaired brain functioning.

Several studies have pointed to a link between obesity and anxiety, though it is still unclear whether obesity directly causes anxiety or if the association is influenced by societal pressures. Our findings suggest that obesity can lead to anxiety-like behavior, possibly due to changes in both brain function and gut health.""

Desiree Wanders, PhD, associate professor and chair of nutrition at Georgia State University

Wanders will present the findings at NUTRITION 2025, the flagship annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition held May 31–June 3 in Orlando, Florida.

While it is well established that obesity can lead to conditions like type 2 diabetes and heart disease, the potential impacts on brain health are less clear. To probe the connections between obesity, cognitive function and anxiety, the researchers designed a series of experiments using a mouse model that develops many of the same obesity-related issues seen in humans.

The study included 32 male mice. From 6 to 21 weeks of age-a period equivalent to adolescence into early adulthood in humans-half of the mice were fed a low-fat diet and half were fed a high-fat diet. By the end of this period, mice on a high-fat diet weighed significantly more and had significantly more body fat than those fed a low-fat diet.

In behavioral tests, the researchers found that the obese mice displayed more anxiety-like behaviors, such as freezing (a defensive behavior mice exhibit in response to a perceived threat), compared with lean mice. These mice also showed different signaling patterns in the hypothalamus, a region of the brain involved in regulating metabolism, which could contribute to cognitive impairments.

In addition, the researchers observed distinct differences in the makeup of gut bacteria in obese mice compared with lean mice. These findings align with a growing body of evidence pointing to the role of the gut microbiome in regulating behavior.

While recognizing that research in mice does not always translate directly to humans, Wanders said that the results provide new insights that underscore the importance of targeting multiple systems in understanding and potentially treating obesity-related cognitive impairments.

""These findings could have important implications for both public health and personal decisions,"" said Wanders. ""The study highlights the potential impact of obesity on mental health, particularly in terms of anxiety. By understanding the connections between diet, brain health and gut microbiota, this research may help guide public health initiatives that focus on obesity prevention and early intervention, particularly in children and adolescents."" 

Wanders also noted that the carefully controlled conditions used in the study lend rigor and credibility to the results but added that the real world is much more complex.

""While our findings suggest that diet plays a significant role in both physical and mental health, it is important to remember that diet is just one piece of the puzzle,"" said Wanders. ""Environmental factors, genetics, lifestyle choices and socioeconomic status also contribute to the risk of obesity and its associated health outcomes. Therefore, while these results are important, they should be considered in the context of a broader, multifactorial approach to understanding and addressing obesity-related cognitive impairments and mental health issues.""

Next, the researchers hope to further explore the mechanisms by which diet-induced obesity affects the brain and behavior by digging deeper into the changes in the gut microbiome and expanding their study to include female mice and different age groups. Wanders added that it would be useful to determine whether weight loss interventions could reverse the impacts.

Wanders will present this research at 11:45 a.m. - 12:45 p.m. EDT on Sunday, June 1, during the Obesity session at the Orange County Convention Center.

While moms have traditionally gotten much of the focus when it comes to children's eating habits, a new study highlights the importance of dads in shaping a child's relationship with food. According to the study, young children were more likely to consume the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables if their father ate a healthier diet during his teen years.

The study is based on data from 669 men who answered questionnaires about their eating habits during adolescence and then, years later, provided information about their attitudes and behaviors surrounding their children's diet.

Our study found that fathers who ate healthier as teenagers were more likely to encourage positive food habits in their children. These fathers were better at modeling healthy eating-actively demonstrating good dietary habits-and monitoring their child's intake of unhealthy foods, such as certain sweets and snack foods.""

Mariane H. De Oliveira, PhD, postdoctoral researcher at Boston College

De Oliveira will present the findings at NUTRITION 2025, the flagship annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition held May 31–June 3 in Orlando, Florida.

The study participants were part of a cohort called Fathers & Family, a sub-study of the Growing Up Today Study, which enrolled children of nurses in the 1990s and 2000s. All participants had completed at least two dietary questionnaires during adolescence and had children between the ages of 1-6 in 2021-2022 when they agreed to participate in a follow-up study specifically for fathers.

During adolescence, about 44% of the participants were categorized as having poor diet quality, 40% had declining diet quality and 16% had improving diet quality. In the follow-up study, researchers collected data on participants' sociodemographic factors, their child's diet, their own diet, and their approach to monitoring and managing their children's access to unhealthy foods.

According to the results, men whose diet quality had improved during adolescence were 90% more likely to model healthy eating when they became fathers and 60% more likely to monitor healthy eating in their children, compared with fathers who had a poor diet in adolescence. In addition, the children of fathers whose diet quality had improved during adolescence were significantly more likely to meet dietary recommendations for fruit and vegetable consumption compared with children whose fathers had poor or declining diet quality in adolescence.

Researchers say the findings underscore the importance of encouraging healthy eating in all demographic groups, including young people who may one day become parents.

""Healthy eating habits formed during adolescence not only benefit individuals but also shape future parenting behaviors, contributing to better nutrition for the next generation,"" said De Oliveira. ""This is especially significant given the growing concerns around childhood obesity and poor dietary habits. Investing in adolescent nutrition, including for boys, can have lasting, intergenerational benefits.""

Researchers noted that the study population was disproportionately white and well-educated, with over 90% identifying as white and over 80% having at least a bachelor's degree, which may limit the applicability of the findings in other demographic groups. In addition, the study evaluated the role of eating regular family meals during adolescence and found that it did not contribute to healthier dietary patterns later in life. However, the study did not account for the potential role of mothers' eating behaviors.

A new study that followed almost 200,000 people for several decades has found that when it comes to heart health, the quality of food consumed matters as much as following a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet. The results suggest that choosing healthy, high-quality foods is key to protecting the heart.

In the past two decades, low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets have been promoted for their potential health benefits, such as weight management and improved blood sugar and cholesterol levels. However, the impact of these diets on reducing heart disease risk has remained an ongoing debate.

We found that what you eat on low-carb or low-fat diets matters just as much as the diet itself. Healthy versions of these diets-those rich in plant-based foods and whole grains-were linked to better heart health outcomes and improved metabolic function. In contrast, low-carb and low-fat diets emphasizing unhealthy foods were associated with a higher risk of heart disease.""

Zhiyuan Wu, PhD, postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Qi Sun, MD, ScD, at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health

Wu will present the findings at NUTRITION 2025, the flagship annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition held May 31–June 3 in Orlando.

The study included 43,430 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986-2016), 64,164 women in the Nurses' Health Study (1986-2018) and 92,189 women in the Nurses' Health Study II (1991-2019). The researchers followed the nearly 200,000 study participants for several decades, tracking their dietary habits and whether they developed heart disease.

Based on information from detailed questionnaires completed by the study participants, the researchers assigned scores indicating how healthy or unhealthy their food choices were within low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets.

The researchers classified carbohydrates, fats and proteins from foods such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes as high-quality nutrients, or healthy, while carbohydrates from potatoes and refined grains as well as saturated fats and proteins from animal-based foods were categorized as low-quality, or unhealthy.

For more than 10,000 of the study participants, the researchers also measured hundreds of blood metabolites to assess how diet quality influenced their metabolic regulation. ""This approach allowed us to better understand the biological effects of these diets and strengthened our findings,"" said Wu.

The analysis showed that study participants who followed a healthy low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet had a lower risk of developing coronary heart disease, while those on unhealthy versions saw an increased risk. These healthy diet patterns, whether low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet, lowered the risk of developing heart disease by about 15%.

""Our findings suggest that improving food quality is crucial for improving heart health,"" said Wu. ""Regardless of whether someone follows a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet, emphasizing whole, minimally processed and plant-based foods and limiting refined grain, sugar and animal foods, can significantly reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.""

For those looking to improve their diet, the researchers suggest focusing on adding more whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes while cutting back on processed meats, refined carbs and sugary foods. They note that it is also important to check food labels and be mindful of added low-quality ingredients, such as added sugars in juices and processed snacks.

Moving forward, the researchers aim to explore additional factors that may influence the relationship between diet quality and heart health. For example, they want to look at how genetic factors, lifestyle choices and other metabolic markers may further shape these associations. They are also interested in how low-carbohydrate or low-fat diets may impact other health outcomes, such as type 2 diabetes and cancer. This knowledge could help tailor dietary recommendations for individuals based on their unique health profiles.

Wu will present this research at 12:45 – 1:45 p.m. EDT on Sunday, June 1, during the Nutritional Epidemiology session in the Orange County Convention Center.

In patients with an advanced type of skin cancer called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), those who received the combination of the immunotherapy drug avelumab and targeted agent cetuximab had almost four times longer median progression-free survival compared to patients who received avelumab alone, according to the results of a phase 2 trial presented today at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting and concurrently published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

It is both an honor and humbling to develop clinical trials that can be potential options for our patients. My hope is that the insights we made with this trial will lead to additional studies that can ultimately bring a new immunotherapy-based combination into standard of care for patients with advanced cSCC.""

Dan Zandberg, M.D., lead author and study chair for the trial, associate professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh and medical oncology co-leader of the head and neck cancer program at UPMC Hillman Cancer Center

cSCC is a common type of skin cancer with about 1.8 million cases diagnosed in the U.S. each year. About 95% of cSCCs are detected early and can be treated with minor surgery. But in rare cases, patients will go on to develop advanced cSCC, which includes locally advanced tumors that cannot be surgically removed and metastatic disease. At this point, the prognosis is poor and treatment is focused on extending survival, not cure.

Zandberg developed the Alliance A091802 (NCT03944941) phase 2 trial in collaboration with the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology through the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) National Clinical Trials Network.

This trial, which was open nationwide, included 57 patients with advanced cSCC. UPMC Hillman was the leading site for patient recruitment, with some of those patients recruited and treated at its network of more than 70 community cancer centers.

Twenty-nine patients received avelumab and cetuximab and 28 received avelumab alone. Because the trial had a crossover design, nine patients in the avelumab group whose cancer progressed switched to the combination group.

Avelumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor drug that targets a protein found on cancer cells called PD-L1. When PD-L1 binds to a receptor on T cells called PD-1, it acts like a brake, slowing down the cancer-killing activity of T cells. Avelumab and other anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies release those brakes.

Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), a protein that plays a critical role in tumor cell growth, proliferation and survival and which is often found in high levels on cSCC cells. It activates natural killer cells, which help fight tumors, and can also activate dendritic cells, which can then stimulate T cells. Previous research done at UPMC Hillman by Robert Ferris, M.D., Ph.D. and his lab helped reveal cetuximab's effect on the immune system.

""The rationale for the combination is that avelumab and other anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies have been shown to take the foot off the brake of the immune system, while cetuximab is pressing on the gas pedal - trying to work together to make the immune system go faster and attack the tumor,"" said Zandberg. ""What's exciting is that in this trial the efficacy of the combination suggests that the two drugs were synergistic, rather than just additive.""

The study showed that the primary endpoint of progression-free survival was significantly higher in patients who received avelumab plus cetuximab with a median of 11 months compared to just 3 months in patients who received avelumab alone.

Even though avelumab and cetuximab led to an almost quadrupling of median progression-free survival compared to avelumab alone, the trial does not support this combination as a standard treatment for patients. That's because since the trial was launched, two other anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies - cemiplimab and pembrolizumab - have been approved and had higher efficacy than avelumab in trials in patients with cSCC.

However, the trial represents the first completed prospective randomized comparison of cetuximab plus blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway versus blockade of that pathway alone in cSCC or head and neck cancer, where this combination has also shown promise. The trial provides valuable information for future trials.

""These findings highlight the potential benefits of combining cetuximab with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and points to the importance of additional clinical trials combining either standard of care pembrolizumab or cemiplimab with cetuximab as a potential way to improve patient outcomes in advanced cSCC,"" said Zandberg.

Notably, patients in the crossover arm had a similar progression-free survival to those who received the combination from the start. Currently, if a patient fails immunotherapy with pembrolizumab or cemiplimab, they switch to cetuximab or chemotherapy. But this trial suggests that continuing immunotherapy and adding cetuximab could be more beneficial.

Olympics

Many of the faces were different for the Americans, but they still secured their fourth victory at Allianz since 2019.

By Cassidy Hettesheimer

The United States women's soccer team's 3-0 victory over China at Allianz Field on Saturday marked a year, minus a day, since coach Emma Hayes took to the sidelines for her first game with the four-time Women's World Cup champions.

It also marked 361 days since the team played Hayes' second game in charge at Allianz last June, a 3-0 victory over South Korea, prepping for the Paris Olympics.

In the whirlwind span since, Hayes led a young American squad to a gold medal in France. There, the Englishwoman had the chance to sit down and swap experiences with Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve, who was leading the U.S. women's basketball team to its 10th gold medal.

On Tuesday, the pair connected again at the Lynx's home victory over Seattle. Hayes and a group of U.S. players crowded into the WNBA team's locker room at Target Center postgame to watch Reeve speak to the team.

“That was an awesome experience to watch another coach, high-level coach, in action,” Hayes said. And also, in the stands, “I jumped so high to grab [a] T-shirt.”

Hayes faced a different challenge in the national team's fourth trip to Allianz — no longer racing against the clock of prepping for the Olympics, but instead using summer friendlies to puzzle out the long-term runway ahead of the 2027 World Cup.

That meant, on Saturday, the U.S. could introduce a few new faces, work regular stars back from injury and test out new combinations of familiar veterans.

In the 28th minute, one of those new faces helped the Americans break through China's unusually-high defensive back line. Michelle Cooper, a 22-year-old forward playing in her fifth game with the national team, slotted a pass from the right side of the field into the 6-yard box. After Alyssa Thompson's initial shot was blocked, Cat Macario tapped the ball across the goal line.

Macario's game-opener was her 11th international goal, and her third in 2025 following a two-year journey coming back from a torn anterior cruciate ligament, which forced her to miss the Paris Olympics.

“What I've been trying to achieve the most since January, it's just to find some consistency,” said Macario, who overlapped with Hayes when Hayes coached Chelsea. “Even if I don't have my best game, per se, then [Hayes] knows that I can contribute to the team in different ways.”

For instance — teeing up midfielder Sam Coffey's goal seven minutes later. Thompson cut up the right sideline and found Macario near the penalty spot, who laid off the ball for Coffey's bending finish.

Captain Lindsey Heaps (née Horan) added a third goal in the 54th minute, flicking on a pass to Cooper, who dashed up that same right touchline and served another cross to Heaps' head.

“We're still a young team in making those connections,” Cooper said. “But it's good to know that only a couple camps in, we're able to hit these passes, hit the runs in behind.”

In the 70th minute, 32-year-old midfielder Lo'eau LaBonta made history, subbing on and becoming the oldest player to debut for the U.S. national team — bucking the team's recent youth shift. Hayes said she has been scouting for new players in film of every National Women's Soccer League match, where LaBonta captains the league-leading Kansas City Current.

“My quote has been, ‘Be stubborn in the most positive way possible,' ” LaBonta said. “Look where I am now, 32, getting my first call-up.”

Phallon Tullis-Joyce recorded her second, if quiet, shutout, in as many appearances for the United States, facing only two shots on goal. The 28-year-old Manchester United goalkeeper — who doubles as a marine biologist and excitedly said she made multiple trips down to “gawk” at the Mississippi River during the week — is part of Hayes' wide pool of potential successors to retired No. 1 Alyssa Naeher in net.

Several U.S. regulars missed this friendly, and will also miss the team's next game against Jamaica in St. Louis on Tuesday. Forwards Sophia Wilson and Mallory Swanson are both pregnant, and Trinity Rodman (back) and Rose Lavelle (ankle) are working back from injuries — though center back Naomi Girma featured for the United States for the first time in 2025, coming back from a calf injury.

ST. PAUL, Minn. (May 31, 2025)  — The U.S. Women's National Team cruised to a 3-0 victory over China PR to open the summer slate of games as Catarina Macario and Sam Coffey scored in the first half and Lindsey Heaps added a goal in the second.

Macario scored the first goal of the match in the 28th minute following a wild sequence inside the six-yard box. Winger Michelle Cooper sent a cross into the penalty area on the ground and toward a crashing Alyssa Thompson, but a Chinese defender managed to body her off from connecting with the cross. While on the ground right in front of the net, Thompson tried to kick the ball toward the goal, but it was deflected by a defender and Macario ran it down at the far post before finishing with a tap in from close range into the left side of the goal.

It was Macario's 11th career goal and third of 2025, making her the USWNT's leading scorer this year. Macario, who started at center forward, is on the upswing after coming back from injuries that kept her away from the National Team for about two years.

Midfielder Sam Coffey scored minutes later to extend the lead off a pass from Macario. It wasCoffey's second international goal, both of which have come against the same opponent. Coffey's first goal for the USWNT came in the team's most recent game against China in December 2023. Macario's assist was the fifth of her National Team career. Macario has contributed to at least one goal in eight of her last nine starts for the U.S.

Team captain Heaps netted the third goal with a header in the 54th minute off a pinpoint cross fromCooper, who earned her first career assist in international play. Like Coffey, Heaps also scored in the USWNT's last match against China.

The Americans dominated the match against a Chinese side that played a high line for most of the match, one which was repeatedly breached by the speedy U.S. wingers, and in the end, the scoreline flattered the Chinese a bit, although the long-time Asian power showed grit and skill throughout the 90 minutes. The USA ended up outshooting China 18-4 and7-2 for shots on goal.

Next up, the USWNT travels to St. Louis, Mo., to face Jamaica at Energizer Park on Tuesday, June 3 (Energizer Park in St. Louis on Tuesday, June 3 (7 p.m. CT / 8 p.m. ET on TNT, Max, Universo and Peacock in Spanish and Westwood One Sports on radio). 

USA — Catarina Macario, 28th minute: Catarina Macario broke the deadlock about halfway through the first half after Michelle Cooper got the U.S. in scoring position with a promising cross from the right wing. Alyssa Thompson got to the ball first as she slid to the ground. She couldn't turn it on goal but kept the ball alive inside the six-yard box. Thompson swung at the ball from the ground and it hit a Chinese defender before rolling to the left side of the goal. It was only a matter of who would reach it first, Thompson or Macario, and it was Macario who tapped it home.

USA — Sam Coffey (Catarina Macario), 35th minute: Alyssa Thompson was the creator of this scoring chance by racingpast her defender into the right side of the penalty area and playing a pass on the ground to Macario, who took a deft touch, and then played a square pass to Coffey who spun her left-footed shot into the upper left corner from around the penalty spot.

USA — Lindsey Heaps (Michelle Cooper), 54th minute: The third goal came off a classic Lindsey Heaps header off a perfect cross from the right wing from Cooper. Heaps headed the ball back across the goal, nailing the ‘keepers' cleats into the ground for her 38th career goal, which tied Mallory Swanson for 16th on the all-time scoring list.

NWSL

ST. PAUL, Minn. — Compared to the past few windows, Saturday's 3-0 win over China was a game where the U.S. women's national team looked in complete control.

The attack kept the pressure on China at Allianz Field in St. Paul, Minnesota, continuing to threaten their defense as it frequently adjusted the height of its line of confrontation. Catarina Macario provided a goal and an assist; Lindsey Heaps and Sam Coffey scored from their midfield roles.

However, head coach Emma Hayes' post-match press conference started with a question about the long-awaited return of Naomi Girma and how the team benefited from her 90-minute shift.

“We've missed her, we really have,” Hayes said. “Just in terms of the way we control the game; her, in a deeper space, just making decisions when to play forward, when not to.”

As the first million-dollar transfer in women's soccer history, this year has only intensified the scrutiny that comes with being one of the world's best players in her position. Her time at Chelsea was not as smooth as the club and player had hoped. She exited her debut in early March with a calf injury, feeling the strain having gone nearly four months without playing a club match. Her first minutes back with Chelsea came in mid-April and this international window marked her first with the U.S. in 2025.

“I gave her a hug after the game,” said midfielder Coffey, who scored her second U.S. goal against China. “Having her on the field is like having a security blanket, and just like being wrapped in it.”

After some tense and at times disjointed performances against Japan in the SheBelieves Cup and Brazil in a pair of friendlies, the USWNT dominated the entire match on Saturday. The defense played its part, with Coffey shuttling around to shield the back-line and the partnership between Girma and Emily Sonnett giving goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce ample coverage whenever China reached the final third.

Those threats were few and far between. The USWNT dominated the chance-creation game, generating 3.01 expected goals (xG) while holding China to 0.18 xG.

“It does feel natural now,” Girma said of returning to the national team. “I mean, I was able to watch what we did before, and I think a lot of what Emma wants to do is layer on what we had done in the past year. I think the changes are good and easy for me to kind of adapt to, with that base knowledge of how we want to play.

“It was just nice to be back on the field.”

As was often the case during the triumphant run to Olympic gold last summer, Girma was at the heart of the team's build-up. She logged a staggering 138 touches, per TruMedia, 41 more than the team's second-most involved player (Avery Patterson, with the right-back notching 97 touches). Girma completed 95.3 percent of her 129 pass attempts, helping determine how the USWNT worked to break through China's defensive structure.

She also put in a defensive shift that embodied working smarter, not harder.

She was not throwing herself into many challenges, though much of that work was done well before the ball even reached the U.S. defense. Still, she was quick on mop up duty, leading the USWNT with seven ball clearances (nobody else had more than three) while winning all three ground duels and her only aerial duel.

Having her in the back-line only helped the midfield feel more confident as they engaged defensively, with peace of mind that she was in position if they failed to win the ball.

“I can't put into words what she means to this team,” Coffey said. “I think everybody sees it on the field, but off the field as well. She's just a joy in this environment and such a light for us. We have missed her so much. I thought she was exceptional today, as she always is.”

In a year characterized by frequent rotation across Hayes' squads and lineups, Girma's return represents a different type of variable for the team. Throughout 2025, Hayes has called on a number of center-backs, each auditioning to be Girma's primary partner. Sonnett represents a vital holdover from the team's last World Cup win in 2019, having established herself as a hard-nosed veteran along the back-line. Emily Sams came off the bench against China, while Tara McKeown has earned five caps this year.

The latter two in particular are emblematic of Hayes' examination of her broader player pool, with both stepping into more important roles given positional absences. Not only has Girma been missing, but so has her partner last summer, Tierna Davidson, who tore her ACL in April.

While Sams, McKeown, Sonnett and others have stepped into their roles, none can quite match the same comfortable benchmark established by Girma.

“I mean, she's a world-class player,” Hayes said. “I thought she brought something to our performance that we're looking for, so I'm delighted to have her back.”

Once she returned to playing regular minutes for Chelsea in mid-April, she was eased back into the fold. While Chelsea kept clean sheets in each of her final four performances of the WSL season, only two of those matches saw Girma play all 90 minutes.

“It was a lot of transition for me,” Girma said on Friday regarding her first months with Chelsea. “I think it was a huge learning experience for me. You always have those moments in your career where you're up and down, up and down, up and down, so it was definitely like that.

“But I think it was a good five months of getting settled, getting to know my team-mates, getting used to playing there, playing with a new team, and living in a new country. So it's been really positive so far, and I've really enjoyed it.”

Girma logged her 46th cap, an impressive total for a 24-year-old defender who seems destined to be the bedrock of this team for years to come. With its world class center-back in the lineup, the United States put together its most composed performance of the year. Then again, that revelation hardly comes as a surprise given Girma's floor-raising performances since her debut in 2022.

Kansas City captain Lo'eau LaBonta reacts to her first ever senior call-up to the USWNT at 32 years old. (1:33)

Lo'eau LaBonta became the oldest player to debut in the United States women's national team's 40-year history on Saturday when she entered the match in the 70th minute of her team's 3-0 win over China.

LaBonta is 32 years and 74 days old. She has a decade of professional experience as a box-to-box midfielder in the NWSL, but it didn't earn her a USWNT call-up until earlier this month.

""You have to have a short-term memory, whether it's wins or losses,"" LaBonta told TBS after her international debut on Saturday.

""And when there's a loss, you let it sink in, but you learn from it, and you move on. And that's what I've done with every obstacle in my life. And you know me, I'm always joking around in the locker room, and I try and do everything with a smile, but I'm out here grinding, and I think eventually Momma Em [USWNT head coach Emma Hayes] called me in and let's go.""

Midfielder McCall Zerboni set the previous USWNT record for oldest debut in 2017 when she debuted just before her 31st birthday.

LaBonta is the captain of the NWSL's Kansas City Current and was a significant contributor to the team's record-breaking attack in 2024, as well as Kansas City's place atop the NWSL table near the halfway point of this season.

She has three goals in 10 games for the league-leading Current this season. She registered six goals and one assist last year in 24 games for the Current, who set an NWSL record with 57 goals scored.

""I know that a lot has been made about [LaBonta's age], but again, I watch the league,"" Hayes said after Saturday's match. ""I watch every game, and she was a player who didn't give up on herself, and she also made sure her performances remained high, even when she didn't get the shout for the national team. I think that should serve as a great reminder to everyone.

""I think her maturity you could see was there. She's confident to not only come in the game, but offered nice supporting role alongside Sam [Coffey]. I think her experience in camp has been really helpful, and I'm looking forward to seeing more of her.""

Hayes revealed last week that she and her staff ""agonized"" over whether to bring LaBonta to the Olympics as an alternate last year.

LaBonta completed all 10 of her pass attempts on Saturday, according to ESPN Research.

LaBonta received call-ups to U.S. youth national teams beginning in 2007 but had not made it to the senior level prior to this training camp.

She is the second player of Hawaiian heritage to earn a USWNT call-up, per U.S. Soccer. Natasha Kai, a 2008 Olympic gold-medal winner, was the first. LaBonta told ESPN's Futbol W earlier this month that she was a ball girl for a USWNT game in Los Angeles when Kai was a player, and Kai gave LaBonta an autographed cleat after learning she was also Hawaiian.

""It's a dream come true,"" LaBonta told ESPN's Futbol W about her first USWNT call-up.

""If you're a professional soccer player -- or even if you're a soccer player in general -- it is always your dream to play on the U.S. women's national team. I've had this dream for over 20 years now.

""So, to finally get the call, I had to pinch myself. I was like, 'It can't be real because this whole year they've been calling in the youth, the young guns and here I am getting this call-up.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Gotham FC's Jaelin Howell talks about the impact of playing alongside USWNT veteran Emily Sonnett. (1:08)

How much can you learn from a match in which the opponent perfectly plays to your strengths?

United States women's national team head coach Emma Hayes must mull that context as she analyzes her team's 3-0 win over China on Saturday.

Hayes has been operating a carousel of new and inexperienced players to identify the group she will develop on the road to the 2027 Women's World Cup. She sought clarity at the wide forwards role ahead of this training camp -- and she ostensibly got answers on Saturday.

Forwards Alyssa Thompson and Michelle Cooper were electric on Saturday as the USWNT's starting wingers who terrorized China's defense. Each player registered an assist and frequently got into space behind to be the catalyst of the USWNT's attack. China may have had its own development reasons to play a higher line, which gave Saturday's game the feeling of two teams playing around rather than against each other.

But Hayes now has further confirmation that both Thompson and Cooper are part of the solution as she narrows down her team heading into the summer. What's more important is that Saturday's performance, combined with recent outings, shows that the USWNT has depth in a winger position and area of the field that has long been integral to its dominance.

If the Americans want to win the 2027 World Cup, they'll need to be excellent in those wide areas. The self-proclaimed ""Triple Espresso"" of Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Wilson scored 10 of the USWNT's 12 goals on the Americans' Olympic gold-medal run last year. The dominance of Rodman and Swanson in those wide areas at last year's Olympics carried on the team's strength from its World Cup title in 2019, when Megan Rapinoe, Tobin Heath and Christen Press were ruthless wide forwards.

But except for a brief appearance by Rodman in April, all three of the Triple Espresso have been absent from the team since that gold-medal game last August. Swanson and Wilson are on maternity leave and Rodman has been sidelined for over a month with a chronic back issue. Hayes needs solutions beyond just this camp.

On Saturday, Thompson and Cooper salivated from the opening whistle as China -- by some surprise -- applied high pressure on the USWNT and held an increasingly high defensive line. It was a situation ripe for the Americans to exploit, and they did exactly that. Thompson assisted Catarina Macario's opening goal (after nearly scoring it herself). Thompson also made the darting diagonal run and then served the cross that led to the USWNT's second goal. Cooper consistently utilized the space behind China's defense to serve dangerous crosses, and she assisted Lindsey Heaps' goal for the third USWNT tally.

""We wanted to be a bit more dynamic in our rotation, so the timing of those rotations to pull their wide player out, I thought in the first half, we did that really, really well,"" Hayes said. ""What we didn't do as well as we wanted to was we tried to find the spaces in between when actually the space was in behind. So, sometimes we overplayed. And actually, if they want to give us [those] areas, then we take [those] areas.""

Thompson, who at 20 years old already has World Cup experience, has emerged as a long-term answer since her resurgence in form last fall after missing out on the Olympics. She has been one of the best American players in the NWSL since September, which has led her to become a consistent winger for the USWNT.

At minimum, Thompson continues to look like both a short- and long-term answer for the USWNT. Her form for club and country makes her a deserved starter for Hayes. Cooper is a less proven entity at the international level -- Saturday was only her fifth cap -- but as Hayes said after the match, ""she's growing into the shirt.""

Add in the versatile Ally Sentnor, among other emerging talents -- Gisele Thompson was supposed to trial as a winger, but left camp injured -- and the USWNT is getting back to its days of forwards who can dominate games in wide areas. That was sorely missed at the 2023 World Cup, where the team crashed out in the Round of 16.

None of which is to say that Rodman, Swanson and Wilson won't be part of the 2027 World Cup picture at 23, 27 and 24 years old, respectively. But the USWNT needs depth -- and it needs to use this formative time to shape its identity before games start to count again, like at qualifying next year. While 2027 feels like a long time away, there are only about a dozen more international windows until the next World Cup.

So, yes, it would be wise not to draw too definitive of a conclusion from Saturday's result. China rightfully played like a team trying to learn a hard lesson about itself rather than win a friendly.

Hayes, however, has said frequently that she can't change the fact that she can only work with the amount of time that she has. And on Saturday, she said she wasn't going to take anything away from a victory that should have provided her with more affirmative answers about who she can rely on.

""I always say it's one of those real terrible curses with women, where they are always so extremely hard on themselves,"" Hayes said. ""So, I'm not going to do that today. I'm going to make sure I keep lifting my team spirits, because they're such a tremendous bunch, and they do so much to represent the badge in the way they do. And today, I thought they were tremendous at what I'd asked them to do.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Naomi Girma returned to the national team and Lo'eau LaBonta became the oldest player to make her international debut for the U.S. in a 3-0 win over China on Saturday.

Catarina Macario, Sam Coffey and Lindsey Heaps scored while goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce got her second shutout in as many appearances.

LaBonta, the 32-year-old midfielder for the Kansas City Current in the National Women's Soccer League, came on as a second-half substitute.

The match also marked Girma's first appearance for the national team this year. The 24-year-old defender has been nursing injuries but recently returned to help Chelsea win the Women's Super League title and the FA Cup.

Girma commanded a record $1.1 transfer fee when she moved from the San Diego Wave to Chelsea earlier this year.

Tullis-Joyce, who plays for Manchester United, started in goal in just her second U.S. appearance as coach Emma Hayes looks to replace goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher, who retired from the national team last year.

Macario scored her 11th international goal after Alyssa Thompson kept the ball alive in a tumble in front of the net in the 28th minute.

Coffey made it 2-0 in the 35th minute, taking a pass from Macario out front and banging her second goal for the U.S. past goalkeeper Pan Hongyan with her left foot.

Heaps, the U.S. captain, scored on a header in the 54th minute.

Chelsea's final FIFA Club World Cup opponent has now been confirmed as LAFC, the last team to join this summer's tournament less than two weeks before it begins.

The group stage took place on December 5, 2024. All 32 qualifiers had been decided at that time, but Mexican side Club León were later removed from the competition.

FIFA's Appeal Committee viewed León, 2023 CONCACAF Champions League winners, to have broken multi-club ownership regulations on account as having the same owners as Pachuca, who later qualified themselves as 2024's CONCACAF champions.

It left a hole in Group D, alongside Chelsea, Espérance de Tunis and Flamengo, that needed filling.

Although plenty of clubs—Costa Rica's Alajuelense were the original objectors to report the multi-club issue to the Court of Arbitration for Sport—laid claim to the open space, the resolution was a one-off ‘play-in' match between LAFC and Club América.

LAFC earned their place in the extraordinary qualifier due to being the team that León beat in the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League final. Liga MX's América, meanwhile, were top of the CONCACAF club rankings at the conclusion of the 2024 Champions Cup.

The game was played in Los Angeles on Saturday night (local time) and the hosts secured a 2-1 win—and their place, albeit at very short notice, at the Club World Cup.

América looked as they would claim a 1–0 victory thanks to a goal from Uruguay international Brian Rodríguez midway through the second half. But Igor Jesus forced extra-time with an 89th minute equaliser, before Denis Bouanga then won it for LAFC in the 115th minute.

Chelsea against LAFC in the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta will now be Group D's first match on June 16. The Blues, qualifiers by virtue of their UEFA Champions League triumph in 2021, will then face Flamengo and Espérance on June 20 and 24 respectively.

Of the 32 tickets to the FIFA 2025 Club World Cup, three belong to Major League Soccer teams.

LAFC ensured that Saturday night, with goals from Igor Jesus and Denis Bouanga completing an epic 2-1 comeback over Mexican powerhouse Club América at BMO Stadium.

By winning the play-in match, LAFC join Inter Miami CF (host nation spot) and Seattle Sounders FC (2022 Concacaf Champions Cup winners) at this summer's Club World Cup.

They'll all receive $9.55 million for participating in the marquee tournament, which is held from June 14 to July 13 across the United States, and can net additional prize money depending on results.

At the Club World Cup, the top two teams per group advance to the knockout phase. All games are streamed on DAZN.

How they qualified: LAFC beat Club América in a playoff match after fellow LIGA MX side Club León were disqualified from the Club World Cup due to FIFA's multi-club ownership rules.

Schedule: Denis Bouanga and the Black & Gold visit three different stadiums in Group D, setting up shop in the southeast United States.

LAFC first encounter English Premier League foe Chelsea, who won the 2025 UEFA Conference League. They'll then pivot to facing ES Tunis (Tunisia) and Flamengo (Brazil).

How they qualified: Inter Miami were awarded the host country spot after winning the 2024 MLS Supporters' Shield and setting the league's single-season points record (74 points; 2.18 ppg).

Schedule: Led by  Lionel Messi, the Herons begin the Club World Cup with a standalone Group A match.

After Egyptian powerhouse Al Ahly, Inter Miami will meet Portuguese titans FC Porto before concluding group play against Brazilian giants Palmeiras.

Shaka Hislop believes Inter Miami need to perform at the Club World Cup to avoid an ""embarrassment"" for the MLS. (0:54)

LOS ANGELES -- Most MLS organizations would state that they have ambitions of maintaining a global reach. Indeed, two years before even kicking a ball in its 2018 debut, front office members at LAFC were already tossing around the aspirations of being a ""global brand,"" which would have been fair to take with a pinch of salt at that moment. Yet, less than decade after those comments and just seven years since its inaugural season, the 2022 MLS Cup champions and two-time Supporters' Shield winners have punched a ticket to the 2025 Club World Cup.

Thanks to a dramatic extra-time winner from Denis Bouanga, which sealed a 2-1 comeback victory against Liga MX giants Club America in Saturday's playoff, LAFC now seems primed to begin following through on its far-reaching goals. The result not only guarantees an eye-catching $9.55 million entry prize for the Club World Cup, which kicks off on June 14 and has total prize money of $1 billion at stake, but also the opportunity to elevate the club's status in the 32-team competition alongside fellow MLS sides Inter Miami and the Seattle Sounders.

""As a club, I think it puts you above and beyond many, many other clubs in the MLS. I think it puts you in a different level,"" LAFC head coach Steve Cherundolo, who has announced he will leave the team after the current season, said after the game. ""It is also a help for the entire league; putting the league on the map at the Club World Cup with one more team.""

The reason why LAFC and Club America were given an opportunity to seal the final spot at the event being held across the United States this summer was because FIFA expelled Liga MX's Club Leon due to multi-ownership rules. Leon had qualified as winners of the 2023 Concacaf Champions League, so LAFC booked their spot in the playoff as runners-up in that tournament, while Club America got theirs ""as the top-ranked team in the FIFA Club World Cup confederation ranking through which qualification is also determined.""

But, in truly Hollywood fashion, overcoming Club America wasn't easy for Cherundolo and company. After all, the Mexican side's XI, arguably the best in all of Concacaf, had a market value of $67.3 million (via SofaScore); LAFC's was just $29.3 million.

And while technically a home game for LAFC at a sold-out 22,000 capacity BMO Stadium, the hostile setting saw the MLS team treated as visitors on their own turf. Liga MX's powerhouse clubs have significant fanbases which greatly outnumber those of MLS on either side of the U.S.-Mexico border, so Club America soared into the stadium on a sea of yellow support that obscured the usual black-and-gold decor.

The night before, hundreds of die-hard aficionados had serenaded Mexico's most-successful club with music, fireworks and banners outside of their Los Angeles hotel. And, once the game kicked off, the travelling support made their presence known with intimidating smoke bombs and booming songs that surpassed those from LAFC's ""3252"" group.

That early pressure was rewarded as Las Aguilas flexed their strength on the pitch with an opening goal from the penalty spot as former LAFC plater Brian Rodríguez struck home in the 64th minute after Mark Delgado had fouled Érick Sánchez. But, with star striker Olivier Giroud arriving off the bench, LAFC began to gather some momentum. Peppering the goal with chances, Bouanga then stepped up with an assist off a corner for Igor Jesus to head an 89th-minute equalizer that sent the playoff into extra time.

""You come alive a little bit when you're down and there's a lot on the line, but our response was incredible; physically, tactically and mentally,"" Cherundolo said. ""I think from what we can change as coaches, how we sub in, the moments you sub in, I think that was also very important to change the momentum and trajectory of the game to help our team.""

LAFC's fans were rejuvenated in the stands and, once in extra time, it was Bouanga who once again took charge with the game winner from a deflected close-range shot in the 115th minute to secure the victory and that Club World Cup invitation.

""You need to see Denis day in and day out. Denis is a competitor, loves to win, loves to compete, thrives on duels, thrives on moments that he creates,"" Cherundolo said. ""His competitiveness, I think it gets a little underrated.""

Bouanga and his teammates will now have a chance to shine on the biggest stage this summer and it will be another fascinating litmus test for a growing side as they face Flamengo, Esperance de Tunis, and Chelsea in Group D.

Before trying to secure global domination, however, there are two MLS home games against Sporting Kansas City and Toronto FC to come before their clash with Chelsea on June 16. ""Our next opponent is Kansas City, so that's where my head is,"" Cherundolo said. ""But I don't think it's any secret to say for us to beat those teams [at the CWC], we need to play perfectly.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

The new Club World Cup will get underway on June 14, kicking off a busy summer of football for the 32 teams involved. 

Taking place in the United States, the new-look tournament also means that an extra transfer window will be in place. 

Sanctioned at the behest of FIFA, the window will open early from June 1 to June 10. 

This is to allow teams competing in the tournament to add extra strength in depth, meaning we could see clubs act earlier than usual in the market. 

So, why exactly is there an extra transfer window, why is it split and when is the Club World Cup kicking off? 

Read on below for everything you need to know about the extra transfer window set to be in place this summer.  

There is typically one only one summer transfer window for European clubs, which usually opens at the end of June or beginning of July. 

However, this time around, FIFA has changed its usual rules to allow clubs competing in the newly-revamped Club World Cup to sign players for the tournament.

A FIFA statement on the new window reads: 'Member associations of clubs participating in the competition shall have the possibility to establish an exceptional additional registration period from June 1-10, 2025. 

'For the avoidance of doubt, no member association is obliged to establish such an exceptional additional registration period.'

To avoid giving an unfair advantage to teams in the tournament, the extra transfer window is open to all clubs, not just those involved in the Club World Cup.

After closing on June, the transfer window will remain shut for six days, until June 16, for Premier League teams.

Page 267 of the 2024-25 season handbook states that the summer window must open 'at midnight on the date 12 weeks prior to the date on which it is to conclude'.

League rules say the summer window must be a maximum of 12 weeks, while the winter window can be longer than four weeks.

The early window in place for the Club World Cup is considered as an exceptional registration period, making it separate from the handbook's usual advice.

The new-look Club World Cup will begin on Saturday June 14 and finish nearly a month later on Sunday July 13. 

The tournament will be held at various venues across the United States and involve the likes of Chelsea, Manchester City, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and PSG. 

While the competition may be viewed as an after-thought by some fans, it comes with a lucrative award - as the winners of the tournament will receive up to £97million ($125million) from FIFA.

A £774million ($1billion) will be shared between the 32 clubs - in addition to a £406million ($525million) participation fee shared based on sporting and commercial criteria, with a further £368million ($475million) shared based on sporting performance.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"

Lionel Messi and Inter Miami CF are heating up. And right on cue.

In their final match before next month's FIFA Club World Cup, Messi and the Herons delivered a dominant 5-1 home rout of the Columbus Crew.

The legendary Argentine No. 10 put in a 2g/3a performance on Saturday night, rivaling his remarkable 1g/5a output from a 6-2 win over the New York Red Bulls last year to enter the MLS record books.

Messi became just the second player in league history to record at least five goal contributions twice in a regular-season match, equalling the Crew's Diego Rossi, who accomplished the feat with LAFC.

In addition to his brace, the reigning Landon Donovan MLS MVP played helper on goals from Tadeo Allende, Luis Suárez and Fafà Picault to extend Miami's unbeaten run to three straight games (2W-0L-1D).

""Clearly, he's the best player in history to play this sport,"" head coach Javier Mascherano told reporters of Messi, who has 5g/4a during this three-game stretch. ""And we have to understand that when he's not excelling too much, it's because some of us are failing. That's the reality.""

""... That's the admiration: seeing someone else do what you can't do. You want to, but you can't.""

The second player in MLS history to twice register 5+ goal contributions in a single game.Messi things. 🐐 pic.twitter.com/30Ik15Ozvj

Messi and Miami's improved run of form comes after a rough stretch in which the Herons managed just one win in eight games across all competitions since their previous showdown against the Crew: a 1-0 victory on April 19 at Cleveland's Huntington Bank Field.

“Of course winning like this, in this manner, does give us confidence,” said Mascherano. “It shows us that if we are brave, if we remain calm, if we have the desire to compete, we can match up toe-to-toe with anyone – especially in MLS.""

As for the Club World Cup, which Miami will officially kick off against Egyptian side Al Ahly on June 14 in the tournament's opening match, the Argentine manager was far more cautious.

""The Club World Cup? That is a different story,"" Mascherano said.

What a night so far ✨ pic.twitter.com/AA0g5QWXe4

Mascherano, himself a two-time Club World Cup winner, is not looking beyond the inaugural game.

The new-look FIFA Club World Cup is fast approaching, with the tournament set to kick off on June 14, 2025.

After a two-year hiatus, the competition is back—and bigger and better than ever. This time, 32 teams (up from the usual seven) will battle it out not just for a brand-new trophy and global bragging rights, but for a share of an expanded $1 billion prize pool.

The revamped format means more clubs from every corner of the globe now have the chance to compete—a move FIFA hopes will not only boost global viewership, but also make the tournament one of the most competitive in world football.

Here's everything you need to know about who has qualified for the 2025 Club World Cup—and how they made it.

Teams from all six of world soccer's governing confederations—UEFA (Europe), CONMEBOL (South America), AFC (Asia), CAF (Africa), Concacaf (North & Central America), and OFC (Oceania)—will be represented at the expanded 2025 Club World Cup.

The number of slots awarded to each confederation is based on historical strength and competitive balance:

For both UEFA and CONMEBOL, qualification is based on performances in their premier club competitions—the UEFA Champions League and the Copa Libertadores—over the past four seasons. Each year's winner secures an automatic spot, with the remaining places going to the highest-performing teams in that time frame who haven't already qualified.

These three regions follow a more straightforward system: the winners of the last four editions of each continent's top club competition (the AFC Champions League, CAF Champions League, and Concacaf Champions Cup) earn a spot. There is an exception this year, however, which we will touch on later.

Given that Oceania has only one place, the highest-ranked team among the last four OFC Champions League winners—based on FIFA's club performance criteria—gets the nod.

In the event of a club winning its confederation's competition more than once during the qualifying period, the vacant spot is passed down to the next highest-ranked club that hasn't already secured qualification. Rankings are determined using a point system that rewards clubs for wins and deeper runs in their respective tournaments over the past four years.

Denis Bouanga scored late in extra time and LAFC dramatically secured the final spot in the FIFA Club World Cup with a 2-1 victory over Club América in a play-in match Saturday night at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles.

Igor Jesus tied it for LAFC in the 89th minute, slipping through traffic and converting a header for his first goal with his new club.

After 24 tense minutes of extra time, Bouanga jumped into the play and fired home a deflected shot from the top of the penalty area in the 115th minute, setting off a wild celebration and sending LAFC to its first Club World Cup.

LAFC will join English club Chelsea, Brazil's Flamengo and Tunisia's ES Tunis when group play begins in two weeks across the U.S. South.

""[This] probably is the best performance of the season, even though there were mistakes made,"" LAFC head coach Steve Cherundolo said. ""But I think to be able to go down and to come back and to score and always be dangerous, and to manage the game like we did...It means to us as a group, first and foremost, the players, coaches, an enormous amount of togetherness.""

""As a club, I think it puts you above and beyond many, many other clubs in the MLS, I think it puts you in a different level, and it is also a help for the entire league, of putting the league on the map at the Club World Cup with one more team.""

LAFC's victory is extraordinarily lucrative for the Major League Soccer power, guaranteeing at least $9.55 million in prize money for making the tournament field. The club also has a chance at nearly $100 million more in prize money from FIFA's nearly $1 billion pool.

Brian Rodríguez put América ahead midway through the second half by converting a penalty kick against his former team, but Las Águilas fell short in front of thousands of supporters.

One spot in the 32-team Club World Cup was open because FIFA disqualified León under its rules against participation by multiple clubs owned by the same entity. León and Pachuca are owned by the same group, and León lost its appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport four weeks ago after attempting to change its ownership structure.

With a stadium full of raucous fans supporting both teams, LAFC and América were cautious in the first half, putting just one shot apiece on target.

Rodríguez beat Hugo Lloris from the spot in the 64th minute, capitalizing on a penalty awarded following a video review of Mark Delgado's risky, spikes-up challenge on Érick Sánchez. Rodríguez, who came on as a halftime substitute after recently recovering from injury, spent parts of four seasons with LAFC from 2019 to 2022 before the Uruguayan winger moved to América for a hefty transfer fee.

LAFC got moving offensively when Olivier Giroud came on as a second-half substitute. The French star nearly tipped home a pass in the box in the 81st minute, but Luis Malagón thwarted him. LAFC cranked up its late pressure behind Bouanga and Giroud.

Jesus, the 22-year-old Brazilian midfielder, finally beat Malagón with a header in the box.

Lloris stopped a point-blank chance for Javairo Dilrosun in the second half of extra time shortly before Bouanga's winner.

Tickets for the match were distributed equally between the clubs' supporters -- and América has a large fan base in Los Angeles, where Mexican teams and players are greeted with massive support whenever they visit. América fans mobbed the south stands at BMO Stadium 90 minutes before kickoff, while LAFC's famed North End crowd was packed.

Both sections set off fireworks and smoke bombs after kickoff, underlining the remarkable atmosphere and giving a taste of what's to come in June and July.

The largest Club World Cup will be held across the U.S. as a precursor to the FIFA World Cup's return to North America in 2026. Inter Miami and the Seattle Sounders already qualified from Major League Soccer, while Pachuca and Monterrey already qualified from Liga MX.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

LAFC have secured the final ticket to the FIFA 2025 Club World Cup, overcoming Mexican powerhouse Club América 2-1 at BMO Stadium on Saturday evening behind goals from Igor Jesus and Denis Bouanga.

Bouanga was the hero in the 115th minute, lashing his deflected shot past goalkeeper Luis Malagón to avoid penalty kicks in the playoff match between two of North America's biggest teams.

The Black & Gold sent the match to extra time in the 89th minute when Jesus nodded Bouanga's corner kick past Malagón – his first goal for the club. That negated América's 64th-minute opener after ex-LAFC winger Brian Rodríguez fired his penalty kick past Hugo Lloris.

With the win, LAFC join Inter Miami CF and Seattle Sounders FC to form an MLS trio at this summer's Club World Cup. They'll all receive $9.55 million for participating in the marquee tournament, which is held from June 14 to July 13 across the United States, and can net additional prize money depending on results.

This one-off game between LAFC and América arose after LIGA MX side Club León were disqualified from the Club World Cup due to FIFA's multi-club ownership rules.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","How West Germany won the 1954 World Cup: Herberger tactics, injured Puskas, group stage mind games?","https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6393274/2025/06/01/how-west-germany-won-world-cup-1958/","Sun, 01 Jun 2025 08:35:00 GMT","

This is the fifth in a series on The Athletic looking back at the winners of each men's World Cup. The previous four articles have looked at Uruguay in 1930, Italy in 1934 and Italy again in 1938, before Uruguay themselves won it for a second time in 1950. So it's about time someone else stepped up…

There are two clear examples in World Cup history of the most exciting team at the tournament, and the neutral's favourites, being foiled by West Germany in the final. The most obvious example is the Netherlands in 1974, but two decades beforehand, Hungary experienced almost exactly the same thing.

Advertisement

If anything, it was even more egregious because this legendary Hungary side had previously destroyed West Germany 8-3 in the group stage — a huge victory, even by the standards of a World Cup that featured a record goals-per-game tally of 5.38. At that point, there seemed little chance anyone would stop the Olympic champions Hungary, let alone the Germans.

But this was a remarkable triumph for West Germany, less than 10 years after the end of the Second World War. It was the first tournament they'd entered since then, having been banned from FIFA leading up to World Cup 1950. While overt demonstrations of nationalism had been avoided going into the tournament, the shock success (half the teams were seeded going into the tournament, and West Germany weren't among them) brought a newfound sense of national pride as West Germany rebuilt itself after the war.

A talented striker who played three times for his country, Sepp Herberger is perhaps more notable for having served in both World Wars, although according to his own testimony he was never involved in armed conflict.

In keeping with other German managers in the 20th century, he served as assistant before becoming the outright manager, leading Germany at World Cup 1938, and then having a 14-year second spell in charge from 1950 onwards.

Herberger was both a good tactician and a canny man-manager. He used to motivate his players by reading out critical press reports from back home, telling them to prove journalists wrong. He thought as much about which players should room together as he did his side's formation. He was variously depicted as both a strict disciplinarian and also an emotionally intelligent father figure to the players.

When he returned home after the tournament, he found that his home had a new address — he now lived on ‘Sepp-Herberger-Strasse'.

The WM formation was on the way out. Hungary were the poster boys for the shift away from that system. But Herberger was canny too, and his approach for that final was first and foremost based around stopping Hungary.

West Germany's formation in the final started to resemble something like the systems we would recognise in the modern era, with left-half Karl Mai performing a man-marking job on Sandor Kocsis and ending up as more defender than midfielder. Kocsis had scored 11 goals in the tournament, but was relatively quiet in the final.

The job of tracking Nandor Hidegkuti — whose drifts into deep positions had flummoxed England in Hungary's famous 6-3 win at Wembley the previous year — was handed to midfielder Horst Eckel rather than a defender.



In turn, captain Fritz Walter and Max Morlock played deep and were regularly involved in build-up play. There was an impressive level of fluidity in the side, with right-winger Helmut Rahn tending to stick to his role, but the others rotating within matches. Rahn was an explosive and unpredictable winger, somewhat out of keeping with what Herberger wanted from his players. His quality, though, was impossible to ignore and he scored twice in the final, when Herberger encouraged his players to attack down the flanks rather than through the middle.

But the most-discussed element of Herberger's tactics was his team selection for the 8-3 group stage defeat by Hungary, where he made seven changes from the opening day win over Turkey. Clearly, this was not a tactical decision in the traditional sense, and there was such anger from the hordes of travelling German supporters that some called for him to resign midway through the tournament (not an entirely unlikely concept — in this World Cup, Scotland manager Andy Beattie resigned after his side's first game, a 1-0 defeat by Austria).

What was the reason for his selection? It seems clear Herberger was resting his best players as he didn't think his side had much chance of beating Hungary. Some suspected he was also trying to engineer his side coming second in the group, to be on the easier side of the knockout stage bracket. And, once West Germany had prevailed in the final, the story became that Herberger had fielded a weakened side to lure Hungary into a false sense of security. Maybe that was the outcome, but was it really the intention?

While centre-halves had been the dominant figures in international football before the Second World War, their retreat into central defence meant the inside-forwards became the stars in the middle part of the 20th century.

This West German side was no different. Fritz Walter, whose brother Ottmar played as the side's centre-forward, was a prodigiously talented inside-left who was adored by Herberger, who gave him special treatment and handed him the captain's armband. This was despite Walter coming in for particular criticism in the years before this success, especially after a 3-1 defeat by France in 1952. He offered to retire from the national side, but Herberger insisted he remained the side's main man.

That paid off in 1954. Although criticised for his sluggishness in the group stage, he came alive in the 2-0 counter-attacking quarter-final victory over Yugoslavia, and scored two penalties in the 6-1 semi-final win against Austria. But it was about more than just goals — he was the side's creative force, roughly their equivalent of Puskas.

Advertisement

Walter had contracted malaria during his time as a prisoner of war, and found it difficult to play well in hot conditions. Most of World Cup 1954 was not to his liking, but in the final week the temperatures cooled, and the final was played on a damp day.

Walter was the first person to be awarded honorary citizenship of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate — the award has never been handed out again.

West Germany tended to come on strong in the second halves of matches. Immediately after the tournament, plenty of credit was given to cobbler-turned-entrepreneur Adi Dassler — the founder of Adidas — for designing innovative new boots featuring screw-in studs, allowing the players to choose short or long ones according to the weather, supposedly a major advantage when the conditions changed midway through the final.

But there may have been a less glamorous explanation. After the final there were reports of used syringes being found in the West Germany dressing room. The team officials insisted the players had been injected only with vitamin C, an explanation later ridiculed by medical experts, who said it would have been no more effective than eating an orange. Several players contracted jaundice in the aftermath, experienced further health problems, and many later admitted receiving injections at the tournament.

Investigations into this continued for over half a century. A 2013 report from Humboldt University suggested the syringes contained methamphetamine, as detailed further by The New York Times.

A genuinely thrilling game that featured two goals for either side in the first 20 minutes. Both continued to play good football, until the game was won in the closing minutes.

The real story was that Puskas was back in the Hungary side for the first time since getting injured against West Germany in the group phase, and despite not being fully fit, he opened the scoring with a calm finish after a loose ball in the box fell his way. Hungary quickly made it two after a terrible mix-up between left-back Werner Kohlmeyer and goalkeeper Toni Turek. But 2-0, of course, is a dangerous lead.

Morlock got one back with — it must be said — the third scrappy goal of the game, turning home a deflected cross. Then Rahn arrived at the far post to fire home a deep corner, after Hungarian goalkeeper Gyula Grosics tried to claim, but was blocked off by Hans Schafer. Grosics always claimed he was fouled, but by the standards of 1950s refereeing it's not a surprise the goal was given.

Hungary had the better chances. Hidegkuti hit the post, Kocsis headed against the bar, Turek made some fine saves, and Kohlmeyer made up for his earlier error with a couple of goal-line clearances. Comprehensive statistics aren't available, but it's fair to suspect that Hungary won on the xG.

In West Germany, the defining moment was Rahm's winner in the 84th minute, when he surprised the Hungary defence by cutting inside onto his left foot and firing into the far corner — a goal that feels very modern in this age of inverted wingers.

In Hungary, the defining moment came in the 86th minute, when Puskas squeezed home what he thought was an equaliser, only to be denied by an offside flag from Welsh linesman Sandy Griffiths. There are no clear television pictures to show whether the decision was correct.

But maybe the defining moment came in the group stage meeting between the sides, when Puskas was kicked in the ankle by German centre-back Werner Liebrich — the third time he'd attempt to foul Puskas — which meant he missed the subsequent games up until the final, when he played despite clearly being short of 100 per cent fitness.

No. The final was Hungary's only defeat in a long run of 49 matches. They'd thrashed the (second string) West Germany side 8-3 in the group stage. They'd defeated the two finalists from World Cup 1950, Brazil and Uruguay, 4-2 in the quarter-final and semi-final respectively. They'd coped for most of the tournament without Puskas, the world's best player. Throw in the doping allegations, and Hungary's loss must be considered one of football's greatest injustices.

Hungary never made it past the quarter-finals again, and on their most recent three appearances — 1978, 1982 and 1986 — didn't make it past the group stage.

The boost to West Germany shouldn't be underestimated, both in pure footballing terms and as an important moment of renewed optimism in the post-war period. Few others around the world, though, shared their joy.

The Parisians' first European Cup success proved well worth the wait, as they turned in a thrilling and record-breaking display in Munich

The 2025 Champions League final looked too close to call. Paris Saint-Germain had beaten one Premier League team after another on their way to the final, but Inter had shown remarkable reserves of resilience and no end of quality in beating Barcelona in the semis.

Consequently, an epic and, more importantly, even encounter was anticipated at the Allianz Arena on Saturday.

What we witnessed, though, was a brutal beat-down, as PSG finally claimed their first European Cup with a devastating - and record-breaking - 5-0 rout of Inter, whose famed defence was no match for Luis Enrique's wonderful array of wingers.

After one of the most closely-fought races for a number of years, Rodri came out on top in 2024, beating Vinicius Jr into second place as Real Madrid dramatically boycotted the ceremony in Paris in protest at their star player missing out.

Unfortunately for Rodri, he will be unable to defend his crown in 2025, with the Manchester City midfielder having suffered a serious knee injury in September. The door, then, ha been open for a whole host of players to succeed the Spain star, and the race for the Golden Ball provided a real rollercoaster over the course of the European campaign.

The 2024-25 season doesn't have the same international tournaments as its two predecessors, and so the destination of the Ballon d'Or will be decided solely by club performances. That opened it up to all sorts of individuals who might not share the same success with their countries as others, while there is also the prospect of the new-look Club World Cup to consider before we crown a winner on September 22 in Paris.

So, who are the favourites for the most prestigious individual prize in world football? As always, GOAL has been here every step of the way to track the contenders and the pretenders with our Ballon d'Or Power Rankings...

Jakub Mensik will return to his hometown of Prostejov this week to compete at the Unicredit Czech Open, an ATP Challenger 100 event, where the Czech has received a main draw wild card.

Mensik arrives in Prostejov following a second-round exit at Roland Garros. Prostejov marks the #NextGenATP star's second Challenger appearance of the season, having competed in Cap Cana in March as World No. 57 in the PIF ATP Rankings. 



Shortly after a semi-final showing in Cap Cana, Mensik won his maiden ATP Masters 1000 title in Miami, where he defeated his idol Novak Djokovic in the final. Mensik is now No. 19 in the PIF ATP Rankings, meaning fans in Prostejov will relish the rare opportunity to see a Top 20 player in an intimate Challenger setting.

The 19-year-old's lone Challenger title came in his home country in 2023, when he won the Prague Challenger, which was just his sixth outing at that level.

Alejandro Tabilo also accepted a wild card into Prostejov. The Chilean is seeded second.

Carlos Alcaraz offered a standout moment of sportsmanship on Sunday during his fourth-round match against Ben Shelton at Roland Garros, where he called a foul on himself at a crucial moment at the start of the second set.

Serving at 7-6(8), 0-0, 30/30, the defending champion approached the net off a forehand and placed a volley into the open court. Shelton scrambled and fired a powerful crosscourt forehand, forcing Alcaraz to stretch fully for the reply. The Spaniard managed to make contact and appeared to hit a clean volley winner.

The point was initially awarded to Alcaraz, but the 22-year-old immediately alerted the umpire that he had lost his grip on the racquet mid-stretch and had made contact with the ball while it was no longer in his hand. By the rules, that meant the point belonged to Shelton.

Despite conceding the point, Alcaraz regrouped quickly and held serve, saving six break points.

Defending champion Alcaraz and Shelton are playing for a quarter-final spot in the French capital. The winner will face Tommy Paul.

Tommy Paul broke new ground on Sunday at Roland Garros, where he reached the quarter-finals at the clay-court major for the first time.

The American earned battling five-set wins against Marton Fucsovics and Karen Khachanov earlier this week but found the going easier against Alexei Popyrin, dispatching the Australian 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 in one hour and 52 minutes.

""I'm enjoying it a lot,"" Paul said when asked about competing on clay. ""It was nice to get a straight-sets win today, give the body a little rest. I mean, as much as I love the five-setters, I definitely like the three-setters a little bit better. I am just excited for more matches.""

Paul has now reached the last eight at three of the four majors, advancing to the semi-finals at the Australian Open in 2023 and the quarter-finals at Wimbledon in 2024. The 28-year-old is just the ninth American man in the Open Era and only active American to advance to Grand Slam quarter-finals on all three surfaces. He joins Andre Agassi, Michael Chang, Jimmy Connors, Jim Courier, Vitas Gerulaitis, Brian Gottfried, John McEnroe and Pete Sampras.

Tommy Paul keeps powering through 👊🔥

Aiming to reach the last four in Paris, the 12th seed will next face defending champion Carlos Alcaraz or countryman Ben Shelton. Paul trails Alcaraz 2-4 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series and is tied at 2-2 with Shelton.

Paul saved 90 per cent (9/10) of the break points he faced against Popyrin, stuck 27 winners to the Australian's 18 and committed 15 fewer unforced errors (22-37) than the World No. 25, according to Infosys Stats.

Paul is now 12-3 on clay this season, having reached the semi-finals at the ATP Masters 1000 in Rome last month. The four-time tour-level titlist is currently No. 8 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

Popyrin had not dropped a set en route to reaching the fourth round in the French capital for the first time. The 25-year-old is up four spots to No. 21 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

Did You Know?
Paul is the first American man to reach the quarter-finals at Roland Garros since Agassi in 2003.

Tennis runs in the Shelton family. Father Bryan won four ATP titles during his career - Emma and Ben have followed in his footsteps.

The Shelton family will be cheering on one of their siblings in today's French Open match as Ben takes on Carlos Alcaraz in Paris.

Ben is currently ranked 13th in the world and is trying to make it to the quarterfinals in Paris if he can get past Spanish wonderboy Alcaraz.

Tennis is generational for the Sheltons. Father Bryan spent eight years as a pro and won four ATP titles before retiring in 1997 to continue in the sport as a coach at his old college, Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta and later at the University of Florida.

Bryan's wife Lisa was a successful junior player during her formative years and her brother Todd Witsken was a professional, reaching a career high ranking of 43rd in singles and 4th in doubles. In 1986, he famously beat Jimmy Connors over three sets in the US Open. Sadly Todd passed away from brain cancer, aged 34 in 1998.

Both of their children, Ben and Emma are talented tennis players who have played for Florida Gators' tennis teams.

A post shared by Emma Shelton (@_emmashelton)

Emma was born in Gainesville, Florida on March 18, 2001 and attended Buchholz High School.

She joined the Gators' class in June 2021, following two seasons of collegiate competition at the University of South Carolina where she posted a 19-3 record in singles and 19-8 in doubles in her first year and 13-12 and 13-11 respectively in her second year.

In addition to her success on the courts, Shelton was lauded for academic achievements with SEC Academic Honor Roll and ITA Scholar-Athlete designations in 2020.

Iga Swiatek won in three absorbing sets against Elena Rybakina, while Elina Svitolina saved match points before beating last year's finalist Jasmine Paolini

Alcaraz attacks from the off on Shelton's serve, getting the break back at the first opportunity, to 15, as Shelton skews wide. Having waited more than two hours to break, Shelton will be mad at himself that he conceded it without a fight. A quick hold from Alcaraz, and they're back on serve, with the defending champ up 7-6, 6-3, 3-3. And Tiafoe is about to serve for the first set, leading Altmaier 5-3. I'm afraid that's all from us for today, but do join us again tomorrow when the fourth round continues. A demain!

A brilliant point and smiles all around with Alcaraz leading 7-6, 6-3, 1-1, and Shelton serving at 15-0. These two are both so fun to watch, with Alcaraz the greatest showman of all. Sometimes the flashiness can be interspersed with moments of lost concentration, but there haven't been many of those today. Shelton holds to 15, and just to totally disprove prove my point about Alcaraz's focus, the Spaniard slides 30-40 down. And Shelton breaks for the first time to go 3-1 ahead! Game on? Perhaps it's too soon to declare that, but it's set on for sure.

Escape from Alcaraz, says Brad Gilbert.

that just felt like 👍 a 3 point takedown in wrestling 🤼‍♂️ from 3all and bang just like that 2 sets and deep hole 🕳️ vs Escape from Alcraz

A Carlos Alcaraz ROCKET forehand to take the second set 🇪🇸#RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/LdVgcmaN5l

Poor Shelton will be wondering what on earth happened there. There he was, still in with a strong chance of winning the second set, and then nine points later he finds himself two sets to love down. Totally ruthless from the defending champion. Meanwhile Tiafoe is channelling his inner Alcaraz on Suzanne Lenglen, having charged into a 3-0 first-set lead over Altmaier, who took out Tiafaoe's fellow American, Taylor Fritz, in the first round.

That denouement may be coming sooner than expected, because suddenly Alcaraz accelerates to 0-15, 0-30, 0-40 on Shelton's serve, courtesy of a couple of ferocious forehands. Shelton steadies himself on the first break point, but is rocked on the second, as Alcaraz breaks for the first time! And Alcaraz serves the set out to love to lead 7-6, 6-3, sealing it with a fizzing forehand down the line!

A lone “let's go Shelton, let's go, let's go Shelton, let's go” from the crowd with Alcaraz serving at 7-6, 3-3, 40-15. It doesn't do the trick, as Alcaraz holds to 30 with a forehand winner. After the dramatic start to the set, these two are going about their business on serve, before we reach the second-set denouement …

Up next for Lenglen: Frances Tiafoe (15) v Daniel Altmaier.

So the first women's quarter-finals are now set:

Sabalenka (1) v Zheng (8)

A truly INCREDIBLE moment 🤯@carlosalcaraz THROWS his racket and makes the volley - but concedes the point to Shelton! 👏@rolandgarros #RolandGarros  pic.twitter.com/cpEpYQ1v8O

There are shades of Rafa with Shelton's sleeveless top, bulging biceps, lefty game and the way he tends to his bottles. Now he just needs an all-action comeback. He's certainly pushing on Alcaraz's serve in the opening game of the second set, and he has break point when Alcaraz throws his racket to get to the ball and makes the volley – but sportingly concedes the point after admitting his error. Alcaraz then decides to copy the belligerence of Anisimova by saving six break points in total – before holding. It's Alcaraz who – somehow – leads 7-6, 1-0. Make that 1-1 after a hold from Shelton.

Sabalenka, serving at 7-5, 5-3, 40-15, must be wondering what she has to do to finish off Anisimova. The seventh match point disappears too, but finally Sabalenka gets the job done with a backhand winner. Admirable fight from Anisimova at the end, but it's Sabalenka, the top seed, who goes through to her third Roland Garros quarter-final, where she'll face Zheng Qinwen, the Olympic champion. Looking forward to that one.

While all this has been going on, Sabalenka has motored through the second set against Anisimova, and has match points at 7-5, 5-2, 15-40 on Anisimova's serve. Sabalenka misses the first with a wayward return – and Anisimova saves the second with a backhand winner. Another MP comes and goes. And a fourth. And a fifth! Sabalenka cries out. But she's still got plenty of breathing space in this match, even after letting a sixth slip away. Anisimova holds after 11 minutes, but it's surely delaying the inevitable …

9-8 Alcaraz, when Shelton shanks well wide. And, crucially for Alcaraz, this set point is on his serve – unlike the first. Alcaraz repeatedly goes to Shelton's backhand, before working the space and firing beyond the American's forehand wing! Alcaraz wins a set that was Shelton's for the taking, and while it's only the opener, it'll be a long way back for Shelton from here.

… Shelton edges to 7-6 … a third set point … Alcaraz is grunting loudly, hitting hard and true, and then shows delicate touch to finish the point at the net with a backhand volley. And he's screaming when he gets his first set point as Shelton nets! So 8-7 Alacaraz … and this time it's Shelton's turn to come forward and settle matters. 8-8 …

So Alcaraz is serving at 4-5, and the left-hander Shelton absolutely rips a forehand past a stumbling Alcaraz! Two set points for Shelton … Alcaraz saves the first on his own serve, but the second is on Shelton's. And Shelton smacks into the net! How costly will those two points prove to be for the American? This first set is surely more important for him to win …

Look here! Shelton gets the first mini-break and leads 3-1. Make that 4-1. Alcaraz regroups for 4-3 – but Shelton has the next two serves on his racket, and if he wins both, he'll have set points. 5-3 … and Alcaraz gets the mini-break back with a wonderful point of back and forth, the best of the match, which Alcaraz takes with a volley that just clips the sideline!

Shelton is doing exactly what Brad Gilbert asked of him, keeping his side of the scoreboard ticking over with a sixth hold for 6-5. Given Alcaraz's rapid success, holding four grand slam titles already, it's easy to forget these two are actually the same age, 22. So this isn't quite Alcaraz v the young pretender. Alcaraz holds too, to 15, and we've got ourselves a tie-break.

Absolute artistry 🖌️#RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/8R4Ds2r594

It's been a good tournament for the Americans in Paris, with eight players through to the fourth round on the men's and women's sides, Shelton and Anisimova included, the most combined for 40 years. But while Shelton is taking Alcaraz the distance in the first set, with the pair locked at 5-all, Anisimova is in danger of falling away against Sabalenka, at 7-5, 1-0 and break point down. Anisimova nets and furiously chucks her racket on to the clay.

Line hunting with Anisimova 🔥🔥🔥#RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/2MpSilBuxT

A second set point for Sabalenka at 6-5, 30-40 on Anisimova's serve, to add to the one she had at 5-3 on her own serve. A quick cross-court exchange … and Anisimova's forehand flumps into the net. Sabalenka withstands the American fightback and has the first set on the board, 7-5.

Back to Alcaraz v Shelton, where Alcaraz is serving at 3-4, 30-0, having missed a break point in the previous game. 30-0 turns into 40-15, and then game after a smart drop-shot. 4-4.

Anisimova holds to claim three games on the spin. It's 5-all. And she has two break points at 15-40 to make it four. Sabalenka is screaming in relief after an ace on the first break point and a missed return on the second. Another ace gives Sabalenka advantage, but Anisimova has her eye in now, and her deep hitting allows her to step forward and whack away the short ball. Deuce. Advantage Sabalenka. Jeu Sabalenka for 6-5. She has herself at least a tie-break.

Alcaraz is serving at deuce, trailing 3-2, and holds from there. Shelton, who's had an up-and-down year, the highs being a run to the Australian Open semi-finals and Munich final, came through a late night five-setter in the first round, but benefitted from a walkover in round two and won in straight sets in round three, so he's got plenty in the tank for this match.

scoreboard pressure is massive today for gimme Shelton, if you can find away keep holding that's how u sneak a break if gets broken early that leads to more

most frustrating on clay  🧱 especially if you get quicker conditions, facing a huge serv can become problematic, and easier for them to sneak a break and fast 💨 set

Sabalenka is serving for the first set at 5-3. At 15-all, the Belarusian has to dig the ball out of the clay, but hits long. 15-30. A viciously spun second serve makes it 30-all … and it should really be set point, but Sabalenka's drop shot doesn't have enough depth, Anisimova gets to it and Sabalenka nets the volley. 30-40, break point … and Sabalenka decides now's the time to send down an ace. After Sabalenka spurns a set point Anisimova gets a second break point … and the American breaks as she rams a forehand at the feet of a helpless Sabalenka! They're back on serve with Sabalenka leading 5-4.

Alcaraz v Shelton has the potential to be another Sunday cracker … and if it was on a hard court I'd give Shelton a decent chance of causing Alcaraz real problems … but on the red dirt and at Roland Garros, with Alcaraz the defending champion, I think Alcaraz will have a little too much. But it's going to be fun finding out.

As for Carlitos, he's pushing at 1-1, 30-all on Shelton's serve. A serve bomb and smash combo gets Shelton to 40-30. And the American holds when he finishes a much longer exchange, a 17-shot rally, with a backhand winner. It's Shelton leading 2-1 on serve.

An early chance for Sabalenka, the top seed, to break, at her advantage on Anisimova's serve. Just wide from Anisimova and Sabalenka gets the breakthrough. And then backs up the break to love with some clean, clinical hitting for 4-1. Sabalenka is such a formidable frontrunner and already this looks to be a tall, tall task for Anisimova, the American 16th seed.

Thanks Daniel. Bit of an unscheduled takeover, this, so it may take me a few minutes to catch my breath. Likewise for the spectators on Philippe Chatrier and Suzanne Lenglen after Swiatek's and Zheng's absorbing wins. But the players wait for no one, and Sabalenka v Anisimova and Alcaraz v Shelton are already under way.

This has been a brilliant day so far, Paolini-Svitolina and Swiatek-Rybakina playing matches as good as anything we've seen so far with the promise of much more to come – both right now, and for the rest of the tournament. My watch, though, is over, so I'll see you soon – here's Katy Murrells to guide you through the next bit of fun.

Next on Chatrier: Ben Shelton (13) v Carlos Alcaraz (2)

Swiatek is laughing now; she wasn't earlier. The first set felt like playing Jannik Sinner she says and she didn't have much hope. But she kept at it and by the end was playing her game, so she's “super-happy”.

The plan was to play with more top-spin than usual but she didn't have room to put it into practise until the second set because Rybakina was so close to the lines. She thinks both players played “pretty amazing” so it gives her a lot that she's through – she doesn't know who's next, guessing “Jasmine”, but then remembers she saw the match and praises Svito as a great fighter for whom every point “means life or death”. It means a big challenge, everyone left is playing great, so she'll focus on herself and be ready.

A brilliant match won by an amazing champion. Swiatek punishes one final forehand, leaping and prancing in delight. Rybakina played tennis as good as you'll see in set one but couldn't sustain it, and bit by bit, Swiatek insinuated herself into proceedings. Next for her: Elina Svitolina. Don't mind if we do!

Successive forehands to the same forehand corner save one match point; Rybakina is not ready to depart…

Big serve, big forehand, colossal putaway; 15-0. Rybakina, though, isn't finish, mashing a forehand winner down the line, Swiatek impassive. She's so focused my brain hurts, and another quick point, this time finished with a stutter-step swing-volley, means 30-15 … and a netted return 40-15. The champ has two match points!

Dear, oh dear, oh dear. Down 15-30, Rybakina plays a disastrous drop that's got far too much on it. Swiatek, killer that she is, gobbles it up, then a tame netted forehand means she'll shortly serve for the match! I'm in awe: at 1-6 0-1 with a break, she looked done for, but she said not today and here we are. What does Rybakina have left?

Next on Lenglen: Aryna Sabalenka (1) v Amanada Anisimova (16).

Into to quarters for the first time, a delighted Zheng doesn't know what to say; Swiatek holds to love. Mentally, she is something else – she's not impervious to nerves, not at all, but her desire is a personality all of its own.

The marathon is over. next for Zheng: Anisimova or Sabalenka.

Now it's Rybakina down 15-30, and error presents break point … and just as happened last game, a double converts it. Or not! the umpire comes to check the mark, Swiatek walking back to her chair, and decides the ball was good! The champ, of course, simply cannot contain her mirth at this development, all the more so when Rybakina closes to deuce. Swiatek though, isn't going away and down advantage, she backs up a fine return with a forehand winner. This is great stuff, two brilliant players giving it absolutely everything, and when Rybakina serves out, at 5-4 she's a game away from the last eight. Pressure for Swiatek while, on Lenglen, Zheng breaks for 5-3 and serving at 40-30 has match point…","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"

PARIS -- Iga Swiatek took a major step forward in her quest for a record fourth straight French Open title -- and fifth overall -- when she beat Elena Rybakina 1-6, 6-3, 7-5 on Sunday.

Swiatek, who has struggled for top form this year and whose last final was at Roland-Garros 12 months ago, trailed by a set and 2-0 but found her game when she needed it most to advance to the quarterfinals, where she will play Elina Svitolina of Ukraine.Editor's PicksThe Americans still playing at the 2025 French Open18hD'Arcy MaineIs this the last time we'll see line judges at a Grand Slam?5dTom HamiltonExperts' picks: Who will win the French Open?7dESPN2 Related

How did she do it and what does it mean for her? Here are three takeaways from a potentially crucial win.

Rybakina, a former Wimbledon champion and the winner in Strasbourg on the eve of the French Open, was on fire in the first set, blasting 12 winners and putting Swiatek under constant pressure. The biggest problem for Swiatek was her serve, an area of her game she has been tweaking under the tutelage of her coach Wim Fissette, but which has been a struggle throughout the clay-court season.2025 French Open Women's OddsAryna Sabalenka+240Iga Swiatek+340Coco Gauff+500Mirra Andreeva+600Odds by ESPN BET  

As the first five games slipped away in little over 20 minutes, Swiatek was well below 50% on first serve, and when she needed to hit a second, she was winning just 20% of the points. She steadied the ship a little at the end of the set to at least get on the board, but her serve was letting her down. In the second set, she took a little pace off, going for more angle, using more body serves, and as Rybakina's level dipped slightly, Swiatek worked her way back into the match.

By the end, she was up at 57% and with Rybakina below 50, she had time to get into the points and turn the match around.

In her well-documented struggles this spring, the wheels have come off the Swiatek game when she's been in trouble, with early losses in Stuttgart and Rome and a humbling by Coco Gauff in Madrid. But this time, though there were mutterings toward her team at times, she stayed calm enough to think clearly and change things.

Standing a little deeper on returns, she was able to get into the points better on the Rybakina serve and began to use her crosscourt forehand to great effect, pulling her opponent out of court.2025 French Open Men's OddsCarlos Alcaraz+105Jannik Sinner+220Novak Djokovic+1100Alexander Zverev+1200

At 2-2 in the second, she survived three straight double-faults on the ad court to hold and lead in a set for the first time and from then on, her confidence grew.

Even at 4-4 in the deciding set, when she thought she had broken serve only for a Rybakina double fault to be changed by the umpire on examination of the mark, she stayed patient. She held to love in the next game, breaking for 6-5 and serving out for victory.

""First set I felt like I was playing against Jannik Sinner,"" she said. ""I needed to do something to get back into the game, the way she was playing, I didn't have a lot of hopes, but I kept fighting. At the end I was able to play my game so I was happy.""

Everything. Sometimes it takes only one moment, one big result, to turn around a player's season and the way Swiatek celebrated as her final forehand sped away for a winner, with a double fist pump, emitted a combination of joy and relief.

A month ago, this might have been a match that got away, quickly, but this was much more like the old, normal Swiatek, ripping forehands with vicious spin, finding solutions when required. When Rybakina beat Jelena Ostapenko, whose 6-0 head-to-head advantage over Swiatek would have been in Swiatek's head again had they met in Paris, it seemed like it was a stroke of luck. But a win over Rybakina, who had beaten Swiatek four times out of eight, won both their previous meetings on clay and was playing incredible tennis, could be a win that starts to restore her aura of invincibility.

Swiatek's biggest rivals for the title, who came into the event sensing that she was vulnerable, will take notice.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","tennis"

Tommy Paul broke new ground on Sunday at Roland Garros, where he reached the quarter-finals at the clay-court major for the first time.

The American earned battling five-set wins against Marton Fucsovics and Karen Khachanov earlier this week but found the going easier against Alexei Popyrin, dispatching the Australian 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 in one hour and 52 minutes.

""I'm enjoying it a lot,"" Paul said when asked about competing on clay. ""It was nice to get a straight-sets win today, give the body a little rest. I mean, as much as I love the five-setters, I definitely like the three-setters a little bit better. I am just excited for more matches.""

Paul has now reached the last eight at three of the four majors, advancing to the semi-finals at the Australian Open in 2023 and the quarter-finals at Wimbledon in 2024. The 28-year-old is just the ninth American man in the Open Era and only active American to advance to Grand Slam quarter-finals on all three surfaces. He joins Andre Agassi, Michael Chang, Jimmy Connors, Jim Courier, Vitas Gerulaitis, Brian Gottfried, John McEnroe and Pete Sampras.

Aiming to reach the last four in Paris, the 12th seed will next face defending champion Carlos Alcaraz or countryman Ben Shelton. Paul trails Alcaraz 2-4 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series and is tied at 2-2 with Shelton.

Paul saved 90 per cent (9/10) of the break points he faced against Popyrin, stuck 27 winners to the Australian's 18 and committed 15 fewer unforced errors (22-37) than the World No. 25, according to Infosys Stats.

Former world No. 4, and four-time Wimbledon semi-finalist, Tim Henman has had his fair share of battles against tennis greats Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Andy Murray.

As such, few are as qualified as the British tennis legend to rank the 'Big Four'. The quartet of tennis giants recently reunited at the French Open for Nadal's farewell ceremony.

Henman was also present, offering commentary for TNT Sports, who asked him to list the five greatest players in men's tennis history. Surprisingly, Henman left fellow Brit Murray out of his top five, instead giving the fifth spot to Rod Laver, andanointing Djokovic as his greatest of all time.

""I think for someone to win the calendar Grand Slam on two occasions, just absolutely phenomenal,"" Henman said of Laver. ""He's a real icon, ambassador of our sport, so he is my fifth.""

U.S icon Pete Sampras, a seven-time Wimbledon champion, landed the fourth spot on Henman's list. ""In fourth place I would say Pete Sampras.

""He was someone that I played against many, many times. Seven Wimbledon titles, 14 Grand Slams in total, an incredible career.""

The top three spots were reserved for Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic. However, in Henman's ranking, the Swiss maestro fell short of his two rivals, despite Henman's admiration for Federer's versatility across different court surfaces, reports the Express.

""In third place I would go for Roger Federer,"" Henman added. ""Winner of 20 Grand Slam titles, eight Wimbledons, played so well on every surface.

""Just how easy he made the game look with his footwork, but also his technique. That one-handed backhand was always a pleasure to watch.""

Nadal clinched the runner-up spot, fresh off a special tribute at the French Open. With an unmatched record of 14 victories at Roland Garros, Nadal was immortalized with a permanent shoeprint on Court Philippe-Chatrier.

""In second place I would go Rafa Nadal,"" Henman continued. ""He won 22 Grand Slams, 14 French Opens. We often talk about records are there to be broken, but I'm convinced that 14 singles titles at Roland Garros will never be broken.""

However, it was the Serbian icon who earned the highest praise from Henman. Just a week after securing his 100th career title in Geneva, Djokovic is chasing his 25th Grand Slam trophy in Paris and has been named the greatest male player ever by Henman.

""Greatest male player of all time is Novak Djokovic,"" Henman said. ""What he's done, winning every Grand Slam a minimum three times. He's won 24 majors, going for his 25th here in Roland Garros. He's the best player that I've ever seen.""

Tim Henman believes another Roland Garros title may be beyond Novak Djokovic in Paris next weekend – but he is convinced the Serbian legend can make another challenge to win a record-equalling eighth Wimbledon title.

Djokovic is chasing a 25th Grand Slam singles title, as he looks to move ahead of Margaret Court and become the player with the most major titles in their collection.

That achievement would cement his legacy as the greatest player of all-time and not just in the men's game, with former British No 1 Henman predicting his moment of glory is unlikely to come on the clay courts of Paris.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have shared the last five Grand Slam titles between them, with Djokovic's last major title coming at the 2023 US Open.

He insists he is a contender to lift major title No 25 in Paris, but Henman suggests Djokovic's chance to complete his last great tennis dream at Wimbledon, with the grass court Grand Slam getting underway on the last day of June.

World No 1 slams Novak Djokovic treatment and makes a big plea to his doubters

“I would never write Novak off,” Henman told Tennis365 in an exclusive interview conducted in the TNT Sports studio at Roland Garros.

“He wasn't my favourite to win coming into this event, but he was on my list as a potential winner if things went his way.

“Sinner and Alcaraz have separated themselves from the rest at the moment, but Djokovic is in that next batch of half of dozen that could cause a surprise and win.

“You look at it now and he is through to the fourth round, he came in here on the back of winning a tournament in Geneva and the mood around him feels a little different.

“He had no clay court form ahead of that tournament in Geneva. He goes to play that tournament a week before a Slam and at his age, you look at that and question if he will be struggling for energy playing extra matches.

“But I think the confidence he takes from a win, his 100th career title, puts him in a good place. He knows what it takes to win here.

“That said, I would still look to Wimbledon as his best chance to win another Grand Slam.

“Sinner and Alcaraz are strong favourites on this surface, but I look at Wimbledon and grass courts that should give Djokovic a little assistance and that's where I see his best chance to win another Grand Slam.

“The list of players who could potentially win Wimbledon is pretty small and I would certainly have Djokovic on that list.”

Djokovic beat Filip Misolic 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 on a night of celebration in the French capital, as Paris Saint-Germain were crowned as champions of Europe in soccer for the first time in their history.

He will now face Britain's Cameron Norrie in the next round and will be confident of getting through to the quarter-finals, where he might face No 3 seed Alexander Zverev.

“I have won nine out of nine sets and have been solid when I needed to be,” declared Djokovic after his win against Misolic.

“There is always something to improve, always something to get better at, but I am happy with my levels here so far.”

The win against Misolic was Djokovic's 99th at Roland Garros and he is relishing the chance to set new records in his career.

“When I tried to extend my career for as long as I can, I wanted to play at the highest level and that's what I'm doing, so I couldn't be happier,” added Djokovic.

Although we are currently mid-way through an enthralling French Open, for some, attention has already moved on down the tennis calendar.

In fact, this latest piece of information goes beyond even Wimbledon, the next Grand Slam, and moves straight to the US Open.

However, that is with good reason, as they are plotting something which could revolutionise one area of the sport that has been left dormant for far too long.

After all, it's not a controversial opinion to state that singles tennis commands the bulk of attention not just from the tennis community, but from casual viewers too. 

It has the biggest names and the biggest prizes, with stars like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner likely already household names despite their youth.

And they are following on from the success paved by the Big Four, with Roger Federer, Andy Murray, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic having all helped shine a light on a sport that has arguably fallen behind commercially in recent years.

Still a few months away, but US Open is very, very excited about what they're cooking with their newfangled mixed doubles event.Player buy-in from singles stars has been *huge*: I've heard that 9 of WTA Top 10 are currently planning to play, as well as 10 of the ATP Top 10.

That's without mentioning the women's game too, which reached new heights thanks to stars like Serena and Venus Williams, to name just two.

With that in mind, the US Open are seeking to use the big names of today to help shine a light on another area of the sport.

They have reportedly already received buy-in from all of the ATP's top-ten players, and nine of the WTA's top ten, with the tournament itself said to be ‘very, very excited' about what they have planned.

This would make the New York Grand Slam a step above the others, with Frances Tiafoe saying the US Open is better than the other majors in one other key factor as well.

The fact of the matter is that tennis, despite its worldwide popularity, does not capitalise as it should.

With their Netflix documentary, Break Point, there was widespread scrutiny over their failure to promote the sport like Formula 1 did with Drive to Survive.

And then, with the doubles, at times it can actually feel like this, very valid part of the sport is an afterthought.

So, to find a way to boost the latter with the big names from the singles game makes perfect sense, and is a real step in the right direction. It should surprise no one that the US Open, which builds its entire model around generating as much revenue as possible, are the trailblazer in this regard.

To have already had such support from those major players is key, and it will be interesting to see how it pans out this September.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Tennis could be set to finally listen to stars over the gruelling calendar by moving the Australian Open, according to broadcaster and former pro Patrick McEnroe. Several players, including Carlos Alcaraz, have complained that they do not get enough of a break from the energy-sapping circuit.

Last year, world No. 2 Alcaraz warned bosses that they would ‘kill' players due to an ever-increasing schedule. There were a mere 49 days between the men's singles showdown at the year-end ATP Finals tournament and the first round of this year's Australian Open in January. Players compete all year round and many are often only paid if they enter competitions, with prize money their only source of income. That means they rarely get a break.

To deal with the growing discontent, McEnroe says he has heard “rumblings” that the Australian Open could be pushed back by a month to February. However, that could simply accommodate space in January for a big tournament, perhaps in the Middle East.

Brother and seven-time Grand Slam champion John McEnroe said on TNT Sports: “If they moved the Australian to later, that would give more time, but they don't want to give that up. The January slot. What do you think, in March?”

Patrick responded: “I'm hearing rumblings that it could move to February.”

John said that would be “helpful”, and Patrick continued: “Of course, there'd probably be another big tournament put in in early January, that's part of potentially the plan. Middle East, hello?

“It's pretty typical of all sports like in the NBA you see players taking nights off under contract. In tennis the difference is you don't play you don't get paid. No guaranteed contracts. Top players have big endorsement deals but even those normally have stipulations that the players have to play certain events or be ranked at a certain spot to collect the money.”

Alcaraz is the most high-profile star to strongly criticise the schedule. Speaking last September, the Spaniard said: “As I said many times, you know, the calendar is so tight, a lot of tournaments, no days off or not as much days off as I want.

“I'm the kind of player who think there is a lot of tournaments during the year, mandatory tournaments, and probably during the next few years gonna be even more tournaments, more mandatory tournaments. So, I mean, probably they are going to kill us in some way. Right now they are showing up a lot of injuries because of the ball, because of the calendar, because a lot of things.”

Tennis Revolution: Major Changes Looming in the Sport as Players Speak Out

In a groundbreaking turn of events, the world of tennis is on the brink of a massive transformation as legendary player and broadcaster Patrick McEnroe drops bombshell rumors during the French Open. The sport, known for its grueling schedule, might finally heed the calls of its star players for a much-needed respite from the relentless circuit.

Rising star Carlos Alcaraz and several other players have been vocal about the demanding calendar, expressing concerns over the lack of breaks and the toll it takes on their physical and mental well-being. Last year, Alcaraz issued a stark warning, cautioning that the jam-packed schedule could ultimately “kill” players. With only 49 days separating the ATP Finals and the Australian Open earlier this year, athletes find themselves constantly on the move, competing year-round with little time off. For many players, prize money from tournaments serves as their sole income, leaving them with no option but to continue without respite.

Amidst the growing discontent, McEnroe has hinted at a potential shift in the tennis calendar, suggesting that the Australian Open could be pushed back to February. Such a move could open up space in January for a significant tournament, possibly in the Middle East. The tennis icon's brother, John McEnroe, weighed in on the discussion, contemplating the implications of such a change. Speculation is rife about the logistics and repercussions of altering the tournament schedule, with talks of introducing a new major event in early January.

The current structure of tennis, where players are only paid based on their tournament participation and performance, stands in stark contrast to other professional sports leagues that offer guaranteed contracts. This lack of financial security adds to the pressure on players to compete regularly, even at the cost of their well-being. Top players, while enjoying lucrative endorsement deals, are often bound by strict obligations to maintain their rankings and tournament appearances to secure their earnings.

Alcaraz, one of the most vocal critics of the grueling tennis calendar, has highlighted the issues surrounding the sport's schedule, pointing to the increasing number of injuries and the demanding nature of the game. The young Spanish sensation has raised concerns about the relentless nature of the tour, emphasizing the need for a more balanced and player-friendly calendar to safeguard the health of athletes in the long term.

As the tennis world braces for a potential revolution, the voices of players like Alcaraz echo a growing sentiment within the sport for change and a more sustainable approach to scheduling. With rumors swirling and discussions underway, the future of tennis hangs in the balance, awaiting a transformation that could reshape the sport for generations to come.

Jakub Mensik will return to his hometown of Prostejov this week to compete at the Unicredit Czech Open, an ATP Challenger 100 event, where the Czech has received a main draw wild card.

Mensik arrives in Prostejov following a second-round exit at Roland Garros. Prostejov marks the #NextGenATP star's second Challenger appearance of the season, having competed in Cap Cana in March as World No. 57 in the PIF ATP Rankings. 



Shortly after a semi-final showing in Cap Cana, Mensik won his maiden ATP Masters 1000 title in Miami, where he defeated his idol Novak Djokovic in the final. Mensik is now No. 19 in the PIF ATP Rankings, meaning fans in Prostejov will relish the rare opportunity to see a Top 20 player in an intimate Challenger setting.

The 19-year-old's lone Challenger title came in his home country in 2023, when he won the Prague Challenger, which was just his sixth outing at that level.

Alejandro Tabilo also accepted a wild card into Prostejov. The Chilean is seeded second.

“I've already played three matches here with the same headband… Yeah, I was surprised,” Baptiste explained to Rocha as she argued her case.“We tried to cover it with a marker, but the material won't let it stay on… For my next match, I will get a new one with a smaller logo. But for today, I don't have anything else to wear.”Grand Slam supervisor Denise Parnell, the first female referee at Wimbledon, was called to the court to assess the situation, delaying the start of play by several minutes. Ultimately, Parnell agreed to make a one-time exception for the headband.The officials also flagged the size of the Jumpman logo on the player's right arm sleeve. Baptiste quickly turned it inside out, and was finally cleared to play.

George Russell and Max Verstappen have shared their reactions following a remarkable late-race collision between them that resulted in a penalty for the Red Bull driver and dramatically altered the final race order of the Spanish Grand Prix.

It was a dramatic conclusion to the race in Barcelona, as the whole picture was dramatically shaken up when a Safety Car was deployed in the latter stages after Kimi Antonelli's Mercedes pulled off track with a mechanical issue, prompting most of the frontrunners to pit again.

Verstappen only had the hard tyre option available, leaving the Red Bull driver vulnerable to attack from those behind, and that's how it panned out once the racing action got back underway.

After Verstappen endured a major snap following the restart and made contact with Charles Leclerc, falling back to P4 during the scuffle, Russell attempted to take advantage and similarly charge past.

Verstappen managed to hold onto the place, but only by taking to the exit road and emerging ahead of Russell. In order to avoid a penalty for gaining an advantage off track, his race engineer recommended that he allow the Mercedes driver to pass by.

Despite some fiery complaints over the radio, he appeared to back off at Turn 5 and invite Russell to take the outside line, but quickly returned to his usual speed and collided with him on the penultimate lap.

Offering his take on the incident, Russell said afterwards: “My perspective is that I just got crashed into! I don't really know why or what the thinking was behind it. In the end, I'm glad that I continued with little damage and ultimately it punished him a lot more than me.

“That's how Max goes racing. As I said, he was in P4, I was in P5 – I ended up P4, he ended up P10, so from my side I'm glad that I managed to finish the race.

“Not really sure what he was thinking because he cost himself and his team a lot of points, so no conversation [is] really required.”

Russell claimed his best race result since the Miami Grand Prix

The incident saw Verstappen receive a 10-second time penalty, which dropped him from fifth place to 10th, opening up a more comprehensive gap to his competitors at McLaren in the drivers' standings.

He later briefly reflected on the crash, stating: “I don't need to say anything about it because it doesn't matter anyway.

“I had a big moment there in the last corner. Unfortunately the hard tyres had very low grip so that was quite painful. Basically, we just ran out of tyres. In hindsight, was it better to stay out? Maybe, I don't know. It's always easy to say afterwards. Because of those hard tyres, you get into those situations.

“I think [the strategy] was good, I think it worked for us. It was the best way forward. It was racy and I liked it. Unfortunately we didn't get the benefits at the end.”

Piastri ‘proud' to bounce back with victory in Spain as he hails ‘weekend I've been looking for'

Oscar Piastri has further strengthened his championship lead by clinching a commanding victory in the Spanish Grand Prix, the Australian leading team mate Lando Norris in a McLaren 1-2 amid a dramatic end to the race that saw Max Verstappen and George Russell collide.

Piastri made an excellent start from pole position, allowing the 24-year-old to build an early lead from Verstappen who had overtaken Norris into Turn 1. Norris later retook the position – only for Verstappen to leapfrog both McLarens after the first pit stops, putting himself into P1.

This proved to be brief, however, as the Dutchman pitted early for a second stop, handing the lead back to Piastri – all of which triggered much intrigue over whether Verstappen would opt for a three-stop strategy, a scenario that could pose a threat to the papaya squad should the Red Bull have fresher rubber later on.

Verstappen did indeed embark on a three-stop – but the whole picture was dramatically shaken up when a Safety Car was deployed in the latter stages after Kimi Antonelli's Mercedes pulled off track with a mechanical issue, prompting most of the frontrunners to pit again.

Race results

While Piastri and Norris surged clear at the restart amid a six-lap dash to the flag, Verstappen found himself passed by Charles Leclerc for third before battling with Russell. The pair made contact and Verstappen was forced to go down the escape road, only for Red Bull to tell their driver to hand the position back.

There was then another collision between the pair for which Verstappen subsequently received a 10-second time penalty. But there were no such dramas ahead for Piastri, who sealed his fifth victory of the season ahead of McLaren team mate Norris.

Leclerc sealed the final spot on the podium for Ferrari in third, while Russell claimed fourth and Nico Hulkenberg was an eye-catching fifth for Kick Sauber after starting back from P15 on the grid.

Lewis Hamilton followed in sixth for Ferrari, while Isack Hadjar added to Racing Bulls' tally in seventh and Pierre Gasly claimed eighth for Alpine. Fernando Alonso finally scored his maiden points of the campaign in P9 for Aston Martin, while Verstappen's penalty dropped him down to a final position of P10.

Piastri led away when the race began, while Norris was overtaken by Verstappen as further drama played out behind

Liam Lawson just missed out on points in an eventful afternoon for the Racing Bulls driver, with Gabriel Bortoleto following in P12 for Kick Sauber ahead of Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda in P13. Williams' Carlos Sainz had a tough home race in P14, while Franco Colapinto crossed the line in P15 for Alpine.

The Haas pair of Esteban Ocon and Ollie Bearman were the final classified runners in 16th and 17th respectively, with Antonelli and Williams' Alex Albon the two retirees, the latter having sustained front wing damage to his car.

Only 19 cars competed in the race after Aston Martin announced Lance Stroll's withdrawal from the event on Saturday evening, with the Canadian experiencing hand and wrist pain which will require a medical procedure.

Race Highlights: 2025 Spanish Grand Prix

After a busy build-up of three practice sessions and a thrilling Qualifying – which saw Piastri beat team mate Norris to pole position by 0.209s, the biggest pole-winning margin of the season so far – the attentions of the paddock turned to the 66-lap Spanish Grand Prix.

Amidst preparations for the race, news broke late on Saturday evening that Stroll would not be racing on Sunday. A statement from Aston Martin confirmed that the Canadian had been suffering wrist and hand pain over the course of the past six weeks – deemed by his medical consultant to be in relation to the procedure he underwent in 2023 following a pre-season cycling accident.

The statement added that Stroll will “undergo a procedure to rectify these issues before focusing on his recovery”. With it being too late for Aston Martin to nominate a replacement, the squad would consequently run just one car – that of Alonso – in Sunday's race.

This also meant that, with Stroll having qualified in P14 during Saturday's Qualifying, those behind him in the order were each promoted one position on the starting grid. Tsunoda, meanwhile, would start from the pit lane after changes were made to his Red Bull under parc ferme conditions.

Once the cars had assembled on the grid and the tyre blankets were removed amid another hot and humid day in Barcelona, it was revealed ahead of the anticipated two-stop event that everybody would be starting on the soft compound – with the exception of Tsunoda on the medium rubber. The McLaren pair had opted for fresh tyres, while the rest of the top 10 had opted for used sets.

Piastri made a strong start from pole position as the Spanish Grand Prix got underway

After the formation lap had been completed and the lights went out, Piastri swept ahead from pole position but Norris was facing a challenge from both Verstappen and Russell, the trio going three abreast into Turn 1 before Verstappen took P2 from Norris.

Russell, meanwhile, lost out to former team mate Hamilton, while Leclerc added to Ferrari's dream start by also making a move on the Mercedes, pushing the Briton down to sixth. Elsewhere Antonelli had lost a place after running down the escape road at the first corner, while Gasly and Hadjar remained in their starting positions of P8 and P9 and Hulkenberg had gained an impressive five place to put himself into P10.

As the action started to settle, Piastri had built a two-second advantage over Verstappen by Lap 4, while Russell sounded frustrated as he took to the radio to claim that others around him were “moving under braking”, prompting Team Principal Toto Wolff to ask him to “concentrate”.

Replays from the start revealed that Lawson had clipped the back of Alonso's Aston Martin, allowing Hulkenberg to gain places. Albon was also caught up in the melee, resulting in the Williams picking up damage to his front wing.

Albon went on to pit on Lap 7, the Thai driver dropping to the back of the order, while back on track Leclerc was all over the back of team mate Hamilton in a scrap for fourth. The Monegasque tried to make a move into Turn 1 on Lap 9 – only to be met with a robust defence by Hamilton.

However, with the pair losing ground to Norris in third, the order soon followed from the pit wall for Hamilton to let Leclerc through, which Hamilton subsequently did. There was further action in the pit lane, meanwhile, with the likes of Hulkenberg, Tsunoda and Bearman pitting while Sainz suffered a nightmarishly slow stop, bringing him back out at the rear of the pack.

As Lap 11 ticked down, Piastri continued to hold the lead by over three seconds from Verstappen, while Norris had closed in to within half a second of the World Champion. “No grip, compared to them that is,” Verstappen glumly told his race engineer Gianpiero Lambiase, just as Piastri reported some struggles with his rear tyres.

It did not take long for Norris to take advantage of the situation, the Briton passing Verstappen with ease into Turn 1 on Lap 13 – and just one tour later, the Dutchman dived into the pits for a fresh set of soft tyres, emerging back on track in P8.

Another title winner, meanwhile, was skating across the gravel at Turn 5 – that being home favourite Alonso, who returned to the track in P15 just ahead of Ocon. The Spaniard was subsequently noted by the stewards for rejoining the track unsafely, though it was soon decided that no further investigation was needed.

Alonso went on to pit for medium tyres on Lap 16, while Hamilton followed one tour later. “There's a long way to go,” the seven-time World Champion cautioned before being told that they were attempting an undercut. Leclerc up ahead was encouraged to “full push”, the Monegasque making his stop on the following lap.

Alonso had a trip through the gravel as he battled hard in his home event

Some moves were playing out across the field, with Alonso going around the outside of Sainz to take P16, while Verstappen had put himself up to P3 after overtaking both Mercedes cars. Up at the front, Piastri was quizzed on how far he could go and whether Lap 25 was possible, to which the Australian responded: “Possible, but difficult.”

Lap 22 saw Norris pit for medium tyres, the McLaren driver emerging back on track in P3 some 10 seconds behind Verstappen. And just one tour later, Piastri visited the pits – only for the championship leader to find himself five seconds adrift of the Red Bull which was now in P1.

With Verstappen, Piastri and Norris occupying the top three by Lap 25, the rest of the top 10 saw Leclerc head team mate Hamilton in fourth and fifth respectively, with Russell, Antonelli, Hadjar, Gasly and Hulkenberg completing the order.

Further back, Lawson was battling hard against Albon but the pair made contact, resulting in Albon collecting front wing damage for a second time in the race. The Thai driver soon visited the pits, seemingly ready to retire – however, after he was issued with a 10-second time penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage, he returned to the track.

That return did not last for long, with Albon then peeling back into the pits to retire – the team having seemingly wanted to serve the penalty rather than carrying it over to the next race in Canada. Verstappen, meanwhile, was unhappy with his RB21 up ahead, reporting that it was “so hard to drive”.

It was a disastrous day in Spain for Albon, who twice suffered front wing damage before retiring from the race

As such, the Dutchman pitted again for more medium tyres on Lap 29, dropping him down to fourth – did this mean that a three-stop strategy was on the cards for him? Elsewhere Lawson was in the wars again as he tried unsuccessfully to divebomb Bearman, an incident that was soon under investigation by the stewards for causing a collision.

By Lap 35, Piastri was leading by four seconds from Norris, while Leclerc had Verstappen chasing him down for third. The Red Bull soon made a move down the main straight before quickly opening up a gap to the Ferrari – and beginning to catch Norris in the process.

Norris, meanwhile, had started to cut into his team mate's lead, setting up for an intriguing final third of the race. Verstappen was informed by the Red Bull pit wall that “Mclaren are receiving the threat”, hinting at the potential danger the Dutchman could pose should he be armed with fresher tyres later in the Grand Prix on his predicted three-stop strategy.

Elsewhere, Leclerc pitted from fourth for another set of mediums – dropping him down to sixth – while Russell soon followed and bolted on some fresh soft tyres before emerging back on track in P7 behind team mate Antonelli.

The Italian subsequently allowed Russell to pass him, the pair seemingly running different strategies. Up ahead, Piastri had extended his lead again with 20 laps remaining, the Australian now more than four seconds ahead of Norris, while Verstappen remained the same margin behind the Briton.

Verstappen looked set to embark on a three-stop strategy in the race

Two veterans of the field – Hulkenberg and Hamilton – pitted on Lap 47, the former returning to the track in P10 on a so far promising day for the Kick Sauber man. Hamilton, meanwhile, endured a slightly slow stop, putting him back to P7.

One tour later, any questions over Verstappen's strategy were answered when the Dutch driver made a third pit stop to bolt on a set of used soft tyres. This saw him reemerge in third as he returned to the track just behind team mate Tsunoda, with the Japanese driver subsequently getting out of the way.

In response to this, McLaren quickly brought Norris into the pits – bringing him out just ahead of Verstappen – while Piastri followed one lap later. A smooth sequence of events saw Piastri head back out in the lead, a few seconds clear of Norris.

However, with cars ahead for the leaders to lap, there was plenty of jeopardy still at play. Case in point, Lawson and Bearman were again engaged in a feisty scrap – only for Bearman to be forced onto the escape road in the drama, just as Norris and Verstappen were trying to lap them behind. Verstappen was clearly unhappy, raising his hand before shouting “idiots” over the radio.

This incident resulted in Bearman being noted by the stewards for leaving the track and gaining an advantage. But there was further drama to come when Antonelli pulled into the gravel with a mechanical issue, resulting in the Safety Car being deployed – which sparked a flurry of action in the pit lane.

The Safety Car sparked a flurry of action in the pit lane, with numerous cars including both McLarens coming in for a stop

The top three were amongst those to make another pit stop – but Verstappen was left unimpressed by the decision to bolt on a set of hard tyres in contrast to those on softs around him, with this seemingly being the only option left for the World Champion.

As the Safety Car prepared to peel in on Lap 60, there was a bit of a moment when Piastri braked hard to allow the vehicle to move clear. But the championship leader executed the restart well, with both McLarens surging ahead while Verstappen suffered a dramatic snap into the final corner.

Leclerc went side-by-side with the Red Bull down the main straight and snatched P3, despite some contact between them along the way. Russell then tried to get involved, only for the Mercedes to briefly make contact with Verstappen, forcing the latter to go down the escape road. The incident was soon under investigation by the stewards.

Verstappen was then asked to let the Silver Arrows car through, prompting an angry response from the World Champion – and as Russell tried to move past, there was another collision between the pair. “He just crashed into me,” Russell commented.

While the first incident between them was deemed as requiring no further investigation, Verstappen was promptly under investigation for the second for causing a collision – and was consequently handed a 10-second time penalty.

Amidst all of this drama, Piastri was sailing clear at the front and crossed the line to take victory by 2.471s from Norris, another perfect outcome for McLaren which has strengthened their leads in both the Drivers' and Teams' Championships.

Leclerc held onto third – with it being confirmed in the latter stages that his incident with Verstappen on the main straight will be investigated after the race – while Russell took fourth. Hulkenberg, meanwhile, had a dream result by claiming fifth, providing a much-need haul of points for Kick Sauber.

Hamilton followed in sixth, having narrowly fended off seventh-placed Hadjar by just half a second, while Gasly was eighth and Alonso scored his first points of the campaign in front of his home crowd in ninth.

The final point on offer went to Verstappen, with his penalty dropping him down to P10. Lawson, Bortoleto, Tsunoda, Sainz, Colapinto, Ocon and Bearman completed the order, with Antonelli and Albon both recording a DNF.

All of this has given Piastri a 10-point lead over Norris in the Drivers' Championship, while Verstappen is now 49 points adrift of the Australian in third.

Piastri and Norris brought home another 1-2 for McLaren in Barcelona amid plenty of drama behind them

""It was a bit of a surprise to see Max try a three-stop and it nearly worked for him but, yeah, it was a great weekend overall,"" said Piastri. ""I think the pace was really good, we could turn it on when we needed to. Just very proud of the work we've done this weekend. It wasn't the best first practice, and then we got our stuff together. It's a nice way to bounce back from Monaco so it's been a superb weekend.”

After a weekend off, the next stop on the F1 calendar will be the Canadian Grand Prix from June 13-15. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action from the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve.

Bad Bunny, Margaret Qualley and Benny Safdie are among the cast additions for director Kyle Newacheck's Netflix sequel that starts streaming in July.


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


Adam Sandler is putting a new spin on his beloved titular golfer in the full trailer for the Netflix sequel movie Happy Gilmore 2. 


	During Saturday's fan event Tudum at the Kia Forum in the Los Angeles area, Netflix debuted the trailer for director Kyle Newacheck‘s new comedy that is set to begin streaming July 25. Sandler reprises his starring role as the long-driving phenom that he originated in Universal's 1996 film Happy Gilmore.




	The trailer ends with a kicker that calls back to the most famous exchange in the original movie, and one of the most famous Sandler lines in general. (You will have to watch to find out.)

	Christopher McDonald, Julie Bowen and Ben Stiller are among the performers returning from the original feature, while new cast additions include Bad Bunny, Margaret Qualley, Benny Safdie, Travis Kelce and Kym Whitley. Also set to appear are Eminem and such pro golfers as Jack Nicklaus, John Daly and Jordan Spieth.

	“I haven't swung a club in years,” Sandler's character laments in footage that was previously released and shows Happy getting back in the swing of things. “I'm a little intimidated. All these guys hit it big now.”


The Hollywood Reporter exclusively reported that Dennis Dugan — who directed the original Happy Gilmore and executive produces the sequel — is reprising his onscreen part as pro golf tour commissioner Doug Thompson in the new film. 


	Returning to produce Happy Gilmore 2 are Sandler, Tim Herlihy, Robert Simonds and Jack Giarraputo. Sandler and Herlihy wrote the screenplay for the sequel after having penned the original's script.

	











	Earlier this year, Dugan teased Kelce's role in the sequel. “His acting was really good and funny, and he was just a genuinely nice guy,” Dugan told THR at the time. “I met him for a day and a half, loved working with him, and now every time he catches a pass on TV, I say, ‘My best friend caught another pass.'” 


	During an interview with the Dan Patrick Show that aired late last year, Sandler admitted to feeling pressure to live up to the original movie that hit theaters Feb. 16, 1996.


	“It's on your mind,” Sandler said at the time. “We've got a lot of good stuff, and we just want to make sure that it all comes together and keeps it going from start to finish, and that's the goal. We'll see. We're definitely nervous, but we feel some sort of confidence.”

The final episodes will roll out in three different parts, with the series finale set for New Year's Eve. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


Netflix has finally revealed when the long-awaited and fifth and final season of Stranger Things will debut.


	The streamer announced the final season of the coming-of-age sci-fi hit will air in three parts late this year. The first will premiere Nov. 26, followed by part two on Christmas and the series finale on New Year's Eve.




	The news was announced at Netflix's Tudum fan event at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles Saturday, with stars Finn Wolfhard, Caleb McLaughlin and Noah Schnapp running through some look-back clips before revealing the dates for season five via a teaser (watch it below).

	Back in January, Ross Duffer said about the final episodes, “We spent a full year filming this season. By the end, we'd captured over 650 hours of footage. So, needless to say, this is our biggest and most ambitious season yet. It's like eight blockbuster movies. It's pretty insane.”


Matt Duffer added, “At the same time, we think it's our most personal story. It was super intense and emotional to film — for us and for our actors. We've been making this show together for almost 10 years. There was a lot of crying. There was so much crying. The show means so much to all of us, and everyone put their hearts and souls into it. And we hope — and believe — that passion will translate to the screen.”


	In November, Netflix announced the season five episode titles to tease the story arc of the season: “The Crawl,” “The Vanishing of [censored for now]” “The Turnbow Trap,” “Sorcerer,” “Shock Jock,” “Escape From Camazotz,” “The Bridge” and “The Rightside Up.”  


	The plan is also to have a bit of a time jump going into the final episodes. “I'm sure we will do a time jump,” Ross told TVLine. “Ideally, we'd have shot [seasons four and five] back to back, but there was just no feasible way to do that. So these are all discussions we're going to have with our writers when we start the room up.” Netflix has confirmed that the show would jump a little over a year to the fall of 1987, after season four took place in March 1986.

	











	The creators have also previously teased upcoming projects in the Stranger Things universe. 


	“There are more Stranger Things stories to tell and in the works,” Matt said. “It's a bit early at this point to talk about them, but we're deeply involved in every one — it's very important to us that anything with the Stranger Things name on it is of the highest quality and not repetitive — that it has a reason to exist and always blazes its own path. And also, it needs to basically just be … awesome. Or we need to think it's awesome. And there are a lot of what we think are awesome things in the pipeline.”


Stranger Things stars Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Noah Schnapp, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Priah Ferguson, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Maya Hawke, Joe Keery, David Harbour, Winona Ryder and Brett Gelman.

Disney's blockbuster 'Lilo & Stitch' earns a huge $63 million domestically in its second weekend for a jaw-dropping global haul of $610 million, while Tom Cruise's final 'M:I' movie also continues to impress. 


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	While its fate isn't yet sealed, Karate Kid: Legends opened behind expectations at the domestic box office, despite teaming original star Ralph Macchio and beloved action legend Jackie Chan, who starred in the 2010 redux.


	Sony is estimating a third-place North American opening of $21 million from 3,809 theaters for the male-fueled film (rival studios show it coming in closer to $20 million). Heading into the weekend, tracking had the pic debuting to $25 million; three weeks ago, that number was a far more promising $35 million. Overseas, where it began rolling out early, Legends took in another $12 million for an early foreign tally of $26 million and $47 million globally (it has only opened in 40 percent of the marketplace).

					Ralph Macchio Insisted That 'Karate Kid: Legends' Delay Its Release Until After 'Cobra Kai'		
			









	Regardless of a soft opening, Sony remains confident that the PG-13 film will sport strong chops, thanks to an A- CinemaScore and solid exits. And its net production budget was a modest $45 million before marketing.


	Critics are far more divided than audiences when it comes to Karate Kid: Legends, which features Ben Wang in the titular role. His character is mentored by both the characters played by Macchio, star of the classic 1984 movie and, far more recently, Netflix's acclaimed Cobra Kai series, which ran for six seasons and ended earlier this year.


	In 2010, Sony successfully reinvigorated the franchise with The Karate Kid, starring Chan opposite Jaden Smith. The movie, opening to $55 million domestically, was one of the year's top hits. 


	Box office pundits are already speculating that franchise fans may have been sated by Cobra Kai, at least for the time being. The series was viewed as a sequel to the first three films; the threequel was released in 1989. They add that middling reviews for Legends certainly aren't helping.

	











	And then there's the Lilo & Stitch and Mission: Impossible factor. Both movies continued to do strong business in their second outings after fueling a record Memorial Day weekend.


Lilo & Stitch — which has shattered numerous records and is likely to become the first Hollywood movie of 2025 to join the billion-dollar box office club — continues to exceed all expectations. It remained No. 1 this weekend both domestically and overseas as it zoomed past the $610 million mark globally after  grossing another $63 million domestically from 4,410 locations and $113.1 million overseas.


	In less than two weeks, the pic has already become the second top-grossing Hollywood release of 2025 behind Warner Bros.' A Minecraft Movie ($947.1 million). Ditto for North America, where it has now passed up Ryan Coogler's sleeper hit Sinners ($350.1 million).


	The live-action update of the 2002 animated film has also played a key role in helping Disney become the first Hollywood studio of 2025 to cross the $2 billion mark in worldwide ticket sales, including $1 billion domestically.


	Paramount and Skydance's Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning, starring Tom Cruise in his final turn as uber spy Ethan Hunt, remained squarely in second place with an estimated sophomore outing of $27.2 million from 3,861 theaters for a 10-day North American tally of $122 million. Final Reckoning is benefiting greatly from its exclusive Imax run.


	Overseas, the Christopher McQuarrie-directed pic earned another $76.1 million for an international cume of $103.1 million and $353.8 million globally. M:I has always done big business in China, and Final Reckoning is no exception, even if returns from the Chinese box office are far less than what they used to be. The movie, debuting there on Saturday, has already become the top-grossing imported title of the year.

	











	In its third outing, Warner/New Line's Final Destination: Bloodlines came in fourth domestically with $10.8 million from 3,134 locations for a North American total of $111.7 million and $229.3 million worldwide. 


Karate Kid wasn't the only new nationwide offering. Danny and Michael Philippou's highly anticipated horror pic Bring Her Back, from A24 and starring Sally Hawkins, rounded out the top five with an estimated $7.1 million from 2,449 cinemas. The critically acclaimed film was graced with a B+ CinemaScore from audiences, which is like an A when it comes to the horror genre. Overseas, where Sony is assisting in releasing, it earned $1 million from its first eight markets.


	At the specialty box office, Wes Anderson's The Phoenician Scheme opened in six locations domestically and secured the top per-location average of the year to date, or $95,000, following its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival. Focus Features and Indian Paintbrush partnered on the film, whose ensemble cast is led by Benicio del Toro, and sports an early international total of $6.2 million and $6.8 million globally.

	Victor starred in Coco as the protective Aubelita, and the film went on to garner two Academy Awards for best animated feature and best original song, “Remember Me,” written by Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez. Notably, Coco featured an all-Latin cast. 


	After Disney announced Coco 2 was in development at Disney's Annual Shareholder Meeting earlier this year, Victor showed her excitement for the project on Instagram. 


	“It was my great pleasure and experience working with the incredibly talented Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina! We get to do it again,” she wrote, though the official cast for Coco 2 has not yet been confirm. “This is what we've all been waiting for! I'm so excited! Coco shared a Mexican tradition that is now celebrated around the world in unity. An amazing amount of work and talent goes into the creation of this unique film.”

Gloria Calderón Kellett, whom Victor starred alongside in Prime Video's With Love, shared a heartfelt Instagram post Saturday, recalling when they first crossed paths on the set of The Ortegas and “she radiated talent, humor and grace.” 


	“It's hard to say goodbye to the incomparable Renee Victor,” she wrote. “Years later, she would become my TV mom, Marta, on With Love — a role named after my paternal grandmother. It felt like destiny. She brought that character to life with such warmth, sharp wit, and elegance. And let's be honest — she had the best legs in the biz!” 


	“Renee was a true pro. A scene-stealer. A joy. A blessing. Her artistry made everything better, and her presence made every set brighter,” she wrote in the conclusion of the post.

Netflix brought out Gaga to perform at the streamer's L.A. fan event Saturday (May 31).

	Ashley Iasimone



	Netflix has confirmed Lady Gaga will appear in season two of Wednesday, the hit series starring Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Addams. Gaga will be “playing the mysterious and enigmatic Rosaline Rotwood, a legendary Nevermore teacher who crosses paths with Wednesday,” according to a company release on Netflix.com.

	











	The streaming service first announced the news of Gaga as guest star at its Tudum fan event at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles on Saturday (May 31), The Hollywood Reporter says.


	Gaga marked the occasion by making an appearance herself, taking the stage for a Wednesday-themed set that had her “emerging from a coffin” while “backed by a cadre of Addams Family-esque dancers,” reports THR. The coffin lid was inscribed with “HERE LIES THE MONSTER QUEEN.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The pop star performed Mayhem tracks “Zombieboy” and “Abracadabra” before returning to her coffin. In the middle of her mini set was a dance performance to the Cramps' “Goo Goo Muck,” inspired by the viral dance scene from Wednesday‘s first season. 


Wednesday is the latest acting credit for the singer, who led the films Joker: Folie à Deux, A Star Is Born and House of Gucci, and was in two seasons of FX's American Horror Story. Gaga won an Oscar for best original song and was nominated for best actress for A Star Is Born in 2019.

	










A post shared by Netflix US (@netflix)


	Though Gaga's Rosaline Rotwood isn't seen, a six-minute preview for season two of Wednesday arrived Saturday night, giving fans of the show a glimpse at how Wednesday Addams (Ortega) spent her summer: locked in a serial killer's (Haley Joel Osment) basement.


	Watch the first six minutes of the second season of Wednesday below. Season two premieres on Aug. 6.

""I don't think I'll put myself in a position that I add this much pressure to myself again,"" the artist said in a video published by The New York Times.

Next year things might look a bit different for Miley Cyrus, who says in a conversation with The New York Times that she's looking forward to a “rebirth of how I look at my career.”


	When asked about her relationship with mainstream success, Cyrus, who just released her ninth studio album, Something Beautiful, spoke of what she sees next for herself as an artist.


	“I think it's winding down, my attachment to mainstream success,” Cyrus said in the video interview, published on Saturday, May 31. (A shortened version of the full interview was published on the outlet's website.)

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	“I kind of feel like this album, it's definitely not a ‘last lap' — I'm definitely not going 180 in my career necessarily right now — but I think it's potentially the last time I'll do it exactly this way,” she noted.


	The singer announced Something Beautiful in March, when she gave fans a first listen to album track “Prelude” and the set's title track. She's since released two more singles, “End of the World” and “More to Lose,” and just before the album's release held a private concert hosted by TikTok at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. Still to come is a visual component to the project, a film set to show in theaters for one night only on June 12 in the United States and Canada, and internationally on June 27. 

	











	Cyrus — whose previous full-length release, 2023's Endless Summer Vacation, reached No. 3 on the Billboard 200 — said, “I'm taking a big bet on this one [Something Beautiful]. I'm all in. But I don't think I'll put myself in a position that I add this much pressure to myself again.”


	“A lot of things are going to change about that for me, towards the end [of this year] and the beginning of next year. That's really kind of my focus, of using this year to kind of wind that idea I've had of myself down. There's a song on the album called ‘Reborn' and it's kind of about this. I feel like next year for me is gonna be kind of this rebirth of how I do things and how I look at my career,” said Cyrus.


	The conversation clocked in at nearly an hour, between Cyrus' in-person sit-down with the publication and a follow-up call. Among the many topics discussed with candor: her present-day relationship with each parent (Tish and Billy Ray Cyrus), whether she's interested in being a parent one day, what happened when she did E.M.D.R. therapy, growing up as a child star and why finally winning her first Grammy (for “Flowers,” in 2024) was so significant, and — when interviewer Lulu Garcia-Navarro brought up Cyrus' peers in the industry — her rapport with other female pop stars.


	“I find the relationship between female pop stars to be really interesting and often very fraught,” Garcia-Navarro suggested, to which Cyrus joked: “Divas.”


	“Is that what you think is happening?” she asked Cyrus.


	“I mean, probably on my end,” the singer said, and then clarified, “I don't mind the word diva. Maybe I'm a little diva.”


	Cyrus added, “It's kind of cool. It's a fantasy. You don't have to be famous to be a diva — just be a diva. Diva does not mean difficult for no reason.” When asked whether she thinks she's difficult, she quipped: “I'm difficult, but not for no reason.”

	











	The interviewer followed up by prompting, “You have said you don't feel part of the cohort of singers of your generation and age group … You've held yourself apart in a certain way.” She asked Cyrus why.


	“I don't think it's so much of a conscious choice,” Cyrus said. “I think for me, my persona — the public's idea of me — is ‘on,' in some way, but in my own time, I'm very off. I like no makeup, my hair up messy. I don't even look in the mirror in my own time.”


	“It's not that I haven't found it,” she said. “I haven't looked very hard. I'm sure girls in my community are going like, ‘Well, that's me too and you haven't reached out.' No, I haven't … I like doing my two worlds.”


	Cyrus related her real life to that of her teenaged Hannah Montana persona.


	“Maybe it's something subconsciously from the show, like from Hannah Montana where I think my famous person has one life and then as a regular person I have another life,” she explained. “I think maybe subconsciously it programmed me — not even joking — to think who I am at home and who I am as a performer are kind of like two separate identities, and actually they are.”


	Elsewhere in the conversation the former Disney star talked about the younger generation of pop singers, including Sabrina Carpenter, whom she's met and sometimes worries about due to the hectic schedule the “Espresso” hitmaker keeps. “Every time I see her I have the urge to ask her if she's OK. I'll see she's performing in Ireland, and then the next day she's doing a show in Kansas. And I'm like, ‘I don't know how that could be physically OK,' because I was in that situation. I know what it feels like to fry yourself, and I don't want anyone else to get fried. But I like all the new girls. I think they're all unique and are very found,” Cyrus said.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SUNDAY AM UPDATE: Saturday was kind to most movies in the top 10 and saw lifts over Friday, in particular Disney's Lilo & Stitch and Paramount's Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning which were respectively up 51% and 55%. Lilo & Stitch is coming in at $63 million for its second frame, while Mission: Impossible 8 is at $27.3M.


	Disney executives are skipping around the Burbank lot as Lilo & Stitch is catapulting the studio past the $1 billion mark at the domestic box office with a 30% market share. Disney is the first studio to pass that milestone YTD. Excluding 2020, Disney has grossed $1B+ domestically for 20 consecutive years since 2005, the only studio to accomplish this. 

	











	Sony is calling Karate Kid: Legends at $21M but others see it under $20M, like in the $19M range. Oh, no. I mean, if Sony called it at $20M given that everyone is in the high $19M range today, that's not a big deal. But nobody knows where the extra $1M+ is coming from. Saturday was at $7.3M, off 5% from Friday/previews of $7.7M. If you back out the $2.3M previews, Saturday was an up day for the Jackie Chan and Ralph Macchio team-up at +35%.




			Watch on Deadline		







	I'm told that Karate Kid: Legends came on tracking at $35M and dropped to the mid-$20Ms before this weekend. Oh, jeez.


	Why wasn't there a big rush to this film? Why is it under its projections? It's the Cobra Kai streaming Netflix effect, dummy. With the Karate Kid audience conditioned to stay at home, what's the big reason for them to run out and watch another fight tournament onscreen? Yes, as we said before, being in the shadow of Lilo & Stitch doesn't help given the overlap of certain demos. Families are on a budget and they're going to put their money toward the title that kids are nagging them to see (tracking does take this into consideration with kids under 12).

	











	RelishMix noticed negative chatter, concentrated around the fear that Karate Kid: Legends wouldn't live up to the hype and the success of previous installments. Comments included, “I mean the story is same as every Karate Kid film,” and, “I do not know how I feel about this. I'm half terrified.”


	Call it what you will — $19M-$20M. Note that while it's under expectations, the picture will be somewhat profitable. It's an OK piece of business at a $45M net production cost, even though I'm sure Sony would have loved to see bigger numbers.


	Let's not forget the great exits, which should help the film hold.


Karate Kid: Legends was originally dated for June 7, 2024, before the strikes pushed it to December 13, 2024. When it came to business for this film, Sony had second thoughts and chose kids out of school for the summer over a crazy multiple over Christmas, thus moving Karate Kid: Legends back to a post-Memorial Day weekend slot.


	Elsewhere this weekend is A24's Bring Her Back — an excellent, original gross movie with great exits. Beyond the B+ CinemaScore, there's 80% audience on Rotten Tomatoes with a big hug from critics at 90% certified fresh. Just like A24 was trying to campaign for Toni Colette for Hereditary, there's an awards push to be done here for Sally Hawkins. Though the movie is at the top of its forecasted range with $7M, it's a bit surprising it didn't overindex more and do a number beyond the Philippou brothers' first movie, Talk to Me ($10.4M), or at least on par. Remember that when it comes to these indie labels, it's a business of margins and slide rules in regards to P&A spend, from theatrical yield to profiting in the home windows. A 3x-4x multiple off a movie's opening (Midsommar, Heretic) is typically A24's theatrical goal on these genre movies; Talk to Me had a 4.6x (final domestic was $48.2M). That movie eased 39% in its second weekend. We'll see if Bring Her Back can bring more back.


Bring Her Back played best in the East and West and even throughout the U.S. and Canada. AMC Burbank was the pic's highest-grossing location with just under $30,000.


	As we said all weekend, even if the numbers for Karate Kid: Legends and Bring Her Back aren't dazzling, let's celebrate depth. All movies grossed an estimated $151M, up 130% from the same post-Memorial Day frame a year ago. I mean, Lilo & Stitch‘s second weekend at $63M reps 95% of what most movies grossed a year ago at $66M.

	10.) J-Hope Tour: Hope on Stage (TRAF) 631 theaters Sat $789K Sun $150K, 2-day $939K/Wk 1 Busting into the top 10 is Trafalgar Releasing's live broadcast of the grand finale of j-hope's first solo world tour from Osaka Japan's Kyocera Dome.

Global projection (sans Japan) for the weekend stands at $4.1M.


	11.) The Accountant 2 (AMZ) 820 (-1182) theaters, Fri $214K (-56%) Sat $331K Sun $231K 3-day $776K (-62%), Total $65M/Wk 6


Notables:


The Phoenician Scheme (Foc) 6 theaters, Fri $270K Sat $160K Sun $140K 3-day $570K, PTA $95K, Wk 1As we said Saturday, it's the biggest per screen of the year to date. Updated on individual theaters through Saturday: NYC's Angelika $121K, AMC's Lincoln Square is $96K, L.A.'s AMC Century City is $58K, L.A.'s AMC the Grove $55K, AMC Burbank $53,400 and NYC's Alamo Brooklyn stands just under $44K. Movie is 77% certified fresh with critics on Rotten Tomatoes. No audience score yet. Asteroid City, Focus Features' previous Cannes Film Festival premiere and theatrical release with Wes Anderson, had a RT critic score of 76% certified fresh and audience score of 66%.


SATURDAY AM: It's a solid weekend following the Memorial Day holiday with all titles driving around $144M worth of business, +117% from the post-holiday doldrums a year ago. Let's rejoice and take it. 


	No, it's not the biggest for the post 4-day holiday during post pandemic times — that belongs to 2023 when Sony's all-pleasing fanboy animated movie, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse led all titles to a $205M+ marketplace. However, out of 22 weekends in 2025, only ten of 'em have grossed north of $100M-plus. Let's be pleased. I'm sure those novelty popcorn buckets at the circuits are still flying off counters. 


	Disney's Lilo & Stitch is still on track for a $60M-$64M second weekend, Paramount's Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning is showing that Imax makes a difference in weekend 2 with a -58% hold and $26.7M, and Sony's Karate Kid: Legends…the studio is forecasting $21M-$23M opening off a $7.5M Friday. Rivals see it lower in the high teens, however, as we said yesterday, it boils down to Saturday business and whether that tips more families into both Karate Kid, and Lilo & Stitch toward the higher end of its range. 


	There is a bit of overlap between the two films demo wise, even though Lilo skews more female at 62% and Karate Kid: Legends more male at 59%. Their men under 25 demos are close (Legends is 22% to Lilo‘s 18%) and their women over 25 as well (Legends is 30% and Lilo 34%). Yes, of course, substantially more moms are taking kids to see Lilo.


	Net production cost on Karate Kid: Legends was $45M before P&A. It will be interesting to see how big overseas is. The franchise was born at a time in 1984 before studios relied on overseas. With Jackie Chan in the 2010 reboot, the foreign box office on that movie edged out domestic, $182.5M to $176.5M and that's without China, however, Japan made a great $17.4M. 


	Men over 25 for Karate Kid were 37% and women under 25 the lowest turnout at 11%. Best grades for the crossover comes from women over 25 with 95%. Diversity demos were 36% Caucasian, 31% Hispanic and Latino, 16% Asian American and 12% Black.

	











	Great exits though for Karate Kid: Legends with an A- CinemaScore, the same grade as the 1986 sequel, Karate Kid II. The 2010 Chan version landed an A. Of course, the biggest reason on Screen Engine/Comscore's PostTrak why people bought tickets to Legends is because it's part of a franchise they love (46%). Also interesting to note that of all the moviegoers going to see Karate Kid: Legends, 68% of them said they have Netflix as their leading streaming service. That's where Sony's output deal is in the pay-one, and it's also where Cobra Kai lives. 


	A24's Bring Her Back after a $3.1M Friday is looking at $7M-$8M in 5th place. For horror films, especially an A24 one, which typically divides audiences, the movie, wow, landed a B+ CinemaScore. Also, four stars and 80% positive and a 57% definite recommend. High praise. Hopefully that all works in the film's favor throughout this weekend and leg-wise. Thirty one percent of those who bought tickets said they went because it's a Philippou twins movie, and 48% said it's because it's a horror movie.


	Men over 25 mostly turned out at 42%, as well as women over 25 at 28%, with an even amount of men and women under 25 at 15% apiece. Diversity demos were 50% Caucasian, 23% Latino and Hispanic, 14% Black and 9% Asian American. Most influential forms of advertisement for Bring Her Back was social media at 21% per those polled by PostTrak which isn't surprising as it's an A24 movie, and that's where they focus most of their P&A spend. Those polled also said buzz from friends/family was influential (15%) as well as the in-theater trailer (14%). Social media universe across TikTok, Instagram, etc. was 50M per RelishMix, which is ahead of Hereditary (44M) before opening and just under NEON's Cuckoo (53M, $3M opening). 


	Positive word of mouth that RelishMix spotted included fans of the Philippou's Talk to Me, as well as excitement over their trailer, some horror fans remarking that the movie looks like a throwback to 1989's Pet Sematary.

	A24 financed the movie for around $20M I hear, with foreign rights sold going to Sony for around $13M, I understand.  


	Also, as expected, Focus Features' Wes Anderson movie, The Phoenician Scheme, is heading toward the best theater average of 2025 year to date with $95K from six NYC and LA theaters. Not as high as the director's Asteroid City two years ago ($142,2K), but robust enough for the specialty sector post pandemic which is desperate for dollars. 3-day looks like $570K in 12th place. The Angelika in NY led all theaters with $78K yesterday where they had a premium $62 ticket that included an “Immersive Experience” and popcorn. AMC Lincoln Square did $63K, LA's AMC Century City posted $38K, AMC The Grove a similar take, AMC Burbank $31.3K and Alamo Brooklyn was around $23K. Muy bien.

	Notables: 


The Phoenician Scheme (Foc) 6 theaters, Fri $270K, 3-day $570K, PTA $95K, Wk 1 


FRIDAY AFTERNOON: Disney's Lilo & Stitch is coming in right where we were seeing it — at $60M in weekend 2, -59%, at 4,410 locations. That hold is similar to that of the second weekend of Little Mermaid, which was also a Memorial Day theatrical release. Today looks like $17M for Lilo‘s second Friday, -70%. Running total for the Dean Fleischer Camp directed movie by Sunday is $277M. 


	However, Sony's Karate Kid: Legends is looking lighter than forecasts with a $20M opening after a $7M-$8M Friday that includes previews in 3,809 theaters. That would put the Ralph Macchio and Jackie Chan team-up in third place behind Paramount's second weekend of Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning, with a $7.7M second Friday and $27.3M second weekend, -57% at 3,861. That's better than Dead Reckoning‘s second weekend decline of -65% sans Imax screens. Running total for the Christopher McQuarrie directed, Tom Cruise title by Sunday looks like $122.6M. 


	The anticipation is that Saturday will work in both Lilo and Karate Kid: Legends‘ favor.


	Fourth is New Line's Final Destination: Bloodlines with $2.8M today at 3,134 and a third weekend of $10M, -48%, for a running total by Sunday of $110.9M.


	Fifth is A24's Bring Her Back with $3M today (including previews), and $6M-$7M for the weekend at 2,409 sites.   


	Even if Karate Kid: Legends comes in less than expected, we are in far better shape than a year ago when the post Memorial Day weekend only did $66M per Box Office Mojo (there weren't any major studio releases and Garfield Movie led with a second weekend take of $14M). The top five movies this weekend (at the high end) are already grossing north of $124M.


PREVIOUS FRIDAY AM: Sony's Karate Kid: Legends grossed $2.3M from previews that began at 2 p.m. Thursday.


	The PG-13 movie is a vortex of old school and new school: Ralph Macchio's Daniel-san, Jackie Chan's Mr. Han and, shhhhh, the Cobra Kai gang (I mean, is it really a secret?). Forecast for the movie is $25M-$30M in a marketplace where Disney's Lilo & Stitch is overpowering with a potential $60M second frame. Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning also is hoping to hold with those Imax screens, around $32M or less.


	Critics like this Karate Kid a little less than the 2010 Chan one, 55% Rotten vs. 67% fresh. Karate Kid: Legends received 4 stars on PostTrak and a 68% definite recommend from definite audiences, 4 1/2 stars from parents and a 63 definite recommend, and kids under 12 with 4½ stars and a 79% must-see right away. Boys ages 10-12 at 64% made up the majority of the under-12 set; that demo is an essential portion of the Cobra Kai cult. Overall, men showed up at 60% last night.


Karate Kid: Legends‘ Thursday night is just ahead of the $1.9M that Sony/Alcon's The Garfield Movie reboot made last May before a Friday of $8.4M and 3-day of $24M.

	











Karate Kid: Legends was made for $45M net before P&A; that's $5M more than the 2010 version cost (unadjusted for inflation). The Karate Kid franchise is 41 years old and counts $620M at the global box office from five previous movies; the bulk of that figure is from the Chan/Jaden Smith version 15 years ago, which made $359M worldwide.


	A24's Danny and Michael Philippou horror movie Bring Her Back made $850K in previews at 2,409 theaters that began at 4 p.m. Thursday. That figure is just under A24's fall sleeper Heretic, which made $1.2M in previews starting at 7 p.m. before turning into a $4.3M Friday and $10.8M opening. The Philippou twins' previous A24 movie, 2022's Talk to Me, opened to $10.4M. A good definite-recommend from the fanboy crowd last night for Bring Her Back at 58%, with women over 25 giving the movie its best positive score at 83%. The Thursday crowd was male-heavy at 57% to female's 43%. Women overall enjoyed it more than the guys, 83% to 77%. Go Sally Hawkins. The pre-weekend outlook is $5M-$7M. On Rotten Tomatoes, Bring Her Back has been stamped with 88% certified fresh. No audience score yet.


Lilo & Stitch ends its first week with $217M at 4,410 theaters, after $9.2M yesterday, -9% from Wednesday. The pic's first week is 15% behind that the $255M for  Inside Out 2, which ended its run at $652.9M, and it's 9% behind Moana 2‘s first seven days of $239.3M (final $460.4M). No, we're not saying the movie is doing badly, we're just trying to give you an idea of where Lilo & Stitch lives. While no one is forecasting this for Lilo & Stitch, sometimes these fan-fave Disney movies can go into overdrive, i.e. Inside Out 2 owns the best second weekend ever for a PG movie of $101.2M. And nobody saw that coming…


Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning ends its first week with an estimated $95.3M at 3,857, which is 7% ahead of the first week of 2018's Mission: Impossible – Fallout ($220.1M final domestic) and 4.7% ahead of the first seven days of 2022's Dead Reckoning (final domestic B.O. was $172.6M).


	The rest of the top 5 for the week:


	3. Final Destination Bloodlines (WB/NL) 3,523 theaters, Thu $1.85M (-13% from Wed), Week $30.7M (-56%), Total $100.9M/Wk 2It was the highest grossing of the franchise out of the gate. Nothing in its way.


	4. Thunderbolts* (Dis) 3,180 theaters, Thu $765K (-10%), Wk $14.8M (-36%), Total $177M/Wk 4


	5. Sinners (WB) 2,632 theaters, Thu $880k (-15%), Wk $14.06M (-37%), Total $261.8M/Wk 6

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor


Refresh for latest…: With a pair of phenomenal holds, Lilo & Stitch and Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning continued to dominate global turnstiles this weekend.


	To wit: Disney's Lilo & Stitch added $113.1M from 52 offshore markets, lifting the international box office cume to $330.7M. The overseas drop was just 28%. The worldwide total through today is $610.8M.


	Paramount/Skydance's Mission: Impossible 8's sophomore offshore session was good for $76.1M, a great 33% dip from opening. The international total on the Tom Cruise-starrer is now $231.2M, and global is $353.8M.

	Before we dig into details on the above, note that Sony's Karate Kid: Legends, which kicked off international rollout in early May ahead of its wide global release this weekend, kicked up another $12M from 43 offshore markets this session. That takes the international cume to $26M through Sunday. Alongside domestic, the global gross to date is $47M.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Major markets to come on this one are: Australia (June 5), Italy (June 5), China (June 7), Spain (August 8), France (August 13) and Japan (August 29).


	Now, turning back to Lilo & Mission… 


	Disney's live-action take on the 2002 animated adventure has already become the No. 2 studio release of the year internationally, and is the No. 1 non-local title across Europe (except for Denmark and Finland), and in all markets across Latin America as well as Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Philippines and Thailand.


	Notable holds this frame include France (0%), Germany (-12%), UK (-28%), Australia (-29%), Brazil (-34%), Spain (-36%), Mexico (-40%), Korea (-44%) and Italy (-46%).


	Some markets saw increases, including Netherlands (+21%), Belgium (+13%), Saudi Arabia (+8%), Poland (+7%), Singapore (+3%) and Ukraine (+1%).


	New this session was Hong Kong ($1.1M), where the little blue alien opened at No. 1 and 4% ahead of The Minecraft Movie.


	Among other benchmarks, L&S is notably the 2nd highest grossing Disney live-action title of all-time across the Latin American region (behind only The Lion King); the 2nd highest grossing Disney live-action title ever in Mexico, 3rd highest in Colombia and 4th highest in Brazil.

	











	Further, it is the highest grossing film of 2025 in Italy (non-local), Brazil, Mexico and Thailand.


	The Top 5 to date are: Mexico ($45.9M), UK ($34.5M), France ($23.1M), Brazil ($21.6M) and Germany ($18.1M).


	Japan opens next weekend.


	As for Mission 8, audiences continued to accept.  Notable strong holds were seen in Netherlands (-4%), Germany (-10%), France (-21%), Indonesia (-21%) and Japan (-23%).


	Also notably, China debuted this frame. This is a market that typically gravitates towards the franchise, but has been wonky of late with Hollywood fare. So, great news that The Final Reckoning became the highest-grossing imported film in a single day this year and the fastest imported film to reach the RMB 100M mark in 2025. The gross there is a strong $25.2M while social scores are the highest of the franchise.

	The Top 5 are: UK ($12.5M), Mexico ($11.2M), India ($7.6M), Philippines ($6.9M) and France ($6.7M).


	The film has also become the biggest horror movie of all time in Pakistan, and the 4th best ever there for a WB title.

Lady Gaga, the one and only “monster queen,” rose out of her coffin to perform a rousing medley of tunes that were very much on-theme with Wednesday, closing out Netflix‘s Tudum with a nod to her newly confirmed cameo role in the highly anticipated second season of the Jenna Ortega YA drama.


	The Emmy, Grammy and Oscar winner took the stage at Los Angeles' Kia Forum following the premiere of the first six minutes of Wednesday Season 2, which also showcased new cast member Haley Joel Osment, who plays a serial killer infinitely more likely to be a victim than the eponymous macabre teen he has kidnapped.

	Beginning her performance at the streamer's annual event, Gaga stepped out from a vertical coffin amid a sea of background dancers dressed in the vein of Gomez Addams (Luis Guzmán), singing track “Zombieboy” off of her recently released Mayhem, critically acclaimed and largely viewed as a return to form of sorts for the pop/dance icon.




			Watch on Deadline		







	After shrugging off her coat and commandeering the stage in a black bodysuit, the consummate artist launched into the viral dance — limbs delightfully flailing — that first launched her involvement with the show, which stemmed from a social media video that supplanted The Cramps' “Goo Goo Muck” with Gaga's “Bloody Mary” in a scene featuring Ortega's character's uninhibited dancing (choreographed by the actress herself) during a function at her boarding school.


	As the performance shifted its focus to a gang of Wednesdays, Ortega crossed the stage in character to sit at a full dining table filled with scrumptious spider webs and decapitated heads à la carte, allowing Gaga a costume change into an avant garde red velvet dress. She then capped off her medley with a rendition of crowd-pleaser “Abracadabra,” the second single off of Mayhem.












	Ending her eight-minute performance to the jaunty Addams family theme, Gaga found her way back to the coffin, blowing a kiss to the audience as it closed to display the words: “Here lies the monster queen.”


	Part 1 of the hit series' second season will debut Aug. 6, with Part 2 following Sept. 3.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Former 'Voice' Coach Usher Acted as Groomsmen at Fellow Music Star's Weekend Wedding","https://entertainmentnow.com/music/usher-groomsmen-wedding/","Sun, 01 Jun 2025 15:50:01 GMT","

 Singer Usher spent his weekend in Mexico as a groomesmen in fellow singer Robin Thicke's wedding.

Thicke married his long time model fiancée April Love Geary in a lavish ceremony in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, on Friday, May 30, according to PEOPLE. The two were engaged for years before tying the knot.

A post shared by People Magazine (@people)

The singer's 15-year-old son, Julian, whom he shares with his ex-wife Paula Patton, also served as a groomesman for his father's big day.

In addition, Thicke paid tribute to his late father Alan Thicke with an empty chair that was decorated with a banner, per PEOPLE.

“In loving memory of Alan Thicke, Father of the groom,” it read. “Although you cannot be here with us today, your love and light remain in our hearts.”

Usher and Thicke have been friends for over 20 years and frequently collaborate together.

While Thicke appeared on a April 2023 podcast of “We In Miami,” he dished on how the two became instant friends. The “Blurred Lines” singer even decided to FaceTime the singer and had a brief conversation on air.

A post shared by We In Miami Podcast (@weinmiamipodcast)

“Well, we became instant friends. We just really both love music, and we had the same influences growing up,” Thicke told the hosts. “He's just a really sweet, kind human being.”

Thicke wrote “Can U Handle It?” off of Usher's 2004 album “Confessions” album and received a writing and producing credit for it. The two also were featured together on Quincey Jones' “The Secret Garden” back in 2010.

Academy Award winner Leo DiCaprio and comedian Ken Jeong were also in attendance for the nuptials, according to TMZ.

Thicke and Geary first got engaged on Christmas Eve in 2018. “YES YES 1000x YES,” the now 30-year-old wrote at the time.

A post shared by April Love (@aprillovegeary)

After years of being engaged, Thicke proposed for a second time with a new ring for Geary, just days before they wed in Mexico. The second engagement happened while the duo went to Cannes, France.

“Robin surprised me during our trip to Cannes by proposing to me again with a new ring that one of my best friends made,” she wrote. “I'm so obsessed with it, thank you!!!”

A post shared by April Love (@aprillovegeary)

The couple share three children together — Mia Love, Lola Alain and Luca Patrick. The couple had their son Luca serve as the ring bearer and had him walk down the aisle holding a box with the writing “ring security” on it, according to the New York Post.

“Law & Order” actress Odelya Halevi just tied the knot!

Halevi married luxury real estate agent Aaron Mazor in Tel Aviv, Israel, on May 30, according to PEOPLE.

The actress, who was born and raised in Israel, tied the knot in front of 180 guests at Ronit Farm. She gushed to PEOPLE on the big day.

“For me, Israel isn't just a place; it's home. It holds some of my most cherished memories. The people, the energy, the land — it's where my heart always returns,” she said.

The couple wanted a destination wedding and had to start planning a year in advance to coordinate everyone's schedules.

They chose Ronit Farm due to the beauty of its natural and luscious scenery.

A post shared by Ronit Farm חוות רונית (@ronitfarm)

“We chose to marry in the afternoon, surrounded by nature — trees, water and the quiet serenity of the landscape. It felt like a fairy tale,” Halevi added. “The earth tones we picked were meant to reflect that setting — natural, warm and grounded.”

In addition to the stunning setting, the guests dined on a buffet which highlighted the cuisine of Israel.

“The food in Israel is some of the best in the world, and we wanted our guests to have the ability to try it all,” Halevi said.

Halevi and Mazor ended up meeting through a mutual friend: comedian Andrew Schulz. The two were each separately invited to one of his performances at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, Halevi told PEOPLE.

“We met briefly during intermission and sparks flew. After the show, we headed to the afterparty where we fell into a meaningful conversation,” she said. “Aaron thought I was a little kooky, and I knew right away that he was a keeper.”

The 36-year-old announced her engagement to Mazor in a comical Instagram post on August 31, 2023.

“We're no longer dating @aaron.mazor,” Halevi posted with an image of the two as she showed her new ring.

A post shared by Odelya Halevi (@odelya_halevi_)

Prior to her marriage, Halevi told Us Weekly in October 2024 she will use the iconic “Law & Order” “dun dun” sound if she gets into a disagreement with Mazor.

“When I'm in an argument with my fiancé, Aaron, he always thinks he's right about certain things,” she began. “When I win an argument, I just go, ‘Dun dun. I rest my case.'”

Halevi joined the cast of “Law & Order” in season 21.

Long before “I Know What You Did Last Summer” and “Godford's Park” made him a major big screen presence, Ryan Phillippe's “One Life to Live” character broke ground on television. Phillippe portrayed Billy Douglas between 1992-93, the first gay teenager depicted on daytime TV.

In an interview with People, the “Cruel Intentions” star said that, among the large volume of fan mail he received during his time on the series, many came from parents writing that the character “gave [them] a way to connect with [their] LGBTQ child.” Kids, meanwhile, wrote, “I've never seen someone represent me in any entertainment before in my life.”

“As that job progressed, I realized how important it was to some people,” Phillippe said. “And I was only 17 years old, so you don't really have a sense of that. It was such a different time, but I very much matured through having had that experience and seeing the impact that it had for others.”




			Popular on IndieWire		






In the early ‘90s, at the height of the AIDS epidemic, gay roles were only beginning to break into the mainstream. Phillippe's character predated Tom Hanks' Oscar-winning performance in “Philadelphia,” radical comedies like “The Birdcage,” and Ellen's earth-shattering coming out episode on her self-titled sitcom. Phillippe said that the storyline made him afraid, being that it was such a different time.

 










“I think there were some fears associated with the point in time that we were at and it being before so many walls and ceilings have been broken in that regard,” Phillippe recalled. “But I know that any fears that anyone had about me doing it immediately went away once I saw the reaction that it got from the people who viewed it.”

Phillippe previously discussed on the impact of his role in a 2010 interview with The Advocate.

“One kid said he'd considered suicide before seeing a character like him being accepted,” Phillippe said. “I also heard from a father, a mechanic, who hadn't spoken to his son since he came out. When our show came on in his shop, it gave him some insight and understanding as to who his son was, so it opened up communication between them.”

Phillippe currently stars in the Amazon Prime series “Motorheads.” Watch the trailer below:

Jacob Elordi is being split open and sewn back together again for Guillermo Del Toro‘s buzzy “Frankenstein” adaptation.

Elordi stars as the horrific creation, who is reanimated by scientist Victor Frankenstein, played by Oscar Isaac. Mia Goth, Christoph Waltz, Felix Kammerer, Lars Mikkelsen, David Bradley, and Christian Convery co-star.

Del Toro writes, directs, and produces the reimagining of Mary Shelley's monster story. The official logline reads: “Guillermo del Toro adapts Mary Shelley's classic tale of Victor Frankenstein, a brilliant but egotistical scientist who brings a creature to life in a monstrous experiment that ultimately leads to the undoing of both the creator and his tragic creation.”

Del Toro said while at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival that the feature is an “emotional story” and is “as personal as anything.” Del Toro continued, “I'm asking a question about being a father, being a son. … I'm not doing a horror movie — ever. I'm not trying to do that.”

 










Andrew Garfield was originally set to star in the lead role; due to the SAG-AFTRA strike, he exited the project following scheduling conflicts, with Elordi replacing him.  

Elordi teased to IndieWire that “Frankenstein” is going to be “one hell of a movie.” He later told IndieWire that the cast watched two Frankenstein films from the 1930s as references while filming del Toro's adaptation. “I think I've seen every creature film ever made. Strangely enough, Guillermo gave me a baby book — a baby development book — at the start of filming,” Elordi said. “[Those] two references I remember greatly.”

“Frankenstein” continues Netflix's partnership with del Toro, including the Oscar winner for Best Animated Feature Film, “Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio,” the anthology series “Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities,” and the animated films “Trollhunters: Rise of the Titans” and “Trollhunters: Tales of Arcadia.”

“Frankenstein” is produced by J. Miles Dale and was shot in Aderdeen, Scotland. 

“Gothic romance was born partially out of the fascination with ruins,” del Toro told Vanity Fair of the feature. “Sometimes they're more beautiful than the building complete because it's the clash of creation and destruction.” 

 










“Frankenstein” premieres on Netflix in November 2025. Check out the teaser below.

Adam Sandler has called in his team of all-stars for “Happy Gilmore 2.” Yes, the long-awaited sequel to the iconic 1996 sports comedy is actually finally happening, and there are more than a few starry cameos on the green. 

Sandler reprises his role as the titular unsuccessful ice hockey player turned unlikely golf pro. He is joined again by Julie Bowen and Christopher McDonald, who both are back in the roles they starred in for the 1996 original. Travis Kelce, Bad Bunny, Kid Cudi, and Sandler's “Uncut Gems” director Benny Safdie also are in the sequel, with Sandler telling IndieWire that Safdie has a “juicy part.” Rory McIlroy, Scottie Scheffler, Bryson DeChambeau, Brooks Koepka, Justin Thomas, and Will Zalatoris also star.

“Happy Gilmore 2” is directed by Kyle Newacheck (“Workaholics,” “What We Do in the Shadows”), who also previously helmed Sandler's 2019 film “Murder Mystery.” Sandler cowrote “Happy Gilmore 2” with Tim Herlihy, who also cowrote the original.

Sandler recently lamented the loss of former “Happy Gilmore” actor, alligator Morris, who died at an estimated age of 80. In the 1996 film, Morris infamously is confronted by Sandler's Happy; Morris grabs a golf ball on the green, leading Happy to realize that it is the same gator who chomped on the hand of his mentor, Chubbs (Carl Weathers).

“Goodbye, Morris. We are all gonna miss you,” Sandler tweeted after the news of Morris' passing was made public May 12. “You could be hard on directors, make-up artists, costumers — really anyone with arms or legs — but I know you did it for the ultimate good of the film.”

Sandler recalled how much the animal actor was missed on set for the sequel, saying, “I know your character's decapitation in the first movie precluded your participation in the sequel, but we all appreciated the fruit basket and the hilarious note,” he quipped. “I will miss the sound of your tail sliding through the tall grass, your cold, bumpy skin, but, most of all, I will miss your infectious laugh. Thanks to Mr. Young for taking care of you all these years, and vaya con dios, old friend.”

Wake up, release date. At Netflix Tudum 2025: The Live Event, the streamer announced that writer and director Rian Johnson's third installment in the “Knives Out” series will debut on Friday, December 12. Johnson also previewed footage from “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery,” which sees Daniel Craig returning as Benoit Blanc alongside Jeremy Renner, Cailee Spaeny, Andrew Scott, Mila Kunis, Thomas Haden Church, Glenn Close, Josh Brolin, Kerry Washington, Josh O'Connor and Daryl McCormack.

“This is the third Benoit Blanc movie that we've made. And one thing that we try and do — that we strive to do with each one of them — is to keep the audience guessing,” Johnson said at the event. “It's really important for us to figure out new ways every time, so that just when you think you have it figured out, a new twist comes along that you weren't expecting. And that's what makes these movies special.”

Johnson has been a longtime advocate of theatrical releases, and the original “Knives Out” film, distributed by Lionsgate, was a sleeper hit in 2019, grossing over $300 million worldwide. Its sequel “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery,” however, was picked up by Netflix and only given a limited, 696-screen release — grossing $15 million in just one week — before moving exclusively to Netflix on Dec. 23, 2022.

 










Johnson told Business Insider earlier this month that he didn't think theatrical releases were going anywhere.

 “We've seen, if you put a movie people want to see in the theaters, they are going to show up for it, and that experience of being in a full house and having that experience is so important,” Johnson said. “It's something that I love and I want more of in the world.”

But Netflix has had a cagey relationship with theaters. Last September, co-CEO Ted Sarandos said at the Royal Television Society's London Convention that theatrical releases are a “fairly insufficient way to distribute some movies,” according to THR.

Benoit Blanc himself previously stated he hoped “Wake Up Dead Man” would stay in theaters longer than its processor.

“The people I speak to — the fans, I suppose — all they want to do is take their families and go see it at the cinemas,” Craig said.

The cryptic sneak preview, stayed true to the tease Johnson posted a year ago, when he celebrated the “malleable” nature of the whodunit.

“There's a whole tonal spectrum from Carr to Christie, and getting to explore that range is one of the most exciting things about making Benoit Blanc movies,” he wrote.

“Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery” debuts on Friday, December 12. Watch the sneak preview below.

It has been three long years since fans last turned Upside Down with new episodes of “Stranger Things,” but during Tudum 2025: The Live Event, Netflix has finally revealed the fifth and final season will drop in two parts, with Vol. 1 releasing on Wednesday, November 26 and Vol. 2 hitting the streamer on Christmas Day. The series finale will debut on New Year's Eve. 

Star Finn Wolfhard told IndieWire in April that while he could not tease much “without them killing me,” wrapping production was “bittersweet.”

“It was super emotional, but we're all unbelievably happy with the finished product,” Wolfhard said. “We just can't believe it's over, but we can't wait until people see it.”

In January at Next on Netflix, the Duffer Brothers previewed footage from the finale season, with Ross Duffer calling it the “biggest and most ambitious” yet.

“It's like eight blockbuster movies,” he added.

Season 4 villain Vecna's portrayer Jamie Campbell Bower teased in an interview on iHeart Radio's “I've Never Said This Before With Tommy DiDario” that the latest outing is “bigger” and “completely insane.”

 










“If you thought last season was nuts, this season is just out of control, wild, like, it's bonkers. It really, really is,” Bowers said.

“At the same time, we think it's our most personal story,” Matt Duffer said in January. “It was super intense and emotional to film — for us and for our actors.”

Like Wolfhard, Matt, too, characterized the last lap as emotional.

“There was so much crying. The show means so much to all of us, and everyone put their hearts and souls into it. And we hope — and believe — that passion will translate to the screen,” Matt said.

Information regarding the fifth season has been trickling out with a steady drip, drip, drip since the Season 4 finale in July 2022. The episode titles were even revealed all the way back in November.

Those titles are: “The Crawl,” “The Vanishing Of…,” “The Turnbow Trap,” “Sorcerer,” “Shock Jock,” “Escape from Camazotz,” “The Bridge,” and the series finale of “The Rightside Up.”

Vol. 1 of “Stranger Things 5” debuts on Friday, November 26, with Vol. 2 streaming on Christmas Day and the series finale streaming on New Year's Eve.

The highly-anticipated third season of “Squid Game” has almost commenced — and the competition is more fierce than ever. Lee Jung-jae reprises his lead role for Season 3, which takes place three years after the events of the first “Squid Game.” Now, Gi-hun (Lee) is determined to destroy the games for good and has spent his prize money only to support his cause.

After Gi-hun convinced his fellow players to overpower the Squid Game guards during the Season 2 finale, Gi-hun is back confronting the Front Man (Lee Byung-hun) as Jun-ho (Wi Ha-joon) looks for the island.

 










“Squid Game 2” premiered in December 2024 and debuted to 68 million views in its first week. Netflix announced at the time that it was a record for the streamer and beat out the previous one set by “Wednesday” in 2022, which managed only 50.1 million views.

“Squid Game” Season 2 was seven episodes and ended on a cliffhanger. The season also introduced a new characters such as Dae-ho (Kang Ha-neul), Hyun-ju (Park Sung-hoon), Yong-sik (Yang Dong-geun), Geum-ja (Kang Ae-sim), Jun-hee (Jo Yu-ri), and the games' guard No-eul (Park Gyu-young).

 










Hwang Dong-hyuk is the creator and showrunner of “Squid Game.” IndieWire's review for Season 2 cited how the continuation felt like “the standard sequel to a Hollywood blockbuster” thanks in part to the “bigger, bolder style that tends to come with extra resources.” Critic Ben Travers wrote, “Season 2 is more like half-a-season, complete with a cliffhanger ending. For anyone satisfied with the first competition, the seven new episodes are still likely to provide enough visceral entertainment or vicarious thrills to merit a return trip. Season 2 continues to capitalize on a premise that's instinctively absorbing — who will win and who will lose, who will play with honor and who will debase themselves, who will we identify with and who will we vilify. The slightly trickier questions — the ones that last a little longer than the length of each game — are when and why: When does a character cross a line? Why do they cross it? And can we empathize with their justifications for doing so?”

Season 3 will be the final season for “Squid Game,” but the franchise could continue with David Fincher being rumored to direct an English-language spinoff for Netflix. 

“Squid Game” Season 3 premieres June 27 on Netflix. Check out the trailer below.

Jimi Hendrix did not want to be onstage at the Hollywood Bowl. A month earlier, in late July 1967, he and arguably England's hottest new band—The Jimi Hendrix Experience, a riotous power trio formed in London only 10 months earlier—had bailed on their first full American run after opening for the squeaky-clean heartthrobs of the Monkees for eight disastrous dates. Though they were, by many reports, the loudest and most aggressive band on earth—with Noel Redding on bass and Mitch Mitchell on drums—they had not been able to compete with the hormonal pleas of American pubescence for the headliners.

Maybe, though, this silence was worse. Just before releasing their debut album in the States, the Experience had accepted the invitation to warm up the audience at the Bowl for The Mamas & The Papas, the sweet-singing “California Dreamin'” quartet so afraid to offend they'd cropped their first album cover to bowdlerize the toilet originally left in the frame. The Experience seemed to shock almost everyone into submission, the crowd so quiet Hendrix wondered if anyone was there at all.

“Right now, we'd like to continue on—drearily—with a song named ‘Foxey Lady,'” he said near the set's middle, a moment that must have reminded him of trying to win over fans of Englebert Humperdinck's saccharine numbers during one early European tour. Hendrix forgot the second verse to “The Wind Cries Mary” and barely bothered trying to recover. A bit later, he sighed: “Well, dig: We've got two more records to do, thank god.” The trio slashed into “Purple Haze.”

It was the Summer of Love, sure, but it was also the Long, Hot Summer, with ubiquitous race riots providing a warped mirror of the overseas escalation in Vietnam. The moment was charged. And so, this lilywhite crowd was having none of the Black man in his butter-yellow pants and bejeweled jacket, even if he was letting them off easy. The Experience had opened with “Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,” maybe the biggest song in the world at the moment, then covered Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, and Bob Dylan. They'd omitted the murder ballad that became their first overseas smash, “Hey Joe,” and didn't come close to the despondent candor of “Manic Depression” or the astral slink of “Third Stone From the Sun.”

Sure, he played the guitar with his teeth and between his legs, but he didn't set the thing on fire, smash it to bits, or, as best as anyone remembers, even pretend to fuck it. The most aggressive Hendrix got was to tell whoever happened to be listening to put their hand over their heart for “the American and British anthem”—a feedback-flooded assault on “Wild Thing.” Folks had spent their $1.50, however, to sing along to “Monday, Monday” on a Friday night, not to be confronted with a coming revolution. Hendrix was happy to be done with them, too.

Only five days later, the revolution would arrive, anyway: As they tried to make Frank Sinatra's label relevant and solvent again, Reprise would finally release the American edition of Are You Experienced, 11 tracks that grafted the possibilities of The Information Age and the psychedelic counterculture onto the primal oomph of rock'n'roll. (A housekeeping note: From here on, I'll refer to the 1997 American edition of Are You Experienced, expanded to include that moment's singles and B-sides, as the definitive version; its sequence is simply sharper than its British counterpart.) At the Hollywood Bowl in August 1967, The Mamas & The Papas had swayed pleasantly to a corroding image of the present. Hendrix had tried to confront the crowd with the future and failed. Regardless, it was here now.

The Experience, of course, were not absolute outliers. Though Bob Dylan sat in upstate exile, he'd flipped his own amplifier switch two years earlier and already issued three snarling electric albums. In England, the Who were coaxing chaos from guitars that Pete Townshend would soon smash, and Cream were beautifully mean. The Beatles and the Stones were becoming stranger studio creatures. The Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane had provided the soundtrack to Owsley Stanley's potent acid at the Human Be-In that January in California, and, on the other American coast, the Velvet Underground were fusing noise and rock in real time. The Mothers of Invention, Sandy Bull, Albert Ayler, James Brown, the Fugs, Pink Floyd: They were all pushing into the unknown by that summer of 1967.

But no other album presented a map so full of new possibilities, opportunities for exploration that were rooted in the past but unafraid of the unknown quite like Are You Experienced. In an hour, Hendrix the songwriter moves from mental illness to sci-fi dreams, from sexual celebration to existential despair, from beatnik individualism to collective liberation. And then there's Hendrix the guitarist and bandleader, moving between barroom blues and a more elegant update, between lysergic mischief and relentless rock singles, between guitar solos so heroic they feel godly and noise passages so harsh they feel drawn from the gutter. Sixty years later, Jimi Hendrix remains history's only perfect rock star; in a career that was shorter than a single presidential term, he showed the rest of the world what they'd missed and suggested how to get there. Are You Experienced is his first and best explosion of brilliance, so mighty that we're still sorting through its pieces and meanings and implications.

Hendrix's American reintroduction had, at least, started strong. In the early months of 1967, a consortium of well-connected and well-heeled industry types began to plot the Monterey International Pop Festival, hoping to elevate rock's cultural cachet by mirroring the decade-old jazz fest along California's coastline. Both Paul McCartney and the Stones' manager and producer, Andrew Loog Oldham, insisted that the organizers bring the Experience over for their stateside debut, though their first single, “Hey Joe,” had flatlined in the country. Brian Jones flew to California to introduce Hendrix as “the most exciting guitarist I have ever heard.”

In England, Hendrix had become such a sensation that his verve even forced the Who's Townshend and Cream's Eric Clapton into a short-lived friendship, inspired by an admixture of admiration, jealousy, and fear. Backstage at Monterey, Hendrix, knowing that he was going on after the Who, taunted Townshend, since this was his chance to upstage his rival forever. (He also jammed with the Dead backstage, playing bass alongside Phil Lesh.) It became one of rock'n'roll's epiphanic performances, less for its mauling take on “Like a Rolling Stone” and italicized “Purple Haze” and solos played with his teeth than for its destructive finale—Hendrix hovering above his guitar with a bottle of lighter fluid, setting it on fire until he broke it to bits. He sanctified and sacrificed rock'n'roll in a single frame.

Hendrix had won the battle with Townshend, but everyone wasn't sure it was worth the war. Mo Ostin, who had signed Hendrix to Reprise, hated the stunt, as did Michelle Phillips of The Mamas & The Papas. “Practically everybody at the festival came out of folk music,” she later remembered, admitting she didn't want Hendrix at that Hollywood Bowl show, either. “You wouldn't dream of abusing your instrument to get a reaction from the audience, like setting your guitar on fire and pretending to ejaculate off of your guitar.”

The States had always been an uneasy fit for Hendrix; that's why, after all, he had needed to come back to play Monterey. Born in Seattle as World War II raged in Europe, he was Black and Cherokee, descended from two of this country's most persecuted groups. His parents were quarreling alcoholics who split when he was 9. His father, a veteran named Al, took custody; his mom, Lucille, died when he was 15. After learning a few Elvis songs on a ukulele he salvaged in a trash heap, Hendrix got his first electric guitar at 16 and played alongside Al, who worked a cheap saxophone that eventually got repossessed.

After run-ins with the law, Hendrix enlisted in the Army at 19, shipping off to Fort Campbell on the Tennessee-Kentucky border. He loved training as a paratrooper, the adrenaline and solitude of ripping through the sky. “When you first jump it's really outta sight,” he later said. “Physically it was a falling-over-backwards feeling, like in your dreams.”

But Hendrix despised the rules and how little music he could play in the service. Discharged in 1962 after reportedly breaking his ankle, he formed a band, moved to Nashville, and toured the South relentlessly, picking up gigs with the likes of Ike & Tina Turner and Wilson Pickett before joining the Isley Brothers. (“I got tired of playing in the key of F all the time,” he joked of that last gig, “so I turned in my white mohair silk suit.”) Speaking of suits, Hendrix and the rest of Little Richard's band stole the Byrds' suits and ties backstage in Los Angeles in 1965, Roger McGuinn once told me, smartly forcing the band to look cool in street clothes on the cover of their 1965 debut. After quarreling over money and Hendrix's uncanny ability to rival the bandleader, he left Little Richard, too, and headed for Harlem.

Hendrix was there for only a year, toggling between bands of his own and stints as a sideman, when his break materialized. Linda Keith, a model and the girlfriend of Keith Richards, had become his fan and booster, bringing her famous friends to Hendrix's tiny shows and even pilfering Keef's pearly white Stratocaster as a gift for the upstart. Keith convinced Chas Chandler, a bassist in town to play one of his last shows with the Animals, to see Hendrix on a Wednesday afternoon.

Keith had tipped Hendrix that Chandler loved “Hey Joe,” a murder ballad that had been floating through the folk and rock scenes on both American coasts for five years. (Jason Schneider's new book, That Gun in Your Hand, offers a fascinating play-by-play of the song's saga, using it as a window on the history of popular music for the last 60 years.) “Wow, I'm gonna find an act and record that song in England,” Chandler had vowed. “That's going to be a hit.” It was the first song Hendrix and his Blue Flames played that day at Café Wha? Chandler asked Hendrix to come to England and make that hit.

Three weeks after Hendrix landed at Heathrow, he was off to France for four shows supporting Johnny Hallyday, a national hero and a coiffed crooner with a slight edge. This time, he had the Experience. Noel Redding had responded to an audition ad for the Animals, but Chandler hoodwinked the guitarist into playing bass for the first time. Hendrix liked his hair, which matched his own, and he liked how he played bass like a lead guitar, meaning he could fly right alongside Hendrix. Chandler had asked Mitch Mitchell only to do the forthcoming shows in France, but he had the hair, too, and Hendrix liked what he heard. He was in, too. “He played me a record by Elvin Jones once,” Hendrix later said, “and I went, ‘Damn, that's you!'”

By the time the France run was done, they were ready to make good on Chandler's wish to turn “Hey Joe” into a hit. At their fourth show, in Paris, the song was a prime mix of doom and equivocation. Hendrix wrestled with the anger and cowardice of a friend who'd killed his lover and was preparing to flee. Redding's bassline felt oversized, like a tell-tale heart threatening to burst through a rib cage, while Mitchell kept pushing and pulling the meter, as if nervous about the narrative. They cut it later that month, sorting through assorted sets of background vocalists until they found the Breakaways. They intone the melody like they're whistling from the grave, the dead woman haunting Joe's gusto. It sounded simple but felt complicated. “Hey Joe” was out by the end of 1966, a British hit in early 1967.

The success emboldened Chandler and the band, who cut “Purple Haze” early that year. Chandler had turned Hendrix on to science fiction. Hendrix long insisted that the song wasn't about drugs but instead mirrored a dream about walking beneath the sea, likely prompted by a Philip José Farmer tale about life in space he'd recently read.

The song's permanent association with an acid trip, though, didn't just stem from that distorted lyrical reality. In early 1967, Hendrix met an electrical engineer named Roger Mayer, who soon stopped by with a guitar pedal he'd been perfecting, the Octavia. (Back in New York, the Fugs had hipped Hendrix to his first fuzz pedal.) When Hendrix played the Octavia on the “Purple Haze” solos, it sounded as if the world had splintered into crystal fragments, the expected sound of his guitar split into a million prismatic pieces. Where the Who soon co-opted Terry Riley's kaleidoscopic sounds with a heap of pretense, Hendrix casually predicted them with the coda of his second single.

The British version of Are You Experienced, released three months ahead of its American counterpart, omitted Hendrix's first three singles, including “The Wind Cries Mary,” a plaintive ballad inspired by a fight with the girlfriend he met the night he arrived in London, miraculously recorded in 20 minutes. The choice to favor new material allowed for a slightly conservative introduction to Hendrix. Opener “Foxey Lady” let him bend the blues inside a sexy and simple groove, each of his whispers, screams, and guitar squeals as flirtatious as the words themselves. He sauntered straight through the electric blues during “Red House,” as if he'd stopped in some roadhouse en route to Chicago, then strutted his way through “Can You See Me,” his brisk contribution to that moment's British garage-rock explosion.

But those singles had done little in the States, meaning that Reprise was free to frontload its edition of Are You Experienced. Those opening chords of “Purple Haze,” then, sounded like the brittle fanfare of a revolution, while the second track, “Manic Depression,” delved into mental illness with a candor and vulnerability that didn't comport with a generation that had endured World War II. It is a paean, too, for art, for channeling the unease in one's mind into creation, particularly a frenetic guitar solo. “Music, sweet music,” Hendrix sings to himself as the notes whinny, his self-soothing suggesting chaos that's just barely controlled.

And then there's “Hey Joe,” that murder ballad Hendrix brought back to the States, chased by “Love or Confusion,” a dissonant and droning tune that slingshots into an acrobatic solo. Hendrix then tries and fails to navigate the bittersweetness of romance and reality during “May This Be Love,” the riff and the rhythm curling into a series of beautiful but aimless and endless circles; it's as if the Experience are stuck in a maze, chasing feelings that will never be satisfying. The first side closes with “I Don't Live Today,” a fuzzed-out anthem about self-destruction that sprints headlong into a thicket of feedback and formless drums. “Oh, there ain't no life nowhere,” Hendrix sighs during a break in the melee. Amid the Summer of Love, Hendrix was content to teeter on the edge of a void. Again, that was just Side One.

What becomes clear across every variation of Are You Experienced—and the mound of outtakes that have trickled out over the years—is how much fun The Experience had making it. Hendrix, remember, had been playing guitar only for a decade, and he was so judgmental of his own voice that he apologized to his father for “Hey Joe” before it was released and insisted on being sequestered from the band while singing. Redding was so new to bass that unsubstantiated rumors Chandler played it on “Hey Joe” have persisted for decades.

They are discovering these songs and their rapport, then, in real time, free to go wherever their novel trans-national dynamic took them. The cowbell rumble of “Stone Free,” the narcoticized giggles of “Third Stone From the Sun,” the Pentecostal funk breakdown of “Fire” and the way that Mitchell does move like a hard-rock Elvin Jones as he and Redding shout the chorus back at Hendrix like excitable British goofs still in short pants: Each of these feels like discovery, as if the three of them are spotting new land from the crow's nest of some pirate ship. In their excitement, they became the earth movers and cartographers of music's future.

Hendrix and this music have been so ubiquitous for the last six decades that dissecting their influence seems too elemental, like trying to explain why air exists. An infinite supply of dorm-room posters, an endless barrage of gilded (and sometimes very good) compilations and archival dumps, a steadfast stream of books and biopics: Seemingly every element of Hendrix's near-instant impact has been dissected, documented, and perpetuated, with more of his music released after his death than during his life many times over. Still, its importance on almost everything that followed remains dizzying.

Consider, for instance, that a bookish young pianist named Herbie Hancock in Miles Davis's Second Great Quintet had dismissed rock'n'roll out of hand until his mentor told him to listen to Hendrix. Several months after Are You Experienced was out, Hancock sat at a Fender Rhodes for the first time to play on Miles in the Sky, becoming the sparkplug for an electric evolution in jazz. Davis' subsequent albums, especially 1971's Jack Johnson, became the manna of the jam-band world; Hancock's subsequent albums opened up nascent avenues of exchange between jazz, R&B, and hip-hop that producers and players like Flying Lotus or Mk.gee are still pursuing. In 1971, Funkadelic released Maggot Brain, Sly and the Family Stone There's a Riot Goin' On, Black Sabbath Master of Reality. (The first 10 seconds of “Highway Chile,” I should mention, are proto-doom perfection.) Already dead for a year by that point, Hendrix exists in all of it.

And consider but a few covers of just three of the 17 cuts on Are You Experienced. Aside from every bar band that will ever exist, both the Stooges and the Cure covered “Purple Haze,” the former blowing it out and the latter tracking it as an alien dance. Seal rendered “The Wind Cries Mary” as a lovesick lament in the early '90s, four years after Marc Ribot turned it into a deadpan fuck-you. John Lee Hooker, the Mississippi native whose first renaissance began just as Hendrix quit the Army, gave the elemental blues core of “Red House” a bear hug. Prince, meanwhile, renamed it “Purple House” and repeatedly blew it out with gospel underpinnings and a guitar solo so heroic and gnarly that I can't hear it without picturing Hendrix's magnetic grin.

Prince, too, serves as a reminder of Hendrix's essential importance beyond being a singer, guitarist, and performer. On and beyond Are You Experienced, Hendrix's subversion of every expectation of what a rock star was supposed to be provided a vector for personal liberation, for being exactly who you felt like you were meant to be, even if that meant flipping Keith Richards' guitar upside down and playing it that way. “A lot of people think what I do with my guitar is vulgar,” he once said. “Those who think we are filthy are the same people who don't want to let Joan Baez sing her anti-war songs publicly.”

Like playing his guitar with his teeth, his fashion sense—radical neons, flamboyant scarves, a silk kimono and velvet pants as he joined a young and serious Ralph Nader and a bemused and aged Robert Young on The Dick Cavett Show—was derided in real time as a gimmick. He repeatedly protested such charges, insisting that it simply felt right. Hendrix upended the notion of the purely masculine, entirely cocksure rock star. Yes, he was a cad, but you could see his embrace of femininity in the clothes he wore, just as you could hear it in his unease during “Hey Joe.” An attentive student of Little Richard, Hendrix flirted with androgyny from the start.

Despite being a rare Black rock star in the late '60s, Hendrix was reluctant to embrace the day's radical politics. He'd been confronted with vile racism while touring the South before launching the Experience, and reviews after he launched the Experience often deployed racist epithets. But he criticized various Black Power movements just as they took hold in American society, uttering idealistic platitudes like “It's the solutions everyone wants now, not just protest.” For many, his silence was maddening.

But in Karl Ferris' photos on both sides of the American version of Are You Experienced, Hendrix stands just in front of Redding and Mitchell, the camera positioned in both instances to make him look like a god or at least a powerhouse. It is a subtle but mighty message from England for back home, delivered in a way that gave Hendrix the license to lead his part of a revolution in his own way. At the Hollywood Bowl, five days before Are You Experienced was released, the crowd must have seen that change coming and, if not cowered, then at least not clapped.

Hendrix played the Hollywood Bowl just one more time, in September 1968, 13 months after that abysmal initial appearance. Hendrix Fever was then rampant. The tickets were $1 more than they'd been for last year's love, The Mamas & The Papas. Fans waded into the fountains in front of the stage, causing water to flow onto the band and its amplifiers, creating fears of electrocution. (The fountains were removed four years later.) “The Jimi Hendrix Experience was too much for the ushers who have managed to confine spectators to their seats during the summer series of rock concerts in the Hollywood Bowl,” began the Los Angeles Times review that ran two days later. Hendrix had wondered where everyone was a year earlier; now, they were too close for safety, let alone comfort.

Four weeks after that show, the Experience would release Electric Ladyland, its third and final album, three days after the second anniversary of their first gig. I simply cannot overstate the insanity of that timeline: Between the start of 1967 and the fall of 1968, the Jimi Hendrix Experience recorded and released three unimpeachable studio albums while touring at every available opportunity.

Axis: Bold as Love and Electric Ladyland were progressively more experimental, from the sci-fi radio drama and noise quake on the former to the 14-minute odyssey of exotic percussion and tones and experimental panning that anchored the latter. They were absolutely following the map of Are You Experienced and opening new avenues with each attempt. For my money and time, there is no other triptych of rock records—not Dylan goes electric, not Led Zeppelin begins, not the Berlin trilogy, not the Beatles arriving at Revolver—more compact, imaginative, and consequential in rock'n'roll history. In less than two years, The Jimi Hendrix Experience opened up the future of music and vanished.

“Is that the stars in the sky, or is it rain falling down?” Hendrix sang at the start of “Love or Confusion,” a song that jangled in spite of the drone squealing beneath it. “Will it burn me if I touch the sun? Yeah, so big, so round.” Fame did, indeed, burn Hendrix badly. He struggled with the gauntlet of fame, sex, and drugs, the exhaustion of his schedule, and the financial pressures of building the sound palace of his dreams, Electric Lady Studios, in Greenwich Village. Sessions for The Experience's second and third albums were gauntlets of endless takes, that lack of expectation curdling into work and tedium. Chandler bailed before Electric Ladyland was done.

After Redding left in 1969, Hendrix began to pursue an even grander vision of the Experience's experiments with Band of Gypsys. It ended, though, with a public meltdown on stage at Madison Square Garden before the first album could even be released. “That's what happens when Earth fucks with space,” Hendrix told the crowd as the short set limped to an end. “Never forget that.” He was dead nine months later, almost four years after first landing in London.

It is easy to wallow in that timeline, to imagine the possibilities of what might have been had Hendrix's safety been prioritized more than his financial solvency, had he been given better guardrails to, for, and from fame. But it is more inspiring to look out over the nearly 60 years since he made Are You Experienced and treasure him as the rarest rock'n'roll anomaly that has ever existed—the person who gave brilliantly and completely and then, for whatever reason, disappeared.

So many of his former peers, champions, and biters remain, still squeezing the lifeblood from rock's desiccated body for at least a few more years. But as a permanent idea sprung from an ephemeral form, Hendrix remains more powerful and captivating than the lot. “We'll get outdated,” Stella Benabou, who owned the record store where Hendrix shopped, said near the end of 1973's A Film About Jimi Hendrix. “He won't.” Half a century later, he still hasn't.

Donald Trump reposted a baseless conspiracy theory claiming Joe Biden was “executed in 2020” and replaced with a robot clone.


	The president shared a post from a user on Truth Social late Saturday that alleged: “There is no #JoeBiden – executed in 2020. #Biden clones doubles & robotic engineered soulless mindless entities are what you see. #Democrats don't know the difference.”


	Similar unfounded theories about Biden have been floating around the internet for years. An eight-hour Facebook video posted in 2021 claimed that “Biden is computer generated.” Others have more recently purported that Biden was replaced with artificial intelligence.


	The Truth Social account that posted the allegation that Biden is a robot has dabbled in other conspiracy theory lies, including that the 2020 election was “stolen” as part of a “military-grade coup” and that Trump has saved the world “from the Satan Worshipping Deep State (DS) Global Elites.”


	The president's supporters encouraged the conspiracy in the replies, sharing side-by-side photos of Biden that they say are evidence he was replaced by a lookalike. One user shared a video that claimed “Joe Biden's eyes changed from blue to black.”

	This is not the first conspiracy theory Trump has dabbled in, although it may be one of the weirdest. Trump has relentlessly — and falsely — claimed the 2020 election was “rigged.” He alleged that former president Barack Obama was not born in the U.S. (and then falsely blamed Hillary Clinton for starting the birther controversy). And he has said the physical attack against Paul Pelosi, husband of former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, was staged. During the 2024 campaign, Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance repeated fabricated claims that Haitian immigrants were eating pets. These theories have all been proven untrue or have zero credible evidence to back their assertions.  

	











	Members of Trump's administration have also pushed conspiracy theory lies into the mainstream. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., has shared debunked claims, including that vaccines cause autism and that condensation emitted by airplanes is actually made up of harmful chemicals (a.k.a. chemtrails). These high-profile endorsements have arguably led to more people believing in them, including state legislators in Louisiana who recently voted to ban chemtrails. Trump's FBI Director Kash Patel has frequently endorsed the beliefs of QAnon, a specious conspiracy theory that alleges the U.S. government is run by a “Deep State” pedophile ring of Satan worshipers.

Stranger Things revealed its fifth and final season's release schedule Saturday during Netflix's Tudum event, with the last eight episodes arriving in three installments around major holidays.


	The fifth season's Volume One premieres on November 26, the day before Thanksgiving, followed by Volume Two on Christmas, December 25. The series will end with The Finale, set for New Year's Eve, December 31.


	All three parts will hit the streaming service “worldwide all at once, date may vary based on your local timezone,” anchored to 5 p.m. PST.


	Netflix also shared a teaser for Season 5, featuring footage of the Hawkins crew's journey thus far:

Stranger Things 5 arrives three years after Stranger Things 4's summer 2022 two-part release, and over a year after Netflix first revealed the titles for the fifth season's episode: “The Crawl,” “The Vanishing of [name was censored]” (the first-ever episode of Stranger Things was called “The Vanishing of Will Byers”), “The Turnbow Trap,” “Sorcerer,” “Shock Jock,” “Escape From Camazotz,” “The Bridge” and the finale “The Rightside Up.”

	











	The fifth season also comes 11 months after Stranger Things wrapped production, filming a reported 650 hours of footage for the final season. While the show's creators Matt and Ross Duffer have kept the final season's plot guarded, they did reveal that the fifth season picks up in the fall of 1987, well after the events of Season Four, which began in the spring of 1986.

	Rep. Jerrold Nadler criticized Donald Trump and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) after officers detained a crying staff member in Nadler's district office.


	While protesters gathered outside an immigration courthouse, DHS officers attempted to enter Nadler's Manhattan office in the same building and accused his staff of “harboring rioters.”


	The incident, first reported by Gothamist, was captured on camera. In the video, which the outlet said was recorded by a person who was monitoring activity in immigration court, DHS is seen handcuffing an unidentified staff member.


	“No she did not. That is not what happened,” another staff member said off camera.


	“She pushed him back,” an unidentified officer responded.


	“I'm a federal officer,” a DHS official said to a staff member who was stopping him from entering a private section of the office and asking if they had a search warrant. The officer said no, they did not have a warrant, but the staff member eventually allowed him to enter the area.

	











	Nadler blasted Trump and DHS for “aggressive and heavy-handed tactics” used in this incident and to detain others across the country.


	“President Trump and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are sowing chaos in our communities, using intimidation tactics against both citizens and non-citizens in a reckless and dangerous manner. In the most recent and deeply troubling incident, DHS agents forcefully entered my Congressional office and handcuffed a member of my staff,” Nadler said in a statement released Saturday.

	











	Nadler said the officers actions demonstrate “a deeply troubling disregard for proper legal boundaries.”


	“If this can happen in a Member of Congress's office, it can happen to anyone — and it is happening,” the New York congressman said, calling on DHS and Trump to “halt the use of these dangerous tactics.”

	Nadler also criticized the administration's “use of the expedited removal process which denies due process to immigrants and citizens alike.”


	The detained staff member was ultimately not arrested, nor was she charged with a crime. She told Gothamist that “everything resolved” but did not comment further.

Donald Trump‘s director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russ Vought, alleged without evidence that “no one will lose [Medicaid] coverage as a result” of the House's proposed budget. House Speaker Mike Johnson similarly claimed “People will not lose their Medicaid unless they choose to do so.” 

Vought blatantly lies about Medicaid cuts on CNN, claiming ""no one will lose coverage as a result of this bill"" pic.twitter.com/2OUR0EfQPf


	“There are no Medicaid cuts in the big, beautiful bill,” Johnson said Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press. “We're not cutting Medicaid.”

Mike Johnson: ""Those 4.8 million people will not lose their Medicaid unless they choose to do so."" pic.twitter.com/kQfr6Wz3eJ


	“This bill will preserve and protect the programs, the social safety net, but it will make it much more commonsense,” Vought said on CNN's State of the Union. “Look, one out of every five or six dollars in Medicaid is improper. We have illegal immigrants on the program. We have able-bodied working adults that don't have a work requirement that they would have in TANF or even SNAP. And that's something that's very important to institute. That's what this bill does. No one will lose coverage as a result of this bill.”

	











	There's a lot to unpack here. Vought, who was a major architect of Project 2025, said that between one fifth and one sixth of Medicaid spending is “improper.” According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, in 2024, however, just 7.66 percent of payments were considered “improper.” But “improper” covers a lot of payments, including underpayments, overpayments, and payments where there is not enough information to determine if a payment was proper. In other words, improper is not a synonym for fraudulent.

	Vought additionally claimed that undocumented immigrants are on Medicaid. Except for emergency room services in certain situations, federal Medicaid funds cannot be used to cover undocumented immigrants. Some states, however, have chosen to use their own funds to provide health coverage to undocumented immigrants, including children.


	Lastly, Vought and Johnson said the bill will not cause people to lose coverage.

	Several experts and organizations expose this for the lie that it is. 


According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), if the Republican budget passes, it would reduce federal Medicaid spending by $723 billion, and 7.6 million people would lose Medicaid  coverage by 2034, thanks in large part to new work requirements for those age 18-64. Other changes to the program, such as stricter and more frequent eligibility checks, will also likely lead to lost coverage. 


	Citing two states that have implemented similar work requirements on Medicaid recipients to those proposed in the GOP bill, Jennifer Tolbert, deputy director of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured and the director of State Health Policy and Data at Kaiser Family Foundation, said on PBS, “These new rules pose barriers to people enrolling in coverage and lead to coverage loss. And this is loss of coverage among people who are eligible for the requirements, but who have difficulty navigating the reporting requirements and providing the documentation needed to verify that they in fact meet the requirement.”


	The left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, which estimated that up to 14.4 million people could lose coverage over the next 10 years, said, “Research shows — and the CBO previously concluded — that work requirements do not increase employment. Instead, they lead enrollees who lose coverage to take on more medical debt, delay getting needed medical care, and delay taking medications.”

	Losing coverage can lead to serious consequences. Having coverage saves lives. One study by the National Bureau of Economic research found that Medicaid expansions increased enrollment by 12 percent and reduced mortality among low-income adults by 2.5 percent, and new Medicaid enrollees were 21 percent less likely to die compared to before they had coverage.

	An obscure ideology most people have never heard of is dominating almost every aspect of American life. Nearly every important Supreme Court ruling by the conservative majority — from abortion to voting rights, from gun control to environmental protection — virtually the whole far-right agenda — has been foisted on the nation using this ideology as its justification. “Originalism” is not a household word. Yet is in an extremely important word — the key to the political movement that has transformed the country over the last forty years and culminated in the regime of Donald Trump.


	Originalism's influence, once confined to the nation's law schools, is now vast, reaching far beyond the Supreme Court majority's politicized rulings. First and foremost, originalists — yes, they call themselves that —provide the intellectual underpinning for Trump's “emergencies,” his lawless assault on law firms, universities, the Smithsonian, the Library of Congress, the Voice of America, indeed, the entire civil service. The grand alibi comes in the form of what the originalists present as the doctrine of “unitary executive,” a contrived theory of their own making that they pass off as something the Framers inscribed in the Constitution. 

	











	In justifying Trump issuing executive orders as though they were dictatorial decrees, the theory denies innumerable vital federal agencies and institutions the slightest independence. Most recently, on May 22, the Supreme Court moved to the brink of destroying that independence, trashing an 80-year old precedent in a preliminary ruling on the longstanding Humphrey's Executor, and allowing the president more power to remove officials from independent organizations, and cloaking the pre-determined result in flimsy originalist explanations. As the “unitary executive,” Trump can threaten to place the Federal Reserve under his heel, which would likely trigger a worldwide Depression. The high court itself exposes originalism as the expedient fraud that it has always been. Left unchecked, originalism can be wielded as a tool to tear apart American democracy and menace the global economy.

	Confusion surrounds originalism partly because it flies under many aliases, including “textualism,” “original meaning,” and “history and tradition.” Until recently, even the most influential elites in the legal establishment have had difficulty grasping the shifty, esoteric jurisprudence that has no particular historical claim to legitimacy but that now rules the federal judiciary.


	Yet originalism does have a history. For decades, a dedicated and staggeringly well-funded movement of plutocrats and their right-wing allies has worked through shadow networks to capture and politicize the courts. How much money? Probably more than $2 billion. According to Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) this operation spent $34 million in its campaigns against President Barack Obama's choice for the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland, and to install Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh on the court. That's been money well-spent in the right-wing's dark money operation. It's won victory after victory in the courts, in every domain of law — from gun rights to abortion to environmental law and beyond. Originalism is the phony doctrine they invented to justify their rulings, confuse their opponents, and impose their political agenda.  


	So-called originalists like to pontificate with lofty pronouncements about what the Founders would have wanted — as though the Founders were unified in their vision, and as if that vision could be unequivocally divined from a vantage point 250 years later, from sparse documentary evidence by ideologues who cook the history books. And the Christian Nationalist wing of the originalists absurdly claim that the Founders intended to create a Christian nation, as though Thomas Jefferson and James Madison never spoke about the separation of church and state.


	The originalists claim that they are serving a truly impartial jurisprudence, merely calling “balls and strikes,” in Chief Justice John Roberts' phrase, based on a literal meaning of the Constitution. In fact, the record shows, glaringly, that the originalists work backwards from their goals to find the magic words to cloak their extremism. Facts and precedent be damned. Originalists bully their way forward using distorted and outright fabricated history, figuring that no one will call them out.

	In short: Originalism is a dangerous fraud.


	Whatever its claims to historical grounding and omniscience, originalism is a comparatively new invention as an ideology. It was born as a direct political response to the Supreme Court's landmark 1954 ruling, Brown v. Board of Education, declaring segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional.

	











Brown was an affront not just to Jim Crow southerners but to the broader conservative movement, exemplified by William F. Buckley Jr.'s then new magazine, National Review. The backlash drew from old ideas from before the Civil War in defense of slavery about states' rights, to stop the implementation of federal laws, including equal justice under the law and especially voting rights, and, more boldly, to declare those laws unconstitutional. It's a direct route from the segregationists' arguments against civil rights to Chief Justice John Roberts' ruling in 2013 eviscerating the Voting Rights Act of 1965. That may be the only true originalism.


	It's important to note that this reactionary movement was not confined to the political fringe. The spirit of constitutional originalism had existed, for many years, focused mainly on opposing the reforms of the New Deal. Having switched to responding to desegregation, the movement conservatives suddenly had to obfuscate the racist core of their position. Hiding their bigotry in the folds of history, they embarked on the project of supposedly discovering the original intent of the 14th Amendment, trying to show that its guarantee of equal protection under the law was irrelevant to securing civil rights for Black schoolchildren and their parents.


	To undermine Brown, conservatives hit upon a slogan they dressed up as a judicial principle: “intent construct.” That was the first definition of what became originalism. To distract from the racist foundations of their resistance, they tried to shift attention from existing injustice to what the framers of the Constitution supposedly intended — the intent construct. As a leading pro-segregation journalist James J. Kilpatrick wrote: “In constitutional cases, the clock must always be turned back.” He was whistling “Dixie” or humming “Carry Me Back to Old Virginny.” Glossed over, of course, was the fact that “intent construct” meant that the conservatives on the bench would construct the framers' intent, sometimes out of thin air.


	With the seed planted against desegregation, the conservative movement — including William F. Buckley's National Review, Barry Goldwater, and Ronald Reagan — nurtured and grew the project of what would became known as originalism.


	The most important figure in defining originalism was Robert Bork, who as Richard Nixon's acting Attorney General tried to suppress the Watergate investigation in the notorious Saturday Night Massacre in which, on President Nixon's order, he fired the special prosecutor in 1973. Bork had proposed, two years earlier, what would become an influential outline of originalism in an article for the Yale Law Journal. He argued that judges should be able to discover what the framers “actually intended” from “text or history,” without inserting their own interpretation. Funnily enough, in Bork's originalism, the Framers always supported what the contemporary right-wing wanted at any given moment.

	











	When President Reagan nominated Bork to the Supreme Court in 1987, the Senate rejected him as too extreme. Yet if Bork's nomination failed, the ideas he propagated had already gained momentum. (The fight over Bork's botched nomination gave birth to a new verb — “borked” — which has been used to describe every failed nomination since and marked the beginning of vicious partisan fighting over Supreme Court seats.)


	In 1985, President Reagan's Attorney-General Edwin Meese — soon to be disgraced in a financial scandal and forced to leave office — addressed the American Bar Association, professing that the “intended role“ of the judiciary was to serve as “bulwarks of a limited constitution.” Judges and justices, he argued, should be expected to “resist any political effort to depart from the literal provisions” of the Constitution and “press for a Jurisprudence of Original Intention.” Meese and the originalists concealed that “Original Intention” meant intention as construed by themselves, the originalists. 


	What these ideological inventors left unstated was the inconvenient fact that the Framers themselves believed that the Constitution's words should not become a kind of scripture but instead serve as the basis for guarding freedom and rights while pursuing the general welfare, evolving along with the nation. The Framers endlessly disparaged the idea of an unchangeable fundamentalist text. “In framing a system which we wish to last for ages, we should not lose sight of the changes that ages will produce,” James Madison said during the Constitutional Convention. In a debate in the House of Representatives, on April 6, 1796, Madison declared, “…whatever veneration might be entertained for the body of men who formed our Constitution, the sense of that body could never be regarded as the oracular guide in expounding the Constitution.” But the originalists ignore the practical sense of the Framers as they claim to conduct seances hearing their true voices from the beyond.


	Antonin Scalia, appointed by Reagan to the Supreme Court in 1986, became originalism's most visible and vocal proponent on the court. Originalism also became the creed of the Federalist Society, an organization of conservative academics that morphed into a hugely influential elite right-wing legal and political operation, grooming hundreds of lawyers for appointment to the federal bench, a vast machinery to take over the judiciary and the law financed by the many millions of dollars gathered and administered by the reactionary theocrat Leonard Leo, who assumed control of a $1.6 billion slush fund in recent years. Although originalism was then a newly minted concept, which would have been inconceivable to the Founders, within 15 years it had managed to seize the political high ground and masquerade as history.

	











	In 2000, in one of the crudest but most consequential maneuvers in American history, Scalia led a conservative majority on the court, in a 5-4 decision, to hand the presidency to the Republican candidate, George W. Bush, by stopping the counting of thousands of ballots in the Florida contest. Scalia, in a bit of originalist jiu-jitsu, flipped the 14th Amendment's “equal protection” clause to declare Bush the winner — a ruling Scalia reportedly confessed in private later was “as we say in Brooklyn, a piece of shit.”


	The basic conceits of originalism are deceptively simple: The meaning of the Constitutional text was fixed, knowable, and unambiguous at the time it was written; and that this meaning should govern for all time. To these absurd presumptions the originalists add one more: that only originalists can dictate the law.


	The real trick for them is to find language that is roomy enough to embrace their pre-arranged goals but also narrow enough to avoid sounding obviously contrived. Contrary to the humbug of what originalists would have you believe, the Founders did not have a unified vision. Madison believed that even the meaning of words in the Constitution acquired different definitions over time. “What a metamorphosis would be produced in the code of law if all its ancient phraseology were to be taken in its modern sense,” he stated in 1824.


	But it's easy enough to manipulate historical sounding language into a single, clear-cut “original” meaning and then arrive at an interpretation of that meaning that justifies the desired conclusions. Intended to have a gravity not unlike fundamentalist Biblical exegesis, it more closely resembles three-card monte.


	Such historical distortion and falsehoods, for example, form the cornerstone of the court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the case that overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated federal protections for abortion rights.


	Among the central assertions in that decision, written by Justice Samuel Alito, concerned what Alito called a “most important historical fact” — that 28 out of 37 states banned abortion throughout pregnancy at the time of the ratification of the 14th Amendment (the basis for Roe) in 1868. Historians quickly noted that Alito's claim was spurious: At least seven of the 28 states he claimed had completely banned all forms of abortion actually permitted them in some form. Roe finally fell in 2022, a victim of bad faith “originalist” history, and women were deprived of a basic right to reproductive freedom and health.   

	











	Alito is not alone on the Supreme Court bench in warping the historical record. At this point, one critic observes, “distorting the past to further his ideological agenda has become a trademark feature” of Justice Clarence Thomas. Thomas' majority decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, struck down a New York law that required persons to obtain an unrestricted license to carry a concealed firearm. The defense, along with amicus curiae briefs, cited numerous Reconstruction-era gun regulations as precedents for the restriction law. Thomas dismissed these as “outliers” and placed far greater weight on how, he said, English peasants during the 1500s carried guns. Now, English highwaymen of the 16th century were as good as the Framers for originalist precedent.


	Thomas' decision rested on Scalia's originalist formulation in District of Columbia v. Heller, in 2008, in which he extended the Second Amendment, applying to members of militias (today's National Guard), to an unqualified right for gun ownership for every individual. Thomas, however, took originalism beyond any hitherto limits, claiming that any and all gun control had to be able to cite an analogy to a regulation on an originalist basis to be valid. 


	In 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, the Supreme Court showed just how far it is willing to go in ignoring the facts by fabricating the recent past as well as history. The majority ruling, written by Justice Gorsuch, held that a wedding website designer was entitled to discriminate against a gay couple because the Colorado law which prohibited her from doing so violated her First Amendment rights. The entire case was a scam. One day before the court's opinion was published, The New Republic reported that the facts had been fabricated. The designer had never been asked to make a “gay” cake; the religious right had engineered the complaint in order to bring a test case to the Supreme Court. Gorsuch's ruling, meanwhile rested on another assertion of false history: that religious speech has always occupied an unimpeachably privileged position in American law. With that, he stomped on the principle of the separation of church and state fervently advocated by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, and which is enshrined in the Constitution's “establishment clause” prohibiting government support for religion of any sort.


	Originalism has succeeded in insinuating itself into law and politics at every level. It has featured in every Republican Party platform from 1992 to 2016, except in 2004. At least five of the nine Supreme Court justices explicitly espouse it, and the rest are required to engage it as legitimate legal theory. It has taken hold everywhere from the Courts of Appeal to state courts through appointments of right-wing judges.

	











	By now, any U.S. citizen engaged in civic life knows about Project 2025. Despite Trump's ludicrous protest that he was not involved with the project and knew nothing about it, many of the major policies it describes have either been implemented already by the Trump regime since January or are in the pipeline. Many of the contributing authors of Project 2025 are originalists. The fingerprints of originalism are everywhere in this plan, which makes sense: Project 2025 aims to remake the whole of American law, politics, and social life in a radical right-wing mold.


	Originalism doesn't do what it claims to do, and some judges try to fight it on its own terms. Judge Beryl Howell, the chief judge on the federal D.C. Circuit recently used originalist reasoning to hold that the Trump administration's unitary executive theory is invalid — pitting originalism ironically against originalism. She wrote that “the Framers made clear that no one in our system of government was meant to be king — the President included — and not just in name only.” And yet Trump insists he can be a dictator. His originalist ideologues bestow on him vast and unchecked powers, the unitary executive.


	To help cut through the fog of originalist propaganda, too often taken at face value in news reporting and public debate, we established in 2023 what we call the Court of History, appealing to what is, after all, the highest court of all. We have exposed the originalist fraud, through news articles, webinars, and conferences. We have revealed the insidious use of this concocted doctrine to justify a far-right agenda. And we have unmasked the underlying theocratic movement of Christian Nationalism to leverage originalism for its cultish ambitions. Since the 2024 election, we have expanded our mission to address the illegalities and unconstitutional outrages of the Trump regime; and we have extended our reach to become a podcast on the Legal AF network. We believe that the beginning of the defense of American democracy is to explain fearlessly the Trump regime's catastrophic assault on constitutional rights, the rule of law, and a government that serves the people. It will take much more work before the curse of originalism is dispelled.      


	Starting in the farther fringes of the segregated South and right-wing radicalism, originalism is at the center of the conservative project. Far from an abstract game of legal reasoning, originalism has real and devastating consequences. Donald Trump has become the essential implementer of their gameplan to force through Project 2025 and pack the courts with originalist judges. But as the nation approaches the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution, we can only wonder what bizarre twisting of history the originalists will invent to justify a tyrannical regime.

	If his posts on his social media site, X, are any indication, Elon Musk is letting a New York Times report that he's taken so much ketamine he can't pee right get to him.


	“To be clear, I am NOT taking drugs!” Musk wrote on Saturday. “The New York Times was lying their ass off. I tried *prescription* ketamine a few years ago and said so on X, so this not even news. It helps for getting out of dark mental holes, but haven't taken it since then.” 


	Musk was allegedly taking ketamine, Ecstasy, and psychedelic mushrooms during the 2024 campaign, The New York Times reported Friday. He apparently used ketamine so heavily that it's affected his bladder, a known issue caused by chronic ketamine use. Sources said that he was using ketamine almost daily, mixing it with other drugs. His usage reportedly troubled those around him. It is unclear whether his alleged drug habit continued when he became part of the Trump administration. 


	Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, has become increasingly popular, including among the teetotaling influencers on The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives.

	Musk was an integral part of the 2024 election, spending about $290 million to support Donald Trump and Republicans. When Trump took office, Musk became the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, an effort to slash the federal workforce and make the government more MAGA. On Wednesday, it was reported that Musk's time in the Trump administration was coming to an end. 

	











	Musk posted multiple times about the allegations of drug use on Friday and Saturday.  


	“I'm in meetings with dozens to hundreds of people every day and am photographed constantly. If this bs from NYT were true, it would have been EXTREMELY obvious,” Musk posted. 


	The Times points out that Musk's behavior has been “erratic,” like his insulting Secretary of State Marco Rubio — and his posting incessantly on X, at all hours of the day and night. 


	During an appearance with Trump in the Oval Office on Friday, Musk was sporting a black eye, which he blamed on his 5-year-old son, also nicknamed X.

	“I was just horsing around with little X, and I said, ‘Go ahead, punch me in the face.' And he did,” he said at a news conference at the White House.


	As the head of SpaceX, a massive government contractor, Musk said he's been subjected to random drug tests.


	“The 3 years of random drug testing was just because of one semi-puff during a @JoeRogan podcast!” he wrote on X Saturday, referencing when he took a hit off a joint on Rogan's show in 2018. SpaceX gives out random drug tests, a requirement as a federal contractor. According to the Times, Musk has gotten advance warning of the tests.


	“I'm not on ketamine ffs,” he wrote in another post.  


	Trump said Friday that he did not know about Musk's reported regular drug usage. “I'm not troubled by anything with Elon,” he said. “I think he's fantastic.”


	Musk has spoken about his prescription ketamine use in the past. Last March, he told journalist Don Lemon that he uses a “small amount” of ketamine about once every other week. The ketamine, he said, is prescribed by “an actual, real doctor.”

	“There are times when I have sort of a … negative chemical state in my brain, like depression I guess, or depression that's not linked to any negative news, and ketamine is helpful for getting one out of the negative frame of mind,” he said. 


	“If you use too much ketamine, you can't really get work done,” Musk added. “I have a lot of work, I'm typically putting in 16-hour days … so I don't really have a situation where I can be not mentally acute for an extended period of time.”

A documentary charting one of the most famous purported UFO sightings in history is to be shown at a film festival.

""The Rendlesham UFO – The British Roswell"" investigated reports made by US airmen who claimed to have witnessed a UFO in Rendlesham Forest, Suffolk, in December 1980.

Mark Lee, co-director of the documentary, said the aim was ""to create a conversation, as I am getting hundreds of people a week sending sightings and videos"".

It will premiere at the Raindance Film Festival in London on 24 and 25 June.

On 26 December 1980, several United States Air Force (USAF) security personnel stationed at RAF Woodbridge, reported that they investigated ""lights"" in the surrounding forest.

The sighting became headline news in the UK and sparked a host of books, dramas, documentaries and websites, suggesting it was either an actual alien visit, a secret military aircraft, a misinterpretation of natural lights or the beam of Orfordness Lighthouse - or a hoax.

According to the creators of the documentary, it will feature exclusive interviews and never-before-seen footage of recent sightings in the forest.

The Rendlesham Forest story has been dubbed the ""British Roswell"" after the 1947 Roswell Incident in New Mexico, USA. The documentary follows Mr Lee and co-investigator Guy Thompson searching for the truth armed with metal detectors and dowsing rods.

The film has been described as a ""sensational UFO road trip movie"".

Mr Lee, who has a science degree, said: ""There is something unexplained there and there are so many credible witnesses to the event.""

The 54-year-old from St Albans co-directed the film with Roderick Godman. 

""I am more of the ideas and production - and Roderick made the film,"" he said.

""There had been sightings of UFOs leading up to the 1980 sighting, and going back in through the decades.""

He added that he had an ""open mind"" about what the sightings were.

Narrating the documentary is William B. Davis, best known for starring in The X-Files.

Mr Lee said he was really excited to work with Davis, who recorded the voiceover in Vancouver, Canada.

He added that he only got into the film making industry five years ago, and it ""was a dream come true"" as he was nominated for best director.

 DPM Dar, Afghan FM Muttaqi highlight importance of UAP railway link project

 They agreed to work closely for an early finalisation of the framework agreement

ISLAMABAD (APP) – Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar and Acting Foreign Minister of Afghanistan Amir Khan Muttaqi on Sunday emphasised the importance of Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Line Project for regional connectivity.

They agreed to work closely for an early finalisation of the framework agreement, Foreign Office Spokesperson said in a press release.

The DPM/FM held a telephone conversation with the FM Amir Khan Muttaqi who welcomed the decision of Pakistan to up-grade its diplomatic relations to the ambassador level and informed that Afghanistan has decided to reciprocate the same. He termed it a very positive development in bilateral relations.

Both leaders also reviewed implementation of decisions taken during DPM/FM's visit to Kabul on 19 April 2025 and vowed to continue working together to establish mutual trust between the two brotherly nations. 

Earlier this week, Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed to enhance diplomatic ties by exchanging ambassadors — a major move toward restoring normal relations after years of tension between Islamabad and the Taliban-led government in Kabul.

On Friday, Pakistan announced it would elevate its diplomatic mission in Afghanistan from Charge d'Affaires to Ambassador level, citing a “positive trajectory” in bilateral relations.

The Foreign Office also confirmed that Afghanistan has decided to reciprocate Pakistan's move by appointing its own ambassador.

Both ministers underscore the strategic importance of the proposed Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan railway corridor

Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Afghanistan's Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi on Sunday reaffirmed their commitment to advancing the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Line Project, calling it a vital step for enhancing regional connectivity.

In a phone conversation, the two ministers underscored the strategic importance of the proposed railway corridor and agreed to work closely for the early finalisation of its framework agreement, according to a statement from Pakistan's Foreign Office.

Muttaqi welcomed Pakistan's decision to upgrade diplomatic relations with Kabul to the ambassadorial level and confirmed Afghanistan would reciprocate the move.

He termed the decision a “positive development” for bilateral ties.

The conversation also served as a follow-up to Dar's visit to Kabul on 19 April 2025.

Both sides reviewed the implementation of key decisions taken during that trip and reiterated their shared commitment to strengthening mutual trust and cooperation.

Last month, Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed to ensure the dignified and orderly repatriation of undocumented Afghan nationals, amid tensions over Islamabad's deportation campaign.

Dar's first trip to Afghanistan since assuming office focused on defusing friction and restarting stalled cooperation on security and regional connectivity.

During his meetings with Acting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, Dar stressed the need to manage cross-border security, combat militancy, and strengthen bilateral trade.

The ministers agreed to finalise a joint committee of intelligence and interior ministry officials to address counterterrorism and border management concerns.

The two sides also reached consensus on enhancing regional economic links through initiatives like the CASA-1000 power project and the transnational Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan railway.

Control with the inside of the left foot, thump.

Control with the inside of the right foot, thump.

Control with the left thigh, this time, the ball arriving a bit higher. Touch to the right, thump.

The ball smacking against the wall and springing back towards him through the puddles, the spray flying off it. The rain hammering down, his sodden tracksuit clinging to his skin. The noise of the ball hitting the wall echoing around the square. Over and over: right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot. Control, thump. Control, touch, thump.

Ousmane Dembele is still a child, but he is already obsessed with football. If his friends are around, he plays with them: furiously contested kickabouts on the bare concrete of his neighbourhood, a pair of trees or a couple of backpacks for goals.

If they are not, or if they are deterred by the weather, he comes here, to a playground a stone's throw from the high-rise apartment block he calls home, and wallops his football against the side of a squat red-brick building with a sloping terracotta-coloured roof.

It is an easy, carefree pastime, but even at this young age, he knows that it will make him a better footballer; every touch and every shot strengthening his bond with the ball, sharpening his muscle memory. Control, thump. Control, touch, thump.

The spindly youngster is at the beginning of a journey that will successively turn him into one of the most promising, one of the most unfortunate, one of the most maddening and ultimately one of the most celebrated football players in the world.

At Rennes and then Borussia Dortmund, he is the very epitome of footballing potential: a whirlwind of sidesteps and breezy dribbles, a broad smile forever stretched across his face, a trail of befuddled opponents forever floundering in his wake.

At Barcelona, after a record-breaking €135million transfer, things get complicated: injuries, recurrent complaints about his time-keeping and professionalism, the fear that his potential is destined never to be truly fulfilled.

But the planets have aligned at Paris Saint-Germain, where his abrupt transformation into a prolific goalscorer means that he approaches Saturday's Champions League final against Inter in Munich accompanied by a higher level of expectation than perhaps any other player. Should PSG prevail, the Ballon d'Or could well be his.

As he stands on the brink of career-defining glory, this is his story so far.

By Moustapha Diatta's reckoning, he was five years old when he first met Dembele, who was one year older. The two boys' mothers were close friends and their families lived in the same building in La Madeleine, a disadvantaged district of the Normandy town of Evreux, which lies 60 miles west of Paris.

“The days often revolved around football,” Diatta tells The Athletic. “We'd have kickabouts with friends at the foot of our building or we'd challenge a team from another neighbourhood to a game.

“Ousmane always had a ball with him. And he had a gift. He could already shoot with both feet and his dribbling was instinctive. The results were pretty incredible.”

A child of the 2000s, having been born in May 1997, Dembele grew up idolising players such as David Beckham, Steven Gerrard and Lionel Messi. The dream of following in their gilded footsteps took root at an early age.

“When we were young, he told me several times that he was going to become a great player,” says Diatta. “That's one of his character traits: when he wants something, he does everything to get it.”

Dembele was seven years old when he and Diatta joined local club ALM Evreux (later to become Evreux FC), whose pitches lay a 10-minute walk away across the Boulevard du 14 Juillet. The first time Evreux youth coach Gregory Badoche laid eyes on him, he could scarcely believe them.

“He stood out a mile,” Badoche recalls. “It was almost paranormal: the quality of his sidesteps, his dribbles, the crazy changes of rhythm. He was a little shrimp, you know, a very slender guy with legs like toothpicks, but his dribbling ability was insane.”

Interest from major local clubs did not take long to arrive. Le Havre and Caen both made overtures, but Rennes won out after offering to help Dembele's family — his mother, Fatimata, his brother and his two sisters – to relocate to Brittany with him.

Expectations, on both sides, were high.

“There was a recruiter from Rennes called Armand Djire who used to come and watch him regularly,” says Badoche. “When Ousmane was still only 12, Armand said to me: ‘If he doesn't become a professional, I'll end my career'.”

As the former director of the Rennes academy, Yannick Menu has equally fond memories of ‘Dembouz' the burgeoning footballer and Dembele the burgeoning person.

“Ousmane is someone who's very cheerful and very smiley,” he says.

“Sometimes our relationship was a bit stormy, because when you're in contact with a young person every day, that can happen. But he loved football and he loved training and he always gave everything on the pitch.”

Dembele made rapid progress in the Rennes youth ranks and was capped by France at both under-17 and under-18 level. But he was frustrated by what he felt was a lack of consideration from the club. Amid interest from Red Bull Salzburg, he downed tools in the summer of 2015, sitting out a two-week training camp in Germany, before eventually putting pen to paper on a three-year professional contract.

After making his debut off the bench in a 2-0 win at Angers in October 2015, the 18-year-old became a fixture in the starting XI and finished his maiden campaign with an excellent return of 12 goals and five assists from 26 Ligue 1 games.

“He was very collective-minded,” says former Rennes head coach Philippe Montanier. “He was a dribbler, but he always dribbled with intention.

“And he had personality as well. I remember the derby against Lorient (a 2-2 draw in January 2016). We went 2-0 down in the first half, but he was the one who was urging his team-mates to react.”

Dembele's remarkable two-footedness left observers agog. A hat-trick of right-foot strikes in a 4-1 win over Nantes was followed by a notorious post-match interview in which even he seemed not to know which was his stronger foot.

The unintentionally comical effect of that interview created an impression of a young player whose head was tethered to his shoulders with less than customary tightness. But those who know him insist that behind the impression of absent-mindedness lies a keen intelligence.

“Sometimes he'll seem a bit in his own world, then the next second he'll seem very switched on,” says a source close to Dembele, speaking anonymously to protect relationships.

“He's passionate about historical documentaries, for example. So in a conversation, you might think he's a bit lost, but then he'll suddenly start talking to you about the Bolsheviks.

“It's like when he's on the pitch — he's constantly throwing people off-balance.”

Before his first season in senior football had reached its conclusion, Dembele had been announced as a Dortmund player, joining the club from the Ruhr valley on a five-year contract for a fee of €15million.

Diatta, who played at centre-back, signed for Dortmund's reserves and the pair embarked on a German adventure together, first living in a hotel and then moving into a house in the city centre.

“We had a pretty simple life there,” Diatta recalls. “It was our first experience overseas, so we were discovering life abroad. We were lucky to find French players there like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who really took Ousmane under his wing.”

The kind of football career that Dembele had pictured for himself in those kickabouts in La Madeleine was suddenly upon him: a gigantic stadium, packed to the rafters with 80,000 wildly cheering fans; glamorous Champions League ties against Real Madrid, Sporting CP, Benfica and Monaco; taut domestic tussles with Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig.

Initially taken aback by the intensity of Dortmund's training sessions, Dembele soon got up to speed and credited head coach Thomas Tuchel with giving him the liberty to play his natural game.

“When I have the ball, it's total freedom,” he told L'Equipe. “It's something that I need. I'm allowed to move into the middle, put myself in the number 10 position, change wings. It's gratifying to feel this confidence in me, as if I was 25.”

Forming a devilish three-pronged attack alongside Aubameyang and Marco Reus, Dembele enjoyed a brilliant first season, playing a starring role in Dortmund's conquest of the DFB-Pokal and being named the Bundesliga's Rookie of the Season (one year on from having won the equivalent award in France).

But the youngster's impatience came to the fore once more the following summer when he went on strike again, leaving a bad taste at Dortmund that lingers to this day. This time it was to force through a move to the club of his dreams.

Before joining Barcelona, Dembele had never sustained a serious injury. Within two weeks of being unveiled at a sun-soaked Camp Nou in August 2017, he ruptured the tendon in the femoral bicep of his left thigh, which sidelined him for nearly four months. It created an unfortunate template for what was to follow.

In Dembele's early years at Barca, his body continually betrayed him. Further problems with his left hamstring came in January 2018 and March 2019. A muscle tear in his right thigh in May 2019. A muscle tear in his left thigh the following August. A complete right hamstring tear in February 2020. A knee tendon issue in June 2021 that forced him out of Euro 2020.

By the time he left Barcelona in the summer of 2023, after six seasons at the club, he had missed no fewer than 119 matches due to injury.

It did not help that, even when he was fit, he did not always seem entirely present, with repeated instances of lateness driving the club's decision-makers to distraction.

Dembele was living with Diatta and his uncle in a luxurious house in Barcelona's upmarket Pedralbes neighbourhood and the fear within the club was that he was spending too much time playing video games and not enough time focused on football.

“In his early days, he didn't have the professional mindset of a Barca player,” says a source who worked with Dembele during his time at the club.

“His eating habits were horrible. He also had a phase when he'd show up very late for training. He was fined for that multiple times. Sometimes he'd fall asleep at home and that was it. He even missed medical appointments.”

Diatta puts Dembele's teething problems at Barca down to inexperience. “When you buy a player at such a young age and there are lots of expectations around him, you should be able to forgive him a few little mistakes,” he says.

Eventually, the penny dropped. Encouraged by his agent, Moussa Sissoko, Dembele took on a full-time personal chef, Anthony Audebaud, in the summer of 2019. Out went the Coca-Cola and the ready meals, in came the sea bream, the sea bass, the spring chicken and the vegetables.

A year later he started working with a personal fitness coach, former elite sprinter Salah Ghaidi, and physiotherapist Jean-Baptiste Duault, who was taken on after impressing Dembele's entourage with his analysis of the player's injury problems in an interview with L'Equipe.

The feeling in Dembele's camp was that Barcelona's focus on patient, possession-dependent football meant that their training sessions were not sufficiently dynamic for him from a physical perspective. Backed by his new personal support staff, Dembele took physical preparation and injury prevention into his own hands, constructing a daily fitness schedule designed to strengthen and protect the muscles that had previously been his undoing.

With his injury problems finally behind him, Dembele's last three seasons at Barcelona were much happier as he became a key figure under first Ronald Koeman and then Xavi. Although his attacking statistics remained largely underwhelming, he bowed out as a Barca player with three La Liga titles and two Copa del Rey wins to his name.

“He eventually became a sort of veteran in the dressing room and his team-mates understood him better in his last years,” says the Barcelona source. “Dembele ended up being loved for how he was.”

The turnaround in Dembele's Barca fortunes also permitted him to resurrect his international career. He played only a peripheral role in France's triumph at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, having lost his place after their opening game, and then went 860 days without playing for Les Bleus between November 2018 and March 2021.

But although injury curtailed his involvement at Euro 2020, he was a first-choice pick on the right flank at both the 2022 World Cup and Euro 2024. Close to Kylian Mbappe, Dembele is popular in the France squad due to his irrepressible bonhomie and has long retained national coach Didier Deschamps' backing, in spite of his many injury problems, thanks to his unique ability to unlock matches.

“Some players understand things very quickly and are already mature at the age of 19 or 20, like Kylian,” says Ludovic Batelli, who coached both Dembele and Mbappe at under-19 level with France.

“I think Ousmane needed a bit more time to understand that work, rigour and discipline would make him even more effective and successful. But as they say — better late than never.”

Having agreed to meet a €50million (£42.9m, $54.9m) release clause in Dembele's Barcelona contract, the PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi sold his club's project to the forward by vowing that he would be the homegrown figurehead of a young, hungry team with a strong French identity.

Paris had been a 70-minute train ride from Evreux during Dembele's childhood and he had happy memories of going to watch games with his friends at the Parc des Princes.

It helped, too, that Dembele already knew PSG's newly appointed coach. While coach of Barcelona, Luis Enrique had enquired about the winger's availability following his breakthrough at Rennes, only for Dembele to inform him that he had already given his word to Dortmund. Seven years on, their paths finally converged.

“Luis Enrique was fiercely protective of him, right from day one,” says a source close to the PSG coach. “He was confident that he had something magical in his hands and that under him, Dembele was going to flourish.”

After claiming a league and Coupe de France double alongside Mbappe in his maiden PSG season, Dembele was one of the players expected to step up to the plate when his long-time friend left the French capital for Real Madrid last summer.

Things did not get off to the best start when he was dropped on disciplinary grounds for PSG's 2-0 defeat at Arsenal in the Champions League in October.

Dembele had questioned Luis Enrique's possession-heavy tactics during a team briefing and subsequently reported late for a training session, although a source close to him suggests that he was primarily axed for the trip to the Emirates Stadium in order to send a message to the rest of the squad.

Yet only two months later, Luis Enrique happened upon a tactical innovation that would reinvigorate PSG's season — and transform Dembele's career.

The decision to deploy Dembele as a false nine for a 3-1 home win over Lyon in mid-December proved the spark for a stupendous run of goal-scoring form in which the France international racked up 27 goals in only 22 appearances.

Amassed in the space of only three and a half months, it represented twice as many goals as he had ever previously mustered over the course of an entire season.

Dembele, who has scored 33 goals in all competitions, attributes his improved fortunes to the fact that his central role means he has to expend less effort in order to get into shooting positions, enabling him to take aim at goal with fresher legs. Sources close to him additionally point to the hours of work he has spent on his finishing in training over the last 12 months, as well as input from a personal video analyst.

As the deliberately elusive focal point of a deliberately loose-limbed starting XI, the super-fit Dembele also plays a pivotal role in PSG's build-up play and their formidable pressing game.

Having turned 28 earlier this month, Dembele is one of the senior figures in the PSG squad. Although grand speeches have never been his style (“a connector rather than a leader” is how one source describes him), he fulfils an important function in the club's youthful, multilingual changing room.

“He speaks several languages, which facilitates links with his team-mates,” says a source close to the PSG squad. “He's also someone who's very jovial, who likes taking the mick, and that helps to create a good atmosphere and bind the squad together.”

Dembele's performances have also benefited from the fact that, away from the pitch, he has moved into a more settled phase in his life. He married Moroccan influencer Rima Edbouche in December 2021 and they had a baby daughter in September 2022.

A practicing Muslim, PSG's No 10 is scrupulously discrete about his private life and describes himself as “casanier”, meaning ‘a homebody'. Though fatherhood and the demands of elite-level football have inevitably reduced the amount of free time on his hands, he remains a committed Football Manager player and watches as much live football as he can. “I watch practically every championship,” he confided to Le Parisien last year.

Few would have bet on him emerging from the current campaign with a stronger claim to the Ballon d'Or than Mbappe. But according to those who know him, until he has the Champions League trophy in his hands, thoughts of individual glory can wait.

“For him, the most important thing is to win the Champions League with Paris Saint-Germain, because it would be something historic,” says best friend Diatta.

“And it'd be deserved, when you look at his journey. He's been through tough times, people have spoken ill of him, about the injuries and things like that, but he's never complained. He's just kept working.”

One more assured first touch, one more thumping finish, and a little boy's dreams will all come true.

“I've been super excited to be a part of this show and take part in the magic that is Paranormal Cirque.” 

That's from Sandra Kalista, also known as The Amazing Zilla. 

She is one of the performers with Cirque Italia's Paranormal Cirque, set to wow Lethbridge audiences with shows under the big top until June 2 on the grounds outside the Agri-food Hub and Trade Centre. 

Kalista says this is her first year with Cirque Italia, having joined the troupe in January. She brings a blend of comedy, suspense, and sword swallowing to the table. 

However, she has been a circus sideshow entertainer for over 21 years and has been honing her craft for almost three decades. Kalista explains that she was first immersed in the art form after her older brother was diagnosed with cancer and was receiving treatment at a hospital near their home in Florida. 

“I found out that I was excellent at improv as well as observational humour, so I started doing clown [work] and stand-up comedy for the kids and the young adults there at the hospital,” she says, adding she learned how to do other ‘party tricks' like feats of strength. 

This led to her getting booked for one-off performances before starting to perform with circus sideshows in her early 20s. 

Cirque Italia found Kalista through her social media channels, and after what she calls a “fantastic interview process”, she officially joined the troupe for its Paranormal Cirque, which blends elements of horror with the acrobatics and showmanship of the circus. 

She adds that one aspect she truly appreciates with this show is the strong female representation. “I have never seen such strong female representation on stage,” Kalista says, adding that, “The majority of our thrill and danger acts are actually led by these amazing, gorgeous, strong and talented women.” 

“It's a whole different experience. When I usually go to the circus, it's mostly men or usually a 50-50 split depending on acro, aerial, yoga, that kind of stuff, but this is more women-dominated, where they are able to express different aspects of their art and other characters that aren't as normally highlighted in horror situations like movies, plays [or] theatrics, so the fact that we're doing this in circus form is even more fun for me, and it's like we get to express different levels of our artistic art form and I couldn't be more excited for everybody here in Lethbridge to see it.” 

Kalista noted that representation on all levels is an important aspect of the circus. “I am a plus-sized entertainer,” she says. 

“A lot of people don't expect to see a size 16 be able to be as strong or as athletic or high-energy as I am, so for people to be able to see that kind of plus-sized representation across the board – being able to be smart, funny, talented, witty [and] energetic – and we have all different kinds of body types on the cast, male and female as well as those in between that choose not to disclose, so it's fantastic to see everybody being able to live their true authentic selves here with the circus and people get to experience that in this theatrical, immersive event.” 

Kalista says audience members who attended the troupe's performance in 2024 in Lethbridge can expect a few new characters and acts for 2025.  

For anyone who is thinking of a career in the circus or performing arts, Kalista says, “Be focused, stay calm and collected, and maintain your discipline”. 

You can check out some of Kalista's work on her Instagram page. 

She adds that the Paranormal Cirque is geared toward a mature audience, so those under the age of 13 are not permitted to attend. Children aged 13 to 17 can check out the performance but must be accompanied by an adult who is 21 or older.

More information about the Paranormal Cirque is available at the show website, Instagram page, and on Facebook.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","15 Best Supernatural Horror Movies Of All Time, Ranked","https://www.slashfilm.com/1869611/best-supernatural-horror-movies-ranked/","Sun, 01 Jun 2025 12:10:00 GMT","



What exactly is a supernatural horror film? The defining word there, supernatural, refers to things and events beyond our scientific understanding, but that's far broader a definition than it might sound. Vampires and werewolves, zombies and witches, cursed objects and nightmares bleeding into the real world — they're all beyond our grasp and therefore supernatural. Heck, all eight ""Leprechaun"" movies and all but the first two ""Friday the 13th"" films fit the bill, too.

Narrowing down the best supernatural horror films becomes a daunting task given that lens, so we're going to drill down a little deeper. For our purposes here, we're going to focus on a more generally accepted view of the supernatural, namely, things that are attributable to an ethereal source and mostly unseen. Think ghosts, demonic entities, vengeful spirits, and the like. Of course, even this slimmer definition leaves the door wide open with literally hundreds of worthy contenders, but we're going to highlight fifteen of the best that the subgenre has to offer.

Now keep reading for a look at the best supernatural horror films.



Father and son coroners is already such a satisfying setup, one worthy of a long running television series, but ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" ups the ante further with the pairing of Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch in the roles. The two find themselves working late at night on a recently delivered corpse, but as their scalpels come out, so do long-buried truths and grim realities. It seems this is no ordinary unidentified body — this was a woman with immense power. And maybe she still is...

Director Andre Ovredal delivers a slick and frequently scary film here that unfolds almost entirely inside the morgue. It's a sterile, streamlined environment, but the film breathes life into it and finds legitimately frightening beats in every corner of the small space — if you won't take my word for it, maybe you'll listen to Stephen King's thoughts on its scares. The woman's secrets speak to pain and suffering, assaults that seem destined to be paid back in full against those who find themselves in her presence. Its ending might not be as strong as everything that comes before, but the slow unspooling of its dark supernatural truths still makes for a highly effective piece of horror.



Religious horror is a subgenre that itself consists of several smaller subgenres. Some are distinguished by the wide variety of the world's religions, but others stand out through how they choose to explore the familiar. While far too many horror movies touch on the Christian faith through narrow stories of possession, 1977's ""The Sentinel"" takes a more original approach with a protagonist who finds herself sitting atop a gate to hell itself.

Unlike Lucio Fulci's grotesquely gothic masterpiece, ""The Beyond,"" Michael Winner's film finds less nihilism over the gate and more hope. Of course, this being Christian horror, that hope comes with guilt and sacrifice, and that's where the movie's dramatic and thematic weight comes from. It's a fascinating reveal, one that comes after a steadily grotesque and violent slow burn build, and there's power in its emotional weight. A creepy atmosphere, even creepier neighbors, and a truth that threatens the world all stem from that collision between the supernatural and the human.



Hideo Nakata's 1998 original, ""Ring,"" can't be discounted as it still sits as a moody slow burn well worth your time, but Gore Verbinski's 2002 remake, ""The Ring,"" surpasses it in both power and style. Like the original, Verbinski's film finds life and death in the tangible, haunted reminders of our past. An innocuous VHS tape, itself a ghost of yesterday, is home to an ethereal rage that quite literally crawls out of your television to do you harm.

The curiously grim aspect at play here sees only those unable to pull themselves away from the images being targeted. It's simple — don't watch the tape, and you'll be fine, but for some people that's like asking them to stop breathing. Today's equivalent would be trying to pry people off social media or their cell phones, but there's something far more satisfying in seeing the intangible anger of the dead infect us through the clicks, hisses, and whirring of a machine prone to displaying the lies we pass off as entertainment.



Some will think that William Friedkin's highly acclaimed adaptation of William Peter Blatty's bestselling novel deserves a higher spot on this list, but it's worth repeating that all of the film here are fantastic pieces of supernatural horror. ""The Exorcist"" is the clear inspiration for hundreds of possession films that followed, and while its various beats have grown more familiar and cliched over the years, its execution remains masterful from beginning to end.

It's a tale of good versus evil, innocence versus the monstrous, and ultimately the power of faith over doubt. Two priests descend on the home of a young girl possessed by a malevolent demon, and it's their faith being put to the ultimate test. From Friedkin's visuals and Dick Smith's makeup effects to Jack Nitzsche's unforgettable score and Jason Miller's haunted, embattled performance, the film takes hold and encases you its evolving nightmare of devilish intent for the full two hours.



Possession films that approach things from a fresh angle will always beat those that follow the expected path — someone's possessed, bring in a priest, spiritual battle, the end — and Sean Byrne's second feature finds success as one of the former. ""The Devil's Candy"" sees a family of three move into a new home only to discover two things. A satanic presence hovers in the air like the stench of the dead, and the man who used to live there really, really wants his house back. Oh, and the guy has also fully given himself over to the dark side, too.

Heavy metal music, intense violence, and the brash, caustic artwork of a father dancing on the edge of the devil's pitchfork collide into a family drama that delivers genuine scares. A big reason for its success comes down to Byrne's pairing of supernatural threats with a family we truly come to care about. Ethan Embry, Shiri Appleby, and Kiara Glasco earn a spot in our hearts, and the evil on their doorstep leaves us genuinely fearing for their sanity and lives.



Creepy kid movies really hit their peak in the '70s and '80s, and while we've seen plenty since then, they've really gone downhill in their effectiveness as they too often feel self-aware and played almost for laughs. Richard Donner's 1976 chiller, ""The Omen,"" is played straight and remains a thrilling, frightening look at the devil's intrusion onto the earthly plane. A U.S. diplomat and his wife unknowingly adopt Satan's spawn, and that truth only comes clear as the boy's childhood becomes fraught with death and unexplainable occurrences.

Donner wisely balances the supernatural premise with a classy, A-list cast including Gregory Peck and Lee Remick as the unwitting parents and a haunting score by Jerry Goldsmith. There's something clearly off with the kid, and the arrival of a suspicious nanny and terrifying guard dog dial the threat even higher, but the horror is infused with humanity in the form of Peck's character. He's traumatized by the devilish truth here, but he's hurt even more by the realization that he'll have to do something terrible to stop this evil, something no parent can calmly envision.



Emotional suffering and pain are frequent elements in supernatural horror, particularly ghost stories. Ghost themselves are reminders of the past, and they're often hanging around due to an unresolved sadness or cruelty from when they were still alive. One of the many beautiful things about Joel Anderson's ""Lake Mungo"" is that its ghost isn't seeking to scare people or find retribution — she ultimately wants only to help her loved ones see her, understand her, and let her go.

Anderson frames his film as a faux documentary of sorts as the drowning death of a teenager leaves her parents and brother in disarray. Unexplained noises and sightings raise questions, and the answers, when they come, are as hauntingly creepy as they are devastatingly bittersweet. Like the best work from Mike Flanagan and James Wan, the film finds its biggest scares in its quieter moments with terrifying images tucked to the side of the frame, waiting for viewers to catch it unprepared. It all makes for a haunting experience with an ending that will also leave you affected by its exploration of grief.



Haunted house movies are a mainstay of supernatural horror, but while most aim to tick off many of the same boxes, Nobuhiko Obayashi's ""House"" goes rogue in the best and weirdest of ways. Seven friends arrive at a remote house owned by one of their aunt's, but they discover almost immediately that the house has little time for the young and the restless. This is a home built on sadness and loss, but like the house itself, Obayashi is a trickster concealing his dark themes beneath a fountain of folly and wacky antics.

Taken out of context, the film's visuals and death scenes might seem silly and cartoonish as there's definitely a streak of fun, wildly creative sequences complete with unabashedly homemade optical effects. Watched as a whole, though, the film reveals an anger built on past pain and lost love that's taken out on younger generations disrespectful to the suffering that endured by those who came before. It's goofy, bright, bloody, and childlike in its surrealistic approach, but it's also an endlessly sad acknowledgment of loss in post-war Japan. So heavy, so light, so undeniably unique.



Ari Aster's ""Hereditary"" is the kind of feature debut that most filmmakers would kill for as it takes modern sensibilities and styles and blends them beautifully with brutally dark themes and events found more frequently in films from the '70s. Lineage and fate play a role here as a family gathers to mourn the death of their matriarch only to discover the evil coursing through their veins and in the air around them. Events are in motion, and there's no escape.

The film finds life in variety as a gory accident paves the way for messy seance shenanigans, cursed books, and possession. It's that last bit delivers big by never feeling even remotely familiar, and it instead avoids possession tropes by having different reactions — where one possession is sedate, the next is terrifying as it makes a woman hunt her own child with a bloodlust in her eyes. There's a nihilistic inevitability here, one captured with sharp cinematography and oppressive score, leading to an ending that leaves you drained and gobsmacked by evil.



John Carpenter's filmography features a few gems worthy of inclusion on a list of the best supernatural horrors including ""Christine,"" ""Prince of Darkness,"" and ""In the Mouth of Madness,"" but it's ""The Fog"" that ultimately earns the spot. Ghost stories just hit different when they're being told by an old man with a British accent in front of a campfire. Carpenter unspools a wonderfully eerie tale of death, legend, and justice from beyond the grave, inspired by the films of Val Lewton, and it feels like a wholly satisfying pairing of the old-fashioned and the new.

A small coastal town sees itself visited by ghostly apparitions hellbent on revenge, and Carpenter builds genuinely suspenseful and frightening set pieces out of their slow, fog-shrouded approach. The cast is fully onboard for the scary good times with fun turns by Tom Atkins, Jamie Lee Curtis, Lanet Leigh, Adrienne Barbeau, and Hal Holbrook, and the director's own score finds just the right beat for the horrors. It's a simple tale, something that works in its favor as we're able to just sit back and enjoy the spook show.



Like ""Lake Mungo"" above, Koji Shiraishi's ""Noroi: The Curse"" frames its supernatural horrors in the form of a faux documentary, but that's where the similarities end. Where the former is a slow burn built on ghostly images and grief, this Japanese gem doles out all manner of horrifying teases that ultimately coalesce into an increasingly mad descent into hell. The documentary we're watching was made by a filmmaker who subsequently disappeared, and we're about to see why.

Strange deaths, only some of which were accidental, leads a documentarian to discover even stranger things including a girl with psychic abilities, the sound of phantom baby cries, an ancient demon, stolen fetuses, possession, and more. It's an evolving tale, and while there's various supernatural terrors throughout, it's the knowledge that our guide is destined to disappear that hangs over the watch — it's the horror of knowing what our protagonist doesn't, and by the time his wife is done immolating herself we're left traumatized by what our eyes have been made to witness. These are visuals that will stick with you.



Ed and Lorraine Warren may have been a couple of hucksters making quick money off people's desperate need to believe, but there's no denying the terrifyingly good entertainment that filmmaker James Wan has crafted from their lives. 2013's ""The Conjuring"" kicked things off, and it was soon followed by two direct sequels (soon to be three) and six spinoffs. The quality of the films varies throughout the franchise, but Wan's ""The Conjuring 2"" remains a high point.

The film sees the Warrens head to England to see if a family's claims of possession merit any truth, and there are plenty of scares sharing the screen with moments of genuine warmth between characters. We get our first look at the demonic nun, Valek, in this movie, and Wan makes her arrival genuinely terrifying, which in turn makes it understandable why the character landed two spinoffs of her own. Possession, ghostly remnants, demonic presences, and deadly premonitions all come into play here as Wan marries slick filmmaking with old-school scares.



Stephen King is on record as being very unhappy with Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of ""The Shining,"" but while his complaints are understandable, those of us who didn't write the novel are left with a beautifully crafted haunted house film about one man's alcohol-fueled descent into ghostly madness. Addiction and abuse are kept as underlying themes while the Overlook Hotel's ghostly influence infects a weak man with murderous intentions leaving his family forced into a nightmarish game of hide and seek.

Kubrick's film does a fantastic job capturing how supernatural horrors like ghosts and haunting premonitions can infuse both buildings and characters with added depth and meaning. The hotel's isolation makes it ideal for the slow creep of madness that injects itself into Jack Torrance, and while Jack Nicholson's performance makes him feel slightly off from the very start, his decline is still both evident and frightening. It's a big, artfully done slow burn — think A24's horror best before that was even a thing — and it's one of the greatest horror movies, period.



Haunted house movies can sometimes feel more than a little familiar, but Tobe Hooper's ""Poltergeist"" succeeds by twisting the formula just a bit and dropping a loveable family into its suburban nightmare. The Freelings are a family of five who move into their new home in a new suburb but quickly discover they're sitting atop old sins. Spooky events culminate in their youngest daughter being sucked into a ghostly dimension.

Various elements of this have become iconic from the creepy television set to the terrifying clown to the swimming pool filled with corpses, and the horrors build to include parapsychologists, goopy portals, and optical effects. Through all the scares, Hooper and producer Steven Spielberg keep the family relatable, the spookiness high, and the feeling of fun ever present. This is a ghost story as big summer entertainment, and it leaves you smiling even as you're sinking into your chair with a playful fear.



Our number one pick might surprise some people, both because of the film itself and because it's landing ahead of some mighty big classics, but ""The Entity"" deserves this spot on our list of the best supernatural horror films. Ignore its ""based on a true story"" trappings, and instead just settle in for a simple film about a woman being haunted by an unseen spirit. Now replace the word haunted with others like assaulted, brutalized, and terrorized. Lots of ghost movies are creepy — ""The Entity"" is legitimately terrifying.

Barbara Hershey gives a fully committed performance as the woman targeted by the malicious spirit, and director Sidney Furie captures them with a starkly ferocious energy. No one believes her, of course, but the attacks continue even after she's moved to an observation room, and even under the lights and scientific scrutiny, it's still scary as hell. It's another slow burn, but themes of victimhood, misogyny, and more are given time to simmer between attacks that grow more frequent and frightening, and it all leads to both a big confrontation and a sad truth.","{'href': 'https://www.slashfilm.com', 'title': 'SlashFilm'}","other"

Showrunner/EP Derek Haas's Jensen Ackles (The Boys, Supernatural)-starring Countdown is previewed in Prime Video's June 2025 trailer.



No, you're not seeing double. Shortly after we looked at what Showrunner/EP Derek Haas (NBC's ""Chicago"" franchise) had to share about the upcoming series, Prime Video dropped a new trailer previewing the main titles set to release this month. If you're reading this, then you know that Jensen Ackles (The Boys, Supernatural)-starring Countdown not only made the cut but also secured that sweet anchor spot at the end.

Here's a look at Prime Video's June 2025 trailer, with the look at Countdown kicking in at around the 4:40 mark:



When an officer with the Department of Homeland Security is murdered in broad daylight, LAPD detective Mark Meachum (Ackles) is recruited to a secret task force, alongside undercover agents from all branches of law enforcement, to investigate. But the hunt for the killer soon uncovers a plot far more sinister than anyone could have imagined, kicking off a race against time to save a city of millions. Ackles's Mark Meachum is described as a rogue L.A. detective, wrong-side-of-the-tracks kind of guy who takes risks that most people wouldn't take. That could make things difficult when Meachum finds himself part of an elite team that also includes Nathan Blythe (Eric Dane), Amber Oliveras (Jessica Camacho), Keyonte Bell (Elliot Knight), Evan Shepherd (Violett Beane), and Lucas Finau (Uli Latukefu).

Speaking exclusively this week with EW, Haas noted that the show's drama won't just be about big action scenes, with Meachum involved in some romantic entanglements. ""It's not going to be just one,"" Haas added about the potential romantic dynamics at play. ""I love the triangle. It's my favorite shape. And we're going to have a few of those."" In addition, Ackles discussed what it was like working with the ensemble cast, how Supernatural fans might find similarities between Meachum and Dean Winchester, and how the series made him feel a bit like Tom Cruise:

Ackles on Working with the ""Countdown"" Cast: ""It's like every ingredient for a perfect dish. Everybody blends well together. Everybody's so giving and happy to do whatever it takes for the team.""

Ackles on Fans Finding Similarities Between Mark Meachum & Dean Winchester: ""There's probably going to be some familiarity from that fandom with this guy. It's not like I'm going so opposite spectrum with this character. He's going to be a familiar taste, which is good. I like doing that. I mean, I played Dean for 15 years. I loved playing that kind of a character. And I think this guy is in the vein of that, just with a completely different set of circumstances.""

Ackles on Getting ""Getting My Tom Cruise On"" with ""Countdown"": ""I actually just did some ADR the other day for an action sequence. I was watching it and I was like, 'Oh, I'm getting my Tom Cruise on here. This is some full-on action stuff.'""

Out in the village of Agua Fría (which, although that sounds rural and out of town-ish, is actually well within what we all consider Santa Fe), they've got a little bit of everything. Donkeys. Goats. Horses. “Yesterday morning, a pheasant showed up on our property,” notes clairvoyant teacher and spiritual healer Lisa Pelletier, whose home and Deep Roots Psychic Studio are headquartered in this rural pocket. A pathway leads to the low-profile studio. “It's crunchy. There's no plumbing. It's a bit like camping sometimes. But it's a studio, so people are very forgiving. They don't expect it to be diamond plaster walls or anything,” she figures. Best of all, “Combining with the land, it just feels very calming, harmonious, very generous as well. It's both a receptive and a giving space. It's not just me. It's a combination of all of the things that create that.”

The feeling inside the studio suits her. “It's very grounding. I bring to it a lot of my spiritual practice and psychic awareness. I'm working with all kinds of energies, working with the land and beings, on the healing I give to my clients and my students and the healing I do on myself. So all of that is incredibly healing and grounding and centering,” she says. In fact, “It's revelatory, is what this studio feels like.”

With high ceilings at 20 feet and tall windows that stretch to 16 feet, the studio is about 24 feet wide by 30 feet long. “It feels very expansive,” describes Pelletier. “The room sits right on top of the ground. It has very little footing. It's ground level. It has cement flooring but no insulation.”

Furnishings include a huge wooden desk on wheels, a big couch where clients sit, a few lamps, some modern Swedish teak chairs, a cedar chest that belonged to her great grandmother, throw rugs and a video set-up where she teaches on Zoom. “It's a light, bright, healing spiritual studio. I do a lot of creating here. A lot of it is non-physical. I'm creating curriculum and healings and new possibilities,” Pelletier remarks. There's not a lot of color, but there are patches of aqua, teal and turquoise, including a turquoise ceramic dish with carved birds and inquiry cards. A giant plant that she identifies as a type of philodendron has been hers since she was 18. She's 59 now.

Office hours are irregular. “I'm here whenever spirit calls—morning, day and night,” she details. “I do clairvoyant healings, whether live or remote. Before the clients show up for the session, I meditate to center myself and be in a neutral and compassionate place. I do energy work in the room. All the spiritual work I do, I'm using my non-physical sight, the sight of my spirit is how I see it. I do deep meditation.” With the five huge south-facing windows, “I have a wonderful view of the night sky, when I'm in here meditating at night. I can see the stars, and the moon will generally arc in that southern-facing sky.”

As soon as she found the property 10 years ago with her husband, actor/director Scott Harrison, Pelletier knew she would use this space for her practice. “I had a sense of all of it, the healing and spiritual work I would be doing in here. I felt it all. I'm clairvoyant, so I could feel all that healing and creativity. I had that kind of timeless feeling of, It's all right here already,” she comments. On a design level, “That sort of unfinished, crunchy quality, it's crafty, that's my and my husband's style. We're not really into polished things. So just the style of it felt very lovely and familiar.”

Lisa Pelletier, psychic, teacher and healer, stands at the entrance of her Deep Roots Psychic Studio.

The studio space called to her on many levels: “The physical space, and the psychic space. For folks who aren't clairvoyant, they can think of it as psychological space. I feel like I have a lot of space to be who I am, and to be how I am. That's something that I actively maintain and grow,” she explains. What's more, “It has what feels like if we took our homes in Velarde and Cordova and moved them down here to Santa Fe. Which was sort of a wish we had when we first left northern New Mexico to come down here.”

Pelletier grew up mostly in south-central Connecticut, spending summers on Cape Cod. She went to the University of Connecticut, earning a bachelor's degree in fine arts and becoming a graphic designer. She and Harrison were living in New York when, “We made a list of cities that were green—artistic and more natural.” Santa Fe was unknown to them when they visited in 2002. On their last day, she recalls, “We saw this very tiny listing that said: Small adobe. Velarde. On river. $900.” Two months later, they were living there.

“People end up moving here and visiting here for healing. And a lot of the people who live here become proficient in healing themselves and sharing healing. That's the aspect of Santa Fe that I love,” she declares. A regular at Sweetwater Harvest Kitchen, Harry's Roadhouse and Iconik Coffee Roasters, Pelletier is a harmony-oriented Libra. “Because I'm an air sign,” she reasons, “I love the water and earth, perhaps to complete. I can be sometimes more mental, or I used to be, and I love to have that counterpoint.”

What she values most about her favorite room? “The spiritual freedom, which is a tenet of my practice, and my teachings,” she decides. “It goes back to a giving and receiving quality. The land here and this room really gives that and supports that. All the energy work and prayer that I do, help that. Then the clients receive that. I receive it and give it back. It's this wonderful flow of giving and receiving, involving even the plants and also the beings who are still on the property who have been here several millennia, and my own spirit guides who came with me.”

With one repost from President Donald Trump, former president Joe Biden has joined a storied pantheon: public figures believed to have died and been replaced by clones.

Not content with spreading conspiracy theories on Friday night, late on Saturday night, Trump shared a post by a supporter to his Truth Social page that claimed Biden was killed in 2020. The post reads, “There is no #JoeBiden - executed in 2020. #Biden clones doubles & robotic engineered soulless mindless entities are what you see. Democrats dont know the difference.”

With this bizarre accusation, Biden joins such celebrities as The Beatles' Paul McCartney, who has been dodging rumors about his death since 1969, and Avril Lavigne, who has been plagued by a conspiracy theory involving her death and subsequent replacement by a clone since the 2000s.

Trump's own wife Melania has also been the subject of similar conspiracy theories, with the idea that Melania had been replaced by a body double gaining credence during Trump's first term, prompting the White House to issue a statement dismissing the theories as a “non-story.”

Trump supporters were quick to encourage the president's repost, sharing memes and “evidence” for the theory in the replies—one being that Biden's eye color allegedly changed in 2020, while another claims that Biden was replaced because his ear lobes suddenly appeared to be attached to his head, whereas prior to 2020 they were unattached.

Other commenters pointed to side-by-side photos of Biden from the 1990s and the 2020s, as well as different signatures as further proof that Biden had been murdered, with some specifying that he had been executed by a military tribunal.

It's been a conspiracy-filled weekend for Trump, with the president also reposting a conspiracy theory on Friday night that accused CBS of suppressing footage of his 2015 appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert (the footage is readily available on YouTube). 

Biden, who is still dealing with speculation about his fitness for office toward the end of his term, recently shared that he had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer.

The news prompted many in the MAGA-verse, including Trump, to call for Biden's White House doctor to be investigated for giving the former president a clean bill of health last July.

Look closely at the spots to tell leopards from jaguars: there's a subtle clue.

A large predator lurks in the brush, flashing a long tail and fur printed with telltale black and tan rosettes. It must surely be a leopard. Or … could it be a jaguar? With their stealthy hunting habits and similar builds, patterns and hues, the two large cats can be strikingly difficult to tell apart. What, in fact, is the difference between a leopard and a jaguar?

To begin with, they live in completely different parts of the world, with jaguars found in the Americas today, and leopards occurring across a large range spanning Africa, parts of the Middle East and Asia.

""They're on the opposite sides of the globe, but a long time ago they shared a common ancestor,"" Allison Devlin, jaguar program director for Panthera, the global wild cat conservation organization, told Live Science.

Jaguars and leopards are part of the Panthera genus, which also includes lions, tigers and snow leopards. Tigers and snow leopards form their own branch of the Panthera family tree, while leopards, jaguars and lions are grouped together on another branch because they descend from a separate common ancestor.

However, between 3.6 million and 2.5 million years ago, jaguars split from the common ancestor shared by their leopard and lion cousins. The origins of the Panthera genus are uncertain, but fossil evidence shows that jaguars dispersed across the Eurasian plateau about 2 million years ago, and from here they migrated across the Bering Land Bridge during the last ice age to North America, and eventually down into Mexico through South America, where this species occurs today. In fact jaguars are the only Panthera lineage that occurs in the Western Hemisphere, and exist as just one species across their entire range, Devlin said.

Meanwhile, leopards split off from their closer relatives, lions, about 2 million years ago, and spread into Africa, Southeast and Northeast Asia, where they occur as eight regional subspecies across this range today. This evolutionary history means that leopards and jaguars are different species that aren't even each other's closest relative, despite their striking similarities.

Most noticeable among these common features is their spots, but even these have subtle differences that can be used to tell the animals apart.

""The rosettes on the jaguar quite often have spots in the middle of them, whereas the leopard doesn't,"" Tara Pirie, a lecturer in ecology and conservation at the University of Surrey in the U.K., told Live Science. She shared another clue: ""[Leopard] rosettes are tightly packed, whereas the jaguar, with the spot in the middle, their rosettes are quite large and not as tightly packed.""

Related: What's the difference between apes and monkeys?

Their shared ancestry might partly explain why these two remote species both have spots. But it could also be an adaptive response to the environments they live in, a phenomenon known as convergent evolution, Devlin explained.

Rosettes, spots and other light-and-dark mixed patterns are in fact quite common in felid predators that live in partly-shaded landscapes, where their spots help keep them camouflaged. Jaguars and leopards both occur in places with partial forest cover, and both animals also rely on ambush tactics to hunt. So their coats provide critical camouflage enabling them to sneak up and pounce on prey at close range, Devlin said.

There are, however, some key differences in their hunting styles that also reveal striking physiological distinctions between the two animals.

""The way I think of it is that a leopard is built more like your all-around athlete. They can climb trees, they can run, they can ambush,"" Devlin said. ""For jaguars, they're built more like a bodybuilder, where they're heavier in the barrel, in the chest and in the head. And part of that is related to their hunting techniques.""



Jaguars are real heavyweights that can reach up to 260 pounds (120 kilograms). Their generally stockier frames include a much bulkier head than leopards have, formed by larger bones that support bigger muscles and give this animal some of the strongest jaws in the cat family, Devlin said.

Whereas most cats kill their prey through strangulation or breaking the neck, the jaguar's powerful bite gives it the extraordinary ability to kill its prey by puncturing the skull. Their bite is so strong that they can crush through the upper shells of tortoises and sea turtles, both of which they target as prey, Devlin explained.

On the other hand, at a much lighter 176 pounds (80 kg), leopards kill prey through suffocation, by biting the throat. Their smaller frames allow them to spring up into trees — something that jaguars can also do, although in general they spend far less time in trees. The leopard's arboreal preferences, meanwhile, have given them the advantage of being able to store or ""cache"" prey away from others' prying eyes, Pirie said.

Up in the canopy, the leopard's nimble-footed ways are helped along by another key tell that separates them from jaguars: a lengthier tail. ""Whereas in the leopard, it could be up to a meter [3.2 feet long], in the jaguar it is maybe 60 centimeters [1.9 feet]. So even just that 40 centimeters [1.3 feet] could bring a lot more balance,"" Pirie said.

With these features as a guide, it's just about possible to tell leopards and jaguars apart. But nature has one more trick up her sleeve: all-black leopards and jaguars. The satiny sable coats on these animals are caused by a genetic mutation, and while they might look like it, they are not a different species. In fact, they're what's known as the ""melanistic phase"" of the species in each case, according to Devlin.

—Why do cats' claws retract but dogs' claws don't?

—Why are tigers orange?

—Did cats really disappear from North America for 7 million years?

Interestingly, in both leopards and jaguars, these darker cats appear more commonly in heavily-shaded habitats. Black jaguars occur more in the dimly-lit depths of the Amazon rainforest, Devlin said.

Meanwhile ""you've got leopards over in [the Malaysian jungle], they tend to be melanistic … which would help blend them in with that dense habitat,"" Pirie said.

The rarity of melanistic leopards and jaguars makes them even more vulnerable than their regularly-spotted siblings, who are threatened by hunting, shrinking habitats and the illegal wildlife trade. As a result, jaguars and leopards share the unfortunate fact that their populations are both in decline, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

But we have the tools to change that, Devlin said. ""If they have the habitat, the prey and the protection that they need, they can persist.""

A federal appeals court has obliged a Korean spa in Lynnwood, Washington to provide services to transgender females. The beauty parlor had attempted to bar transwomen who have not undergone gender-affirming surgery from entering its ladies-only facilities.

The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled Thursday, in a 2–1 vote, that Olympus Spa must change its admissions policy to comply with the anti-discrimination law. The court found that the spa's owners were not being deprived of their First Amendment rights, such as the right to free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and right of association, by the State of Washington's requirement.

Olympus Spa, which operates two locations in the state, is a traditional Korean bathhouse offering massages, body scrubs, and hot tubs that require full nudity. In 2020, the Washington State Human Rights Commission filed a complaint after a transgender woman—who had not undergone genital surgery—was denied entry.

The Commission argued that the spa's ladies-only policy violated the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD), which prohibits discrimination in public accommodations based on gender identity and gender expression.

In response, Olympus Spa filed a lawsuit claiming the state was violating the owners' constitutional rights to freedom of religion, speech, and association. The spa, run by a Christian Korean-American family, cited religious and cultural beliefs in opposing the inclusion of individuals with male genitalia in female-only spaces where nudity is required.

“The family-run business is owned by Korean Christians who hold sincere faith-based convictions against allowing persons whose genitals are external (males) to be present with persons whose genitals are internal (females) while in a state of partial or full undress if such persons are not married to one another,” the complaint stated.

However, the Ninth Circuit ruled that enforcement of the state law does not violate the First Amendment. Writing for the majority, Judge Margaret McKeown said that providing a Korean body scrub or massage does not constitute protected expressive conduct. She added that accepting the spa's argument would essentially make every gym or massage parlor exempt from nondiscrimination laws.

The ruling comes amid broader national debates on transgender rights. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump reversed several protections for trans individuals, ending federal support for child sexual mutilation procedures and issuing executive orders banning transwomen from women's sports and removing “radical gender ideology” from the military.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has unveiled a proposal to increase the power of EU members and limit the authority of its bureaucracy. Calling it a “patriotic plan” for the bloc, he said in a series of weekend social media posts that it will revive the “European dream.”

The EU elites in Brussels have exploited every crisis to amass more power, Orban claimed in a post on X. This course has so far only translated into less sovereignty for member states and “failed policies,” according to the prime minister. “Brussels hijacked our future” by disrupting public safety through migration and eroding prosperity with “green dogmas,” he stated in another post.

“Europe can't afford this any longer, it's time to take back control,” he said.The PM's plan is based on what he calls four pillars: a path toward peace on the continent and defusing tensions with Russia, removing Brussels' “centralized control” over finances, “bringing back free speech” and strengthening Europe's Christian identity, and tightening control over immigration.

“We want peace, we don't need a new Eastern front,” Orban said, commenting on his plan and stating that the bloc should not accept Ukraine as a member. “We don't want our money poured into someone else's war,” he added.

A military buildup and defense increase actively promoted by some EU nations could easily lock the bloc in an “arms race” with Russia, Orban warned. Such a development would “devour… taxpayers' money,” he said. Instead of pouring more resources into the military, the bloc needs to contribute to the peace process between Moscow and Kiev, the prime minister maintained, praising US President Donald Trump's efforts in this regard.

The EU needs to start “arms limitation talks with the Russians as soon as possible. Otherwise, all our money will be swallowed by the arms industry instead of being spent on peaceful… goals,” Orban argued.

European nations once united to create the “safest and the most advanced continent” in the world but this dream was “stolen,” the prime minister charged, calling on EU nations not to allow Brussels to use the Ukraine conflict “as an excuse to take more of our money.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin is right in considering the Ukraine conflict a proxy war against Russia, US President Donald Trump's special envoy Keith Kellogg told Fox News in an interview on Sunday.

He said that while he believes the peace process will ultimately succeed, “escalatory issues” remain. Kellogg referred to comments by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who last month indicated that Berlin would be open to supplying Kiev with Taurus cruise missiles.

Kellogg addressed Russian President Vladimir Putin's perspective, saying “he considers this a proxy war by NATO. And frankly… in a way it is.”

“The escalatory issues are still there,” Kellogg said. “Chancellor Merz has said: well, I'm going to give the Ukrainians the Taurus missile system.”

The German cruise missiles have a range of roughly 300 miles (482 km), which can allow Ukrainian strikes to reach deep into Russian territory, Kellog said. He added that Putin has made it clear: if such weapons are supplied to Ukraine, Russia will regard the suppliers as a party to the conflict.

“He considers this a proxy war by NATO. And frankly… in a way it is.”

Russia can clearly see the other Western military support Ukraine is receiving, Kellogg added.

“Everybody has got to be willing to step back a bit,” and compromise, to get the peace process “to an end state,” the envoy said.

Last week, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted that Merz's “provocative” statements “hinder peaceful efforts.” Moscow has stressed that any Ukrainian use of German Taurus missiles against Russian territory will be viewed as Berlin's direct involvement in the Ukraine conflict, as the armaments' use is impossible without the participation of Bundeswehr service members.

Last year, after Trump's predecessor Joe Biden allowed the use of US ATACMS ballistic missiles in long-range strikes on Russian territory, Moscow retaliated by revamping its strategic doctrine and lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons. Russia now considers any strike by a non-nuclear state backed up by a nuclear one as a joint attack.

Both Kellogg and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio have previously characterized the conflict as a proxy war.

“Frankly, it's a proxy war between nuclear powers – the United States, helping Ukraine, and Russia,” Rubio said in March, noting that the current White House administration is eager to see it end.

Moscow has long designated the Ukraine conflict as a Western proxy war against Russia and repeatedly condemned arms supplies to Kiev as counterproductive to the peace process.

US defence secretary ‘vilified China with defamatory allegations' at Shangri-La Dialogue

China's government has accused Pete Hegseth of trying to “sow division” in the Asia Pacific region over his speech at a Singapore defence conference where he warned China was a potentially “imminent” threat.

On Saturday Hegseth said China was “credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific”, and was rehearsing for “the real deal” of invading Taiwan.

“There's no reason to sugar coat it. The threat China poses is real, and it could be imminent,” the US defence secretary said in a keynote address at the Shangri-la Dialogue defence forum, calling for Asian countries to increase defence spending.

On Sunday, China's ministry of foreign affairs condemned his words, which it said were “filled with provocations and intended to sow division”.

“Hegseth deliberately ignored the call for peace and development by countries in the region, and instead touted the cold war mentality for bloc confrontation, vilified China with defamatory allegations, and falsely called China a ‘threat',” it said.

“The remarks were filled with provocations and intended to sow division. China deplores and firmly opposes them and has protested strongly to the US.”

The statement also pushed back at Hegseth's claim that China was trying to become a “hegemonic power” in the region.

“No country in the world deserves to be called a hegemonic power other than the US itself, who is also the primary factor undermining the peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific,” it said.

The ministry accused Hegseth of “playing with fire” with what it calls “the Taiwan question”. China's ruling Communist party (CCP) claims Taiwan is a province of China, illegally run by separatists, and has vowed to annex it. Taiwan's democratically elected government and the majority of its people reject the prospect of CCP rule.

Speaking to reporters on Sunday morning, Australia's defence minister, Richard Marles, rejected the premise of China's criticism of Hegseth.

“What we have seen from China is the single biggest increase in military capability and buildup in a conventional sense by any country since the end of the second world war,” he said.

“That is one of the key features of the complexity of the strategic landscape which all of us face within the region and which is faced around the world.”

Marles said Australia had worked with regional partners including the US and the Philippines “over a long period of time to uphold the global rules-based order”, including freedom of navigation operations to assert the UN convention on the law of the sea.

The US is not a signatory to that convention.

The Shangri-la Dialogue is an annual conference that hosts dozens of leaders, defence ministers and military chiefs from around the world, for three days of panel discussions and speeches. But much of the significant interactions occur on the sidelines, with private meetings between representatives. Past years have often seen the US and China trade barbs, but also occasionally hold significant meetings, including last year with China's defence minister, Dong Jun, and Hegseth's predecessor, Lloyd Austin.

This year, however, China sent only a small delegation led by a vice-president of the People's Liberation Army's national defence university, Rear Adm Hu Gangfeng.

On Saturday afternoon Hu told a panel, which included the head of the British armed forces, that speakers had attempted to “provoke, split and instigate confrontations in the region” with criticisms of China.

He said the maritime situation in the region was “generally stable” but faced “severe challenges”, and accused unnamed countries of increasing military presences and infringing on territorial sovereignty of others “in the name of so-called freedom of navigation” and supporting “Taiwan independence separatist forces”.

China claims much of the South China Sea, where there are overlapping claims of sovereignty among several countries. It has rejected a ruling by The Hague that its claims are unlawful.

Later on Sunday, Singapore's defence minister, Chan Chun Sing, told a panel that it was crucial China and the world properly understand each other. Referencing China's absence, Chan said Beijing should use “every opportunity” available to get its position across.

“But regardless of whether China attends the [dialogue], it is incumbent on all of us to reach out to China in different forums … to not end up in a situation where either side misinterprets, miscalculates, or misrepresents each other's position. That is dangerous.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ukraine's SBU intelligence agency said it was behind the attacks on Russian planes, saying they caused $7 billion (€6.17 billion) in damage.

""This is the estimated cost of the enemy's strategic aviation, which was hit today as a result of the SBU's special operation,"" they said in an online post.

Previously, the AP news agency cited a Ukrainian security official as saying the SBU attack destroyed more than 40 Russian planes using drones deep inside Russian territory.

The reportedly struck various planes including Tu-95 and Tu-22M strategic bombers and surveillance-focused A-50, the official said on condition of anonymity.

The attack comes on the same Day Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a delegation would travel to Istanbul for a fresh round of peace negotiations with Russia on Monday.

Sunday also saw Ukraine's military report waves of Russian drone and missile attacks overnight.

Ukraine's army said Russia's ""missile strike on the location of one of the training units"" had killed a dozen soldiers, most of whom had been in shelters during the attack.

""This is the estimated cost of the enemy's strategic aviation, which was hit today as a result of the SBU's special operation,"" they said in an online post.

A passenger train derailed following a bridge blast in Bryansk region, with at least seven dead and scores injured, Russian authorities said.

A freight train also derailed hours later following another bridge collapse in Kursk, with no casualties reported. Russian officials said both bridges were blown up, with its investigators classifying the incidents as ""acts of terrorism.""

There are unconfirmed reports this Sunday that a Ukrainian drone strike has destroyed more than 40 Russian aircraft.

Ukraine's domestic intelligence service is claiming responsbility for the attacks, saying they caused billions of dollars in damages.  Meanwhile, Moscow said drone strikes caused ""several aircraft"" to catch fire.

Also, a senior Ukrainian military commander quit on Sunday after a Russian attack overnight killed a dozen soldiers on training.

The hostilities come on the eve of a fresh push for peace negotiations in Istanbul, with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying his defense minister will be leading the delegation.

PARIS (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin is stalling at the peace table while preparing a new military offensive in Ukraine, two senior U.S. senators warned Sunday, arguing that the next two weeks could shape the future of a war that has already smashed cities, displaced millions and redrawn Europe's security map.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal spoke to The Associated Press in Paris after meeting President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and touring neighborhoods shattered by what they called the worst Russian bombardments since the full-scale invasion began.

In Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron — who they say is “100% aligned” with them on the war — the senators warned the window to prevent a renewed assault is closing. 

A sweeping U.S. sanctions bill could be the West's last chance to choke off the Kremlin's war economy, they said — adding that they hope their firsthand findings will shift momentum in Washington and help bring a skeptical President Donald Trump on board.

“What I learned on this trip was he's preparing for more war,” Graham said of Putin. Blumenthal called the sanctions proposed in legislation “bone-crushing” and said it would place Russia's economy “on a trade island.”

“It is crunch time for Putin and for the world because Russia is mounting a new offensive,” he said. 

At the heart of their push is a bipartisan sanctions bill, backed by nearly the entire U.S. Senate but still facing uncertain odds in Washington. It would impose 500% tariffs on countries that continue buying Russian oil, gas, uranium and other exports — targeting nations like China and India that account for roughly 70% of Russia's energy trade and bankroll much of its war effort.




Graham called it “the most draconian bill I've ever seen in my life in the Senate.”

 “The world has a lot of cards to play against Putin,” he said. “We're going to hit China and India for propping up his war machine.”

With peace talks yielding little and Trump's approach to Ukraine highly uncertain, Graham and Blumenthal have stepped into the breach — blunt emissaries on a lonely mission. Political opposites moving in lockstep, they're crossing Europe, and the aisle, with the moral urgency of two men trying to forestall another Russian offensive before it's too late.

Peace talks are scheduled to resume Monday in Istanbul. But Ukrainian officials say Moscow has yet to submit a serious proposal — a delay both senators described as deliberate and dangerous.

“Putin is playing President Trump,” Blumenthal said. “He's taking him for a sucker.” The senator said Putin “is, in effect, stalling and stonewalling, prolonging the conversation so that he can mount this offensive and take control of more territory on the ground.”

Graham added: “We saw credible evidence of a summer or early fall invasion, a new offensive by Putin. ... He's preparing for more war.”

Trump has yet to endorse the sanctions bill, telling reporters Friday: “I don't know. I'll have to see it.” Graham said the legislation was drafted in consultation with Trump's advisers.

Graham backed the president's diplomatic instincts but said, “By trying to engage Putin — by being friendly and enticing — it's become painfully clear he's not interested in ending this war.”

Blumenthal hoped the bipartisan support for Ukraine at least in the Senate — and the personal testimonies they plan to bring home to Congress and the Oval Office— may help shift the conversation.

“He needs to see and hear that message as well from us, from the American people,” he said of Putin.

In Kyiv, the senators said, the war's human toll was impossible to ignore. Graham pointed to what Ukrainian officials and Yale researchers estimate are nearly 20,000 children forcibly deported to Russia — calling their return a matter of justice, not diplomacy.

Blumenthal described standing at mass grave sites in Bucha, where civilians were executed with shots to the head. The destruction, he said, and the stories of those who survived, made clear the stakes of delay. “Putin is a thug. He's a murderer.”

Both said that failing to act now could pull the U.S. deeper into conflict later. If Putin isn't stopped in Ukraine, Blumenthal said, NATO treaty obligations could one day compel American troops into battle.

After a one-hour meeting with Macron in Paris, both Graham, of South Carolina, and Blumenthal, of Connecticut, said they left convinced Europe was ready to toughen its stance.

“This visit has been a breakthrough moment because President Macron has shown moral clarity in his conversations with us,” Blumenthal said. “Today, he is 100% aligned with that message that we are taking back to Washington.”

Blumenthal pointed to the rare bipartisan unity behind the sanctions bill. “There are very few causes that will take 41 Republicans and 41 Democrats and put them on record on a single piece of legislation,” he said. “The cause of Ukraine is doing it.”

Ahead, Ukrainian military leaders are set to brief Congress and a sanctions vote could follow.

“President Trump said we'll know in two weeks whether he's being strung along,” Graham said. “There will be more evidence of that from Russia on Monday.”

DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) — Scottie Scheffler felt he was hitting all the right shots and only had 13 straight pars to show for it Saturday on a tough day at the Memorial. As usual, he had a powerful finishing kick, and the world's No. 1 player wound up in a familiar spot.

Scheffler, six shots behind when he made the turn, had four birdies over the last five holes for a 4-under 68 at Muirfield Village, giving him a one-shot lead when Ben Griffin missed a 3-foot par putt on the final hole.

“I don't know what the scoring average was today, but I was definitely proud of the way I finished and it was really challenging,” Scheffler said. “Through 13 holes, I felt like I was playing really good and I was only even par. Just a hard course.”

And it became a hard task for everyone chasing him. Scheffler has won the last eight times when he had the 54-hole lead, including two weeks ago at the PGA Championship. He goes after his third win in his last four starts.

No one is throwing in the towel, not with five players within five shots of the lead when so much can happen so quickly at Muirfield Village, as Saturday showed.

And that starts with Griffin, who won his first individual PGA Tour title at Colonial last week and didn't sound the least bit bothered that Scheffler was the guy he was chasing.

“Obviously, Scottie Scheffler's the best player in the world, but No. 1 can be beat,” Griffin said. “I feel like right now ... you know, I beat him last week. Obviously, he's coming off a major win. But, yeah, I feel like he obviously can be beaten, and I've just got to keep the pedal down and make a lot of birdies because I know he's going to, as well.”




The scoring average for the 57 players who made the cut was 73.9, and three players failed to break 80. Scheffler, the only player to break par all three rounds, was at 8-under 208.

Griffin became the only player this week to reach 10-under par when he ran off three straight birdies starting at No. 6. And then he gave it all back with four straight bogeys, three of those bogeys from either the fairway or the tee box.

Scheffler was lurking, as always. He has an uncanny knack of hanging around and winding up with the low score by the end of the day. This was no exception.

“I did see that Ben got to 10 under, but it's not going to change my play in the middle of a Saturday,” Scheffler said. “This golf course is really challenging and no lead's safe around this place. I knew if I kept going and played a decent round, I would be in somewhat of a position to chase him down tomorrow.”

He holed a 10-foot birdie putt on the 14th — his first of the day — followed getting on the collar of the green at the par-5 15th for a simple birdie. He hit 7-iron into the wind to 8 feet for birdie and closed with one last birdie from just inside 15 feet that ultimately gave him the lead.

He's no longer chasing, and he's a tough customer to track down. 

Jordan Spieth also was in the chase, tied with Scheffler in second place at one point, until he failed to save par from a bunker on the 17th and drove into the creek on the 18th for a closing bogey and a 72. He was five shots behind, feeling better about his game.

There was just one problem. Spieth talked about the fun of being in the mix, of making six birdies on a tough course, of needing to keep moving in that direction. And then he paused.

“The bummer for me is Scottie's at 7 or 8 (under) and he just ... you can't count on him shooting even tomorrow,” Spieth said. “So it would take something special. But all in all, just trying to shoot a few under each day out here.”

Nick Taylor of Canada wound up three shots behind after a 74, and for that he was thankful at the end. Taylor went into the water and made double bogey on the diabolical par-3 12th, followed that with a bogey and was sliding out of contention. And then he holed out from fairway for eagle at the 14th, birdied the next hole and played that four-stretch in even par.

The best round belonged to Sepp Straka, a two-time winner on the PGA Tour this year. He posted a 66 as the leaders were just getting started and was in the group at 3-under 213 that included Spieth and Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley (68).

Patrick Cantlay and Rickie Fowler each shot 69 and joined Shane Lowry (73) at 214. It's a long way off, and it can feel even longer with Scheffler the one they are chasing.

“It's a tough golf course. I'll be trying to chase him down,” Taylor said. “He's obviously playing phenomenal, so I'll have to play some of my best golf to be in the hunt there with the last few holes to go. But it is playing so difficult that being a few under early will get me back in there.”

Sen. David McCormick, R-Pa., discusses the Russia-Ukraine war, President Donald Trump's tariff policies and the Gaza humanitarian crisis on ‘Fox News Sunday.'

Ukrainian forces destroyed dozens of Russian warplanes with a drone attack on air bases deep within Russian territory on Sunday.

Ukrainian forces destroyed 40 aircraft in the attack, which an official says took more than a year to orchestrate. Russia's defense ministry confirmed the attack on Sunday, saying it struck five airfields.

The operation saw drones transported in containers carried by trucks deep into Russian territory, he said. The drones reportedly hit 41 planes stationed at several airfields on Sunday afternoon, including A-50, Tu-95 and Tu-22M aircraft, the official said.

Moscow has previously used Tupolev Tu-95 and Tu-22 long-range bombers to launch missiles at Ukraine, while A-50s are used to coordinate targets and detect air defenses and guided missiles.

A US Navy contract to move sailors' server-stored records to a secure cloud system was recently torpedoed as part of DOGE-led cuts that show how top officials are under pressure to find large cost-savings even over the objections of their own organizations.

An IT services provider named Pantheon received a $170 million contract last year to relocate the records threatened by flooding from a Tennessee data center to cloud storage. But a top Navy official ordered it to be cut, at the suggestion of Department of Government Efficiency newcomers, over the strenuous warnings of their own personnel officials.

An internal memo reviewed by BI highlighted that the system that DOGE recommended reverting to has been plagued by delays, a bloated budget, and little to show for it all.

Continued ""delays have resulted in the Navy having to expend even more resources on legacy systems that are past end of life and do not meet the needs of the Service,"" the memo said.

The Navy's Information Officer argued the contract was duplicative of legacy software, and justified the cancelation with the idea that government workers could do the same cloud migration contractors were then performing.

But none of that is true, three sources familiar with the contract said, arguing this was hype from Navy leaders eager to offer up juicy cuts to DOGE officials to boost their own standing.

The ""decision, driven by demonstrably false and misleading claims, directly contradicts the Administration's goals of cutting waste, improving efficiency, and reforming failing IT programs,"" a second internal document says.

If the archaic data center in Tennessee floods, as Navy HR officials fear, the impact to personnel would be excruciating, sources said, hampering salary payments, recruiting efforts, and stalling promotions. Without such data on hand, it would be impossible to know who is eligible to promote and when, or even how to readily assign qualified troops during a war. The location maintains records for the over 330,000 sailors on active-duty.

""We were making good progress,"" said one Navy official familiar with the efforts, a tough chore considering that dozens of interconnected systems feed data throughout each other system for Pantheon's 500 data workers to map out. The Navy halted their work and canceled the contract earlier this month. Military.com first reported the contract's cancelation last week, and potential impacts to sailors' careers.

The modernization efforts were led by the Navy's ""N1,"" the military equivalent of a human resources section that oversees almost all Navy administrative matters, led by Vice Adm. Richard Cheeseman. Sources told BI that oversight passed only recently to the Navy's Chief Information Officer, Jane Rathburn.

Internal documents reviewed by BI noted that the CIO's office told DOGE officials that the contract was duplicative, and that the government would be better served relying on old software known colloquially as ""NP2.""

But the Pantheon contract was anything but duplicative, as the CIO claimed, and the company would have saved the Navy hundreds of millions, according to sources. What's more, the old NP2 system has its own problems.

Sources said that by the time Pantheon arrived, the legacy software's price tag had ballooned to an eye-watering $1 billion over the last five years in Tennessee, with no real progress to show. One source estimated the actual cost to be closer to $5 billion.

A source with knowledge of Pantheon's work, and who voiced support for DOGE goals of improved efficiency, noted that the NP2 program requires staffing and oversight from the Navy. He suggested that rendering NP2 obsolete — in part by through contracts like Pantheon's — could mark some government offices and jobs for elimination.

The debacle began to unfold just before Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth directed the DoD to curb IT contracts, and instead ""in-source more expertise and harness the unparalleled talent of our existing experts,"" according to a memo released this week.

Navy leaders underscored to DOGE officials that government employees could instead tackle the cloud migration efforts. But internal memos decried such a move, noting that government personnel have not performed any of the hundreds of previous migrations, and calling such an idea ""not financially responsible.""

Navy spokesperson Ferry Gene Baylon told Business Insider that the contract was canceled based on recommendations from DOGE.

""The Navy is focused on the wellbeing of the men and women who serve as we look to optimize resources essential to Navy personnel systems, pay management, and operational readiness,"" Baylon wrote in an email, adding that ""it would be premature to comment on the details of future contracts."" She did not comment on internal memos.

Sources told BI that Pantheon has already received $30 million of the $170 million total due. Now, it's unclear what will happen next to fix sailors' data, and who will be in charge.

That the data in Tennessee will continue to be at-risk rather than proceeding with Pantheon will inevitably hurt sailors, the Navy official said, adding that amid years of recruiting challenges, the service's ability to retain its force depends on paychecks.

""If you can't pay them or promote them correctly, you're not going to keep people,"" the official said. ""They're going to leave, rightly so, because they're not being treated the way they deserve to be treated.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","ChatGPT Is Making Us Weird","https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-making-us-weird-artificial-intelligence-disrupting-work-social-life-2025-6","Sun, 01 Jun 2025 09:22:00 GMT","

The other day, my family group chat lit up when I posed a question about whether it's important to say ""please"" and ""thank you"" to ChatGPT when asking it to conduct a niche search or plan out an itinerary.

My mother, ever a stickler for manners, said she makes a conscious choice to behave in this way. A choice she said she makes to ""keep myself human.""

Another loved one later admitted she's been leaning on the chatbot for guidance as she navigates a tricky moment in her marriage.

And I couldn't resist my temptation to ask ChatGPT to evaluate how attractive I am after The Washington Post reported that people were asking it for beauty advice. (It said I have ""strong, expressive features,"" then told me to stand up straighter and smile more.)

But I know it's not just my immediate circle: ChatGPT is making everyone behave a little strange.

As large language models become fixtures of our digital lives, the ways we engage with them reveal a society in flux, where machines aren't only mimicking human interaction but quietly altering the expectations and norms that govern it.

Business Insider spoke with four professionals who interact with chatbots like OpenAI's GPT models in radically different ways — a sociologist, a psychologist, a digital etiquette coach, and a sex therapist — to explore how the rise of AI is changing how we see each other, how we view ourselves, as well as how it's disrupting our manners and intimate lives.

The conversations centered on ChatGPT, since OpenAI's chatbot is quickly becoming the AI world's equivalent of what Google is to search engines, but the professionals said similar conclusions could be drawn for Meta AI, Microsoft Copilot, Anthropic's Claude, or any other large language model on the market today.

Digital etiquette consultant and author Elaine Swann said that society has needed to adapt to new social cues as each wave of technology has changed our lives.

While we've largely collectively agreed that it's all right to use shorthand in personal email correspondence and rude to take a cellphone call on speakerphone in public, we're still establishing a social code for how to interact with AI bots and agents.

Kelsey Vlamis, a senior reporter at Business Insider, said she's started seeing a chatbot-related change in her personal life. While on vacation in Italy, she said her husband found himself impatient with their tour guide, consciously having to keep himself from interrupting with questions ""since that's how he talks to ChatGPT when he is trying to learn something.""

Of course, he had to hold himself back, Vlamis added, ""since that is not, in fact, how we talk to human beings.""

Since AI has gained momentum, social media is full of posts asking whether it's appropriate for a spouse to use ChatGPT to write a love note to their partner, or for a worker to rely on an AI agent to fill out a job application on their behalf.

The jury's still out on situations like these.

""AI is certainly smarter now, which is great for us, but at the same time, we have to be very careful that it doesn't substitute basically our judgment or empathy,"" Swann said. ""We have to be careful with it, not just utilizing it as our sole source of information, but also making sure that we put a mirror up to ourselves in how we use it, and running its suggestions by people that we know and care about.""

Maintaining our baseline levels of respect — not just for each other, but the world around us — is also key, Swann said.

After OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X in late April that it costs ""tens of millions of dollars"" for the company to process niceties like ""please"" and ""thank you"" directed toward ChatGPT, she stressed that it's up to the company to make processing those statements more cost-effective, not up to users to stop being polite.

""This is the world that we create for ourselves,"" Swann said. ""And AI should also understand that this is how we speak to one another, because we're teaching it to give that back to us.""

Altman, for his part, said the massive amount of funds used on polite requests toward ChatGPT is money ""well spent.""

Laura Nelson, an associate professor of sociology at the University of British Columbia, said that because the world's most popular chatbots are created by American companies, written by US-based programmers, and trained primarily on content written in the English language, they have deeply entrenched biases that are often seen in Western cultures.

""It's really important to keep in mind that it's a particular world view that these algorithms have based their training data on,"" Nelson said.

So if you ask ChatGPT to draw you a picture of a plate of breakfast, it'll conjure typical North American foods: bacon, eggs, sausage, and toast. It describes a bottle of wine as a ""classic and thoughtful gift,"" though in many cultures, alcohol is rarely consumed, and a bottle would make a tone-deaf present.

While those examples are relatively harmless, the bots also exacerbate more insidious and potentially damaging biases.

A 2021 study published in Psychology & Marketing found that people prefer AI to be anthropomorphized as female in their devices, like it is in most pop culture representations, because it makes the technology seem more human. However, the study found that preference may be inadvertently entrenching the objectification of women. There have also been numerous reports that lonely, mostly male, users may verbally abuse or degrade their AI companions.

Business Insider previously reported that artificial intelligence is also rife with discriminatory bias due to the data it's trained on, and ChatGPT in particular showed racial bias when screening résumés for jobs, over-selecting Asian women candidates and under-selecting Black men.

While these biases may not immediately change our behavior, they can impact our thinking and the ways we operate as a society, Nelson said. And if ChatGPT or other AI applications are implemented into our decision-making, whether in our personal lives, in the workplace, or at the legal level, it'll have wide-reaching effects we haven't even considered yet.

""There's just no question that AI is going to reflect our biases — our collective biases — back to it,"" Nelson said. ""But there are a lot of people interacting with these bots, and we have no data to suggest what the global trends are, or the effects it's going to have long-term. It's a tricky thing to get a handle on.""

Concrete data about the societal shift caused by AI is hard to come by, but the companies behind the tech know something is happening. Many of them have dedicated teams to figure out what effect their technology has on users, but their publicly available findings aren't peer-reviewed like a typical scientific study would be.

OpenAI announced that a recent update to the GPT-4o model had a hiccup. It was ""noticeably more sycophantic"" than prior models, the company said in a press release. While it passed OpenAI's self-described ""vibe check"" and safety testing, they rolled it back after realizing its programming to please the user could fuel anger, urge impulsive actions, or reinforce negative emotions ""in ways that were not intended.""

The company's announcement highlighted that OpenAI is keenly aware that the various AI applications gaining momentum online — from digital romantic partners to study buddies to gift-suggesting elves — have also started to have creeping effects on human emotions and behavior.

When reached for comment, a spokesperson for OpenAI directed Business Insider to the company's recent statements on sycophancy in GPT-4o and an early study of emotional well-being.

OpenAI's research, conducted with users over the age of 18, found that emotional engagement with the chatbot is rare. However, heavy users were more likely to report an emotional connection to the bot, and those who had personal conversations with ChatGPT were more likely to report feelings of loneliness.

An Anthropic spokesperson said the company has a dedicated research team, Societal Impacts, which is analyzing Claude usage, how AI is being used across jobs, and studying what values AI models have.

Representatives for Meta and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment.

Nick Jacobson, an associate professor of psychiatry at Dartmouth's Center for Technology and Behavioral Health, conducted the first trial study delivering psychotherapy to clinical populations using generative AI. His research found that a carefully programmed chatbot can be a helpful therapeutic tool for people suffering from depression, anxiety, and eating disorders.

Engagement among patients in the study rivaled that of in-person therapy, they saw a significant reduction in the severity of their symptoms, and, when measured using the same test as human providers, the patients in the study reported they bonded with their therapeutic chatbot with a similar intensity as a human therapist.

""Folks were really developing this strong, working bond with their bot,"" Jacobson said, a factor which is key to a productive therapeutic relationship. However, most bots aren't programmed with the care and precision that Jacobson's was, so those emotional bonds could be developed with an AI that doesn't have the skills to handle their users' emotional needs in a productive way.

""Nearly every foundational model will act in ways that are profoundly unsafe to mental health, in various ways, shapes, and forms, at rates that are totally unacceptable,"" Jacobson said. ""But there are so many people that are using them for things like therapy and just plain companionship that it's becoming a real problem — I think folks should handle this with greater care than I think they are.""

Smith, a relationship and sex therapist, said she believes in-person therapy comes with unique benefits that can't be replicated by AI, but she sometimes recommends using chatbots for anxious clients to practice social interactions in a low-stakes environment, ""so if it goes badly, or you get stuck, there's no pressure.""

""But some of the drawbacks are, like anything really, if it becomes a mechanism to avoid human interaction, or if it is taking you away from going out and being in the world,"" Smith said. ""Video games are probably fine for a lot of people, and then there are some people that it takes over, and then they're missing out on their non-virtual life because they're too involved. I can see that that would be a problem with these bots, but because this is so new, we know what we don't know.""

While the results of his trial were promising, Jacobson warned that the large language model used in his study was carefully trained for years by some of the most prominent scholars in the psychiatric field, unlike most ""therapy"" bots available online.

""This has inherently got a lot more danger than a lot of folks are necessarily aware of,"" Jacobson said. ""There's probably a great deal of good that can happen from this, but there's a great deal we don't know, like for example, when folks are turning to these things for companionship, does that actually enhance their ability to practice in social settings and build human bonds, or do folks actually further withdraw and replace what would be otherwise human relationships with these parasocial relationships with these chatbots?""

Jacobson is particularly concerned about AI's impact on developmental processes among younger people who haven't grown up with old-school social norms and habits.

While testifying before the Senate Commerce Committee in early May about child safety in the AI era, Altman said he would not want his son to have a best friend bond with an AI bot, adding that children require ""a much higher level of protection"" than adults using AI tools.

""We spent years and years focusing predominantly on safety, so it's very concerning to me how many people are jumping into the AI space in new ways, and just shipping it,"" Jacobson said. ""And in my mind, that's acting quite irresponsibly. You know, a lot of folks in Silicon Valley want to move fast and break things, but in this case, they're not breaking things — they're breaking people.""

The UK backed Morocco's plan to administer the disputed territory of Western Sahara, in a historic shift mirroring moves by France and the US.

 According to data from SaylorTracker, Strategy's BTC investment is up over 50%, representing unrealized capital gains of over $20 billion. 

Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor posted the Bitcoin (BTC) chart signaling an impending BTC acquisition by the company, marking week eight of consecutive purchases by the company during this latest buying stint.

""Orange is my preferred color,"" Saylor wrote to his 4.4 million followers on X — a number that has been steadily growing over the past two years as the Strategy co-founder commands increased media attention due to the company's corporate treasury plan.

The company's most recent Bitcoin acquisition on May 26 of 4,020 BTC, valued at roughly $427 million at the time of purchase, brought Strategy's total holdings to 580,250 BTC.

According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, this makes Strategy the single largest known Bitcoin holder, with the company's BTC holdings dwarfing the amount of BTC held by the US and Chinese governments combined.

Strategy has become synonymous with Bitcoin, with many traders seeing it as a proxy bet for the digital asset. 

The company's rapid accumulation of BTC is already altering market dynamics, according to CrytoQuant analyst Ki Young Ju. Institutional buying could also trigger a supply shock, sending BTC prices higher, executives from crypto-native Sygnum Bank told Cointelegraph.

Related: Michael Saylor shoots his shot for Rogan spot: ‘Let's talk about Bitcoin'

Strategy has been characterized as an emerging financial superpower by authors like Adam Livingston. However, not all investors are convinced by Strategy's reported Bitcoin accumulation numbers.

A growing number of market participants have voiced criticisms and suspicions that Strategy does not have the Bitcoin it purports to have in its corporate treasury, citing a lack of regular proof of reserve audits.

One individual responded to Saylor's impending acquisition post by asking: ""No proof of reserves is your preferred 'trust me bro.' When mempool? Or [are you] too scared to show that you do not have Bitcoin, but instead paper Bitcoin?""

The Strategy co-founder argues that proof of reserve audits are risky for large enterprises and institutions because they open up the institutions' wallets to tracking and unwanted attention from potential threat actors.

This high degree of transparency inherent in public blockchains is often cited by industry professionals and business leaders as one of the main impediments to institutions putting their business operations onchain.

‘No force on earth can stop it' is what Michael Saylor, Strategy's founder, had to say about the digital gold during the recently concluded Bitcoin 2025 event in Las Vegas.

Keep reading to find out exactly what Saylor said and why his unwavering confidence in Bitcoin provides retailers like you and us the opportunity to accumulate the best altcoins before the next crypto rally.

During his time at the Bitcoin event, Saylor noticed a surreal ‘explosion of interest' by companies to follow Strategy's ‘buy and HODL $BTC' playbook.

Moreover, the companies that approached Saylor during the event belonged to different parts of the world, including the UK, Hong Kong, and South Korea. This is huge because it confirms that $BTC's rising popularity isn't just limited to the US.

Speaking of the US, it's worth remembering that president Trump signed an executive order earlier this year, kickstarting the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

In addition to calling Bitcoin ‘the most explosive idea of the era' and ‘an idea whose time has come,' Saylor also remarked that an unprecedented interest in buying $BTC could make it exponentially harder to accumulate the asset.

We think it will get exponentially harder to buy Bitcoin, but we will work exponentially more efficiently to buy Bitcoin – Michael Saylor

Everything signals to this being a perfect time to buy and HODL some of the top cryptos that could pump heavily during a $BTC supply squeeze. To help you get started, here are our top three recommendations.

BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is arguably the best crypto to buy now thanks to its never-before-seen approach to following Bitcoin's growth trajectory.

$BTCBULL holders who store their tokens in Best Wallet will automatically receive free (and 100% legit) $BTC as airdrops.



These airdrops will take place whenever the king cryptocurrency reaches the mighty price landmarks of $150K and $200K for the very first time.

Needless to say, the best time to buy a new meme coin is when it's in presale, which, luckily for you, $BTCBULL is.

The project has raised over $6.6M, and each token is currently available for just $0.00254. Here's how to buy it.

MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is the perfect ally to have during a crypto bull run.

This AI agent coin will identify the best cryptos to invest in on your behalf, and that, too, after carefully analyzing social trends and on-chain activity data.

$MIND interacts with crypto influencers on platforms like X, where it patiently listens to their unique opinions on various altcoins going around.



Next, it combines this data with real-time information from CoinMarketCap and DexScreener to find out underrated coins that are silently shaping up to become the next cryptos to explode.

If you want to become a $MIND owner, this might just be your last chance.

The project's presale ($12M+ raised) is coming to a close in less than 36 hours, following which you'd probably never be able to buy $MIND for a low price of $0.0037515.

TROLL's success is proof that there's still enough space for ‘dank' internet users who like to indulge in occasional – and hopefully harmless – online trolling.

This low-cap coin has surged over 120% since its launch in the latter half of April.

Over 8% of these gains have come in just the last seven days, making $TROLL one of the top trending cryptos currently.



$TROLL is currently trading at $0.02189, and a break above the $0.023 resistance level can see it reach for $0.028.

Moreover, with continued momentum, especially during a trending crypto market, can see $TROLL even claim its all-time high of around $0.040.

If this prediction holds true, investors who position themselves in $TROLL now can potentially churn out 180% in returns.

With a squeeze in Bitcoin supply likely to send the broader crypto market soaring, top presale altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) and MIND of Pepe ($MIND) are certainly great inclusions in your crypto portfolio.

However, beware that the crypto market is highly volatile; it turns and twists upon every big and small macroeconomic event.

We'd advise you to only invest after doing your own research and due diligence. None of the above is a substitute for professional financial advice.

I am a full-time teacher, currently working in Saudi Arabia and also the founder of a small educational advocacy group called (Occupational Safety & Health) OSHliteracy.org, which advocates for better safety and health education in schools.

To mark Saturday's World No Tobacco Day (May 31), I would like to raise a concern about a children's safety teaching resource still promoted on the Cyprus Ministry of Labor and Social Insurance (MLSI) website: Napo for Teachers (NFT).Once widely used, NFT is now outdated and discredited. Major organisations including Save the Children, the European Trade Union Committee on Education (ETUCE), and even the six original Napo Consortium producers have all removed references to it. Only seven organisations still promote NFT globally, including Cyprus' MLSI.NFT features six animated lessons originally created for adults but repackaged and aimed at children aged 7–11. However, the children's ‘hero' cartoon character smokes, only drinks alcohol, eats only junk food, and teaches kids how to ‘safely' climb ladders, fix electrics, use household chemicals, light fires and use knives all without adult supervision. Paid product placement is suspected.

WHO evidence shows that the tobacco, junk-food and alcohol industries do target children. NFT undermines national and international, child-focused safety and health campaigns.

Already overburdened primary school teachers rely on the MLSI to recommend safe, inclusive and age-appropriate materials. NFT fails on all fronts. The lessons also include content that is discriminatory, stereotyped and inappropriate.

I have contacted the MLSI several times and only received a standard response.

I respectfully ask, once again, that the labour ministry joins hundreds of others in removing NFT from its website and helps ensure Cyprus' primary-school children are taught safety and health in ways that are respectful, relevant and responsible.

XRP, the digital currency developed by Ripple Labs, has solidified its position as a key player in the cryptocurrency market, known for its role in facilitating fast and cost-effective cross-border payments. As of June 1, 2025, XRP is trading at $2.17, showing resilience despite the crypto market's inherent volatility. Investors and enthusiasts are keenly focused on the XRP price prediction for 2025, driven by recent developments and Ripple's growing influence in global finance. This article explores the latest insights, expert forecasts, and key factors shaping XRP's future trajectory.



A pivotal moment for XRP occurred in July 2023, when a federal court ruled that XRP is not a security when sold to retail investors, marking a significant victory for Ripple Labs. This ruling alleviated long-standing regulatory uncertainty, boosting investor confidence and paving the way for broader adoption. Since then, Ripple has continued to expand its partnerships with financial institutions, particularly through its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, which uses XRP as a bridge currency for international transactions.

Recent market activity has also drawn attention, with reports of over 500 million XRP transferred in a single day, followed by a slight price dip. Such large movements underscore XRP's liquidity but also highlight its susceptibility to short-term volatility. Additionally, technical indicators have shown mixed signals, with some suggesting upside exhaustion and others pointing to bullish momentum.



Analysts have provided a wide range of XRP price predictions for 2025, reflecting the complexity and uncertainty of the cryptocurrency market. Below is a summary of key forecasts:

Source

Predicted Range for 2025

Average Price

Notes

Changelly

Bearish short-term sentiment, but long-term bullish target of $9 by 2030.

InvestingHaven

Predicts a bullish breakout if XRP clears its all-time high of $3.40.

Finance Magnates

$3.50

Predicts $2.85 by June 2025 and $5.50 by year-end, driven by regulatory wins and ETF speculation.

CoinCodex

$2.18 (by June 30, 2025)

$2.20

Suggests a slight decline, with bearish sentiment and neutral Fear & Greed Index.

TradingView News

Up to $8

$6.25

Technical analysis predicts a potential surge based on bullish patterns.

Forbes Advisor INDIA

$6.80

Bull case ($10-$15) tied to ODL adoption; bear case ($1-$4) due to regulatory risks.

More optimistic forecasts, such as those from Forbes Advisor INDIA, suggest XRP could reach $10-$15 in a bull case, driven by widespread adoption of Ripple's ODL service and favorable regulations. Conversely, bearish scenarios warn of challenges like slow adoption or competition from stablecoins, potentially limiting XRP to $1-$4.

Looking beyond 2025, XRP's potential is tied to Ripple's ability to expand its global footprint and the broader growth of the cryptocurrency market. Analysts from Finance Magnates and The Crypto Basic project XRP could reach $10-$20 by 2030, with some extreme predictions suggesting a $27 price point, representing a 1,772% increase from current levels. For instance, The Crypto Basic estimates that a $10,000 investment in XRP today (approximately 4,545 tokens at $2.17) could be worth $58,272 to nearly half a million dollars by 2030, depending on market conditions.

These long-term projections hinge on factors such as:

Adoption: Increased use of XRP in cross-border payments, particularly in regions like Japan, Latin America, and the Middle East.

Regulatory Environment: Continued clarity and favorable regulations globally.

Market Sentiment: The overall performance of the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin's consolidation near $110,000 influencing altcoins like XRP.

Despite the optimistic outlook, several risks could impact the XRP price prediction for 2025 and beyond:

Market Volatility: Recent technical indicators suggest upside exhaustion, with potential corrections below $2.

Regulatory Hurdles: While the 2023 ruling was positive, new regulations or delays in ETF approvals could dampen growth.

Competition: Emerging solutions like stablecoins or SWIFT's blockchain-based settlement systems could challenge XRP's use case.

Investors should also note that macroeconomic conditions, such as global economic uncertainties, could influence XRP's price trajectory.

The XRP price prediction for 2025 ranges from conservative estimates around $2 to bullish forecasts exceeding $8, with long-term projections suggesting even greater potential by 2030. The 2023 regulatory victory and Ripple's expanding partnerships provide a strong foundation for growth, but the cryptocurrency market's volatility necessitates caution. Investors should stay informed about market trends, regulatory developments, and Ripple's progress while conducting thorough research before making investment decisions.

Meet James Wynn, the pseudonymous trader on Hyperliquid who became famous for his $1 billion bitcoin short bet, could now be gaining a new kind of fame: as crypto's own “Inverse Cramer.”

For those unfamiliar with the Cramer lore: he's the high-octane, loud-money mascot of CNBC's Mad Money, a former hedge fund manager turned stock picker with a hit-or-miss track record that turned into a meme. Many retail traders started doing the exact opposite of his recommendations, and the idea became so famous that an “Inverse Cramer ETF” was launched (it was later shut down, but the meme lives on).

Now, crypto traders might have found their new ""Inverse Jim Cramer"" in James Wynn's trading wallet. 

""The winning strategy lately? Do the opposite of James Wynn,"" said blockchain sleuth Lookonchain in an X post, pointing to a trader who has been making millions by doing exactly the opposite of James Wynn's trades. 

""0x2258 has been counter-trading James Wynn—shorting when James Wynn goes long, and going long when James Wynn shorts. In the past week, 0x2258 has made ~$17M, while James Wynn has lost ~$98M,"" Lookonchain said in the post. 

Seventeen million dollars in a week just by inverse-betting on one trader is not a bad payday. However, this might be a short-term trade, and one should be very cautious as things can change lightning fast in the trading world, leaving punters millions in losses if not hedged properly. 

Even James Wynn said, ""I'll run it back, I always do. And I'll enjoy doing it. I like playing the game,” after the trader got fully liquidated over the weekend.

So, maybe this Reddit gem: ""How much money would you have made if you did the exact opposite of Jim Cramer?"" would never translate to include James Wynn. But the sentiments, though, are loud and clear: in a market where perception is half the trade, even your PnL can get memed!

A bonus read: Jim Cramer Doesn't Know Bitcoin""

Aoyon Ashraf is CoinDesk's Head of Americas. He spent almost a decade at Bloomberg covering equities, commodities and tech. Prior to that, he spent several years on the sellside, financing small-cap companies. Aoyon graduated from University of Toronto with a degree in mining engineering. He holds ETH and BTC, as well as ADA, SOL, ATOM and some other altcoins that are below CoinDesk's disclosure threshold of $1,000.

Metrics details

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain cancer in adults and carries a median overall survival (OS) of 12–15 months. Effective therapy for recurrent GBM (rGBM) following frontline chemoradiation is a major unmet medical need. Here we report the dose escalation and exploration phases of a phase 1 trial investigating intracerebroventricular delivery of bivalent chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) epitope 806 and interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 (IL-13Rα2), or CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2 cells, in patients with EGFR-amplified rGBM. Primary endpoints included dose-limiting toxicity, determination of the maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose for expansion, and occurrence of adverse events. Secondary endpoints included objective radiographic response, duration of response, progression-free survival and OS. A total of 18 patients received CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2 cells. The maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 2.5 × 107 cells. Of the 18 patients, 10 (56%) experienced grade 3 neurotoxicity; none had grade 4–5 neurotoxicity. Of 13 patients, 8 (62%) with measurable disease at the time of CAR T cell infusion experienced tumor regression, with one confirmed partial response by Modified Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria (objective radiographic response, 8%; 90% confidence interval, 0–32%) and one patient with ongoing durable stable disease lasting over 16 months. Median progression-free survival was 1.9 months (90% confidence interval, 1.1–3.4 months), and median OS was not yet reached at the time of data cut-off (median follow-up time, 8.1 months). These findings indicate that intracerebroventricular delivery of bivalent CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2 is feasible and appears safe. CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2 cells are bioactive and exhibit a signal of antitumor effect in rGBM. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT05168423.

Patient slides demonstrated a range of target staining, including tissue with subjective positivity for both targets (16321-04, 16321-40, 16321-23, 16321-52), for EGFR (16321-18), and for IL13Ra2 (16321-11). Given the trial inclusion criterion of EGFR amplification, the negative staining for EGFR seen in 16321-11 is a relevant example of CAR target spatial heterogeneity. All images taken at 20x magnification. Experiments were performed in duplicate.

When I ran track in college (10 years ago, sigh), my team's physical therapists were always pushing us to utilize any and all recovery tools, no matter how ridiculous they seemed to us college kids. We'd leave practice with protein shakes in each hand, our shins bulging with ice bags that were plastic-wrapped to our legs as we waddled on our way to the dining hall. We dutifully visited the training room three times a day to take an ice bath or get an ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical muscle stimulation, or the simultaneously loved and dreaded Graston massage. Foam rolling and mini-band work were staples.

Ever since then, I've been fascinated by how trainers and coaches can use recovery methods to make people better athletes, or simply bounce back from marathon training faster. When the Nice Rocc, a new handheld palm-cooling device that claims to improve athletic performance by rapidly speeding up muscle recovery, came onto my radar, I was intrigued.

Even better, the Rocc is manufactured in Boulder, Colorado, close to where I live in Denver. I got to drop by the Nice headquarters myself to see how this thing is made.

Palm-cooling, also called palmar cooling or vasocooling, uses the glabrous, or hairless, skin that humans have on the palms of their hands and the soles of their feet. This skin contains special blood vessels called arteriovenous anastomoses that contract quickly and widely, making them a great area to target if you want to cool core temperature. That aids in muscle recovery and helps athletes go harder for longer.

When you hold a palm-cooling device, it sucks heat from the body and sends cooled blood back into the circulatory system, dropping core body temperature fast. Athletes can take advantage of these tools during rest periods in games or between reps in practice. These devices are even being used to help firefighters and military personnel fight heat stress. As a performance tool, palm cooling is research-backed. Today, professional coaches and players in the NBA, NHL, MLB, and NFL, as well as tennis, soccer, and Olympic athletes, are using these products to get an edge in games and during training.

Nice has already established itself as an iceless recovery-tool maker with the Nice1, a portable cooling and compression device, but the Rocc is its first foray into cooling for performance instead of injury recovery. It's a dense, rounded cylinder that weighs 5.3 pounds, but it has several factors that set it apart from other options on the market.

While most palm-cooling devices, like the CoolMitt, require some setup (usually in the form of adding cold packs or water to the vessel), the Rocc utilizes solid-state electronic cooling, similar to that found in mini fridges. Small squares inside the machine contain two different conductor metals that meet at a junction. Sending electricity to the junction triggers the Peltier effect, causing the outward side of the squares to feel cool, white the internal side of the squares heats up. (This heat is released through fans in the middle of the Rocc.)

All this means that you only have to make sure the Rocc is charged before you can use it. It can run for two hours on a single charge. Once you turn it on, it only takes about two minutes for it to reach the proper cooling temperature (50-60 degrees Fahrenheit). Dropping down to a lower temp causes those glabrous skin blood vessels to constrict, sending your cooled blood on its way through your body. Lights on the device let you know when it's ready to go and the charge status.

Nice recommends the Rocc for anyone looking to amp up their training or competition performance, but you're supposed to hold onto it for at least two minutes to get the best results. (A haptic timer vibrates every thirty seconds to help you keep track.)

That two-minute requirement means it's hard to work into certain workouts, like HIIT training or track intervals, that usually have shorter rest periods. I tried the Rocc during lifting sessions at home. This is one of the ways Nice recommends using it, noting that they have ample anecdotal evidence that it helps lifters hit new PRs and train harder. I definitely noticed a difference in my ability to keep pushing in later sets.

During a workout with two one-minute sets of AMRAP (as many reps as possible) pushups, I used the Rocc in between sets and was able to crank out 24 reps each time. (I do this workout regularly, and I almost always have less reps in my second set.) I also noticed a difference in between two 30-second sets of AMRAP bicep curls. In the first set I got 15. Then I used the Rocc and felt way less muscle fatigue and lactic acid buildup, and got 17.

There's something grounding about holding it. It forces you to focus on your recovery instead of just sitting and zoning out or looking at your phone between sets—and you can feel the cooling effects helping your heart rate and breathing slow down. It's cold, but not uncomfortable to hold. Especially when you're sweaty from working out, it's a welcome sensation.

When I used the device between bigger lifts, like deadlifts and squats, it helped me recover faster and feel better, but I didn't notice major changes in the weight I was able to pull or the reps I could manage. The same was true when I used it between treadmill sprints—my performance wasn't noticeably different, but I did feel more recovered after using it. I wished I didn't have to wait two minutes between sets though; I typically only rest for a minute to 90 seconds between sets, whether they're lifts or sprints.

That meant it was sometimes hard to tell if all the benefits I was experiencing were from taking longer rest breaks in general or the cooling. But that's not really a knock on the product itself; that's just how it's best used, based on our understanding of the science right now. Either way, I did feel better and stronger, especially with upper body lifts, when I used the Rocc.

I'd love to have a version of this that was more lightweight and portable, so I could take it running on hot days. (Nice is looking into something like this.) If you're a serious athlete, especially one who lifts or plays sports like basketball, football, or hockey, where you can take longer rest breaks, or you work in a field like construction, this could be a major game changer in your recovery and performance. The team at Nice even recommends using it before sleep to help your body transition into a parasympathetic state. If you have trouble sleeping, I did find the Rocc to be really relaxing.

The device will run you $975, a steep price tag compared to competitors like Narwhals, CulCans, and Ava Cooling Charge Bar. But the device looks sleek, requires no setup, has a built-in timer, and feels incredibly durable. I'm no longer in my competitive track days, so for someone like me who trains for general health and fun, it probably doesn't make sense to splurge on a Rocc for a home gym. But if you're training at a high level, you know how much difference even a slight recovery advantage in training and competitions can make. This thing is worth it.

A digital photo frame will set your photos free. Most of us have hundreds, if not thousands, of photos just sitting on our phones and computers that we rarely get to revisit in a polished way. While we all intend to print them into photo albums or hang them on the wall, you can't fit every great picture you take onto the walls of your home. That is, unless it's a digital photo frame sitting on your shelf or hanging in your living room.

Digital photo frames are possibly my favorite gadget to enter my home. Every person I have over compliments it or mentions how they want to get one too (which is why they make great gifts!). Every time a friend has bought or been gifted one, I've heard raves about how happy it makes them to see so many photos they love so easily. It's especially great for families with young kids always growing, or grandparents who want to get all the pictures of the family in one place.

These frames are all easy to set up and display every picture you could want. My personal favorite is the Aura Aspen ($229) (9/10, WIRED Recommends), Aura's newest frame (originally the brand was famed for the Mason) that looks almost like a regular analog frame with its mat framing. Aura also makes our favorite budget pick, the Aura Carver ($149). Looking for more options? Nixplay makes a great frame with a touchscreen and included remote control, while Skylight's newest frame lets you change the physical frame to match any interior design changes.

Updated May 2024: We've added the Aura Aspen as our new top pick, and the Azorpa Digital Photo Frame to Honorable Mentions. We've also reorganized this guide and added an FAQs section.

Aura

Aura

There's no beating Aura when it comes to digital frames. All of them have high-quality displays and unlimited photo storage. Plus, they're dead simple to set up, use, and share with family and friends. Everything is controlled with the app, so there's no laggy touchscreen to futz with—you can scroll through or heart photos using the touchbar on top. Aura has long lineup of similar-looking models, and my favorite is the newest one: the Aura Aspen (9/10, WIRED Recommends). The 12-inch frame is a great size to easily see photos from a distance, but not so big that it looks comical in a smaller room. It can be placed in either portrait or landscape mode, and easily rotated at any time. This is a similar experience that you'll find on most of Aura's other frames, though not their cheapest frame (more on that one below).

The best part about the Aura Aspen and other Aura frames is that they don't look like shiny computer screens, nor are they haunted by the blue tinge you'll find on cheaper digital frames. Especially thanks to the mat style you'll find on the Aspen (and other models like the larger Walden), it can easily pass for a real photo frame—until the picture changes, of course. There's really no better experience you can find in the world of digital frames.

Aura

Amazon

Target

Aura

The Aura Carver has been around for a while, and it's still a great frame. The 10-inch frame is one of the best cheap frames you can find, pairing Aura's fantastic experience (a great app! unlimited storage!) with a smaller, landscape-only option. While it does have a slimmer aspect ratio of 16:10, landscape photos still look good, and you can toggle on Photo Match in the settings to have the frame “match” to similar portrait orientation photos together to fill the screen. It'll often match by event, or match two photos of the same person together.

The Aura Carver has the Carver Mat ($179) version for a little higher price tag that matches the aesthetic of the Aura Aspen above, and the biggest option in the lineup, the Aura Walden. Unlike both of these, the Carver Mat is still landscape only, but the Mat version is really beautiful if you want an aesthetic upgrade without shelling out over $200 (and still getting the perks of a much more expensive frame).

Nixplay

Amazon

Nixplay

Nixplay is comparable to Aura, though its app focuses on building playlists of photos rather than a singular library. Nixplay has a couple different frames, but the main and best one is the 10-inch HD Touch Screen. The touch screen works well, though I did find it a little more blue than the matte screen experience of the Aura. But if you'd rather be able to reach out and swipe on the screen itself, or manually adjust the crop with your fingertips, Nixplay is a good choice. It does have a slightly slimmer screen ratio compared to Aura, with a 16:10 ratio.

Nixplay frames have additional perks, like a small clock you can add to the display, though that does make it look less like a real photo frame and more like a smart display. Nixplay also works with some smart TVs to display your photos on the TV like a photo frame, and has Nixplay events to allow friends and family to upload photos to a Nixplay album (and even have that album play on a screen, updating in real time with new photos). Nixplay does have some features you have to subscribe to either Niteplay Lite ($20 a year) or Nixplay Plus ($30 per year) for. The Plus plan gets you unlimited storage and albums and up to two-minute videos, while Lite gives you 100 GB cloud storage and up to one-minute videos.

Skylight

Skylight

If you can't decide what frame style to choose, or are worried you might change your home's color scheme, get the Skylight Frame 2. The Skylight Frame 2 uses Skylight's Snap Frames ($15 to $30) to easily change out the frame style surrounding your photo. The Snap Frames range from your classic black to fun colors like blue and green, two shades of wood, a wider frame that covers the screen bezel for a borderless design, and even two shadowbox-style frames. They're well priced, too, making it affordable to purchase several and swap them out to match your home.

As with the original Skylight, you can email photos or use the app. The Skylight will fill the screen with the photo, but you can easily adjust the arrangement by touching the screen and zooming in or out. The screen quality still isn't quite as nice as the Aura, and doesn't naturally dim based on ambient lighting. But it still looks great, and you can set up schedules in the app for the screen to sleep. The Skylight 2 only comes in one 10-inch size, and has the slimmer 16:9 aspect ratio, so most photos will need some cropping. Skylight also has a free and paid tier, with the paid Plus tier ($39 per year) giving access to features like creating albums, cloud backups, and online access to your photos. It doesn't change the storage amount, which is set to 16 GB for this frame (twice the 8 GB the original Frame has).

Loop

Amazon

Loop

Loop's touchscreen display was among the best of the options I've tried, and photo quality is solid. You can text photos to the frame instead of having to do it in-app, which is nice if your family member is sending photos to your frame and you don't want them to see your entire slideshow. A few frame options offer the ability to email photos. Vertical photos can be shown side-by-side, auto-stretched, or letter-boxed. For the latter, the background is a blurred image of the photo. I was also impressed by the quality of the rose gold metal stand, which adds an extra element of style.

But there are some quirks that I think can be improved upon. I don't like that you have to do some of the signing-up on the frame and some on the app—and if you want to remove a frame, you have to do a factory reset on the device itself, and then remove it from the app, where your photos will remain. I think it should be app only. —Medea Giordiano

Google

Best Buy

If you already have a smart display, you can set it to cycle through your photo albums when it's idle. The best one for this by far is the Google Nest Max. It uses Google Photos to pull pictures, so if you're already a Google Photos user, it's an easy transition. But even if you aren't, adding your pictures to Google Photos is much, much easier than using Amazon's uploading tool in the Echo app. Google's slideshow experience is much better, looking almost on par with a true digital photo frame.

Google's smart displays are smart enough to put vertical photos side by side, and do a good job of pairing similar events together when doing so. Horizontal photos will fill the entire frame. You can't rotate this one to be at different angles like you could other frames, but if you want a single device that can do everything—control your lights! check the doorbell! show you your family!—this is the one to get. The storage limits are for the entire Google Account, starting at 15GB, and you can upgrade on a monthly subscription. I currently pay $10 a month for 2 TB of storage, but you can go as high as 30 TB (for a much higher fee).

Aeezo 9-inch frame $90: This frame will do the job, but the app—the Frameo app, rather than a dedicated Azeeo app, which we've seen on other cheap frames as well—isn't nearly as streamlined as pricier counterparts. They're better that other cheap options we've tested, but, like Cozyla, they cross the $100 threshold. If you can spend a little more, the $150 Aura Carver is a much better buy.

Aura Mason for $199: This was the big original favorite from Aura, with a solid frame and the ability to rotate between landscape and portrait mode. It's still a great frame, but Aura did say they're sunsetting the model, but it'll remain available until it's sold out.

Aura Walden for $299: This frame is essentially the same as the Aspen and Carver Mat but larger, reaching 15 inches across. It's great for wall hanging or for large great rooms, especially since it has a nice flat back. I love mine for my living room and kitchen combo, since the frame is large enough for me to enjoy the pictures from across both rooms.

Azorpa 10-Inch Digital Photo Frame for $110: This slim frame works well and has a nice affordable price point, and it can be rotated. It also has its own dedicated app, unlike several affordable models that all use the same Frameo app. But the ratio is slimmer than smartphone photos, so I found myself needing to constantly recrop pictures or have an extra border along two of the sides. If you don't mind a border and want a really cheap frame, this one's solid.

Cozyla frames: We tried a few from this brand. Photo quality was great and there were solid features like only showing photos that match the current orientation of the frame. I found the app to be frustrating, however, and it comes pre-loaded with unnecessary art images. You can hide them from your frame, but there was no obvious way to remove them from the app entirely. If you happen to find one at a super discount, grab it, but other than that, I'd wait for an update.

Familink 10-Inch Digital Photo Frame for $120: Familink's frame works with or without an internet connection, thanks to its 4G SIM card. Someone will need to set up an account on the website or app (iOS, Android) so that family members can send photos (or even chats) to the frame. There's no slideshow feature—the most recent addition shows automatically, and you can manually scroll through. But the screen still looks good.

myFirst Frame Doodle for $130: This frame is aimed at kids, with its cover you can draw on and an app feed that family members can use for photo sharing and chatting. But it's too expensive for the quality. It was slow and not as straightforward as Aura and no matter how many times I deleted photos from the library, they kept returning.

Pexar 2K Digital Picture Frame by Lexar for $130: This frame can rotate to be either portrait or landscape mode, and has a little stand that attaches via magnet for either position. It's a fine frame, but the screen isn't as nice as those for a similar price. The Pexar is made by Lexar but uses a third-party app, Frameo, which works fine but has a weirdly Instagram-like uploader that's limited to 10 photos.

Skylight 10-inch Frame for $170: This frame was a previous honorable mention, and it's still a solid frame. We like other frames better for the price, including the new Skylight Frame 2 (especially with its Snap Frame accessories). This one only has 8GB of storage, compared to most other frames having 16GB or more.

Vieunite's Textura Digital Canvas for $754 (USD shown in cart): Is beautiful for displaying professional art. It's bright and high-def enough that you don't lose the integrity of the original painting. It's extremely expensive, though, even if it cheaper than buying an actual van Gogh.

What Should You Look For in a Digital Photo Frame?

Here's the top features you should check in a frame:

What Storage Options Are There?

All the main frames we recommend use cloud-based storage, so you'll upload your photos to a cloud server for the frame to reach and display them. Aura has unlimited storage for photos, while Nixplay charges $30 a year for unlimited photo storage (along with other features). While both use cloud storage, these are both reputable companies with defined privacy and security practices. Some of the cheaper frames you'll find won't have these processes in place.

Some frames have internal storage that can be expanded with SD cards, or even use a USB stick. These options can be more secure, especially if you're moving photos yourself from the computer to the USB or SD card and then connecting it to the frame, but it's also more work.

What About Privacy?

You might not think that photos count as sensitive information, compared to a bank account statement or your Social Security number. But it can be devastating to find photos of loved ones used for nefarious or unsavory purposes.

This is why we prefer frames from reputable companies like Aura and Nixplay over cheaper ones with less clearly defined privacy and security practices. Nixplay offers reasonable security measures, like encrypting your photos during transmission, and Aura offers the option to delete metadata, like the location where a photo was captured. However, both say they may disclose personal information if court-ordered or subpoenaed, and neither provides safety guarantees against hacking.

If you're concerned about security, you can avoid connecting to third-party services, but your most secure option is to just download several photos on a tablet and disable all internet connectivity.

Performance may not be as impressive as we expected.

We're seeing traces of AMD's more affordable Strix Halo options, with the octa-core Ryzen AI Max 385 marking its debut on Geekbench. Powering the HP ZBook Ultra G1a, Strix Halo appears poised to expand into the mainstream segment with eight and six-core variations. Performance indicators in Geekbench aren't as impressive as we expected, though we shouldn't consider them as definitive due to this being a leak, typical run-to-run variations, and laptop power settings.

CES marked the debut of AMD's flagship APU family this generation, Strix Halo, under the Ryzen AI 300 Max line, for AI/ML developers and gamers. AMD launched four different variants, ranging from 6-16 CPU cores and 16-40 GPU cores, catering to a wide range of consumers. Most of the first and second quarters have been occupied by the premier Ryzen AI Max+ 395 and 390, with mini-PCs costing up to $2,000. Meanwhile, laptops, limited to the HP Zbook Ultra G1a and Asus ROG Flow Z13, exceed the $5,000 price point, fully decked out with 128GB of LPDDR5x RAM.

The Ryzen AI Max 385 sports eight cores and sixteen threads based on the Zen 5 architecture, alongside a 32 Compute Unit equipped integrated GPU (Radeon 8050S) based on RDNA 3.5 and a 50 TOPS capable NPU. The CPU is advertised to reach 5 GHz, only 100 MHz below the flagship model. This suggests similar single-core performance, but the actual results indicate otherwise.



In Geekbench, this specific sample of Ryzen AI Max 385 dished out 2,489 points and 14,136 points in the single-core and multi-core categories, respectively. This is considerably slower than comparable samples of the Ryzen AI Max+ 395, hovering in the 2,900-3,000 points territory (single-core). There aren't any signs of thermal throttling, as the CPU averaged between 4.95 GHz and 5 GHz. Still, we shouldn't consider these early benchmarks as definitive, as several variables could be at play here.

The test bench in this case was the aforementioned HP ZBook Ultra G1a with 32GB of LPDDR5x memory. HP's website confirms the existence of such a model, listed at an eye-watering $2,599, with shipments starting tomorrow. As of writing, Asus' Flow Z13 doesn't offer a configuration below the 12-core Ryzen AI Max 390. The Framework Desktop is configurable with the Ryzen AI Max 385, with shipments expected in Q3 (July to September) 2025. Meanwhile, only HP's upcoming Z2 Mini G1a mini workstations sport the entry-level hexacore Ryzen AI Max 380.

 June 01, 2025  

For patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) following first-line treatment is independently predictive of disease recurrence and overall survival over 2 years, suggesting important prognostic value of the biomarker to improve upon standard assessment with PET-CT imaging.

“We demonstrated the prognostic value of ctDNA MRD [minimal residual disease] in first-line DLBCL cell patients [and that] ctDNA MRD provides independent evidence of residual disease beyond PET-CT,” said first author Steven Wang, MD, of Amsterdam UMC Location Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in presenting the findings at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. 

“These results support the integration of ctDNA MRD as a standard component of response evaluation in first-line DLBCL treatment,” he said.

The prognosis for long-term outcomes in DLBCL currently relies on PET-CT; however, key challenges with the approach include sometimes suboptimal sensitivity and specificity, with the potential to miss microscopic residual disease.

Liquid biopsy-based analysis of ctDNA, increasingly used in other cancers, meanwhile offers a radiation-free, non-invasive method for the assessment and monitoring of DLBCL. 

To further investigate the biomarker's prognostic benefits in DLBCL in a prospective context, Wang and colleagues evaluated data on 160 patients at more than 50 centers in the Netherlands and Belgium in the HOVON-902 trial.

Of the patients, most (79%) had stage 3 or 4 disease. All patients had been treated with curative-intent first-line therapy, with either R-CHOP or DA-EPOCH-R chemotherapy regimens.

In the assessment of ctDNA MRD, the investigators utilized the phased variant (PV) enrichment and detection sequencing (PhasED-Seq) assay, which targets unique “phased variant” alterations, or multiple mutations on the same DNA molecule.

The design boosts the assay's sensitivity compared with other tests, which can have limitations such as error profiles of single nucleotide variants (SNVs).

Among the patients, most (90%) had DLBCL, with 9% having high-grade B-cell lymphoma and 1% with primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma.

In terms of the distribution of International Prognostic Index (IPI) risk level, 22% were low-risk, 29% low-intermediate risk, 27% high-intermediate risk, and 22% at high-risk. Patients' median age was 67.5 years.

With 31 months of median follow-up in the cohort overall, the 24-month rates of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 74% and 86%, respectively.

The rates of PFS after 3 years were substantially higher for those who were MRD-negative at the end of treatment compared with those who were MRD-positive (85% vs 15%, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] 11.03; P < .0001), and 3-year rates of OS were also higher (92% vs 41%; HR, 7.38; P < .0001).

The findings show that “end-of-treatment ctDNA MRD is strongly prognostic for PFS and OS,” Wang said.

Higher cancer stage and IPI risk were associated with MRD positivity (both P < .05), and ctDNA was the most strongly prognostic of PFS (HR, 11.03), compared with end-of-treatment PET-CT results (HR, 5.31) or IPI level of risk (HR, 1.61).

Of patients who did not have a complete response based on PET results, MRD-positivity was likewise significantly prognostic for worse PFS at 3 years (PFS 4%) compared with those who were MRD-negative (PFS 64%), importantly suggesting the ability of MRD to adjudicate imaging results (HR for PFS, 6.78; P < .0001). 

“End of treatment ctDNA MRD-positivity in patients without complete response have especially poor outcomes,” Wang noted.

All of the patients who did not achieve a complete molecular response and remained MRD-positive experienced a relapse.

The prognostic accuracy of ctDNA-MRD status was observed across subgroups, including based on the source of baseline sample (tumor vs plasma), best clinical response, IPI, sex, lactate dehydrogenase, stage, or extranodal disease. 

The researchers also examined how ctDNA MRD status at the end of treatment correlated with the timing of response, and they found that 80% of patients who relapsed within a year of treatment had positive ctDNA MRD at the end of treatment, while only 22% of patients who relapsed after the first 12 months of first-line therapy had positive MRD. “This distinction is important as early relapsers might be eligible for CAR T-cell therapy, and this demonstrates that end of treatment ctDNA MRD can reliably predict early relapses; however, long late relapses might require longitudinal MRD monitoring,” Wang explained.

“These data demonstrate the robust prognostic value of ctDNA MRD by PhasED-Seq in first-line DLBCL patients,” Wang said.

Discussing the research at the meeting, Mark Roschewski, MD, of the National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, agreed that results on the timing of events were notably important.

“Now we can have a better understanding of when these events get captured [on ctDNA testing] and what we saw is that mostly these are early events,” said Roschewski, who recently co-authored a review of ctDNA as measurable residual disease in aggressive B-cell lymphoma.

Roschewski noted that the benefits of ctDNA are reflected in changes in National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines, which indicate that ctDNA, using a sufficient test — such as PhasED Seq — does appear to be suitable as an alternative to invasive tissue biopsies for positive PET scans.

However, the most important thing that the research shows — which validates other findings — is that “these tests can actually risk-stratify patients who have positive as well as negative PET scans, improving upon our current definition of remission,” Roschewski added. 

Ultimately, the findings show that “ultrasensitive ctDNA at the end of frontline therapy for large B-cell lymphoma is the most precise tool to define remission,” he said.

However, for all of its promising benefits, a key concern expressed in the Q&A portion of the session was whether ctDNA could indeed be relied upon to replace a tissue biopsy in real-world practice. 

For instance, while a positive PET scan and positive ctDNA MRD result could likely give clinicians confidence in moving ahead with second-line therapy, the approach may be less clear if a patient is PET-negative but MRD-positive.

“What I worry about is that [ctDNA] is prognostic, but not predictive, and with a relatively small dataset in this study, what are the implications in terms of overtreatment in that kind of situation?” one audience member noted.

“This is an important point,” responded Roschewski. “However, we should recognize that with the way things are done now, our PET scans have a positive predictive value of about 50%,” he said. “One of the concerns, and we see it in the data, is that these patients with a positive PET scan are getting second-line therapy when they don't even have any active disease.”

“So, this is something that is already happening,” he explained. 

Guidelines in such situations suggest either repeating the PET scan or the biopsy, hence delaying therapy. 

“So, a negative ctDNA test could help you get information sooner,” Roschewski said. 

“But would it improve patient outcomes?” the audience member pressed, getting to the issue of clinical utility.

“That's something we don't have data on yet,” Roschewski conceded. “I completely agree that this may not be ready for general clinical care without that data, but it may be fine in the context of a clinical trial for now.”

Roschewski noted that the good news is that “at least three clinical trials” are currently being planned to address the issues.

He noted that “we are able to [use this] in other hemolytic malignancies, but we have not gotten there yet [with DLBCL] and we need prospective trials to tell us what to do.” 

The encouraging news, however, is “if we see success here, there is no reason to stop at large cell lymphoma. There are other curable lymphomas that we would like to test this in, and I think this could be a domino effect in which we start thinking about this all across therapies for a bunch of different lymphomas,” Roschewski said. 

Jane N. Winter, MD, professor of medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, agreed that, with the data showing that ct-DNA is a powerful predictor of clinical outcome and can identify patients at high risk of relapse, “the big question is how we should use this information.”

For instance, “how important is it to identify refractory disease immediately at the end-of-treatment?” she said in an interview.

“I'm hopeful that ctDNA kinetics early in the course of therapy can help us identify patients for escalation of therapy,” said Winter, a past president of the American Society of Hematology. “Similarly, we might be able to use ctDNA to deescalate or abbreviate therapy.” 

Ultimately, the results underscore that “ctDNA at the end of treatment is a powerful predictor of progression/relapse,” Winter said. “I'm very interested in using ctDNA as part of an early disease assessment.”

The study received funding from Gilead Sciences and the Liquid Biopsy Center. Wang, Roschewski, and Winter reported no relevant financial relationships.

Scientists have documented the way a single gene in the bacterium that causes bubonic plague, Yersinia pestis, allowed it to survive hundreds of years by adjusting its virulence and the length of time it took to kill its victims, but these forms of plague ultimately died out.

A study by researchers at McMaster University and France's Institut Pasteur, published today in the journal Science, addresses some fundamental questions related to pandemics: how do they enter human populations, cause immense sickness, and evolve different levels of virulence to persist in populations?

The Black Death remains the single deadliest pandemic in recorded human history, killing an estimated 30 to 50 per cent of the populations of Europe, Western Asia and Africa as it moved through those regions. Appearing in the 14th century, it re-emerged in waves over more than 500 years, persisting until 1840.

The Black Death was caused by the same bacteria which caused Plague of Justinian, the first plague pandemic which had broken out in the mid-500s. The third plague pandemic began in China in 1855 and continues today. Its deadly effects are now more controlled by antibiotics but are still felt in regions like Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of Congo, where cases are regularly reported.

This is one of the first research studies to directly examine changes in an ancient pathogen, one we still see today, in an attempt to understand what drives the virulence, persistence and/or eventual extinction of pandemics.""

Hendrik Poinar, co-senior author of the study, director of the McMaster Ancient DNA Centre and holder of the Michael G. DeGroote Chair in Genetic Anthropology

Strains of the Justinian plague became extinct after 300 years of ravaging European and Middle Eastern populations. Strains of the second pandemic emerged from infected rodent populations, causing the Black Death, before breaking into two major lineages. One of these two lineages is the ancestor of all present-day strains. The other re-emerged over centuries in Europe and ultimately went extinct by the early 19th century.

Using hundreds of samples from ancient and modern plague victims, the team screened for a gene known as pla, a high copy component of Y. pestis which helps it move through the immune system undetected to the lymph nodes before spreading to the rest of the body.

An extensive genetic analysis revealed that its copy number, or total number of pla genes found in the bacterium, had decreased in later outbreaks of the disease, which in turn decreased its mortality by 20 per cent and increased the length of its infection, meaning the hosts lived longer before they died. These studies were performed in mice models of bubonic plague.

Conversely, when the pla gene was in its original, high copy number, the disease was much more virulent and killed each of its hosts and did so much quicker.

The scientists also identified a striking similarity between the trajectories of modern and ancient strains, which independently evolved similar reductions in pla in the later stages of the first and second pandemic, and so far, in three samples from the third pandemic, found in Vietnam today.

In both the Justinian and Black Death plagues, the evolutionary change occurred approximately 100 years after the first outbreaks. Scientists propose that when the gene copy number dropped and the infected rats lived longer, they could spread infection farther, ensuring the reproductive success of the pathogen. 

""The reduction of pla may reflect the changing size and density of rodent and human populations,"" explains Poinar. ""It's important to remember that plague was an epidemic of rats, which were the drivers of epidemics and pandemics. Humans were accidental victims.""

Black rats in cities likely acted as ""amplification hosts"" due to their high numbers and proximity to humans. Because black rats are highly susceptible to Y. pestis, the pathogen needed rat populations to stay high enough to supply new hosts for Y. pestis to persist and allow the pandemic cycle to continue.

However, the pla-reduced strains eventually went extinct, likely reflecting another shift in the host-pathogen relationship within their environment.

When the researchers searched for signs of depletion in a large set of samples of the third pandemic preserved in a collection at the Institut Pasteur, they found three contemporary strains with pla depletion.

""Thanks to our international collaborators who monitor local epidemics of plague worldwide, we were able to find the unique bacterial samples used for this project, akin to finding of three rare needles in a haystack,"" says Javier Pizarro-Cerdá, co-senior author of the work, director of the Yersinia Research Unit and of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Plague at the Institut Pasteur.

The institute houses one of the world's richest collections of modern Y. pestis isolates, adds Guillem Mas Fiol, co-lead author of the study and Postdoctoral researcher supervised by Pizarro-Cerdá.

""One of the most interesting aspects of our research was the possibility to explore a feature first observed in extinct plague strains, that could, for the first time, be experimentally tested in living contemporary bacterial strains,"" he says.

""Although our research sheds light on an interesting pattern in the evolutionary history of plague, the majority of strains which continue to circulate today in Africa, South America and India are the more virulent ones, the ones that were previously responsible for massive mortality,"" says Ravneet Sidhu, co-lead author of the study, and PhD candidate at the McMaster Ancient DNA Centre.

The USWNT heads back into battle.

The United States Women's National Team opened the international window with a victory over China (3-0), continuing to build chemistry and compete against quality opposition in an off year. However, due to a scheduling change, there will not be a second match against the Asian side, with Emma Hayes instead leading her squad against Jamaica. The CONCACAF program continues to grow in strength and is building off of two consecutive qualifications to the World Cup, notching group stage (2019) and round of 16 finishes (2023). St. Louis, Missouri's Energizer Park – a 22,423-seat venue with NorthBride Bermudagrass – hosts the contest, which will also include “a special pre-game celebration for recently retired legend Becky Sauerbrunn.”

This is only the sixth all-time meeting between the two nations, with the USWNT holding a 5-0-0 record and +31 (31-0) goal differential, claiming the most recent result at the 2022 CONCACAF Gold Cup (5-0). Ranked 40th internationally by FIFA, Jamaica failed to qualify for the Olympic Games and has been engaging in regular friendlies against strong competition. The Reggae Girlz fell to France (0-3), beat South Africa twice (3-0, 3-2), topped Peru in two road matches (2-0, 3-2), and dropped a pair of results to Mexico (0-3, 0-4).

Due to his “vast experience and knowledge of the squad,” Hubert Busby was appointed to the head coaching position in May of 2024, his second stint in the position after his initial tenure in 2020 and 2021. The 55-year-old goalkeeper spent several years in the professional game before entering the technical box, picking up experience with several sides, including the Toronto Lynx, the Vancouver Whitecaps, and the Seattle Sounders. He is endeavoring to “use every available window to continue [his] team's development,” providing a bridge for “young players transitioning into the senior setup.” 

A post shared by Jamaica Football Federation (@jff_football)

Busby initially named a 21-player roster for international window, a “versatile” group that is forced to contend with “injuries to a number of senior” talents. Talismanic striker Khadija “Bunny” Shaw remains “sidelined with a muscle injury” since March. Siobhan “Shiv” Wilson “officially stepped away from international football.” Tiffany Cameron and Natasha Thomas are late additions to the squad.

***

Busby utilizes the 4-4-2 and 4-3-3 formations and is looking to “make improved performances in [his] player model” with “clean sheets” and “being able to build in possession.” Jamaica manages to create chances, but finishing remains an area for improvement. The back line drops into a very deep zone when defending and is comfortable with a high-possession build-up, although Mexico was able to force several turnovers in dangerous areas. The attack tends to flow through the wings, with a reliance on long balls and crosses into the box. 

Over the past year, Busby has been rotating between a few different goalkeepers, but with Rebecca Spencer out of the camp, Liya Brooks seems the likely starter for the fixture. She has already picked up scads of youth international experience and was on the roster for the 2023 World Cup, earning praise for her ability to rack up saves when getting shelled by the opponent. The 20-year-old from New Jersey made a single 45-minute appearance during the last collegiate season for Washington State and transferred to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for the upcoming fall. Her big play ability, sure-handedness when coming out on crosses, and ability to navigate the chaos bodes well for her future as the program continues to search for a true number-one option. 

Connecticut-born Allyson Swaby “shows a preference for direct, vertical football” and “looks to get the ball forward quickly” while also displaying adeptness in aerial duels and tackling. The 28-year-old Crystal Palace centre-back is an experienced leader on the line and was the sole goal-scorer during the 1-0 victory over Panama in 2023 that delivered the program a first-ever World Cup victory. Her younger sister, Chantelle Swaby, competes with Leicester City and “likes to be a playmaker” with line-breaking distribution, also capable of deploying at fullback and holding midfielder. The former Rutgers Scarlet Knight excels during the build-up with intelligent passing and also enjoys the size at five-foot-eleven that enables her to bully attackers off of the ball. Fenerbahçe's Konya Plummer is an intelligent player who uses her frame to shield away opponents and has the mobility to cover the entire width of the field, timing her sliding challenges in order to dispossess wingers. Her runs up the field can be similarly fruitful, utilizing sharp dribbling and tight turns to cut through the crowd and charge into an advanced zone.

A “calming influence at the back,” Vyan Sampson has a strong read on the play and will also step into a midfielder role, utilizing her quickness to make an impact in both phases of the game. The 28-year-old INAC Kobe Leonessa defender has adapted quickly to Japan's WE League, “showing great energy since the start of the season” by winning headers and knocking in a few goals. Brown University's Naya Cardoza is one of the newer members of the squad, building off a strong season that saw her named Honorable Mention All-Ivy League after scoring two goals in 12 appearances. The Ontarian accelerates well and can handle herself in the wide or central zones, recording her first international finish with a header off of a corner against Peru. Amelia “Mimi” Van Zanten of Florida State is a current U.S. youth international who can line up on the wing or in the midfield and has “impressed in recent outings for Jamaica.” She avoids pressure when building out of the back, regains possession with well-timed tackles, and can also operate in and around the box with a quick interpretation of the direction of the ball.

After a strong start and suffering an injury, Atlanta Primus spent the end of the season on with Charlton Athletic from Southampton, finding the net once in ten appearances. On her best days, she is a productive presence in the final third with smart runs behind the back line, a cultured touch, and the creative instincts to find her teammates in tight areas. Sheffield United's Jade Bailey can “add extra strength and protection” while also being “comfortable on the ball” with experience at some of the Women's Super League's top clubs. The former England youth international is strong in the tackle and can also slide back in the formation and deploy as a centre-back, which frees up teammates to take greater risks in advanced areas. Kalyssa “Kiki” Van Zanten endured a difficult debut campaign with the Houston Dash, making four appearances before “suffering a foot injury” in April of 2024, but still inked a contract extension with the NWSL side. The Illinois-born midfielder and forward looks to turn upfield, dribbling and darting around opponents with aplomb before drilling shots from distance when finding space around the top of the box.

Bringing “versatility” to the wing, Deneisha Blackwood took a while to land in the correct professional environment but has found her place in Mexico, first with UNAM and now at Cruz Azul. She has “electrifying speed and dribbling” while “playing a key role in build-ups to goal-scoring opportunities,” constantly advancing in order to add another player to the counter-attack. After completing her college career at Florida State, Jody Brown signed for Benfica and completed her debut season with a league title and the Taça da Liga, hitting the back of the net several times. The Guardian praises her as “fast, confident, and difficult to catch, especially in one-on-one situations,” breaking through the lines and identifying the advantageous areas in which to convert chances. Former USC Trojan Olufolasade “Sade” Adamolekun spent the first two years of her professional career at Heart of Midlothian, contributing 13 goals in 33 appearances last season and “adjusting to the frantic nature of Scottish football.” She is “excellent in possession and a key player in the final third,” dancing around opponents with a series of moves, driving possession into deep areas, and occasionally launching a deadly shot from distance. “Exciting” teenager Reanna Blades dropped down the pyramid and joined Burnley following several years with Chelsea while also making her senior international debut for Jamaica after representing England at the youth level. Her first senior goal game in a friendly against Peru, receiving the ball at the corner of the box, beating the defender with a quick move, and then benefitting from a fortuitous rebound on the shot. 

Illinois-born Kayla McKenna is known for her “impressive physique and goal threat,” displaying “power, mobility in attack, and great instinct” as well as the flexibility to line up at winger and attacking midfielder. The 28-year-old Grasshopper Club Zürich forward is at her best when receiving service deep in the final third, whether running onto a through ball or redirecting a cross on the frame. Newcastle United's Shania Hayles had a strong season in England's second tier with 11 goals and two assists in 21 appearances, displaying “excellent anticipation” in her play. The former England youth international has a poacher's instincts and the dribbling panache to engage in extended runs, slaloming around defenders before slotting past the goalkeeper. After spending her freshman and sophomore years at the University of Tennessee, Kameron Simmonds transferred to Florida State and put up five goals and two assists as a junior, including a brace against Syracuse. Observers praise her “versatility, high football acumen, and mental toughness,” operating at full speed when breaking behind the opponent's lines in order to chase down long balls. 

Due to a scheduling change, the USWNT was forced to pivot and instead take on a new opponent instead of playing against China twice. While still a friendly, there will be different tactical adjustments as Emma Hayes tailors her gameplan to an always interesting Jamaica side. The hosts should be expected to ride a superior talent base to victory, but surprises can happen, particularly on the back end of an international window. 

The match is scheduled for Tuesday, June 3rd at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 p.m. Pacific. Viewing options include TNT, Universo, Max, Peacock, and Fubo TV (free trial).

They replace Jones, Balogun, and Zawadski.

The United States Men's National Team was forced to undergo some changes due to injury. Today, U.S. Soccer announced that defenders Walker Zimmerman and Nathan Harriel along with forward Paxten Aaronson will be added to the USMNT roster. They will replace three injured players: DeJuan Jones (lower body), Sean Zawadzki (knee) and Folarin Balogun (ankle).

Walker Zimmerman enters camp as one of the most experienced players, with 43 USMNT caps. Each of the players were on the roster that competed at the 2024 Olympics, but each has senior national team training camp experience. Paxten Aaronson joins his older brother Brendan on the team after a successful loan stint at FC Utrecht. They could become the 8th set of siblings to play in the same international match. Nathan Harriel has excelled for the Philadelphia Union and has been in national team camps, but Harriel is in search for his first cap.

The updated USMNT roster:

GOALKEEPERS (4): Chris Brady (Chicago Fire), Matt Freese (New York City FC), Zack Steffen (Colorado Rapids), Matt Turner (Crystal Palace/ENG)

DEFENDERS (9): Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew), Sergiño Dest (PSV Eindhoven), Alex Freeman (Orlando City), Nathan Harriel (Philadelphia Union, Mark McKenzie (Toulouse), Tim Ream (Charlotte FC), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace), Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati), Walker Zimmerman (Nashville SC)

MIDFIELDERS (9): Brenden Aaronson (Leeds United); Tyler Adams (Bournemouth), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps), Johnny Cardoso (Real Betis), Luca de la Torre (San Diego FC), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake), Jack McGlynn (Houston Dynamo), Quinn Sullivan (Philadelphia Union); Malik Tillman (PSV Eindhoven)

FORWARDS (5): Paxten Aaronson (FC Utrecht), Patrick Agyemang (Charlotte FC),Damion Downs (FC Köln), Brian White (Vancouver Whitecaps), Haji Wright (Coventry City)

Folarin Balogun is the latest projected United States men's national team starter to withdraw from Concacaf Gold Cup duty this summer, joining the likes of Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson and Yunus Musah. 

Monaco striker Balogun was unable to recover in time from the ankle ailment he suffered last month playing for the French Ligue 1 club and will be replaced on USMNT coach's 27-man training camp roster by Eintracht Frankfurt winger Paxten Aaronson. 

Two other players were also dropped from the squad on Sunday because of injury, U.S. Soccer announced. San Jose Earthquakes fullback DeJaun Jones has what the federation called a ""lower body injury,"" while midfielder Sean Zawadzki of the Columbus Crew has a knee problem. The changes come two days after Crew keeper Patrick Schulte (oblique) was forced out of camp in favor of Chicago Fire backstop Chris Brady. 

Philadelphia Union defender Nathan Harriel and center back Walker Zimmerman, who started three of the Americans' four games at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, were summoned to replace Jones and Zawadzki. With 43 career caps, Zimmerman becomes the third-most experienced player in camp after Tim Ream and Matt Turner. Zimmerman, who plays for Nashville SC in MLS, helped the U.S. win its most recent Gold Cup title back in 2021.

Aaronson is the younger brother of USMNT vet Brenden Aaronson. The 21-year-old had six goals and four assists in 28 games for Dutch Eredivisie side Utrecht last season while on loan from Frankfurt. He, Harriel and Zimmerman were teammates on the 2024 U.S. Olympic squad that reached the second round at last summer's Games in Paris. 

The U.S. plays the first of its two Gold Cup tuneups on Saturday against Türkiye in East Hartford, Connecticut, then travels west to face Switzerland three days later in Nashville, Tennnessee. 

Pochettino's team opens the tournament proper on June 15 against Trinidad and Tobago in San Jose, California, then closes out group play with matches against Haiti and guest nation Saudi Arabia.

DeJuan Jones, Folarin Balogun, Sean Zawadski ruled out 

Aaronson brothers could play together 

The US men's national team have made changes to their pre-Gold Cup training camp roster, adding Walker Zimmerman, Paxten Aaronson, and Nathan Harriel to the squad that is set to play friendlies against Turkiye and Switzerland in the coming international break.

All of the additions are injury replacements. They arrive in place of defender DeJuan Jones (who has what US Soccer called a lower body injury), midfielder Sean Zawadzki (knee injury) and striker Folarin Balogun (ankle injury). All of the replacements appeared for the US at the 2024 Olympics, in which the team made a run to the quarter-finals.

Zimmerman is no stranger to the full USMNT, having earned praise at the 2022 World Cup for his late-game defensive heroics against Iran in the final game of the group stage. The 32-year-old has had a solid season anchoring the Nashville SC backline. He won back-to-back Defender of the Year honors in MLS in 2020 and 2021.

Aaronson, the younger brother of camp invitee Brenden Aaronson, just finished a season on loan with FC Utrecht of the Dutch Eredivisie. The midfielder scored eight goals and added four assists this season with Utrecht, and returns to the national team program having last played in the 2024 Olympics. He made his senior international debut in 2023, which remains his last cap for the US.

Harriel received his first senior national team call-up this past January having previously played for the program at multiple youth levels. A Philadelphia Union homegrown product, the outside back figures to provide depth at the position with Jones out.

The U.S. men's national team has announced three roster changes ahead of its June camp, with DeJuan Jones (lower body), Sean Zawadzki (knee) and Folarin Balogun (ankle) all departing.

Walker Zimmerman, Paxten Aaronson and Nathan Harriel have been added to the roster in that trio's place.

Mauricio Pochettino called in a 27-man roster for the team's upcoming friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland. That group is expected to comprise the bulk of the 26-man roster for the Gold Cup, which is due to Concacaf by Wednesday.

The USMNT will face Turkey on Saturday at Pratt & Whitney Stadium in East Hartford, Conn (3:30 p.m. ET). On June 10, the USMNT will take on Switzerland at Geodis Park in Nashville (8 p.m. ET).

Pochettino's side will then kick off the Gold Cup against Trinidad and Tobago on June 15.

Losing Balogun is a blow for the USMNT, with the team's forward position now in major flux. Ricardo Pepi missed out on the current roster with injury, while Josh Sargent was omitted for sporting reasons.

Balogun suffered the ankle injury in training ahead of Monaco's penultimate game of the season, missing his team's last two games.

The 23-year-old has yet to play for Pochettino after missing a majority of the 2024-25 season with a shoulder injury. The Monaco forward last played for the USMNT in September.

None of the three replacements Pochettino called in are forwards, leaving Patrick Agyemang, Damion Downs, Brian White and Haji Wright to fight for minutes at the position.

Aaronson is listed as a forward on the roster, but excelled this season on loan at Utrecht as a box-to-box midfielder. The 21-year-old has one cap for the USMNT, which came in January 2023.

Zimmerman, 32, has been called into a full-strength USMNT roster for the first time since June 2023. The 2022 World Cup veteran has 43 caps for the USMNT.

Harriel, 24, has yet to be capped for the USMNT at the senior level. The Philadelphia Union fullback has represented the U.S. at various youth levels, including at the Olympics last summer.","{'href': 'https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com', 'title': 'Pro Soccer Wire'}","soccer"

Manchester City finally know every team they could face in the Club World Cup this summer after Club Leon were controversially replaced in the competition. The Mexican side were booted out after FIFA could not be satisfied that their ownership was removed enough from that of fellow competitor Pachuca in a decision upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

That left the tournament organisers scrambling to fill the final place, and a play-off was whipped up between Mexican side Club America and MLS side Los Angeles FC. Club America took the lead with a second-half penalty, only to see LAFC equalise in the 89th minute before finding a winner in the 115th minute.

It means that LAFC, part-owned by Will Ferrell and Mia Hamm and boasting players including Hugo Lloris, Olivier Giroud, and former City player Yaw Yeboah, have won the right to play in the Club World Cup, with their first game just over two weeks away. They are in Group D, alongside Chelsea, Flamengo, and ES Tunis.

That is the opposite side of the draw to City, with the Blues in Group G with Juventus, Wydad Casablanca and Al Ain. That means that the earliest City could meet LAFC in the competition is the semi-final stage.

City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak has signalled the club's intention to have as much transfer business done as possible before they start the tournament so that the new players can have time to gel ahead of the new season.

Al Mubarak wants Pep Guardiola and the players to put the disappointment of last season behind them and treat the summer tournament as a new beginning that they should be trying to go all the way in.

“As the defending champions coming into this new format, of course we're very excited. We're very excited to come in as champions,"" Al Mubarak said.

""The format actually, I really like it. This is a very, very serious competition. In the summer, the whole world will be watching this.

""A big number of the top teams in the world will be competing in this tournament and I can assure you, we're going to give it our best shot. We're going there to win it.

""This is the beginning of the new season, not the continuation of last season. The team will take the rest that they will take right now, then they start pre-season and then immediately straight into the Club World Cup.”

Alex Moreno

Real Madrid has issued an official statement this Sunday announcing Thibaut Courtois's medical leave. The Belgian goalkeeper is suffering from sacroiliitis, an inflammation in the sacroiliac joint, which connects the lower back to the pelvis.

The injury, although it doesn't seem serious, will keep him off the field for several days. According to club sources, Courtois will miss the international matches with Belgium against North Macedonia and Wales, corresponding to the 2026 World Cup qualifying phase. He had already returned to the national team during the March break, after Domenico Tedesco's departure and Rudi García's arrival as the new coach.

Despite this setback, the outlook is optimistic. In Valdebebas, they trust Courtois will be fully recovered to play in the Club World Cup, which will be held from June 14 to July 13, 2025. The tournament will be one of the major challenges for Xabi Alonso in his first summer in charge of Real Madrid.

Sacroiliitis is usually treated with anti-inflammatories, physical therapy, and rest. The estimated recovery time varies, but in mild cases it doesn't exceed three weeks. Everything will depend on how the goalkeeper progresses in the coming days.

While Courtois recovers, Andriy Lunin is emerging as the starting goalkeeper for the first group stage matches. The Ukrainian has just completed a good season and could use this time to prove his continuity in the team.

Amid a summer full of rumors about his future, the Club World Cup could be the perfect showcase for Lunin. In addition, Real Madrid is still monitoring the market, where names like Donnarumma or Chevalier have been mentioned as possible reinforcements for the future.

Courtois won't be present at the start of the competition, but his presence for the Club World Cup remains very likely. The coaching staff isn't alarmed, although they are cautious.

FIFA Club World Cup

LAFC is headed to the FIFA Club World Cup on the heels of a $9.55 million strike from one of its big-money players.

Denis Bouanga's 115th-minute deflected shot from roughly 20 yards was the difference, as LAFC edged Club América 2-1 in extra time of its Club World Cup play-in match Saturday night at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles.

When Mexican club León was booted from the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup due to multi-club ownership regulations, it opened up an opportunity for the MLS and Liga MX sides, and they produced a thrilling, impromptu affair with significant financial and competitive stakes.

It was América that looked like it would be headed to the first 32-team Club World Cup, with Uruguayan winger Brian Rodríguez's 64th-minute penalty kick giving the visitors the lead. It held until the 89th minute, when an Igor Jesus goal dramatically pulled LAFC level and set the stage for Bouanga's winner.

LAFC will now be placed in a group with Chelsea, Flamengo and Espérance de Tunis, and, more importantly, the team will net the $9.55 million participation bonus that clubs from this region have been bestowed by FIFA – with the potential to earn more on offer depending on performance in the Club World Cup.

LAFC will also join fellow MLS sides Inter Miami and the Seattle Sounders in the Club World Cup, while América is left to lick even more wounds, playing in Saturday night's event fresh off falling short in the Liga MX final vs. Toluca. Pachuca and Monterrey will remain as Mexico's lone Club World Cup entrants.

LAFC's opener in the competition will come June 16 in Atlanta vs. Chelsea – a match that pits LAFC striker Oliver Giroud against his former team and former Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris against one of his more familiar foes. LAFC will then head to Nashville for a showdown vs. Tunisia's Espérance on June 20 before closing group play against Brazilian power Flamengo in Orlando on June 24.

As for the other MLS participants, Inter Miami opens the competition against Egypt's Al Ahly on June 14 before facing Porto (June 19) and Palmeiras (June 23). The Sounders host Botafogo (June 15) and Atlético Madrid (June 19) before welcoming freshly minted UEFA Champions League winner PSG to Seattle on June 23.

Here's how LAFC's lucrative and potentially pivotal triumph transpired:

Saturday's match was billed as a sellout, and while it was technically a home game for LAFC, it should be of no surprise that América was well-represented in L.A.

América's players looked just at home in the early stages, dominating the ball and calmly and patiently working on the build-up. LAFC defended the most dangerous of América's early balls easily enough, though, with Kevin Álvarez's long ball over the top headed to safety in the fifth minute.

LAFC was finally able to generate some possession after the 10-minute mark, but hold-up play from forward Jeremy Ebobisse was ultimately fruitless, with América clearing the minor threat.

What had been a largely civil match between the two sides turned contentious in the 18th minute, when Sebastián Cáceres slid in studs up on the foot of Mark Delgado, who remained on the ground for quite some time to receive treatment.

After the lengthy delay, LAFC had a golden chance on the ensuing free kick, with the ball into América's box falling for Nathan Ordaz in clear shooting range. The 21-year-old shanked his left-footed attempt wide of the post, though, keeping the match at 0-0.

The first goalkeeper intervention of the night came in the 24th minute, as Lloris was called into action to stop a deflected, low shot from long range by Erick Sánchez.

LAFC threatened again in the 38th minute, with danger man Bouanga getting free down the right and having a go at goal, but a sliding challenge from Cristian Borja prevented Bouanga from directing his chance on frame.

— TUDN USA (@TUDNUSA) June 1, 2025



That was about as close as either club would get over the first 45 minutes, with the match going into halftime scoreless. Each put a single shot on target, while América out-possessed LAFC 57%-43% after its early domination of the ball.

América turned to its bench at halftime for a couple of substitutes quite familiar with the L.A. area – former LA Galaxy midfielder Jonathan dos Santos and Rodríguez, a former LAFC winger. They replaced Alan Cervantes and Víctor Dávila, respectively.

América earned a corner kick in the 59th minute, but it was what happened just prior that caught Las Aguilas' attention, as Sánchez went down just inside the LAFC box under contact from Delgado. No penalty was given initially, and América tried to buy more time for VAR to intervene and encourage the referee to take a look at the replay. It didn't take long for Wilton Sampaio to point to the spot upon the review, awarding the spot kick to the Mexican side.

— TUDN USA (@TUDNUSA) June 1, 2025



Rodríguez, who was an LAFC player from 2019-22 before being sold to América, converted his penalty by going largely down the center after a lengthy run-up to beat Lloris, breaking the deadlock and giving América the game's first goal.

With LAFC chasing the game, the hosts turned to the bench, with Steve Cherundolo tapping Giroud and Cengiz Ünder to replace Ebobisse and Delgado.

It was Rodríguez that came closest next, though, narrowly missing out on making it 2-0 by sending a right-footed chance from a left-sided angle just wide of the far post.

Giroud did have a golden opportunity moments after arriving, though, with a clear look from inside the box being blocked before it could threaten goalkeeper Luis Malagón.

Ryan Hollingshead called Malagón into action in the 80th minute, albeit on a shot from long range that didn't cause too much trouble, with the keeper going down and to his left to make the clean save.

Giroud made Malagón work for it moments later with an agile, full-extension chance from close range that forced an instinctual save and earned LAFC a corner.

LAFC's pressure continued and paid off as the final whistle beckoned, with Jesus crashing toward goal and doing what was necessary to find the equalizer off a later corner kick, following a time-wasting substitution by América.

LAFC continued pushing for a winner in regulation and nearly got it in spectacular fashion. Whether he intended it as a shot or not, Timothy Tillman curled a long-range blast toward goal that Malagón tracked and was forced to tip over the bar. It was a necessary intervention and sent the match to extra time.

With América seemingly reeling, it was Rodríguez who had the best chance early in extra time, forcing Lloris into a save with a low shot that wound up being hit right at the former Tottenham backstop.

The match went to the second half of extra time still level, but not before LAFC suffered a significant loss. Captain and center back Aaron Long was forced out with an injury, replaced by Marlon for the final 15 minutes.

Bouanga, who was a menace all night for LAFC, forced Malagón into a diving save in the 108th minute, with LAFC looking to take its first lead of the night.

On the other side, Lloris was forced into another big save in the 109th minute, with substitute winger Javairô Dilrosun being played in behind down the right and trying to power a left-footed blast inside the near post, only for the LAFC goalkeeper to make a strong stop.

Bouanga's play merited a goal on the night, and it came deep into extra time, with the forward striking from 20 yards and benefiting from a deflection off a defender to make it 2-1 to the hosts.

Chelsea will face LAFC in the Club World Cup later this month after the MLS side booked their place at the newly-expanded competition in dramatic fashion on Saturday night.

The Blues already knew that they had been placed in Group D alongside Brazilian outfit Flamengo and Tunisian team Esperance Sportive de Tunis, and they had originally been due to play Mexico's Club Leon.

However, Club Leon were ruled out earlier this year due to the tournament's multi-ownership rules, meaning another club was given the chance to qualify in their place.

It all came down to a play-off between LAFC and Club America on Saturday, and it appeared that the latter were going to book their spot at the Club World Cup when they took the lead in the 64th minute through a penalty from Brian Rodriguez.

However, LAFC hit back in the 89th minute as Igor Jesus equalised to take the game to extra time, and Denis Bouanga completed the comeback by scoring the winning goal in the 115th minute.

Reacting to the victory, LAFC's Bouanga said: 'It's simply one of the best moments of my career. I love this team, and I love this game.'

He added: 'It's a great achievement and the opportunity of a lifetime. It really opens up some doors for our club.'

LAFC head coach Steve Cherundolo, who is due to leave the club at the end of the season, was full of praise for his team as he said: 'It's kind of a culmination of three-and-a-half years of hard work and dedication that just explodes in that moment.'

LAFC will be Chelsea's first opponents at the tournament in the US, with the two sides scheduled to play each other on June 16.

Four days later, Enzo Maresca's men will take on Flamengo, before finishing their group campaign by facing Esperance Sportive de Tunis on June 25.

The top two teams from the group will qualify for the knockout stages of the competition.

Chelsea will be looking to add more silverware to their collection after winning the Conference League earlier this week following a 4-1 victory over Real Betis in the final.

They won the Club World Cup back in 2022 after triumphing in the Champions League the previous year.

However, this year's tournament promises to be a tougher challenge due to 32 teams now competing, including Real Madrid, Manchester City and Champions League winners PSG.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"

MLS side LAFC is heading to the FIFA Club World Cup this summer, booking their spot with a 2–1 win in extra time over Liga MX's Club América on Saturday night at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles. 

Denis Bouanga slotted his winning goal past América's Luis Ángel Malagón in the 115th minute of extra time, making LAFC the last team to qualify for the 32-team tournament, after Liga MX's Club Léon were eliminated due to FIFA's club ownership rules.

Léon are owned by Grupo Pachuca, an ownership group which also controls Pachuca, another team in the new-look Club World Cup. LAFC, who lost to Léon in the 2023 Concacaf Champions League final, were put into the match against América to decide which team would take the final spot. 

It almost wasn't to be for the Black and Gold, though. 

América opened the scoring in the 64th minute, when Brian Rodríguez smashed a penalty past LAFC goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, after Mark Delgado committed a foul at the top of the box in a collision with Erick Sánchez. 

While the match had been a relatively tight affair to that point, it opened up in the minutes after, sending the largely split crowd into bedlam at several chances through extra time. 

LAFC picked up their attack after conceding, with Olivier Giroud nearly scoring on two chances after coming on in the 74th minute. Yet, it was Igor Jesus who brought the 2022 MLS Cup Champions level in the 89th minute, forcing extra time where Bouanga clinched their spot for the summer's competition. 

With the win, LAFC became the third MLS team in the competition alongside Inter Miami and Seattle Sounders FC, and will join Group D alongside Brazil's CR Flamengo, Tunisia's Espérance and the Premier League's Chelsea, with games in Atlanta, Nashville and Orlando.

The victory also secured them a massive financial boon, earning $9.55 million in prize money for qualifying and will have a chance to draw from the tournament's nearly $1 billion prize pool, should they advance further.

LAFC will open the tournament on June 16 against Chelsea in Atlanta, looking for an upset against the recently crowned UEFA Conference League Champions.

FIFA Club World Cup

LAFC is headed to the FIFA Club World Cup on the heels of a $9.55 million strike from one of its big-money players.

Denis Bouanga's 115th-minute deflected shot from roughly 20 yards was the difference, as LAFC edged Club América 2-1 in extra time of its Club World Cup play-in match Saturday night at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles.

When Mexican club León was booted from the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup due to multi-club ownership regulations, it opened up an opportunity for the MLS and Liga MX sides, and they produced a thrilling, impromptu affair with significant financial and competitive stakes.

It was América that looked like it would be headed to the first 32-team Club World Cup, with Uruguayan winger Brian Rodríguez's 64th-minute penalty kick giving the visitors the lead. It held until the 89th minute, when an Igor Jesus goal dramatically pulled LAFC level and set the stage for Bouanga's winner.

LAFC will now be placed in a group with Chelsea, Flamengo and Espérance de Tunis, and, more importantly, the team will net the $9.55 million participation bonus that clubs from this region have been bestowed by FIFA – with the potential to earn more on offer depending on performance in the Club World Cup.

LAFC will also join fellow MLS sides Inter Miami and the Seattle Sounders in the Club World Cup, while América is left to lick even more wounds, playing in Saturday night's event fresh off falling short in the Liga MX final vs. Toluca. Pachuca and Monterrey will remain as Mexico's lone Club World Cup entrants.

LAFC's opener in the competition will come June 16 in Atlanta vs. Chelsea – a match that pits LAFC striker Oliver Giroud against his former team and former Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris against one of his more familiar foes. LAFC will then head to Nashville for a showdown vs. Tunisia's Espérance on June 20 before closing group play against Brazilian power Flamengo in Orlando on June 24.

As for the other MLS participants, Inter Miami opens the competition against Egypt's Al Ahly on June 14 before facing Porto (June 19) and Palmeiras (June 23). The Sounders host Botafogo (June 15) and Atlético Madrid (June 19) before welcoming freshly minted UEFA Champions League winner PSG to Seattle on June 23.

Here's how LAFC's lucrative and potentially pivotal triumph transpired:

Saturday's match was billed as a sellout, and while it was technically a home game for LAFC, it should be of no surprise that América was well-represented in L.A.

América's players looked just at home in the early stages, dominating the ball and calmly and patiently working on the build-up. LAFC defended the most dangerous of América's early balls easily enough, though, with Kevin Álvarez's long ball over the top headed to safety in the fifth minute.

LAFC was finally able to generate some possession after the 10-minute mark, but hold-up play from forward Jeremy Ebobisse was ultimately fruitless, with América clearing the minor threat.

What had been a largely civil match between the two sides turned contentious in the 18th minute, when Sebastián Cáceres slid in studs up on the foot of Mark Delgado, who remained on the ground for quite some time to receive treatment.

After the lengthy delay, LAFC had a golden chance on the ensuing free kick, with the ball into América's box falling for Nathan Ordaz in clear shooting range. The 21-year-old shanked his left-footed attempt wide of the post, though, keeping the match at 0-0.

— TUDN USA (@TUDNUSA) June 1, 2025



The first goalkeeper intervention of the night came in the 24th minute, as Lloris was called into action to stop a deflected, low shot from long range by Erick Sánchez.

LAFC threatened again in the 38th minute, with danger man Bouanga getting free down the right and having a go at goal, but a sliding challenge from Cristian Borja prevented Bouanga from directing his chance on frame.

— TUDN USA (@TUDNUSA) June 1, 2025



That was about as close as either club would get over the first 45 minutes, with the match going into halftime scoreless. Each put a single shot on target, while América out-possessed LAFC 57%-43% after its early domination of the ball.

América turned to its bench at halftime for a couple of substitutes quite familiar with the L.A. area – former LA Galaxy midfielder Jonathan dos Santos and Rodríguez, a former LAFC winger. They replaced Alan Cervantes and Víctor Dávila, respectively.

América earned a corner kick in the 59th minute, but it was what happened just prior that caught Las Aguilas' attention, as Sánchez went down just inside the LAFC box under contact from Delgado. No penalty was given initially, and América tried to buy more time for VAR to intervene and encourage the referee to take a look at the replay. It didn't take long for Wilton Sampaio to point to the spot upon the review, awarding the spot kick to the Mexican side.

— TUDN USA (@TUDNUSA) June 1, 2025



Rodríguez, who was an LAFC player from 2019-22 before being sold to América, converted his penalty by going largely down the center after a lengthy run-up to beat Lloris, breaking the deadlock and giving América the game's first goal.

With LAFC chasing the game, the hosts turned to the bench, with Steve Cherundolo tapping Giroud and Cengiz Ünder to replace Ebobisse and Delgado.

It was Rodríguez that came closest next, though, narrowly missing out on making it 2-0 by sending a right-footed chance from a left-sided angle just wide of the far post.

Giroud did have a golden opportunity moments after arriving, though, with a clear look from inside the box being blocked before it could threaten goalkeeper Luis Malagón.

Ryan Hollingshead called Malagón into action in the 80th minute, albeit on a shot from long range that didn't cause too much trouble, with the keeper going down and to his left to make the clean save.

Giroud made Malagón work for it moments later with an agile, full-extension chance from close range that forced an instinctual save and earned LAFC a corner.

LAFC's pressure continued and paid off as the final whistle beckoned, with Jesus crashing toward goal and doing what was necessary to find the equalizer off a later corner kick, following a time-wasting substitution by América.

LAFC continued pushing for a winner in regulation and nearly got it in spectacular fashion. Whether he intended it as a shot or not, Timothy Tillman curled a long-range blast toward goal that Malagón tracked and was forced to tip over the bar. It was a necessary intervention and sent the match to extra time.

With América seemingly reeling, it was Rodríguez who had the best chance early in extra time, forcing Lloris into a save with a low shot that wound up being hit right at the former Tottenham backstop.

The match went to the second half of extra time still level, but not before LAFC suffered a significant loss. Captain and center back Aaron Long was forced out with an injury, replaced by Marlon for the final 15 minutes.

Bouanga, who was a menace all night for LAFC, forced Malagón into a diving save in the 108th minute, with LAFC looking to take its first lead of the night.

On the other side, Lloris was forced into another big save in the 109th minute, with substitute winger Javairô Dilrosun being played in behind down the right and trying to power a left-footed blast inside the near post, only for the LAFC goalkeeper to make a strong stop.

Bouanga's play merited a goal on the night, and it came deep into extra time, with the forward striking from 20 yards and benefiting from a deflection off a defender to make it 2-1 to the hosts.

LAFC has secured the last ticket to the big dance, rallying to defeat Club América, 2-1, in a FIFA Club World Cup playoff that required extra time at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles.

Former LAFC attacker Brian Rodríguez had given América a 64th-minute lead from a VAR-assisted penalty kick, and the Liga MX powers seemed to have done just enough to claim a win that will be worth nearly $10 million at a minimum.

However, Igor Jesus' 89th-minute header leveled the scored, saving LAFC, and in extra time Denis Bouanga — the club's most important player in recent years — added to his legend by firing home the winner in the 115th minute.

The win sends LAFC into the Club World Cup, where they will join English giant Chelsea, Tunisian club Esperance Sportive de Tunis, and Flamengo, arguably the most well-supported club in Brazil.

LAFC and Club América were in a playoff due to a convoluted series of events that could only happen when you get Concacaf and FIFA together to sort out a new tournament format.

Initially, the last four winners of the Concacaf Champions Cup — Monterrey, the Seattle Sounders, Club León, and Pachuca — were set to take places in the Club World Cup. However, Club León and Pachuca share owners, something FIFA said cannot be permitted at the Club World Cup. FIFA eventually decided that León was disqualified, and announced a playoff between LAFC (the team León defeated in the 2023 Concacaf Champions Cup) and Club América (the top-ranked Concacaf team in FIFA's rankings for Club World Cup purposes).

León, Pachuca, and Costa Rican club Alajuelense all appealed, with Alajuelense arguing that as Central America's top-ranked team, they should be admitted, but all were rejected. That leaves the final spot in Group D up for grabs, with Saturday's winner claiming the place.

There are 32 teams in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup that have been separated into eight groups of four for the round-robin group stage in June. Here's how the field breaks down

Los Angeles FC secured the final spot in the FIFA Club World Cup with a 2-1 victory over Club América in a play-in match

LOS ANGELES -- Denis Bouanga scored late in extra time and Los Angeles FC dramatically secured the final spot in the FIFA Club World Cup with a 2-1 victory over Club América in a play-in match on Saturday night.

Igor Jesus tied it for LAFC in the 89th minute, slipping through traffic and converting a header for his first goal with his new club.

After 24 tense minutes of extra time, Bouanga jumped into the play and fired home a deflected shot from the top of the penalty area in the 115th minute, setting off a wild celebration at BMO Stadium and sending LAFC to its first Club World Cup.

LAFC will join English club Chelsea, Brazil's Flamengo and Tunisia's ES Tunis when group play begins in two weeks across the U.S. South.

LAFC's victory is extraordinarily lucrative for the Major League Soccer power, guaranteeing at least $9.55 million in prize money for making the tournament field. The club also has a chance at nearly $100 million more in prize money from FIFA's nearly $1 billion pool.

Brian Rodríguez put América ahead midway through the second half by converting a penalty kick against his former team, but Las Águilas fell short in front of thousands of supporters.

One spot in the 32-team Club World Cup was open because FIFA disqualified León under its rules against participation by multiple clubs owned by the same entity. León and Pachuca are owned by the same group, and León lost its appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport four weeks ago after attempting to change its ownership structure.

With a stadium full of raucous fans supporting both teams, LAFC and América were cautious in the first half, putting just one shot on target apiece.

Rodríguez beat Hugo Lloris from the spot in the 64th minute, capitalizing on a penalty awarded following a video review of Mark Delgado's risky, spikes-up challenge on Erick Sánchez. Rodríguez, who came on as a halftime substitute after recently recovering from injury, spent parts of four seasons with LAFC from 2019-22 before the Uruguayan winger moved to América for a hefty transfer fee.

LAFC got moving offensively when Olivier Giroud came on as a second-half substitute. The French star nearly tipped home a pass in the box in the 81st minute, but Luis Malagón thwarted him. LAFC cranked up its late pressure behind Bouanga and Giroud.

Jesus, the 22-year-old Brazilian midfielder, finally beat Malagón with a header in the box.

Lloris stopped a point-blank chance for Javairô Dilrosun in the second half of extra time shortly before Bouanga's winner.

Tickets for the match were distributed equally between the clubs' supporters — and América has a large fan base in Los Angeles, where Mexican teams and players are greeted with massive support whenever they visit. América fans mobbed the south stands at BMO Stadium 90 minutes before kickoff, while LAFC's famed North End crowd was packed.

Both sections set off fireworks and smoke bombs after kickoff, underlining the remarkable atmosphere and giving a taste of what's to come in June and July.

The largest Club World Cup to date will be held across the U.S. as a precursor to the FIFA World Cup's return to North America in 2026. Inter Miami and the Seattle Sounders already qualified from Major League Soccer, while Pachuca and Monterrey already qualified from Liga MX.

Sunday 1 June 2025 19:54, UK

Carlos Alcaraz defeated Ben Shelton to advance to the quarter-finals at the French Open.

The Spanish star beat Shelton in four sets, winning 7-6 6-3 4-6 6-4 at Roland Garros.

That victory put the defending champion through to a quarter-final against another American, Tommy Paul.

Shelton has not yet won a Grand Slam tournament but the 22-year-old still tested Alcaraz.

They matched each other game for game in the first set. Alcaraz did get himself to a break point in the seventh game but Shelton warded off the threat.

The two went into a tie-break and it was the American who picked up the first mini-break to go 2-0 up. Shelton then lined up one over-arm smash after another over-arm smash to finally beat Alcaraz.

He had pushed forward to 4-1 before Alcaraz started to close the gap. With one point separating them, it was then Alcaraz who miscued the ball. However he still managed to retrieve a mini-break when Shelton brilliantly picked up a drop shot only for Alcaraz to gently guide the ball onto the line on the far side of the court as the American toppled over.

A huge forehand from the American took him to set point at 6-4 in the tie-break. But then he couldn't return an Alcaraz serve and netted within a rally.

The Spaniard squeezed him out 10-8 and then, in another decisive moment, managed to hold serve despite huge pressure from Shelton in the first game of the second set. Shelton secured six break points in that game, but Alcaraz conspired to defend them all.

It was Alcaraz who went on to break Shelton's serve and win the second set 6-3.

Shelton made the first move in the third set. He got the break when in an extended rally a shot from Alcaraz clipped the top of the net and bounced out of the court.

The Spaniard hit back immediately. Alcaraz picked up two break points and, with Shelton striking the ball a fraction too far in a rally, Alcaraz pulled back that advantage.

Shelton cannoned an ace past Alcaraz to stave off a break point in ninth game. A wayward forehand squandered the advantage point. He got through eventually, holding serve under pressure.

He then snatched the third set away from Alcaraz with a timely break. On the first of two set points, against the Spaniard's serve, Shelton blasted a forehand into the net. But on the second, another huge forehand from Shelton saw Alcaraz over-hit to give up a break and the set.

Alcaraz though broke Shelton in the third game of the fourth set and held his nerve as the American sought to fire back immediately. From 0-30 down Alcaraz found three quality points and then Shelton handed him the winner.

The Spaniard got a match point against Shelton's serve, wearing the American down in a rally. Shelton clawed the game back to deuce though and blazed a mammoth ace through. They traded drop shots though before Alcaraz lobbed him to win a brilliant point. Shelton however took the advantage point once again and won through to force his opponent to serve for the match.

He did so. A fantastic rally eventually brought Shelton up the court and he put too much on his backhand. That saw Alcaraz take a 30-0 lead in the game. Netting the ball in a rally and a double fault brought Shelton into it but Alcaraz claimed a match point, which he put away with a sweeping forehand.

Carlos Alcaraz admitted Ben Shelton was driving him “mad” before dispatching the big-serving American to continue his march towards back-to-back French Open titles.

The Spaniard dropped the third set but still collected his 100th Tour level clay-court win, 7-6 (8) 6-3 4-6 6-4.

“Honestly, today I fought against myself in the mind. I just tried to calm myself – in some moments I was mad,” he said.

“I was angry with myself, talking not good things. I'm happy that I didn't let that thought play against me.

“I tried to calm myself and tried to keep going. That's what I tried.

“Every time we face each other we bring the level to the top. We entertained the people. He is a really powerful player. He can make any shots.

“I think we played really great tennis. Drops, coming to the net, big shots, and we stayed there in the whole match. For me, it is great having Ben around, a great energy for tennis and for the people. I love watching him play.”

Alcaraz will face another American, 12th seed Tommy Paul, in the quarter-final.

Paul ended the hopes of Australia in the men's draw with a 6-3 6-3 6-3 win against Alexei Popyrin.

...

PARIS (AP) — Carlos Alcaraz called himself for breaking the rules at the French Open and conceded a point to Ben Shelton on Sunday during the defending champion's 7-6 (8), 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 victory in the fourth round.

Early in the second set, Shelton whipped a passing shot well out of Alcaraz's reach up at the net. So Alcaraz flung his racket — and, as his equipment flipped through the air, its strings somehow not only made contact with the ball but sent it back over the net and onto the other side of the court.

Initially, the second-seeded Alcaraz was awarded the point. But he immediately went over to the chair umpire to admit that he wasn't holding his racket when it touched the ball. That's not allowed, so the point went to Shelton, an American seeded 13th.

When the official informed the Court Philippe-Chatrier crowd what had happened, Alcaraz was given a round of applause.

This all happened at what could have been a critical moment, because instead of leading 40-30 on his serve, Alcaraz was now down 30-40, giving Shelton his first break point of the match. But Alcaraz saved that one — and five others in that 20-point game — along the way to taking a two-set lead in an entertaining matchup between a pair of 22-year-olds who hit the ball hard.

The 13th-seeded Shelton, twice a semifinalist at majors, delivered serves at up to 143 mph (230 kph) and forehands at up to 116 mph (187 kph). Alcaraz, already a four-time Grand Slam champion, showed off various parts of his repertoire.

It was tighter than the score might indicate: Shelton held three opportunities to own the opening set, leading in the tiebreaker at 6-4, 6-5 and 7-6. Take any of the subsequent points, and Shelton would own that set.

But Alcaraz — who meets No. 12 Tommy Paul of the U.S. in the quarterfinals Tuesday — saved the first with a service winner. Shelton netted a backhand on the next. And the last ended with Shelton smacking a backhand right at the body of Alcaraz, who was up at the net and contorted himself in order to chop a drop volley winner.

Alcaraz then converted his second set point, closing a 15-stroke exchange with a down-the-line forehand that drew a mistake from Shelton.

The third set went to Shelton when Alcaraz put a forehand into the net, and the big-swinging American punched the air, then his chest, and screamed: “Let's go, baby! Come on!”

The fourth swung Alcaraz's way when he used a drop shot winner to set up a break point that he claimed for a 2-1 edge and, after a total of 3 hours, 19 minutes, he was able to finish off an 11th consecutive win at Roland-Garros.

The McLarens of Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris locked out the Barcelona front row in Qualifying. The next question is can anyone beat them to the first corner when the lights go out for the Spanish Grand Prix.

Best placed to challenge the orange cars in the long run to Turn 1 are Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Mercedes' George Russell - who set identical Q3 lap times – and don't dismiss the row-three starters of Lewis Hamilton in the Ferrari and the second Mercedes of Kimi Antonelli.

Completing the top 10 on the grid are Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, Alpine's Pierre Gasly, rookie Isack Hadjar – after another superb Saturday in the Racing Bulls – and the Aston Martin of local hero Fernando Alonso, whose team mate Lance Stroll has withdrawn with a wrist injury.

STRATEGY GUIDE: What are the tactical options for the Spanish Grand Prix?

The other Spaniard in the field, Carlos Sainz, will line up 17th for Williams, ahead of only Franco Colapinto, whose Alpine hit technical problems in Qualifying, and Yuki Tsunoda who finished a very frustrated last on Saturday for Red Bull.

Tsunoda will commence the Grand Prix from the pit lane, after his team opted to make set-up changes on his car ahead of the race.

Over four seasons of following the globe-trotting Roy family, “Succession” creator Jesse Armstrong and production designer Stephen Carter had mastered the art of finding locations that showcased the characters' extreme wealth, but also how uncomfortable and cold these spaces can be for their characters. When Armstrong was on this week's episode of the Filmmaker Toolkit Podcast, to discuss his new HBO movie “Mountainhead,” about four tech moguls' weekend getaway, he talked about how impersonal these locations can be.

“They're gilded cages, or really more beige prison cells,” said Armstrong. “That wealth has this kind of international hotel feel to it. I've scouted a lot of these locations and there is a similarity. I guess it's often people who spend time a lot of different places around the globe and maybe they want that uniformity, it doesn't have much aesthetic zing to it.”

In his directorial debut “Mountainhead,” the importance of finding the right location was right in the title. As Armstrong talked about on the podcast, the accelerated production process, going from pitch to air in less than six months, was motivated by his desire to tap into the audience's in-the-moment anxiety of the dangers of emerging AI and real-life tech moguls like Elon Musk gaining unprecedented political, cultural, and economic power. He would therefore need a single location to serve as the perfect lair from which his fictional tech bros would plot the future of humanity as the world burned down around them.

 










“There were a number of scary moments on this production where, given the compressed time table that we were trying to achieve, it could have fallen apart over casting, over me flunking and not coming up with a script on time, but not finding the house was one of the major ones,” said Armstrong. “It was scary when we hadn't found it. And in fact, I was so behind on writing the script, I had to, at a certain point, just leave the team to do it.”

Executive producer Jill Footlick, cinematographer Marcel Zyskind, and Carter would continue the search without Armstrong, who acknowledged his list of requirements was significant, including the house needing to be potentially dangerous — to say more would be a spoiler. Beyond the extreme wealth and impersonal coolness, the location simultaneously needed to be visually varied and dynamic.

“I knew that it was almost all going [take place] in this house, and as a director, I was eager that we couldn't, as they say, ‘shoot it out,' and get bored of the location too quickly,” said Armstrong.

The search took the “Mountainhead” team to British Columbia, Wyoming, and Colorado, before finding its 21,000-square foot, seven-bedroom estate, in Park City, Utah.

“I think I knew that we had the right place when Marcel, who's Danish, called me up and said he'd come away from this house with just this incredibly strong feeling of depression,” said Armstrong. “It sort of had shocked him to his core, the kind of the scale of it— it's drilled down into this mountainside over seven floors with a basketball court at the bottom, but has these tremendous vistas out over Utah. It's really a character in the movie, I guess.”

 










After spending the last decade visiting and scouting the international hotel-like blandness of the globe-trotting uber-wealthy, we asked Armstrong if he ever considered what he'd buy if he became mogul-rich. Not surprisingly, he went in the opposite direction of the modern “Mountainhead” house.

“When we were in Tuscany [for Season 3 of ‘Succession'], I mean, it's pretty hard to maybe to screw up a Renaissance villa,” said Armstrong.

“Mountainhead” is now streaming on HBO Max.

	Peter Wade



	A jury convicted a former Republican political strategist on two counts of stalking Friday after prosecutors alleged that Daniel Duffey sent harassing text messages and letters to the victim and his family, the Montana Free Press reported. According to witnesses, Duffey also created a fake Grindr account under the victim's name and asked app users to attend the victim's wedding to have sex with him.


	Duffey was political director for Greg Gianforte's 2020 gubernatorial campaign until he was fired because he allegedly repeatedly hit a parked car with his car door, causing $1600 in damages. He worked on other Republican campaigns as well as for the GOP-led Montana Legislature in the 2019, 2021, and 2023 sessions. 


	Duffey met the victim at a University of Montana football game in 2023 where the two men talked about rugby. After the game, they began a friendly texting exchange. But when the victim didn't reply to Duffey's invitation to grab a beer, Duffey appeared to get angry.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“I'm not sure what happened man. I thought we clicked,” Duffey said in a text sent in Nov. 2023. “I thought it would be cool to be friends.”


	Duffey later texted the victim, “Seriously man, that sucks. I don't know how you go from [being] all over me and sexually assaulting me to pretending like I don't even exist. If you're embarrassed about what happened you shouldn't be.”


	The victim responded, “Been struggling. Not trying to offend you. Also, I do not know what your [sic] talking about with being all over you.”

	











	On the witness stand last week, the victim said Duffey's version of events was “fictitious.” Law enforcement and other witnesses denied knowing about any prior sexual assault allegations against the victim.


	In another text to the victim, Duffey wrote, “[H]onestly the more you treat me like shit and make me think that this is all in my head and I'm going crazy, the crazier I am going to act. You've made very clear you don't give a f— about me and what happens to me, and now I'm going to return the favor. My only hope is that I put you in as much pain and ruin your life the way you've ruined mine.”

	Things continued to escalate from there. According to prosecutors, Duffey sent a letter to the victim's mother-in-law where he wrote about working as a Republican political operative, serving in the military in Afghanistan, and volunteering in Ukraine in 2022. Enclosed in the letter were photos of Duffey with well-known Republican leaders, including Vice President Mike Pence, Rudy Giuliani, and Sens. Ted Cruz and Mitch McConnell.


	In Feb. 2024, around the time of the victim's wedding, Duffey drove near the wedding location to post flyers showing the victim's name and photo and accusing him of sexual assault. According to witness testimony, as reported by the Montana Free Press, Duffey made a fake account on Grindr, an LGBTQ dating app, using the victim's name. He then requested app users attend the victim's wedding to have sex with the victim.


	Duffey even texted the couple a threatening message on their wedding day: “[I]t should be pretty obvious by now, that this isn't going to end tonight when you get married, this goes on for years until I see [the victim] behind bars or paying me so much money you'll never be able to do anything nice again.” 


	Prior to the wedding, on Jan. 21, 2024, the victim reported Duffey's unhinged behavior to local police. Duffey was later arrested near one of the wedding events, and according to prosecutors, law enforcement found a semiautomatic handgun in his car along with poster board and similar flyers. Duffey pleaded not guilty last year and did not testify in his defense. The jury took less than an hour to reach a unanimous guilty verdict after the four-day trial.

	“The evidence in this case convinces the court that, with very little if any provocation, he engaged on a monthslong campaign of assailing the character, the safety of a person he knew for a very short time before engaging in this campaign,” District Court Judge Dan Wilson said in court on Friday. “There's no rhyme or reason for the conduct. It's so far outside of the realm of sociable or acceptable behavior that it is the court's genuine concern that, now that the conviction has occurred, Mr. Duffey has a tremendous incentive and, in light of the evidence submitted in this case, very little imposition of self-restraint to prevent him from engaging in similar conduct in the immediate future.”

	











	Because of Duffey's apparent lack of self-restraint, the judge said the former Republican strategist will be incarcerated ahead of his sentencing scheduled for July 10.

Being human can feel pretty alienating sometimes. Humans are weird creatures and the rules of our societies can feel baffling, but there's a great TV series that approaches that theme through the eyes of an actual extraterrestrial. The SyFy original series ""Resident Alien,"" which stars Alan Tudyk as an alien with a truly unpronounceable name that goes by the assumed name and identity of ""Harry Vanderspeigle,"" shows us just how bizarre humans are by depicting life for an alien who's now stuck among us and doing his best to fit in. ""Resident Alien"" isn't the first movie or series to poke fun at humanity through the eyes of a space alien, with movies like the hilarious Nick Frost and Simon Pegg-starring ""Paul"" and even the Jeff Goldblum rom-com ""Earth Girls are Easy"" playing with the concept, but it does take it to its furthest and most ridiculous conclusions. 

""Resident Alien"" is based on the comic book series of the same name by Peter Hogan and Steve Parkhouse, created by showrunner Chris Sheridan, who previously worked as a writer on shows like ""Family Guy"" and ""Living Single."" It features some great gross-out gags and a truly terrific turn by Tudyk, who has really made a name for himself as an actor who can do just about anything. Not only that, but for fans without access to SyFy, the show is available to stream on both Netflix and Peacock! 



The general premise of ""Resident Alien"" is that the alien was sent to Earth to destroy humanity, but he ends up with human emotions as a result of killing and assuming the identity of the real Dr. Harry, the medical examiner who was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. This leads him to question whether or not he should destroy all humans and sends him on a quest to figure out exactly what his mission is on Earth. Over the show's three seasons things get progressively more wacky, and there's even kind of a mini-""Firefly"" reunion because Tudyk is joined by the voice of Nathan Fillion as an octopus and in the upcoming fourth season, Jewel Staite will appear as an FBI agent investigating the strange happenings surrounding Harry's small Colorado town. 

Though ""Resident Alien"" has a pretty fantastic supporting cast, it's Tudyk's performance as an alien desperately trying to act human that really makes the series work. His running voice-over monologues are hilarious, and he's extremely capable of using his physicality for humor, showing us how an extraterrestrial in a human suit might really react to certain situations. Tudyk is pretty much always amazing, whether he's a leaf on the wind on ""Firefly"" or voicing the funniest version of the Joker ever on the animated ""Harley Quinn"" series, but ""Resident Alien"" is some of his finest work.

The ancient Celts were a collection of tribes that roamed Europe for centuries, reaching as far east as what is now Turkey. Best known from the writings of Julius Caesar, who recorded information on his war with the Gauls — a tribe that lived around modern-day France — the Celts are often depicted as violent, fierce and scruffy. But this picture has been filtered through ancient Roman and Greek authors who knew little about these groups, which spoke different languages and had complex cultures.

There's also no universal definition of who counted as an ancient Celt. Some historians count only continental tribes as Celtic, while others view the Brittonic-speaking tribes in the British Isles, such as the Durotriges and Iceni, as Celts as well. The association of the Celts with only the British Isles — and with Ireland in particular — that often persists today is a Renaissance invention.

Metrics details

We present a photonic engine that processes both optical and microwave signals, and can convert signals between the two domains. Our photonic chip, fabricated in IMEC's iSiPP50G silicon photonics process, is capable of both generation and detection of analog electrical and optical signals, and can program user-defined filter responses in both domains. This single chip integrates all essential photonic integrated components like modulators, optical filters, and photodetectors, as well as tunable lasers enabled by transfer-printed indium phosphide optical amplifiers. This makes it possible to operate the chip as a black-box microwave photonics processor, where the user can process high-frequency microwave signals without being exposed to inner optical operation of the chip. The system's configuration is locally programmed through thermo-optic phase shifters and monitored by photodetectors, and can select any combination of optical or microwave inputs and outputs. We construct multiple systems with this engine to demonstrate its capabilities for different RF and optical signal processing functions, including optical and RF signal generation and filtering. This represents a key step towards compact and affordable microwave photonic systems that can enable higher-speed wireless communication networks and low-cost microwave sensing applications.

Modern communication networks rely on the convergence of high-speed fiber-optic landlines and wireless radio-frequency (RF) microwave communications. The relentless expansion of these networks demands enhanced granularity, heightened data transmission, and operation at ever-higher frequency bands. Facilitating this exponential growth requires network nodes that can process both optical and microwave signals, convert between these domains, and, most importantly, have a reduced footprint, power consumption, and cost. In this quest, microwave photonics (MWP) emerges as a promising frontier, leveraging the vast bandwidth capabilities of optics to undertake signal processing tasks within the optical domain. Despite this potential, prevalent MWP demonstrations have predominantly relied on costly, power-intensive fiber-based systems that exhibit limited scalability1,2,3. Furthermore, earlier efforts at integrating on-chip systems have faced limitations, providing a limited subset of the necessary functionalities, or necessitating the use of several off-chip devices to achieve the intended capabilities4,5,6,7,8.

We present a key breakthrough in this paper, demonstrating a self-contained silicon photonic engine that can process both optical and microwave signals, and can convert signals between the two domains. This chip, which combines lasers, high-speed electro-optic modulators and detectors, and a programmable optical filter, can be considered the first demonstration of a full black-box microwave photonics process engine: for a user who wants to process analog RF signals, the internal optics of the chip are hidden. The signals going in and out can be confined to the RF domain, and no optical connections or external optical devices are essential for the operation.

However, we conceived our chip with more diverse functionality in mind, providing full programmability of the internal signal flow, such that the chip can be used with any combination of optical and microwave input and output signals. Equipped with optical connections and supporting devices, our photonic chip can be used not only for simple functions such as a tunable light source or a photodetector, but also as a high-speed transmitter or receiver, a tunable optical or microwave filter, a frequency converter, or a tunable opto-electronic oscillator (OEO). The programmability of our chip guarantees its robust performance, and control and calibration of the entire chip can be executed entirely in the electrical domain, using optical monitors strategically placed throughout the chip. This makes the chip a flexible engine that can be used to construct different microwave photonic systems.

To realize this integration of functions, we built on the standard iSiPP50G silicon photonics platform from imec9. This platform provides almost all key functions expected from silicon photonics, including low-loss waveguides and passive components, high-speed modulators and detectors, and thermo-optic phase shifters to tune the optical response. The key missing on-chip component in this platform is the light source: for this, we used micro-transfer-printing to integrate indium phosphide (InP) optical amplifier10. Combined with the on-chip tunable filter circuits, they can function as a widely tunable laser11. Optical signals can be coupled to and from optical fibers through grating couplers12. High-speed RF signals can be fed into electro-optic modulators, who imprint this RF signal onto an optical carrier wavelength generated by the on-chip laser. These optical signals can then be processed on-chip by a tunable optical filter bank, and converted again to the RF domain through high-speed photodetectors.

Our full integration approach also enables an entirely new way to treat microwave signals in the optical domain. The common approach is to employ single-sideband modulation, where half of the modulated signal is discarded, introducing inherent end-to-end system losses4,5. In our approach, we designed a reconfigurable modulator subcircuit that gives us arbitrary control over the phase relation between the sidebands and the optical carrier, and our optical filter block allows us to independently filter them before converting them back to the RF domain in the photodetector. This new formalism of signal processing does not suffer from the inherent loss of single-sideband modulation, but also simplifies the filter design algorithms.

Figure 1 shows the silicon photonics chip and its corresponding block diagram. The signal pipeline runs from the tunable lasers through the modulators (where the RF signal comes in) over the filter bank to the photodetectors to the RF output bondpads. All elements on the chip are fully tunable with on-chip thermo-optic phase shifters. And to allow arbitrary use of both optical and microwave signals, we introduced optical switches between the individual blocks in the system that interface with optical fibers, allowing the user to inject or extract light at every stage of the flow, and even create fiber-based feedback loops, as we will demonstrate further.

To demonstrate the versatility of our silicon photonic engine, we demonstrate different optical and electrical functions: optical-to-electrical signal conversion and the reverse operation, optical and microwave filtering and equalization, and microwave frequency doubling. We also combine our chip engine with a fiber loop to implement a tunable opto-electronic oscillator (OEO). The details of these different demonstrations are described in the supplementary material. Additional applications, including but not limited to radio over fiber links13, RF instantaneous frequency measuring14, RF phase tuning15, signal temporal computing8,16, optical and RF switching, and optical sensing17 and interrogation18, can clearly be realized with our photonic engine, though we will not discuss all these possibilities in this paper.

Our photonic chip consists of four main blocks, which are a tunable laser block (with 2 lasers), a reconfigurable modulator block, a reconfigurable optical filter block, and a high-speed PD block, as shown in Fig. 1a. The longest on-chip optical path starts with light generated by the laser source(s), which is then guided into the modulator circuit, which can be configured for RF signal phase modulation, intensity modulation, or its combination, by tuning the embedded static phase shifters (details in the Supplementary Information 3.3). The light, now modulated with an RF payload signal, will be fed into the optical filter block, which consists of a fully tunable four-ring-loaded MZI with tap monitors. The filtered light signal is then converted back into the RF domain by the high-speed PD. The four functional blocks are connected by optical switches, making it possible to inject or extract light signals from outside at each joint, allowing the chip configurations for both optical and RF signal processing, or cascading of these chips through fiber links. The optical switches are implemented as single-stage or double-stage MZIs, tuning with optical phase shifters and monitoring with tap monitors (details in Supplementary Information 3.2)19. A fabricated chip is shown in Fig. 1b, and a packaged device (before fiber attachment) is shown in Fig. 1c. The entire photonic circuit has 15 optical fiber ports, 1 RF input and 2 RF outputs, 52 heater-based optical phase shifters, and 8 tap monitors. It has the capability of fully reconfiguring the optical and electrical response and the conversions between the domains, and it can also function as a tunable laser source or a tunable RF source.

Figure 2 pictures the process engine configured as an optical linear filter: The light signal is guided through the MZI loaded with four independently tunable ring resonators (two in each arm). Such ring-loaded MZIs can act as an auto-regression/moving average (ARMA) filter4,20,21. We implemented all couplers in the filter as tunable MZIs, as shown in Fig 2b–e. With the built-in tap monitors, the coupling status of each ring can be calibrated locally. The tuning procedures are explained in the Supplementary Information 2.4. The optical responses shown in Fig. 2b–e are measured with an optical vector analyzer (LUNA OVA5000) and normalized to the grating coupler transmission envelope. If the phase difference in the MZI is zero, the rings will introduce sharp pass bands as shown in Fig. 2b, c. The fabricated rings show a 3 dB bandwidth of 35 pm when critically coupled. If the MZI phase difference is set to π, an overcoupled ring pair can form typical Chebyshev Type II filters with a flat passband. The measurements show passbands with  ~ 0.5 dB ripple in passbands and 30 dB stopbands rejection (Fig. 2d). By the tuning the second ring pair to the roll-off points, a higher-order Chebyshev Type II filter response is obtained, improving the roll-off bandwidth from 226 pm to 101 pm (Fig. 2e). More details and examples of optical filtering are described in the Supplementary Information 3.4.

One upper ring is used, the phase shifter is set to 0; c Double bandpass filtering configuration and response. One upper ring and one lower ring are used; the phase shifter is set to 0; d Second-order Chebyshev Type II bandpass filtering configuration and response, one upper ring and one lower ring are used, phase shifter is set to π; e Fourth-order Chebyshev Type II bandpass filtering configuration and response. Four rings are used, phase shifter is set to π.

Combining the laser(s) and modulator, we can imprint RF signals onto the optical carrier(s), corresponding to a pure electrical-to-optical response, as shown in Fig. 3. The on-chip tunable lasers consist of a Fabry-Pérot (FP) laser and a ring laser with intra-cavity wavelength filters. The measurements show -3 dBm optical power coupled to fiber with a tuning range of 60 nm. Depending on the design of the transfer-printed SOA, the lasing range can be adjusted11 (details in Supplementary Information 3.1). The reconfigurable modulator block consists of a Mach-Zehnder modulator with tunable couplers and a PN junction carrier depletion modulator in one arm, and a slow thermal phase shifter in the other arm. With the tunable couplers and phase shifter, we can configure the modulator to provide either an intensity modulation or pure phase modulation22 (details in Supplementary Information 3.3). The measurement setup is shown in Fig. 3b. Figure 3c shows the E/O response of the modulator block setting for intensity modulation and pure phase modulation. It exhibits more than 20 dB extinction with the same optical powers in an off-chip PD. When equalized by the filter block (discussed later), the 3 dB bandwidth of the packaged system can be improved from 4.5 GHz to 26 GHz without any pre-calibration (details in Supplementary Information 4.1).

VNA Vector Network Analyzer, EA Electronic Amplifier, EDFA Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier.

The O/E conversion is implemented by two on-chip PDs. The characterization setup is shown in Fig. 3e. Because the packaged connectors of the packaged chip still introduce excessive RF crosstalk, we make use of our engine's optical ports to integrate an extra erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) in the signal path. This boosts the modulated light signal, in turn enhancing the electrical signal. The system response is measured both with an off-chip PD and an on-chip PD, shown in Fig. 3f. Taking the off-chip PD as a reference, the O/E response of the on-chip PD shows a 3 dB bandwidth of 25 GHz, as shown in Fig. 3g. More details are shown in the Supplementary Information 3.5.

The packaged chip can act as an analog microwave processor and implement sophisticated linear filtering of RF signals, as shown in Fig. 4. For characterization, the response is measured with an off-chip PD avoid the RF crosstalk altogether. Unlike previously demonstrated integrated microwave photonic filters using single-sideband modulation (SSB)4,5, our processing engine can use both modulated sidebands, which simplifies the optical filter design. The reconfigurable modulator can generate sidebands with a tunable phase relationship (details in Supplementary Information 3.3), and with the reconfigurable optical filters, the RF response coming from the PDs can be achieved by controlling the interference between the upper and lower RF sidebands. Furthermore, to construct a generalized bandpass or band-stop filter in the RF domain, our approach requires a simple cascade of ring filters that can be independently tuned. More details explaining the unique benefits of this double-sideband approach can be found in Supplementary Information 4.1. Figure 4b–g shows various types of RF filter responses, realized by tuning both the modulator block and the rings. With a limited on-chip laser power, the whole RF gain of our chip is limited to −35 dB, and the noise figure is limited to 53 dB. Limited by the Q factors of the rings, the narrowest 3 dB RF filter bandwidth is  ~ 3 GHz. More details are shown in Supplementary 4.1.

Our signal processing engine can implement RF frequency doubling using the laser, the modulator and the detector, as shown in Fig. 5a. Fig. 5b shows a measurement setup for the nonlinear RF responses. By biasing the Mach-Zehnder modulator at its null point23, the ratio of the second-harmonic signal (2f) to the linear response (1f) can be adjusted by tuning the couplers in the modulator block such that the losses in both arms are fully balanced (this is a 70:30 balance as the PN modulator has a higher loss, as shown in Fig. 5c). The frequency doubling results with the off-chip PD and on-chip PD are shown in Fig. 5d and e, respectively. The results show that the 2f/1f signal ratio is as high as 40 dB with off-chip PD. For an on-chip PD, the RF crosstalk degrades the 1f extinction (details in Supplementary Information 4.2).

We can also use our signal processing engine to construct more sophisticated functions. For instance, by connecting an external PD, additional amplifiers (to compensate the loss in the RF bandpass filters shown above) and a long fiber delay line, our engine can now act as an OEO with a tunable central frequency, as shown in Fig. 6. The fiber creates a much longer longer oscillation cavity, which is indicated in Fig. 6b. With this system, RF signals can be generated with a frequency tunable from 4 GHz to 24 GHz and −116 dBc/Hz phase noise at 100 kHz offset frequency, shown in Fig. 6c. And with the on-chip PD, the generated signal can be tuned from 3.3 GHz to 11.6 GHz with −84 dBc/Hz phase noise at 100 kHz offset frequency, shown in Fig. 6d. More details are shown in Supplementary Information 4.3.

Except for the functionalities shown above, our signal processing engine can also work as an optical wavelength meter or RF frequency meter using the tap monitors in the filter block, where the resolution is limited by the Q factor of the loaded ring (Supplementary Information 4.4).

Our single-chip signal process engine, with a footprint of only 5 mm × 1.3 mm (not including the grating coupler array), provides a fully programmable filtering response for both optical and RF signals, as well as generation and detection of electrical and optical signals. This is a very complete set of functions typically needed in microwave photonics systems. For comparison, an overview of recent progress in the integrated photonic signal processor is shown in Table 1, based on a similar table in Ref. 4. To the best of our understanding, our engine represents a pioneering demonstration on a silicon photonic platform, achieving a seamless integration of all essential components. These components are interconnected with optical switches. By adjusting these switches, our photonic engine can perform a wide range of functions and serve as a critical building block in optical and microwave systems. To the best of our awareness, it also stands as a groundbreaking demonstrator showcasing such an extensive level of programmability.

Utilizing micro-transfer printing technology, we successfully integrated two tunable laser sources heterogeneously into our photonic engine. By employing different SOA coupons, the laser sources together achieve an approximate tuning range of 90 nm with a peak off-chip power of -3.5 dBm (-8 dBm as reported in Ref. 4).

Beyond the photonic chip, we implemented thoughtful packaging, ensuring high robustness. Still, even with state-of-the-art isolation (60 dB, compared to less than 20 dB in Ref. 4) between the RF input and output ports, the packaged engine still suffers from significant RF crosstalk. (details can be found in Supplementary Information 2). Even with those limitations, it shows a good overall performance compared to other demonstrations. e.g. the bandwidth of modulator (our work 34 GHz with a second-degree polynomial fit, 5 GHz in Ref. .4, 15 GHz in Ref. 7,5.4 GHz in Ref. 24), optical filters' FSR (107 GHz in our work, 20 GHz in Refs. 4 and25, 50 GHz in Ref. 5,55 GHz in Ref. 26), and filter's narrowest bandwidth(4 GHz in our work, 6 GHz in Ref. 4,5 GHz in Ref. 26). Its application demonstrators also show excellent results, like the tunable OEO's large frequency tuning range (larger than 24 GHz in our work, maximum 7 GHz in Ref. 27, fixed 10 GHz in Ref. 6) and lower phase noise than commercial RF sources. When programmed as a microwave photonic link, our photonic engine shows a RF gain of −35 dB (similar to −36.98 dB in Ref. 28), a noise figure of 53.5 dB (42.19 dB in Ref. 28), and a SFDR of 107 dBHz2/3. More details are shown in Supplementary Information 4.1.

In-line PD monitors in our photonic engine are included to calibrate and configure our photonic engines without using external optical devices. Furthermore, thanks to its high flexibility, our photonic engine can be combined with specialized off-chip devices to construct larger systems, or improve its performance where needed.

The E/E response of the processing engine is based on dual-sideband modulation. Compared to SSB modulation schemes in other works4,5,26,29, our algorithm enables a much simpler filter design and configuration, and it has a lower intrinsic RF loss. The commonly used SSB modulation scheme for arbitrary RF filtering requires filtering out one sideband of the RF-modulated signal, throwing away half of the modulated signal. Even in an ideal case, this results in an intrinsic 3 dB RF loss. Also, the SSB scheme maps an arbitrary optical filter into the RF domain, which typically necessitates a ring-loaded Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI).

In contrast, our chip is based on a double-sideband modulation scheme, keeping all the modulated RF power, as it eliminates the need for an additional optical filter for SSB suppression, saving at least 3 dB in both optical and RF power. In addition, we can perform arbitrary RF filtering only cascaded all-pass filters. In our demonstrations, we used two cascaded ring filters to achieve the RF filtering shapes shown in Fig. 4. The cascaded ring filter and its tuning process are also significantly simpler than the ring-loaded MZI used in other works. In addition, the reconfigurable modulator, with tunable splitter and combiner, ensures the minimum optical loss in all scenarios.

The configurability of our photonic engine depends on the tuning of the optical switches. Because of the nature of optical interference, even minor light crosstalk in a coherent system can significantly impair the performance30. To address this, our photonic engine employs optical switches for coherent optical splitting and combining that are built with double-stage MZI structures. The coupling in these switch circuits can be tuned from 0 to 1 and are highly tolerant of directional coupler fabrication errors19. Our measurements show that these optical switches can achieve extinction ratios of 40 dB (further details can be found in Supplementary Information 3.2). As these switches are somewhat more difficult to address (due to the additional tuning elements), we have included sufficient in-line photodiode (PD) monitors to calibrate and configure them.

The optical and electrical filters are both based on the same optical filter block in our processing engine. As a tunable filter, the minimum 3 dB bandwidth depends on the quality (Q) factor of the ring resonators, which are  ~50,000 at critical coupling. The monitor PDs inside the ring introduce some extra loss (limiting the Q), but they allow us to directly monitor the ring status for configuration. Better calibration schemes or a tunable power tap should allow us to reduce the impact of these monitor PDs.

The filtering performance is also limited by the filter order, which corresponds to the number of ring resonators in the block. For a higher-order RF filter, we only need to cascade additional rings, which is very scalable in terms of optical losses and tuning scheme. For optical filtering, increasing the order requires extra ring pairs over both arms of the MZI.

The two on-chip laser sources both show 50 nm tuning ranges in different wavelength regions, and a total 90 nm tuning range (from 1508 nm to 1598 nm). With the on-chip modulators, an E/O conversion with widely tunable optical carriers can be reached.

The programmable filter can also be used as an RF equalizer. In the Supplementary Information 4.2 we show how we compensate the uneven RF loss of the PCB and bonding wires, boosting the 3 dB bandwidth from 4.5 GHz to 26 GHz.

In addition, the on-chip laser together with two PDs can also be configured as a coherent receiver with tunable local oscillator (LO). But due to the high RF crosstalk (discussed in the crosstalk section), we did not further evaluated this.

We used micro-transfer-printing technology to integrate two tunable lasers into our photonic engine. These tunable lasers cover a wavelength range from 1507 nm to 1575 nm, with a maximum output power of -3 dBm (measured at the output fiber) and an intrinsic linewidth of 45 kHz. All demonstrations in this work are based on these two on-chip lasers. Additional details are provided in Supplementary Information 3.1 and in Ref. 10.

For optical signal filtering and detection, the performance of the on-chip laser does not significantly affect the results. However, for microwave photonic applications, the on-chip laser performance is critical. First, the laser output power directly influences the RF gain of the system, especially when no additional optical amplification is used-higher laser power enhances the overall system gain. Second, the phase noise of the on-chip laser contributes to the accumulated phase noise of the signal within the system. Therefore, minimizing laser phase noise is essential for maintaining high signal integrity and overall system performance.

We reported two demonstrations of how we can use our engine to build RF signal generators. We showed frequency doubling with 40 dB 2f/1f extinction ratio using the configurable modulator, and a tunable opto-electronic oscillator (OEO) when combining the engine with an external fiber and RF amplifier. The OEO's RF generation covers the 4-24 GHz span with almost constant phase noise of -114 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz using an off-chip PD. This is superior to commercial products (R&S SMR, -105 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset frequency for 10 GHz central frequency). The frequency generation of the OEO system is not limited to 24 GHz with our process engine, but its phase noise measurement is limited by the used spectrum analyzer (26 GHz).

The energy usage of our photonic engine is contingent on the number of functional blocks employed. Our system contains two lasers, one modulator, and around 52 phase shifters (each tunable coupler contains two phase shifter). To fully operate the system, we will need to drive one laser, the modulator, and 23 phase shifters, including 17 tunable couplers (only one arm driven is needed for each tunable coupler), and 6 phase shifters for offset phases. The transfer-printed laser unit consumes 300 mW of electrical power, and the 23 thermal phase shifters (thermal efficiency of 28 mW/π) would cost around 812 mW at the worst case. Altogether, the photonic engine would demand roughly 1112 mW maximum.

For configurability, the system contains 52 thermal tuners, making it quite sensitive to external and internal temperature fluctuations. In addition, the power dissipation of the transfer-printed laser (300 mW) and the modulator termination (80 mW at −2 V) make the thermal control even more challenging. Even though the sample is mounted on a temperature controller, it still drifts with ambient temperature. But when this is well controlled, the system shows a high stability and repeatability, which means that the different internal crosstalk contributions can be compensated by the on-chip tuners.

The chip has an integrated laser, but no optical isolator. This makes the laser cavities vulnerable to all reflections along the optical path. As an example, the used grating couplers have a reflection of around 1.6%. As these are not fully avoidable, all phase tuners will also affect the reflected light, introducing small perturbations to the laser cavity. However, the tunability of the system allows us to compensate for most of these. In our experiments, these effects were not a problem to realize the different demonstrations, but further characterization will be needed to develop robust compensation strategies.

The RF packaging of our photonic engine is not perfect, resulting in RF crosstalk. The circuit board allows the RF signal to couple directly from the input connectors to the output connectors, bypassing the chip. Experimental measurements indicate that the RF crosstalk is approximately -60 dB. Because we did not boost the PD output with a transimpedance amplifier (TIA), their relatively weak signal is drowned in the direct RF crosstalk and cannot be retrieved. For the reported experiments, we made use of the optical ports to insert an off-chip EDFA (the only necessary optical device) to boost the modulated optical signal and then feed it back into the chip, or alternatively we used a separate off-chip detector. With a suitable TIA and even better RF isolation, these measures would not be necessary. Details of this characterization are shown in the Supplementary Information 3.5.

As discussed above, the main limitation of our photonic engine is the low RF signal readout from the on-chip PD and the unavoidable RF crosstalk, resulting in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This affects the performance of all demonstrations and necessitates the use of an off-chip EDFA.

To address these issues, the most effective solution is the integration of a proper TIA near the output of the on-chip PD. This could be realized through monolithic integration, micro-transfer printing, or surface-mount device (SMD) assembly with wire bonding. The addition of a TIA would enable reliable RF signal readout from the PD and significantly enhance the SNR. Moreover, RF wire bonding could help reduce crosstalk by minimizing electromagnetic radiation.

By overcoming these bottlenecks, this silicon photonics-based engine can enable optical and microwave signal processing with all the key components. Its compact, low-power design highlights its potential for data centers, wireless communication, and microwave applications.

The photonic chip was fabricated in the imec iSiPP50G silicon photonic platform on 200 mm wafers. The chip size is 1.3 × 5 mm2 without grating couplers and 3.3 × 5 mm2 with grating couplers. The chip layout is designed using IPKISS by Luceda Photonics.

Transfer printing technology uses a stamp to pick up a prefabricated SOA coupon from a III-V source wafer and print it onto the target position of the silicon photonic sample (or wafer). In this process, SOAs are fabricated on a 2"" wafer of InP epitaxial layer stack, grown by the metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) method at III-V Lab. A release layer is incorporated beneath the SOA device layer stack. After devices are patterned, the release layer is selectively etched, resulting in free-standing components held by tethers. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp is then laminated against these released devices, termed “coupons"". When the stamp is rapidly pulled away, the coupons adhere due to strong bonding, break the tethers, transferring the devices to the stamp.

After pick-up, the stamp now carrying the device (either single or array), is aligned to the destination wafer using pattern recognition through the transparent PDMS stamp. The printing process entails laminating the stamp to the target wafer and retracting it slowly, using a shear force, ensuring the coupons adhere to the target wafer. To enhance coupon adhesion, an divinylsiloxane bisbenzocyclobutene (DVS-BCB) adhesion layer is used. After the process, one metallization step is necessary to link the transfer-printed components with the bondpads on the original silicon photonic sample31.

On the imec iSiPP50G platform, a localized back-end opening (recess) is necessary to interface with the Si waveguide, permitting the seamless integration of III-V SOAs with Si structures. The 40 μm wide III-V SOA measures 1 mm, including two 180 μm adiabatic tapers to enhance the coupling efficiency. Underneath the SOA, there's a continuous poly-Si/c-Si waveguide (with respective thicknesses of 160 nm and 220 nm) ensuring optimal optical coupling between the III-V device layer and the Si waveguide below it. Moreover, an added taper structure aids in channeling the optical mode to the 220 nm thick crystalline Si wire waveguide. Detailed information regarding the design and production of the III-V/Si SOAs can be found in11, and more details can be seen in Supplementary Information 1.2.

Fiber arrays are used for coupling the light in and out of chip. A fiber array is actively aligned by maximizing transmission through a shunt waveguide and then fixed in place on the processed sample using UV-curable epoxy. A 15 dB loss is measured for the reference waveguide ports, corresponding to a 7.5 dB loss per grating coupler. The use of edge couplers instead of grating couplers could significantly reduce the insertion loss of the fiber interfaces9.

The 68 DC channels (heaters, tap monitors and grounds) and 3 RF ports (1 input, 2 outputs) are wirebonded to a high-speed printed circuit board (PCB), which for the high-speed RF ports shows a 3 dB loss at 40 GHz. More details are shown in the Supplementary Information 1.3. However, the modulator and the PD performance show that the wirebonding to the transmission line introduces a high loss and high RF crosstalk, which limits the maximum frequency that the full system can support to 25 GHz. A better RF packaging solution may relax these constrains and bring the performance up to the level of what we measured using RF probes: 33 GHz for the modulator and 50 GHz for the PDs.

The transfer-printed SOA, the tap monitors and the on-chip PDs are driven by a Tektronix Keithley 2401. The heater-based optical phase shifters for tuning and configuration are driven by a PXI 6704 from National Instruments.

No external laser is used to generate the different functions described above. The transmission spectrum for the O/O functionality was measured with an optical network analyzer (LUNA, OVA5000), which does contain a tunable laser, but which is only used for characterization purposes. The off-chip PD is a 42 GHz PD (Discovery LabBuddy DSC10H).

The E/E response is measured by a Keysight vector network analyzer(E8364B, 50 GHz). The RF signal source in Fig. 5b is a 40 GHz signal generator (Rohde & Schwarz SMR 40) and the electrical spectrum analyzer in Fig. 5b is a Keysight EXA signal analyzer (N9010A 44 GHz). The ESA used in Fig. 6b for the spectrum and phase noise measurement is an Anritsu MS2840A (26 GHz).

Defending champion beats Elena Rybakina 1-6, 6-3, 7-5

Carlos Alcaraz reaches last eight by beating Ben Shelton

After another sad second serve rebounded off the top of the net and floated out on a break point, Iga Swiatek turned to her support team and frantically gestured her rage. She had simply not shown up. As Elena Rybakina bulldozed through the early stages of their highly anticipated fourth-round tussle, Swiatek trailed 6-1, 2-0 and her hopes of victory were fading.

For much of this year, Swiatek has struggled to find her form when forced into difficult positions against her toughest rivals. However, she showed her resilience here with a supreme 1-6, 6-3, 7-5 statement win against the 12th seed, to return to the quarter-finals of the French Open.

Five years since her first French Open title, Swiatek's era of dominance at Roland Garros now stands at 25 consecutive victories, the longest winning run here among female players in the 21st century. This win could have a transformative effect on the Pole's confidence as she tries to shake off her difficult run of form and recover self‑belief, in her attempt to become the first woman in history to win the French Open singles title four times in a row.

“I think I needed that kind of win to feel these feelings that I'm able to win under pressure, and even if it's not going the right way, still turn the match around to win it,” Swiatek said. “For sure it's a great confirmation for me. I for sure wanted to have a match like that. Obviously it's great to also have full control over the match, but against great players it's not always going to be possible. I'm happy that I fought, and I also problem-solved on court.”

Although she avoided a fourth‑round meeting with her nemesis Jelena Ostapenko, who holds a 6-0 record against the five‑time grand slam title winner, Swiatek still found herself up against one of her toughest rivals. Rybakina's own recent struggles are reflected in her seeding of No 12. At her best, however, the 2022 Wimbledon champion is one of the top four players in the world.

With her precise, destructive serve and the effortless power she generates with her groundstrokes, Rybakina's game also matches up extremely well against Swiatek's. The Kazakhstani played flawless attacking tennis for 45 minutes as she established a set and break lead: “In the first set it felt like I was playing Jannik Sinner,” Swiatek said.

Despite her high-profile difficulties this year, Swiatek has still been more consistent than the vast majority of the tour this year. Her problems have arisen usually against the best players. When she has been pushed by quality players, she has often become overwhelmed by her own doubts. This time, she continued to think clearly under pressure.

From 6-1, 2-0 down, Swiatek gradually worked her way back into the match, particularly using her heavy topspin forehand to force Rybakina back and drag her out wide on her forehand side. Swiatek also opted to take a deeper return position, a significant departure on her usual position close to the baseline, which allowed her more time to return Rybakina's imperious serve. After working through numerous tight games early on, Swiatek established greater momentum and forced a third set.

In a tense final set that followed, there were numerous tight moments. Swiatek saved three break points at 2-3 then, after finally breaking serve to lead 4-3, she handed the momentum back with another double fault. No matter, in the most consequential match of the tournament so far, which would have been a worthy final, Swiatek played positive attacking tennis under immense pressure until the end. Instead of allowing the tension to overwhelm her, she searched for solutions until she found them.

Swiatek will next face the 13th seed, Elina Svitolina, who produced a brilliant comeback victory herself on a spectacular day in the women's draw. Despite facing three match points, Svitolina recovered to defeat Jasmine Paolini – the fourth seed, and runner‑up last year – to reach her fifth quarter‑final in Paris. Aryna Sabalenka, the top seed, will play Zheng Qinwen in the quarter‑final after defeating Amanda Anisimova 7-5, 6-3.

In the men's draw, Carlos Alcaraz continued to build momentum in his title defence as he defeated Ben Shelton, the 13th seed, 7-6(8), 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 in a high-quality tussle to return to the quarter-finals in Paris. The second seed faced three set points in the opening‑set tie-break but was clinical on the important points and, after conceding the third set, recovered impressively to close out the match without further trouble.

Alcaraz will next face the 12th seed, Tommy Paul, who cruised into the quarter-finals for the first time in his career with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 win against Alexei Popyrin.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"

Red Bull and Mercedes team bosses Christian Horner and Toto Wolff have given their opinions on the dramatic clash between Max Verstappen and George Russell in the closing stages of the Spanish Grand Prix.

After a Safety Car triggered by Kimi Antonelli's stoppage, Verstappen found himself under attack from a host of soft-tyre runners, having only been able to take on hard rubber when he came into the pits.

Verstappen slid his way out of the final corner at the restart and was overtaken by Ferrari's Charles Leclerc via some wheel-banging on the start/finish straight, before Russell saw an opportunity and attempted an overtake of his own.

Taking to the Turn 1 escape road saw the Dutchman initially hold the position, only for his race engineer to instruct him to let the Mercedes man past, which he later appeared to do – despite some radio frustrations – at Turn 5.

However, Verstappen quickly returned to his usual speed and collided with Russell on the penultimate lap of the race – prompting the latter to declare during his media pen interviews that he “got crashed into”.

“Max had a snap at the restart,” said Horner, as he offered his take on the chain of events. “Charles got alongside him [and] it looked like he pulled left on him.

“Then George obviously tried to capitalise on that into Turn 1 and it was very, very marginal. On recent experience and looking at recent incidents, obviously it's subjective.

“You've asked for guidance from the FIA, from the referee. Essentially, there's nothing come back. You can see that it's been reported, it's going to the stewards.

“It looked for all intents and purposes that it was going to be a penalty. So, therefore, the instruction was given to Max to give that place back, which he was obviously upset about and annoyed about, because he felt that, one, he'd been left no space and, two, that George hadn't been fully in control.

“So, after a conversation with his engineer, he elected to give the place back at Turn 5, [and] there was contact between the two cars.”

Horner added: “I haven't had a chance to speak to Max from his side, but obviously the stewards deemed that he caused a collision and got 10 seconds and some penalty points, unfortunately.

“It obviously was very frustrating, because it leaves us with one point [10th place] out of the afternoon, what should have been an easy podium.”

Speaking in his post-race media session, with Russell winding up in fourth position, Wolff commented: “I just heard, actually, that Max had the call to let him pass, right? I didn't know. We were under the impression in the race that he had a problem with the car, and that's why he was so slow getting out of [Turn 4].

“I mean, if it was road rage, which I can't imagine, because it was too obvious, then it's not good. But the thing is, I don't know what he aimed for. Did he want to let George pass and immediately repass, put George the car ahead? Then, like the old DRS games, letting him pass the right way?

“Or… for me, it's just incomprehensible. But again, I don't know exactly what the motivations were, and I don't want to jump on it and saying, you know, this was road rage, et cetera. Let's see what his arguments are. It wasn't nice.”

Pushed more on Verstappen's racecraft and approach, Wolff said: “You know, there's a pattern that I've read, the great ones, whether it's in motor racing or in other sports, you just need to have the world against you and perform at the highest possible level.

“That's why sometimes these greats don't recognise that actually the world is not against you, it's just you who has… you have made a mistake or you've screwed up, et cetera, et cetera.

“So, we haven't seen any of these moments with Max for many years now. Obviously, I know the year 2021 that happened, and I don't know where it comes from.”

Kathy Bates, Cristin Milioti, Helen Mirren, Niecy Nash-Betts, Parker Posey and Keri Russell bond over an hour spent swapping war stories on beauty standards and bad advice. 


							By 

	Mikey O'Connell


TV Features Editor


	These six actresses at the absolute top of their game may have recently found themselves in the zeitgeist for their dramatic work, but there was no shortage of levity when they sat down for THR's Drama Actress Roundtable.


Kathy Bates (Matlock), Cristin Milioti (The Penguin and Black Mirror), Helen Mirren (1922 and Mobland), Niecy Nash-Betts (Grotesquerie), Parker Posey (The White Lotus) and Keri Russell (The Diplomat) swapped ware stories for an hour — talking about the worst advice they've gotten over the course of their careers, seeing too many “beautiful but she doesn't know it” parts in scripts and, for Bates and Posey, relishing in their recent returns to the center of attention. “The memes, the excitement of my friends and family, it's been so lovely,” Posey said of her recent work on The White Lotus and the many, many viral moments it inspired. “There are friends going, ‘We were so worried,' or ‘We've been stressed for you.' They're glad to see you happy and appreciated and getting work that's fulfilling and funny. And my mom can feel fabulous with her friends.”

	Bates says she was in a similar boat, frustrated by a recent string of films that either weren't seen or lost something in the edit. “Things were starting to wind down for me,” Bates said of her career before Matlock. “I just thought that maybe I ought to think about putting my house on the market and moving to France or something. I just wanted some real stimulation.”


	A recurring theme over the hour was bad advice — some of which the women regret taking and much more of it they're glad they ignored. Nash-Betts was told to not marry a woman. “There were people who were like, ‘Your fan base has known you to be a certain way, and you need to stay right there. Otherwise, you'll never eat lunch in this town again,'” said Nash-Betts, who married her spouse Jessica Betts in 2020. “We're about to do another vow renewal, a big party, just so I can say, ‘In your face,' to whoever told me not to get married.”

	











	Mirren was also given an ultimatum. “I was told to have a nose job in my 20s.” she recalled. “Someone said, ‘You'll never get work if you don't have a nose job.'” (She declined.) 


	Speaking of careers, Russell, an entertainment industry fixture since Felicity propelled her to fame at just 22, confessed she's still not 100 percent sold on being an actor. “There are a lot of things that are still embarrassing to me,” she said. “For me, there's a real push-pull. I still have to overcome the obstacle of being nervous, but this version of TV that we're in works for me.”


	Miliot, fresh off of her turn on The Penguin, said her own career prospects have changed dramatically over the last decade. “If I look back 10 years, I was often playing a version of ‘a girl of someone's dreams,'” she said. “That didn't feel like my life experience, which is fine, but the older I get, the more I feel like I'm taking off a pair of tight pants. I feel so much freer. It's not a dig at any of those projects. It's how you're perceived at 25. I was auditioning to play sorority girls or a dead body in a trunk or someone who was in love with a 40-year-old and being like, ‘Have you ever tried dancing in the rain?' To leave that behind felt really good.”


	It should also be mentioned that Mirren also finally revealed the real reason why she so frequently mentions Kurt Cobain during interviews. Her real fixation? “It's not Kurt Cobain. It's dying young.”

It tallies the smallest second-week percentage decline for a No. 1-debuting album in more than a year.

Morgan Wallen's I'm the Problem notches a second week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart (dated June 7), after debuting in the pole position a week ago with the year's biggest week for an album. In its second week, I'm the Problem earned 286,000 equivalent album units (in the tracking week ending May 29) in the United States according to Luminate. A week ago, the set arrived at No. 1 with 493,000 units.

	With a relatively scant 42% second-week decline in units earned, I'm the Problem tallies the smallest second-week percentage drop for a No. 1-debuting album in more than a year. The last No. 1-debuting set to see a smaller sophomore frame fall, by percentage decline, was 21 Savage's American Dream on the March 3, 2024-dated chart. It fell 41% in its second week (from 133,000 to 78,000).




			Trending on Billboard		







	Plus, Wallen has three albums in the top 10 at the same time for the first time ever, as I'm the Problem is joined by his former No. 1s One Thing at a Time (No. 4) and Dangerous: The Double Album (No. 10).


	The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new June 7, 2025-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on June 3. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.

	











	Of I'm the Problem's 286,000 equivalent album units earned in the week ending May 29, SEA units comprise 256,000 (down 28%, equaling 332.89 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs — it leads Top Streaming Albums for a second week), album sales comprise 28,000 (down 79% — it's No. 1 on Top Album Sales for a second week) and TEA units comprise 2,000 (down 39%).


	Nos. 2-8 on the Billboard 200 are all former No. 1s. SZA's SOS is a non-mover at No. 2 (47,000 equivalent album units earned; up 2%); Kendrick Lamar's GNX climbs 5-3 (42,000; up 1%); Wallen's One Thing at a Time is steady at No. 4 (nearly 42,000; down 1%); Playboi Carti's MUSIC motors 18-5 (41,000; up 57% after a range of deluxe boxed set editions, sold through his webstore, were fulfilled to customers); Sabrina Carpenter's Short n' Sweet steps 7-6 (36,000; down 3%); PARTYNEXTDOOR and Drake's $ome $exy $ongs 4 U is up 8-7 (nearly 36,000; down 4%); and Bad Bunny's Debí Tirar Más Fotos rises 9-8 (35,000; down 3%).


Billie Eilish's Hit Me Hard and Soft is back in the top 10, moving 11-9, with 31,000 equivalent album units earned (though down 2%).


	Wallen's chart-topping Dangerous: The Double Album rises 12-10 with 30,000 equivalent album units earned (down less than 1%). Wallen has three albums in the top 10 concurrently for the first time ever, as Dangerous joins I'm the Problem (No. 1) and One Thing at a Time (No. 4). Wallen is the second act to log at least three albums in the top 10 at the same time in 2025, following Lamar after his Super Bowl LIX halftime show performance on Feb. 9. On the Feb. 22-dated chart, Lamar was at Nos. 1, 9 and 10 with GNX, DAMN. and good kid, m.A.A.d city, respectively.

	











	Wallen and Lamar are the only living male artists to have had at least three albums in the top 10 at the same time since Herb Alpert on the Dec. 24, 1966-dated chart (when he, along with the Tijuana Brass, had three titles in the top 10). The most recent act, overall, with at least three albums in the top 10 was Taylor Swift on the March 2, 2024, chart, when she had three in the region — she has held at least three albums concurrently in the top 10 of the chart 22 times.


	Before Lamar, the last male artist — or anyone aside from Swift — to have at least three albums in the top 10 at the same time was Prince, following his death, in 2016. That year, on the May 14 chart, he logged five titles in the region; and on the May 7 chart, he had three in the top 10. Prince died on April 21, 2016.
