                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study that followed almost 200,000 people for several decades has found that when it comes to heart health, the quality of food consumed matters as much as following a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet. However, the impact of these diets on reducing heart disease risk has remained an ongoing debate. Healthy versions of these diets-those rich in plant-based foods and whole grains-were linked to better heart health outcomes and improved metabolic function. In contrast, low-carb and low-fat diets emphasizing unhealthy foods were associated with a higher risk of heart disease." Zhiyuan Wu, PhD, postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Qi Sun, MD, ScD, at Harvard T.H. Based on information from detailed questionnaires completed by the study participants, the researchers assigned scores indicating how healthy or unhealthy their food choices were within low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets. For more than 10,000 of the study participants, the researchers also measured hundreds of blood metabolites to assess how diet quality influenced their metabolic regulation. "This approach allowed us to better understand the biological effects of these diets and strengthened our findings," said Wu. The analysis showed that study participants who followed a healthy low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet had a lower risk of developing coronary heart disease, while those on unhealthy versions saw an increased risk. "Regardless of whether someone follows a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet, emphasizing whole, minimally processed and plant-based foods and limiting refined grain, sugar and animal foods, can significantly reduce the risk of coronary heart disease." For those looking to improve their diet, the researchers suggest focusing on adding more whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes while cutting back on processed meats, refined carbs and sugary foods. They note that it is also important to check food labels and be mindful of added low-quality ingredients, such as added sugars in juices and processed snacks. For example, they want to look at how genetic factors, lifestyle choices and other metabolic markers may further shape these associations. They are also interested in how low-carbohydrate or low-fat diets may impact other health outcomes, such as type 2 diabetes and cancer. This knowledge could help tailor dietary recommendations for individuals based on their unique health profiles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A large prospective, randomized clinical trial in patients with advanced breast cancer has found that the use of liquid biopsy blood tests for early detection of a treatment-resistance mutation, followed by a switch to a new type of treatment, substantially extends the period of tumor control compared to standard care. It is one of the first demonstrations that treatment switching guided by liquid biopsy results brings better outcomes for patients. Dr. Cristofanilli, an expert on the use of liquid biopsy technology for cancer monitoring and early cancer detection, helped design and oversee the SERENA-6 study as a member of its steering committee. The study, which was sponsored by Astra Zeneca, enrolled patients with advanced forms of estrogen receptor (ER) positive, HER2 receptor-negative breast cancer, which is driven by the overactivity of growth-promoting estrogen receptors on tumor cells. Standard treatment includes drugs called aromatase inhibitors that block the production of ER-stimulating estrogen hormones. However, tumors treated this way often start growing and spreading again because they develop mutations in the ESR1 gene that keep estrogen receptors active even when estrogen hormone levels are low or absent. The trial was set up to determine if patients would benefit from early detection of ESR1 mutations with liquid biopsy-type blood tests, followed by an immediate switch to an experimental new breast cancer drug called camizestrant, which reduces the number of estrogen receptors. The researchers screened more than 3,300 patients at 264 different clinical sites in 23 countries. The 315 who had detectable ESR1 mutations but no symptomatic or medical imaging evidence of tumor progression were randomly assigned to stop taking an aromatase inhibitor and start taking camizestrant, or to stick to standard treatment including an aromatase inhibitor. The researchers considered these differences to be both statistically significant and clinically meaningful. Camizestrant also was well tolerated, with low rates of treatment discontinuation. He noted as well that not only breast cancer but also many other cancer types have potential treatment-resistance mutations that can be detected early with liquid biopsy techniques.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research that used blood markers to measure linoleic acid levels and their relation to cardiometabolic risk adds evidence that this omega-6 fatty acid may help to lower risks for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The findings challenge claims that seed oils are harmful to cardiometabolic health. Linoleic acid, which is found in vegetable oils-especially seed oils like soybean and corn oil-and plant foods, is the primary omega-6 fatty acid consumed in the diet. Our study, based on almost 1,900 people, found that higher linoleic acid in blood plasma was associated with lower levels of biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk, including those related to inflammation." The new results are consistent with those from observational studies that have shown higher intake of linoleic acid to be associated with lower risks for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes. "Although other studies have assessed relationships between linoleic acid and cardiometabolic risk factors, our study used objective biomarkers rather than diet records or food frequency questionnaires to assess linoleic acid intake," said Maki. Specifically, study participants with higher linoleic acid showed lower levels of glucose and insulin as well as HOMA-IR, a biomarker of insulin resistance. They also had lower levels of inflammation biomarkers, including C-reactive protein, glycoprotein acetyls, and serum amyloid A. "We saw consistent results across the different biomarkers measured," Maki said. "People with higher levels of linoleic acid in their blood tended to have a healthier overall risk profile for heart disease and diabetes." The researchers say that their findings support the need for additional intervention studies to test whether increasing linoleic acid intake improves cardiometabolic risk factors and lowers the incidence of heart attacks, strokes and type 2 diabetes. Next, they plan to investigate how different types of oils with varying fatty acid content affect cardiometabolic risk factors. Maki will present this research at 10:20-10:24 EDT on Sunday, June 1, during the Bioactives in Inflammation, Intestinal Health, Glucose and Bone Metabolism session and at 12:45-1:45 PM on Monday, June 2 during the Dietary Bioactive Components session  in the Orange County Convention Center.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, new research led by Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center found that adding immunotherapy to chemotherapy after surgery for patients with stage 3 (node-positive) colon cancer - and with a specific genetic makeup called deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) - was associated with a 50% reduction in cancer recurrence and death compared to chemotherapy alone. "It's extremely rewarding to be able to offer our patients a new treatment regimen that can reduce the risk of recurrence and improve their chances of survival." Until now, the standard treatment after surgery for any stage 3 colon cancer has been chemotherapy. However, the researchers note that approximately 30% of patients experience cancer recurrence despite this treatment. The clinical trial enrolled 712 patients with dMMR stage 3 colon cancer that had been surgically removed and who had cancer cells in their lymph nodes. The immunotherapy given in this study was an immune checkpoint inhibitor, known as atezolizumab, which activates one's immune system to attack and kill cancer cells, which are responsible for cancer recurrence and spread. The patients - who lived in the U.S. and Germany - received chemotherapy for six months along with immunotherapy and then continued with immunotherapy alone for another six months. Dr. Sinicrope and others previously studied patients with colon cancer whose cells are unable to repair errors during DNA replication that create a nucleotide mismatch, a condition called dMMR. They noted that these patients' tumors showed a striking increase in inflammatory cells within the tumor, including those that express the target of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Based on the data from this study, Dr. Sinicrope recommends this combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy treatment to be the new standard treatment for stage 3 deficient mismatch repair colon cancer. The research team plans to approach the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a nonprofit organization consisting of 33 leading cancer centers, including Mayo Clinic, with this recommendation. The study included patients with Lynch syndrome, the most common form of hereditary colon cancer, as these patients can have tumors that show deficient mismatch repair (dMMR). By using immunotherapy at earlier stages of disease, we are achieving meaningful benefits for our patients."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tobacco-funded research is still appearing in highly-cited medical journals - despite attempts by some to cut ties altogether, finds an investigation by The Investigative Desk and The BMJ today. Although the tobacco industry has a long history of subverting science, most leading medical journals don't have policies which ban research wholly or partly funded by the industry. These investments include treatments for conditions caused or aggravated by smoking, such as lung cancer, heart disease, and asthma. These ties complicate ongoing efforts of researchers, scientific organisations and journals to distance themselves from the industry and has led to calls for journals to not only institute bans on research by tobacco companies but also on their subsidiaries. They also checked the tobacco policies of 10 leading general medical journals and 10 journals in each of the three therapeutic areas especially affected by smoking. Of those 40 journals, only 8 (20%) had policies prohibiting studies wholly or partly funded by the tobacco industry. But even among the journals that have a policy, enforcement can be difficult when it involves subsidiaries or organisations associated with the tobacco companies. Last year, one of BMJ Group's titles, BMJ Open, retracted a paper after it became clear that the listed funder receives sponsorship from the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World, a group supported and fully funded by tobacco company Philip Morris International (PMI). Dutch researcher Wytse van den Bosch had a research grant from pharmaceutical company Vectura when the company was bought by PMI in 2021. Nevertheless, his study was still published in the European Respiratory Society (ERS) journal which said the research was not in breach of its policy as the grant from Vectura was initiated in 2018. Ruth Malone, professor of social behavioral sciences at the University of California and former editor-in-chief of BMJ Group's Tobacco Control journal, said that institutions, professionals and scientific journals should refuse involvement with the tobacco industry. Nicholas Hopkinson, professor of respiratory medicine at Imperial College London, notes that given the industry's "long-standing history of dishonesty" it is "very straightforward" that researchers should cut ties to companies after they are acquired by big tobacco, as otherwise they would be "working with the tobacco industry" and contribute to their profits. In addition to excluding research funded by the tobacco industry, BMJ journals will also exclude work where authors have personal financial ties to the tobacco industry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have documented the way a single gene in the bacterium that causes bubonic plague, Yersinia pestis, allowed it to survive hundreds of years by adjusting its virulence and the length of time it took to kill its victims, but these forms of plague ultimately died out. A study by researchers at McMaster University and France's Institut Pasteur, published today in the journal Science, addresses some fundamental questions related to pandemics: how do they enter human populations, cause immense sickness, and evolve different levels of virulence to persist in populations? The Black Death remains the single deadliest pandemic in recorded human history, killing an estimated 30 to 50 per cent of the populations of Europe, Western Asia and Africa as it moved through those regions. Its deadly effects are now more controlled by antibiotics but are still felt in regions like Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of Congo, where cases are regularly reported. This is one of the first research studies to directly examine changes in an ancient pathogen, one we still see today, in an attempt to understand what drives the virulence, persistence and/or eventual extinction of pandemics." Strains of the second pandemic emerged from infected rodent populations, causing the Black Death, before breaking into two major lineages. An extensive genetic analysis revealed that its copy number, or total number of pla genes found in the bacterium, had decreased in later outbreaks of the disease, which in turn decreased its mortality by 20 per cent and increased the length of its infection, meaning the hosts lived longer before they died. These studies were performed in mice models of bubonic plague. Conversely, when the pla gene was in its original, high copy number, the disease was much more virulent and killed each of its hosts and did so much quicker. The scientists also identified a striking similarity between the trajectories of modern and ancient strains, which independently evolved similar reductions in pla in the later stages of the first and second pandemic, and so far, in three samples from the third pandemic, found in Vietnam today. "The reduction of pla may reflect the changing size and density of rodent and human populations," explains Poinar. "It's important to remember that plague was an epidemic of rats, which were the drivers of epidemics and pandemics. Black rats in cities likely acted as "amplification hosts" due to their high numbers and proximity to humans. However, the pla-reduced strains eventually went extinct, likely reflecting another shift in the host-pathogen relationship within their environment. When the researchers searched for signs of depletion in a large set of samples of the third pandemic preserved in a collection at the Institut Pasteur, they found three contemporary strains with pla depletion. "Thanks to our international collaborators who monitor local epidemics of plague worldwide, we were able to find the unique bacterial samples used for this project, akin to finding of three rare needles in a haystack," says Javier Pizarro-Cerdá, co-senior author of the work, director of the Yersinia Research Unit and of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Plague at the Institut Pasteur. The institute houses one of the world's richest collections of modern Y. pestis isolates, adds Guillem Mas Fiol, co-lead author of the study and Postdoctoral researcher supervised by Pizarro-Cerdá. "One of the most interesting aspects of our research was the possibility to explore a feature first observed in extinct plague strains, that could, for the first time, be experimentally tested in living contemporary bacterial strains," he says. "Although our research sheds light on an interesting pattern in the evolutionary history of plague, the majority of strains which continue to circulate today in Africa, South America and India are the more virulent ones, the ones that were previously responsible for massive mortality," says Ravneet Sidhu, co-lead author of the study, and PhD candidate at the McMaster Ancient DNA Centre.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While moms have traditionally gotten much of the focus when it comes to children's eating habits, a new study highlights the importance of dads in shaping a child's relationship with food. According to the study, young children were more likely to consume the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables if their father ate a healthier diet during his teen years. Our study found that fathers who ate healthier as teenagers were more likely to encourage positive food habits in their children. These fathers were better at modeling healthy eating-actively demonstrating good dietary habits-and monitoring their child's intake of unhealthy foods, such as certain sweets and snack foods." All participants had completed at least two dietary questionnaires during adolescence and had children between the ages of 1-6 in 2021-2022 when they agreed to participate in a follow-up study specifically for fathers. According to the results, men whose diet quality had improved during adolescence were 90% more likely to model healthy eating when they became fathers and 60% more likely to monitor healthy eating in their children, compared with fathers who had a poor diet in adolescence. In addition, the children of fathers whose diet quality had improved during adolescence were significantly more likely to meet dietary recommendations for fruit and vegetable consumption compared with children whose fathers had poor or declining diet quality in adolescence. Researchers say the findings underscore the importance of encouraging healthy eating in all demographic groups, including young people who may one day become parents. "Healthy eating habits formed during adolescence not only benefit individuals but also shape future parenting behaviors, contributing to better nutrition for the next generation," said De Oliveira. "This is especially significant given the growing concerns around childhood obesity and poor dietary habits. Investing in adolescent nutrition, including for boys, can have lasting, intergenerational benefits." Researchers noted that the study population was disproportionately white and well-educated, with over 90% identifying as white and over 80% having at least a bachelor's degree, which may limit the applicability of the findings in other demographic groups. In addition, the study evaluated the role of eating regular family meals during adolescence and found that it did not contribute to healthier dietary patterns later in life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In patients with an advanced type of skin cancer called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), those who received the combination of the immunotherapy drug avelumab and targeted agent cetuximab had almost four times longer median progression-free survival compared to patients who received avelumab alone, according to the results of a phase 2 trial presented today at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting and concurrently published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. It is both an honor and humbling to develop clinical trials that can be potential options for our patients. My hope is that the insights we made with this trial will lead to additional studies that can ultimately bring a new immunotherapy-based combination into standard of care for patients with advanced cSCC." Dan Zandberg, M.D., lead author and study chair for the trial, associate professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh and medical oncology co-leader of the head and neck cancer program at UPMC Hillman Cancer Center cSCC is a common type of skin cancer with about 1.8 million cases diagnosed in the U.S. each year. About 95% of cSCCs are detected early and can be treated with minor surgery. But in rare cases, patients will go on to develop advanced cSCC, which includes locally advanced tumors that cannot be surgically removed and metastatic disease. This trial, which was open nationwide, included 57 patients with advanced cSCC. UPMC Hillman was the leading site for patient recruitment, with some of those patients recruited and treated at its network of more than 70 community cancer centers. Avelumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor drug that targets a protein found on cancer cells called PD-L1. When PD-L1 binds to a receptor on T cells called PD-1, it acts like a brake, slowing down the cancer-killing activity of T cells. Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), a protein that plays a critical role in tumor cell growth, proliferation and survival and which is often found in high levels on cSCC cells. Previous research done at UPMC Hillman by Robert Ferris, M.D., Ph.D. and his lab helped reveal cetuximab's effect on the immune system. The study showed that the primary endpoint of progression-free survival was significantly higher in patients who received avelumab plus cetuximab with a median of 11 months compared to just 3 months in patients who received avelumab alone. Even though avelumab and cetuximab led to an almost quadrupling of median progression-free survival compared to avelumab alone, the trial does not support this combination as a standard treatment for patients. That's because since the trial was launched, two other anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies - cemiplimab and pembrolizumab - have been approved and had higher efficacy than avelumab in trials in patients with cSCC. However, the trial represents the first completed prospective randomized comparison of cetuximab plus blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway versus blockade of that pathway alone in cSCC or head and neck cancer, where this combination has also shown promise. The trial provides valuable information for future trials. "These findings highlight the potential benefits of combining cetuximab with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and points to the importance of additional clinical trials combining either standard of care pembrolizumab or cemiplimab with cetuximab as a potential way to improve patient outcomes in advanced cSCC," said Zandberg. But this trial suggests that continuing immunotherapy and adding cetuximab could be more beneficial.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vepdegestrant, an investigational estrogen receptor (ER) degrader, known as a proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC ), outshone the commonly used selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) fulvestrant in a phase 3 trial of second-line treatment for a subset of patients with breast cancer. The VERITAC-2 trial included patients with ER-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+/HER2-), locally advanced or metastatic disease who had failed prior treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK 4/6) inhibitors and endocrine therapy, and no exposure to chemotherapy in the advanced setting. “These results support vepdegestrant as a potential monotherapy treatment option for patients with previously treated ESR1-mutant ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer,” said lead author Erika P. Hamilton, MD, a medical oncologist and director of Breast Cancer and Gynecologic Cancer Research at Sarah Cannon Research Institute, Nashville, Tennessee, during a press conference for the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. Vepdegestrant is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, but received fast-track status in February 2024 as monotherapy for this patient population. PROTACs represent a novel class of therapeutic agents that harness the proteasome to selectively degrade target proteins. “There's no established consensus for patients getting treatment in the second-line setting after progression on endocrine therapy and a CDK 4/6 inhibitor,” explained Hamilton. First, it's administered intramuscularly, and second, in a post-CDK 4/6 landscape, we know that progression-free survival is very short — on the order of less than 2 months.” The new trial included 624 patients with advanced ER+/HER2- disease that had progressed following one or two lines of endocrine therapy and a CDK 4/6 inhibitor. “They could not have received fulvestrant already or chemotherapy, and patients had to have benefited from their previous line of endocrine therapy for at least 6 months to enter the study,” Hamilton noted. Such mutations are a common cause of acquired resistance found in approximately 40% of patients in the second-line setting, according to a press release from the drug developer. Key secondary endpoints were overall survival, objective response rate, and clinical benefit rate, which was defined as the rate of confirmed clinical or partial response at any time, or stable disease, nonclinical response, or nonprogressive disease for at least 24 weeks. However, this primary endpoint was not significantly different between groups when calculated for the entire patient population (HR, 0.83; P = .07). Similarly, the objective response rate was more than four times higher (18.6% vs 4%) Commenting in a press release, ASCO breast cancer expert Jane Lowe Meisel, MD, said that although the trial found that vepdegestrant worked better than fulvestrant in patients with ESR1 mutations, “on average, patients did not have prolonged responses on either agent, highlighting the need for combination therapies and continued development in this space.” Meisel is co-director of Breast Medical Oncology at the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia. Compared to oral SERDs, vepdegestrant has a favorable side effect profile, Hamilton said. “Oral SERDs have prominent GI side effects as their most frequent side effect.” But, across all grades, rates of both vomiting and diarrhea were only 6% with vepdegestrant. GI side effects tend to be more common, “in the 30% or 40% range with oral SERDs,” she told Medscape Medical News. Study discussant William John Gradishar, MD, emphasized the importance of reducing side effects. “ Vepdegestrant now joins a growing list of drugs that perform better than current standard of care monotherapy” in the ESR1-mutant population, he noted in the session. But the reality is that most of these drugs are being developed to be used in combination with targeted therapies, “and increased toxicity can be expected with doublet therapy…Quality of life measures as experienced and reported by patients are critical, and even modest changes in symptom and functional domains should not be minimized,” said Gradishar, professor of breast oncology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois. “Vepdegestrant has demonstrated compelling preclinical activity and encouraging early clinical data supporting its efficacy in degrading ER,” said Albert Grinshpun, MD, in an interview with Medscape Medical News. “Importantly, the treatment landscape for patients progressing on CDK 4/6 inhibitors is rapidly evolving, with a growing shift toward combination therapies rather than fulvestrant monotherapy,” he said. “In my view, vepdegestrant has established itself as a promising endocrine backbone for future combination strategies. The study was jointly funded by Arvinas Estrogen Receptor, Inc. and Pfizer. Gradishar disclosed consulting or advisory roles with AstraZeneca, Genentech/Roche, Gilead Sciences, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer.
