                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But card has 'the worst coil whine' ever. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Today, overclocking expert and TechTuber, Roman 'der8auer' Hartung, revealed the gaming performance that an Nvidia RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell graphics card can deliver. We've seen some gaming-like benchmark results for Nvidia's most powerful workstation GPU before, but der8auer also takes this $10,000 professional card though games like Cyberpunk 2077, Star Wars Outlaws, Remnant 2, and Assassin's Creed Mirage. In his 15-minute video, der8auer admits he hopes to use this RTX Pro 6000 in his personal rig, and enjoy the resulting gaming sessions. Before getting into the tests, the TechTuber reminds us that this card doesn't have a Game Ready Driver, it only runs with its workstation driver. But this doesn't seem to be a big issue. The first game dissected is Cyberpunk 2077, played in 4K with max settings (no ray tracing). As you can see, the RTX Pro 6000 is 14% faster than the RTX 5090, on average, and it has 13% better 1% lows in this title. If you are splurging about $10,000 on such a GPU, though, you might not care too much about the slight wrinkle in the power consumption comparison. That last result might have been “a driver thing,” pondered the video host. It looks like the previously seen 3DMark tests actually gave quite a good window onto the performance here. If you haven't already done so, you can watch the full der8auer video above, where lots of other background details are shared. You can also see a fun comparative Cyberpunk 2077 benchmark with its most extreme settings (path tracing) and MFG turned on. However, the workstation card benefits from 24,064 shaders (rather than 21,760) as well as more TMUs, ROPs, Tensor cores and RT cores. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. With its FE-style cooler design the RTX Pro 6000 is nice and compact, but with it easily reaching 600W power consumption, there are a few comments made about the noise of this graphics card. Wryly, der8auer says that the fans ramp up so fast and so loud that you can't really hear the coil whine. Make sure to click the Follow button. Mark Tyson is a news editor at Tom's Hardware.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The UAE wants to have chips made within its borders. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC) is reportedly in talks with White House officials to discuss the possibility of opening a chip fab in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). According to Bloomberg, the company has met several times with U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, alongside state-owned investment firm MGX, discussing plans to invest and build a plant in the country. This site would be of similar scale and size to the one the chip maker is building in Arizona, but no further details have been publicly discussed yet. This isn't the first time that a chip maker has explored putting up a megafactory in the UAE — both Samsung and TSMC have each considered putting up their own facilities in the country in the third quarter of 2024, with senior executives from both companies visiting the area to start discussions. Sources say that Washington wanted to have sovereign control over the site, which apparently was not acceptable to the UAE government. It's also not just about finances — the UAE does not have a ready supply of professionals capable of building and running the factory, so TSMC would have to pull out personnel from other locations. This could potentially affect operations in the U.S., especially if it loses key people to the Middle East plant. The second, more serious concern was national security. If the geopolitical weather changes and the country switches allegiance, having a chip factory outside of Washington's direct control would make it easier for its adversaries to acquire the most advanced chips that America has been trying so hard to keep them from. It has already secured approval from the U.S. to acquire Nvidia AI GPUs through G42, its homegrown AI datacenter company. More recently, OpenAI announced that it will expand Stargate AI infrastructure in the country, with plans to build a 1 GW data center in Abu Dhabi. However, there haven't been any further discussions about the topic yet. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Fortunately, this year's market offers a great alternative without having you compromise on performance or features: The Lenovo Ideapad, which was released this year, is currently available on Amazon for a price so cheap it's not thought to be true. For an insane 73% discount, the 15-inch portable touchscreen computer (16GB RAM, 512GB storage) is on sale for $519, down from its regular price of $1,899. The Lenovo Ideapad in question is a touchscreen 15.6-inch machine, so it's perfect for work and play. Its Full HD (1920×1080) IPS display offers an anti-glare, clear view at 300 nits brightness which makes it easy to see comfortably in a bright room or outdoors.

We're seeing traces of AMD's more affordable Strix Halo options, with the octa-core Ryzen AI Max 385 marking its debut on Geekbench. Powering the HP ZBook Ultra G1a, Strix Halo appears poised to expand into the mainstream segment with eight and six-core variations. Performance indicators in Geekbench aren't as impressive as we expected, though we shouldn't consider them as definitive due to this being a leak, typical run-to-run variations, and laptop power settings. CES marked the debut of AMD's flagship APU family this generation, Strix Halo, under the Ryzen AI 300 Max line, for AI/ML developers and gamers. AMD launched four different variants, ranging from 6-16 CPU cores and 16-40 GPU cores, catering to a wide range of consumers. Most of the first and second quarters have been occupied by the premier Ryzen AI Max+ 395 and 390, with mini-PCs costing up to $2,000. Meanwhile, laptops, limited to the HP Zbook Ultra G1a and Asus ROG Flow Z13, exceed the $5,000 price point, fully decked out with 128GB of LPDDR5x RAM. The Ryzen AI Max 385 sports eight cores and sixteen threads based on the Zen 5 architecture, alongside a 32 Compute Unit equipped integrated GPU (Radeon 8050S) based on RDNA 3.5 and a 50 TOPS capable NPU. This suggests similar single-core performance, but the actual results indicate otherwise. In Geekbench, this specific sample of Ryzen AI Max 385 dished out 2,489 points and 14,136 points in the single-core and multi-core categories, respectively. HP's website confirms the existence of such a model, listed at an eye-watering $2,599, with shipments starting tomorrow. As of writing, Asus' Flow Z13 doesn't offer a configuration below the 12-core Ryzen AI Max 390. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Dyson is known for their vacuum expensive vacuum cleaners but they have also changed the hair dryer industry by creating salon-quality styling from home. Amazon currently has a record low price for the Supersonic Nural hair dryer that you do not want to miss, and it's probably making no profit on this device. Significant discounts do not normally happen on Dyson products, so when it does happen, you have to jump on it! While traditional hair dryers use heavy bulky motors that are loud and clunky, the Supersonic model uses Dyson's unique digital motor that is tiny, very powerful, and is very quiet. You will have a hair dryer that feels light, is ergonomically designed to fit comfortably in your hand and will not drain you during long periods of use. There is more: it even has intelligent heat control when using the hair dryer. It has a built-in sensor that measures air temperature more than 40 times a second and it can help prevent heat damage and helps retain your hair's natural shine. The hair dryer features Dyson's Air Multiplier technology which generates a high-speed jet of air that dries hair in less time—and less frizz—while also smoothing strands to ensure you get that professional styling every time. On top of that, the Supersonic dryer provides magnetic styling attachments from gentle air (for relaxed or tender scalps), to styling concentrator (to focus on specific areas), to a diffuser (for curly hairs). Dyson hair dryers are utilized by some of the best salons in the world and that speak for itself. Bringing that kind of luxury and performance into your home is a huge advantage, and because it is only $379 right now, you should definitely not miss it.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Going forward, it pledges to ensure all USB data, charging, and display functionality “just works” on all your USB-C ports. Moreover, an additional rule means USB 40Gbps ports will be fully compatible with both USB4 and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals. The Microsoft blog indicates that these rules should already be in place with certified Windows 11 laptops and tablets that come with Windows 11 24H2 installed. Senior Product Manager at Microsoft, Ugan S., asks readers of his blog whether they are “Tired of USB-C ports that don't behave consistently?” To illustrate the problem, he retells a story about ‘The Blank Display' and laments that such issues still happen in the present day. To fix this inconsistency, the WHCP will now mandate that every USB-C port on new Windows laptops and tablets needs to support data, charging, and display functionality. This should mean no more guessing about which ports support what, and might also mean end users are happier as they can connect a charger or second display to either side of a laptop (if there are USB-C ports both side). On the topic of USB4, you can also see in the table that “On a WHCP-certified USB 40Gbps system, you can also plug in any USB4 or Thunderbolt 3 device and trust it will work every time on every port.” This should ensure security and feature updates arrive via Windows Update. To wrap up its post, Microsoft explains that the Hardware Lab Kit (HLK) is behind these improvements. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Make sure you grab yours as soon as you can, because it might run out of stock very quickly. Whether you're listening to your favorite playlist or setting the mood for a gathering, the Xtreme 4 ensures your music sounds rich and full, no matter where you are.

American chip giant Intel has partnered with Japanese tech and investment powerhouse SoftBank to build a stacked DRAM substitute for HBM. According to Nikkei Asia, the two industry behemoths set up Saimemory to build a prototype based on Intel technology and patents from Japanese academia, including the University of Tokyo. Most AI processors use HBM or high-bandwidth memory chips, which are perfect for temporarily storing the massive amount of data that AI GPUs process. Aside from that, they get hot pretty quickly and require relatively more power. The partnership aims to solve this by stacking DRAM chips and then figuring out a way to wire them more efficiently. If successful, SoftBank says that it wants to have priority for the supply of these chips. The insatiable demand for AI chips means that HBM supply can be hard to get by, so Saimemory aims to corner the market with its substitute, at least for Japanese data centers. This will also be the first time that Japan aims to become a major memory chip supplier in over 20 years. This won't be the first time that a semiconductor company is experimenting with 3D stacked DRAM. Samsung has already announced plans for 3D and stacked DRAM as early as last year, while another company, NEO Semiconductor, is also working on 3D X-DRAM. On the other hand, Saimemory is aiming for reduced power consumption — something that data centers sorely need, especially as AI power consumption is increasing annually.

The G915 X TKL is a well-built, low-profile gaming keyboard with new switches and impressive battery life, but it's not cheap. Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. If you're looking for a low-profile wireless gaming keyboard, you might still be looking — there aren't too many on the market, as "gaming" usually suggests a focus on performance, while "low-profile" usually suggests compromising performance for convenience and portability. But there are a few low-profile gaming keyboards out there, such as Logitech's G915 — which found its way onto our list of best wireless gaming keyboards several times over the years since it first launched in 2019. Needless to say, it's time for an update — but Logitech knows better than to fix what isn't broken. But there are changes that you can't see on the surface — namely, Logitech's new low-profile switches (in linear, tactile, or clicky), which have been refined for more stable keypresses and compatibility with third-party keycaps. The new board also sports decent battery life (if you turn off the RGB backlighting), tri-mode wireless connectivity, and a slightly more solid (and heftier) case build. The G915 X series includes both a full-size and a TKL option — we're taking a look at the TKL version, which comes in black and white and was priced at $199.99 when it launched in Sept. 2024, but now appears to have increased in price to $229.99. The keyboard is sleek, as in slim, but it sports a pretty roomy layout, with space between the function keys and dedicated connectivity buttons and media keys located along the top. It comes in two colorways — white, which has a silver brushed-aluminum top plate and white keys with shine-through legends; and black, which has a gunmetal gray brushed-aluminum top plate and black keycaps with shinethrough legends. The keyboard sports the same brushed-aluminum top plate — though it's now slightly thicker (1.5mm vs 1.2mm) for (slightly) more structural strength and a more premium typing experience. It features Logitech's "G" logo — backlit, as this is the flagship lineup of Logitech's low-profile gaming keyboards, after all — and eight round, backlit, soft-touch buttons. The first two buttons are for switching between 2.4GHz "Lightspeed" wireless and Bluetooth connections — like the G515 Lightspeed TKL, the G915 X TKL can only connect to one Bluetooth device at a time, so you can really only switch quickly between two devices. There's also a wide metal volume roller, which has light striations for grip and a smooth (not notched) roll. If you're the kind of person who uses dedicated media keys and likes to switch between connections or in and out of Game Mode quickly, the G915 X TKL lays it all out there for you. But if you're like me, who almost never uses dedicated media keys or switches away from her PC, this does seem like a waste of space. The G915 X TKL is a slim but moderate-sized keyboard. There's also a convenient slot for storing the 2.4GHz wireless USB-A dongle, which is always handy on a keyboard that's sized for travel like the G915 X TKL is. The G915 X TKL now features Logitech's new, redesigned low-profile switches in linear, tactile, or clicky. They're the same switches we saw in the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL — low-profile with a POM cross-style stem for a more stable keypress, a better typing experience, and compatibility with third-party keycaps. Our review unit came with linear switches, which have an actuation force of 43g and actuate at 1.3mm (reduced from 1.5mm in the old switches), with a total travel distance of 3.2mm (increased from 2.7mm in the old switches). The switches feature a smooth, consistent keypress with no tactile bump or audible click, and were speedy enough for me to keep up (as much as I normally can, anyway), in fist-person shooters like Counter-Strike 2. Gamers usually like linear switches for their speed, and I will say that the linear switches' slightly lower actuation force did seem to make a difference here — not one that was noticeable in gaming so much as it was in typing, however. My fingers were flying across the keyboard so quickly that I did initially find myself making quite a few errors, and I blame that on the lighter actuation. (All three switch types have the same actuation point and total travel distance.) The keycaps also likely contributed, at least somewhat, to the learning curve on this keyboard — they're wide and flat, with lightly curved tops and that slightly gritty texture you expect from double-shot PBT keycaps. The higher-quality double-shot PBT keycaps are definitely appreciated — while the switches have been updated to be compatible with third-party keycaps, that doesn't mean there are tons of low-profile keycaps out there — and regular keycaps won't work on a low-profile switch. The keycaps have shine-through legends, which are crisp and clear and show off the keyboard's bright RGB backlighting perfectly. The switches are factory-lubed and feel smooth, but typing on this keyboard will get you a consistent, lightweight rattling from the keycaps every time you press a key down. It's not necessarily an unpleasant sound, but it's not what most keyboard enthusiasts are looking for in a keyboard. The G915 X TKL has an aluminum top plate, so it doesn't get the same plasticky rattle as the G515 Lightspeed TKL did in our testing, but it does occasionally give some mild metallic pings. That said, typing on a low-profile keyboard always involves some sort of compromise. You can use G Hub to customize the keyboard's lighting (and sync the lighting effects with other Logitech G products you might own), remap keys and buttons, and set up game mode. Remapping in G Hub is more convoluted than it needs to be, but thanks to Logitech's new "Keycontrol," you can map three layers deep — primary, Fn, and G-Shift. You can also save profiles in the software and on the device itself, and tie profiles to specific apps or games. G Hub also comes preloaded with a handful of standard effects — color cycle, breathing, audio visualizer, etc. The G915 X TKL has three forms of connectivity — 2.4GHz wireless, Bluetooth, and wired (via USB-C). The first connectivity button toggles between 2.4GHz wireless and wired, while the second button switches to Bluetooth (and can also be held down to enter pairing mode). Logitech rates the G915 X TKL's battery life at "up to 1000 hours" over 2.4GHz wireless — but that's with the backlighting off, of course. With the lighting on at full brightness you can expect to get around 42 hours, which is still pretty good — enough to get you through more than a week's worth of pretty heavy usage before you'll need to recharge. It features more versatile switches — though they're not hot-swappable — better battery life, and a solidly-built case — and it's speedy enough, even for competitive gamers. And while the typing experience is a little rattly, it's not bad — once you get used to the lighter-weight switches and flat, smooth keycaps, you'll be typing up a storm on this keyboard without any issues. There are low-profile keyboards with better typing experiences, but they tend to be mediocre for gaming — the Lofree Edge and the Chilkey ND75 LP both sound and feel great, but aren't great for gaming despite their general specs (N-key rollover, 1,000 Hz polling rate) suggesting they are. While gaming peripheral software often infuriates me, it does happen to have a lot of features that are convenient for, well, gaming — and while G Hub is overcomplicated, it's a decent companion when you're, well, gaming.

If you've recently searched for the Samsung Galaxy S25+ 512GB on Amazon, you might have come across something peculiar: the price is not visible. This is because of an agreement with Samsung: The manufacturer is wanting to keep price drops like this a secret – especially as it was released just a few months ago. On Amazon, the Galaxy S25+ 512GB is on sale at its lowest point to date for a limited time only: The 512GB model can be purchased for $869 which is 22% off the original list price of $1119. Make sure you grab yours before it runs out of stock! Both phones have the same basics: unlocked Android, smart AI cameras, and Samsung's latest ProScaler display. If you're looking for differences, the Galaxy S25 has a smaller 6.2-inch FHD+ display and starts with 128GB or 256GB of storage while the S25+ offers a larger 6.7-inch QHD+ screen and storage options of 256GB or 512GB (which is the one on sale right now). The S25+ also benefits from a higher pixel density, which makes images and text appear sharper. Beyond display and storage, the Galaxy S25+ stands out with a bigger battery (4,900mAh compared to the S25's 4,000mAh) for longer battery life for heavy users. The S25+ also supports ultra-wideband connectivity which is not available on the standard S25 and enables features like precise device tracking and secure digital car keys. The best part of this Amazon deal is that the Galaxy S25+ 512GB now costs less than many standard S25 models, thanks to Amazon's limited-time sale. The S25+ is unlocked, so you can use it with any carrier, and it comes with a one-year warranty for extra peace of mind. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine. When she was 10 years old, Rose Yu got a birthday present that would change her life—and, potentially, the way we study physics. That was a rare commodity in China 25 years ago, and the gift did not go unused. At first, Yu mainly played computer games, but in middle school she won an award for web design. Yu went on to major in computer science at Zhejiang University, where she won a prize for innovative research. Yu earned her doctorate in 2017 with an award for best dissertation. Yu, now an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), is a leader in a field known as “physics-guided deep learning,” having spent years incorporating our knowledge of physics into artificial neural networks. The work has not only introduced novel techniques for building and training these systems, but it's also allowed her to make progress on several real-world applications. This work has brought Yu closer to her grand dream—deploying a suite of digital lab assistants that she calls AI Scientist. She now envisions what she calls a “partnership” between human researchers and AI tools, fully based on the tenets of physics and thus capable of yielding new scientific insights. Combining inputs from a team of such assistants, in her opinion, may be the best way to boost the discovery process. Quanta spoke with Yu about turbulence in its many guises, how to get more out of AI, and how it might get us out of urban gridlock. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. Yu on the UCSD campus, where she is an associate professor. When did you first try to combine physics with deep learning? Deep learning—which uses multilayered neural networks to elicit patterns from data—was getting really hot back then. There was already a lot of excitement about applications in image classification, but images are just static things. I wondered whether deep learning could help with problems where things are constantly changing. I wasn't the first person to consider this, but my colleagues and I did find a novel way of framing the problem. Sensors, which monitor traffic on highways and other roads, serve as the nodes of this graph. Yu's interest in computers began with a gift for her 10th birthday. When you put together a series of these snapshots, spaced every five minutes apart, you get a good picture of how traffic is evolving. From there, you can try to predict what will happen in the future. Prior to our work, people could only make traffic forecasts that were reliable for about 15 minutes. That's about when you began working on climate modeling, right? Yes, that started in 2018, when I gave a talk at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Afterward, I spoke with scientists there, and we looked for a problem that would be a good testbed for physics-guided deep learning. We settled on predicting the evolution of turbulent flow, which is a key factor in climate models, as well as an area of major uncertainty. Familiar examples of turbulence are the swirling patterns you see after pouring milk into a cup of coffee and giving it a stir. In the oceans, swirls like this can span thousands of miles. But the required calculations are very slow, which is why we don't have good models for predicting hurricanes and tropical cyclones. The basic idea is that deep neural networks that are trained on our best numerical simulations can learn to imitate—or as we say, “emulate”—those simulations. They do that by recognizing properties and patterns buried within the data. Our models sped up predictions by a factor of 20 in two-dimensional settings and by a factor of 1,000 in three-dimensional settings. Something like our turbulence prediction module might someday be inserted into bigger climate models that can do better at predicting things like hurricanes. Turbulence in blood flow, for instance, can lead to strokes or heart attacks. Propellor-generated airflows interact with the ground to create turbulence. That, in turn, can cause the drone to wobble. We used a neural network to model the turbulence, and that led to better control of drones during takeoffs and landings. I'm currently working with scientists at UCSD and General Atomics on fusion power. One of the keys to success is learning how to control the plasma, which is a hot, ionized phase of matter. At temperatures of about 100 million degrees, different kinds of turbulence arise within the plasma, and physics-based numerical models that characterize that behavior are very slow. Yu and doctoral student Jianke Yang in her office at UCSD. In the past couple of years, my group has developed AI algorithms that can automatically discover symmetry principles from data. Our algorithm also identified rotational symmetry—the fact, for example, that a sphere doesn't look any different regardless of how you rotate it—which is something it was not specifically trained to know about. While these are well-known properties, our tools also have the capability to discover new symmetries presently unknown to physics, which would constitute a huge breakthrough. It then occurred to me that if our tools can discover symmetries from raw data, why don't we try to generalize this? These tools could also generate research ideas or new hypotheses in science. What exactly is AI Scientist—just a fancy kind of neural net? It's not a single neural network, but rather an ensemble of computer programs that can help scientists make new discoveries. My group has already developed algorithms that can help with individual tasks, such as weather forecasting, identifying the drivers of global temperature rise, or trying to discover causal relationships like the effects of vaccination policies on disease transmission. We're now building a broader “foundation” model that's versatile enough to handle multiple tasks. Scientists gather data from all types of instruments, and we want our model to include a variety of data types—numbers, text, images, and videos. AI can assist in practically every step of the scientific discovery process. The literature survey stage in an experiment, for example, typically requires a massive data-gathering and organization effort. In this case, it can't compete with an experienced researcher. While AI could help with hypothesis generation, the design of experiments and data analysis, it still cannot carry out sophisticated experiments. How far would you like to see the concept go? Rest assured, the goal is not to replace human scientists.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. In my 15 years of reviewing tech, this pellet-firing, story-telling, pretend-urinating robot attack dog is easily the strangest thing I've ever tested. Arriving in a slightly battered box following a series of questionable decisions on Temu, I'm immediately drawn to the words “FIRE BULLETS PET” emblazoned on the box. And there, resting behind the protective plastic window with all the innocence of a newborn lamb, lies the plastic destroyer of worlds that my four-and-a-half-year-old immediately (and inexplicably), names Clippy. And he (my son assures me that it's a he), is clearly influenced by the remarkable, and somewhat terrifying, robotic canine creations of Boston Dynamics—a renowned company that's leading the robot revolution. Naturally, given the $50 price tag (a little less if you don't want the—ahem—spinal-mounted pellet gun), I'm not expecting Clippy to perform miracles. But, given my track record, being served an Instagram ad promising all manner of animatronic wizardry for less than the cost of a round of drinks in a London bar, the opportunity was too tempting to pass up. What happened, almost inevitably, was a lesson in not taking the social media ads you are served at face value. It was also a lot of ridiculous fun. After freeing Clippy from his box, I'm immediately met with some of the lightest, cheapest, glossiest plastic I've ever come across. Its polycarbonate body remains one of my favourite phone designs to this day. Sturdy, solid, and light, it was everything an object clad in plastic should be. Clippy and his accompanying remote, on the other hand, provide a somewhat Christmas cracker toy-like level of confidence in their durability. Except, of course, that I am in ownership of the turret-toting model, which promises to lay waste to enemies by bombarding them with water-absorbent pellets (more on that in a bit). Overall, the entire ensemble resembles an elongated CCTV camera on legs, with a turret resting on top—suitably menacing, and genuinely not far off Boston Dynamic's bona fide offering, in looks, at least. Elsewhere, I can only assume that the controller has been pumped full of helium, such is its hollow, airy lightness. Heavily inspired by the shape of an Xbox controller, I particularly love the fact that its bumper buttons and triggers are simply formed from one immobile piece of moulded plastic. There's something quite beautiful in their utter uselessness that I enjoy very much. As for the business end, it's an ADHD nightmare. Littered with a chaotic array of buttons in seemingly no logical order, I give credit to the designers for creating a controller that laughs in the face of muscle memory. Initial attempts at turning Clippy on are unsuccessful. I desperately look through the carnage of controller buttons, hoping to find a volume or mute option. What I didn't expect, was cheerful whistling, and the sound of water tinkling into a toilet bowl. I look, and happen upon the “handstand” button. This, I feel, will be an impressive test of his dexterity. A handstand maneuver will surely call upon multiple gyroscopes and accelerometers, combining and crunching data from numerous sensors in real time to ensure that Clippy's body remains perfectly poised in balance. A moment passes, his rear legs rise, and they begin to twitch. I presume this apparent seizure is meant to represent elegant scissor kicks. “Don't blame me bro, did you really expect anything else?” I can almost hear him plead. But, somehow, Clippy does return to his feet and appears unscathed, ready for more. As I mentioned, the controller has many, many buttons—no less than 17 functions in fact—and I'm not going to bore you with overly gratuitous descriptions for each one. Kung fu: Absolutely zero semblance of any martial art moves, or even a cheeky backflip. Instead (and completely inexplicably), some form of poolside, Lost Frequencies-esque lounge music blasts out. Both of these buttons involve vigorous floor-humping that surpass even his most sexually charged efforts. Oh, and a side note for any optimists out there, Clippy is not waterproof. Story: Buckle up, pressing this button results in very loud, tinny classical music blaring out over a spoken story. The narrator has an Eric Cartman-like twang to their voice, and the speaker quality means I can barely make out what's being said. The next story, I think, involves a pigeon. Despite this clearly incredible skillset, it is interesting that Clippy's ability to be controlled or steered via the remote is … flawed. Going forward is generally fine, and there are left and right buttons which cause him to turn very slowly, often toppling over in the process. There is no reverse, so I constantly have to pick him up before he collides with walls and furniture (no collision detection cameras appear to be present). He can, at least, shake hands (or "hadn-shake" on the remote) like any well-trained pup. It would also be remiss not to mention that there is an official app which lets you control your robot dog via Bluetooth. For example, you can select different “foods” for him to eat, ranging from a bone to “Nuclear Energy Source”—all of which result in various forms of eating animations. There's also a voice command mode, which doesn't seem to work. Despite offering all the permissions asked for (including, against my better judgement, access to my phone and files), voice commands seem to fall on deaf ears. There's also a program mode which lets you set up custom actions, though all my attempts seem to end up in more faceplants. According to the product page, Clippy's back-mounted turret “can be loaded with water bombs to launch for fun.” The image accompanying this description is impressive. Two blue projectiles appear to blast forth from the cannon. I immediately picture an autonomous robotic guard dog patrolling the house, scanning for threats, and dispensing justice as appropriate. Once soaked in water for a few hours, they plump up, and you can load them into the turret, before firing away. Clippy walks forward a few steps, crouches to steady his aim, and two pellets dribble out with all the urgency of a clogged ketchup bottle. This method is repeated about ten times, with mixed results. At best, a pellet is fired relatively straight, but still not without any meaningful force—certainly not enough to even penetrate a wet square of toilet paper. After the ammo is spent, we decide that it's time to watch him faceplant again. But while it's all too easy to slate, playing around with Clippy has taken me back to my childhood, where toys like this were life. He brought him into our bedroom every morning, waking me up with a shrill, unintelligible story before blasting out a guitar riff with an enthusiasm that is already wearing thin. It won't be long, of course, before Clippy gathers dust in some corner, replaced by the Next Thing. I imagine he'll end up in a thrift store, awaiting a new family to dazzle and confuse in equal measure.
