                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A jury convicted a former Republican political strategist on two counts of stalking Friday after prosecutors alleged that Daniel Duffey sent harassing text messages and letters to the victim and his family, the Montana Free Press reported. Duffey was political director for Greg Gianforte's 2020 gubernatorial campaign until he was fired because he allegedly repeatedly hit a parked car with his car door, causing $1600 in damages. After the game, they began a friendly texting exchange. Duffey later texted the victim, “Seriously man, that sucks. I don't know how you go from [being] all over me and sexually assaulting me to pretending like I don't even exist. Also, I do not know what your [sic] talking about with being all over you.” In another text to the victim, Duffey wrote, “[H]onestly the more you treat me like shit and make me think that this is all in my head and I'm going crazy, the crazier I am going to act. You've made very clear you don't give a f— about me and what happens to me, and now I'm going to return the favor. My only hope is that I put you in as much pain and ruin your life the way you've ruined mine.” Enclosed in the letter were photos of Duffey with well-known Republican leaders, including Vice President Mike Pence, Rudy Giuliani, and Sens. According to witness testimony, as reported by the Montana Free Press, Duffey made a fake account on Grindr, an LGBTQ dating app, using the victim's name. Duffey even texted the couple a threatening message on their wedding day: “[I]t should be pretty obvious by now, that this isn't going to end tonight when you get married, this goes on for years until I see [the victim] behind bars or paying me so much money you'll never be able to do anything nice again.” Duffey was later arrested near one of the wedding events, and according to prosecutors, law enforcement found a semiautomatic handgun in his car along with poster board and similar flyers.

It's so far outside of the realm of sociable or acceptable behavior that it is the court's genuine concern that, now that the conviction has occurred, Mr. Duffey has a tremendous incentive and, in light of the evidence submitted in this case, very little imposition of self-restraint to prevent him from engaging in similar conduct in the immediate future.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

Over four seasons of following the globe-trotting Roy family, “Succession” creator Jesse Armstrong and production designer Stephen Carter had mastered the art of finding locations that showcased the characters' extreme wealth, but also how uncomfortable and cold these spaces can be for their characters. When Armstrong was on this week's episode of the Filmmaker Toolkit Podcast, to discuss his new HBO movie “Mountainhead,” about four tech moguls' weekend getaway, he talked about how impersonal these locations can be. “They're gilded cages, or really more beige prison cells,” said Armstrong. “That wealth has this kind of international hotel feel to it. As Armstrong talked about on the podcast, the accelerated production process, going from pitch to air in less than six months, was motivated by his desire to tap into the audience's in-the-moment anxiety of the dangers of emerging AI and real-life tech moguls like Elon Musk gaining unprecedented political, cultural, and economic power. “There were a number of scary moments on this production where, given the compressed time table that we were trying to achieve, it could have fallen apart over casting, over me flunking and not coming up with a script on time, but not finding the house was one of the major ones,” said Armstrong. And in fact, I was so behind on writing the script, I had to, at a certain point, just leave the team to do it.” Executive producer Jill Footlick, cinematographer Marcel Zyskind, and Carter would continue the search without Armstrong, who acknowledged his list of requirements was significant, including the house needing to be potentially dangerous — to say more would be a spoiler. “I knew that it was almost all going [take place] in this house, and as a director, I was eager that we couldn't, as they say, ‘shoot it out,' and get bored of the location too quickly,” said Armstrong. The search took the “Mountainhead” team to British Columbia, Wyoming, and Colorado, before finding its 21,000-square foot, seven-bedroom estate, in Park City, Utah. “I think I knew that we had the right place when Marcel, who's Danish, called me up and said he'd come away from this house with just this incredibly strong feeling of depression,” said Armstrong. “It sort of had shocked him to his core, the kind of the scale of it— it's drilled down into this mountainside over seven floors with a basketball court at the bottom, but has these tremendous vistas out over Utah. It's really a character in the movie, I guess.” “When we were in Tuscany [for Season 3 of ‘Succession'], I mean, it's pretty hard to maybe to screw up a Renaissance villa,” said Armstrong.

Jerrold Nadler criticized Donald Trump and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) after officers detained a crying staff member in Nadler's district office. While protesters gathered outside an immigration courthouse, DHS officers attempted to enter Nadler's Manhattan office in the same building and accused his staff of “harboring rioters.” The incident, first reported by Gothamist, was captured on camera. In the video, which the outlet said was recorded by a person who was monitoring activity in immigration court, DHS is seen handcuffing an unidentified staff member. That is not what happened,” another staff member said off camera. In the most recent and deeply troubling incident, DHS agents forcefully entered my Congressional office and handcuffed a member of my staff,” Nadler said in a statement released Saturday. Nadler said the officers actions demonstrate “a deeply troubling disregard for proper legal boundaries.” “If this can happen in a Member of Congress's office, it can happen to anyone — and it is happening,” the New York congressman said, calling on DHS and Trump to “halt the use of these dangerous tactics.” Trump Spreads Bizarre Conspiracy Theory That Biden Was Executed and Replaced by a Robot Clone Joni Ernst Issues Non-Apology for Joke About People Dying Due to GOP Medicaid Cuts She told Gothamist that “everything resolved” but did not comment further.</p>

Originalism's influence, once confined to the nation's law schools, is now vast, reaching far beyond the Supreme Court majority's politicized rulings. In justifying Trump issuing executive orders as though they were dictatorial decrees, the theory denies innumerable vital federal agencies and institutions the slightest independence. As the “unitary executive,” Trump can threaten to place the Federal Reserve under his heel, which would likely trigger a worldwide Depression. Left unchecked, originalism can be wielded as a tool to tear apart American democracy and menace the global economy. Confusion surrounds originalism partly because it flies under many aliases, including “textualism,” “original meaning,” and “history and tradition.” Until recently, even the most influential elites in the legal establishment have had difficulty grasping the shifty, esoteric jurisprudence that has no particular historical claim to legitimacy but that now rules the federal judiciary. According to Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) this operation spent $34 million in its campaigns against President Barack Obama's choice for the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland, and to install Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh on the court. It's won victory after victory in the courts, in every domain of law — from gun rights to abortion to environmental law and beyond. So-called originalists like to pontificate with lofty pronouncements about what the Founders would have wanted — as though the Founders were unified in their vision, and as if that vision could be unequivocally divined from a vantage point 250 years later, from sparse documentary evidence by ideologues who cook the history books. The originalists claim that they are serving a truly impartial jurisprudence, merely calling “balls and strikes,” in Chief Justice John Roberts' phrase, based on a literal meaning of the Constitution. Originalists bully their way forward using distorted and outright fabricated history, figuring that no one will call them out. Joni Ernst Issues Non-Apology for Joke About People Dying Due to GOP Medicaid Cuts Trump Could Get Fox News-Style Intel Briefings Because He ‘Doesn't Read': Report The Seven Ugliest Provisions in Trump's ‘Big Beautiful Bill' Whatever its claims to historical grounding and omniscience, originalism is a comparatively new invention as an ideology. It was born as a direct political response to the Supreme Court's landmark 1954 ruling, Brown v. Board of Education, declaring segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional. Brown was an affront not just to Jim Crow southerners but to the broader conservative movement, exemplified by William F. Buckley Jr.'s then new magazine, National Review. The backlash drew from old ideas from before the Civil War in defense of slavery about states' rights, to stop the implementation of federal laws, including equal justice under the law and especially voting rights, and, more boldly, to declare those laws unconstitutional. It's a direct route from the segregationists' arguments against civil rights to Chief Justice John Roberts' ruling in 2013 eviscerating the Voting Rights Act of 1965. To undermine Brown, conservatives hit upon a slogan they dressed up as a judicial principle: “intent construct.” That was the first definition of what became originalism. As a leading pro-segregation journalist James J. Kilpatrick wrote: “In constitutional cases, the clock must always be turned back.” He was whistling “Dixie” or humming “Carry Me Back to Old Virginny.” Glossed over, of course, was the fact that “intent construct” meant that the conservatives on the bench would construct the framers' intent, sometimes out of thin air. With the seed planted against desegregation, the conservative movement — including William F. Buckley's National Review, Barry Goldwater, and Ronald Reagan — nurtured and grew the project of what would became known as originalism. The most important figure in defining originalism was Robert Bork, who as Richard Nixon's acting Attorney General tried to suppress the Watergate investigation in the notorious Saturday Night Massacre in which, on President Nixon's order, he fired the special prosecutor in 1973. Bork had proposed, two years earlier, what would become an influential outline of originalism in an article for the Yale Law Journal. He argued that judges should be able to discover what the framers “actually intended” from “text or history,” without inserting their own interpretation. Funnily enough, in Bork's originalism, the Framers always supported what the contemporary right-wing wanted at any given moment. Yet if Bork's nomination failed, the ideas he propagated had already gained momentum. (The fight over Bork's botched nomination gave birth to a new verb — “borked” — which has been used to describe every failed nomination since and marked the beginning of vicious partisan fighting over Supreme Court seats.) In 1985, President Reagan's Attorney-General Edwin Meese — soon to be disgraced in a financial scandal and forced to leave office — addressed the American Bar Association, professing that the “intended role“ of the judiciary was to serve as “bulwarks of a limited constitution.” Judges and justices, he argued, should be expected to “resist any political effort to depart from the literal provisions” of the Constitution and “press for a Jurisprudence of Original Intention.” Meese and the originalists concealed that “Original Intention” meant intention as construed by themselves, the originalists. “In framing a system which we wish to last for ages, we should not lose sight of the changes that ages will produce,” James Madison said during the Constitutional Convention. Antonin Scalia, appointed by Reagan to the Supreme Court in 1986, became originalism's most visible and vocal proponent on the court. Originalism also became the creed of the Federalist Society, an organization of conservative academics that morphed into a hugely influential elite right-wing legal and political operation, grooming hundreds of lawyers for appointment to the federal bench, a vast machinery to take over the judiciary and the law financed by the many millions of dollars gathered and administered by the reactionary theocrat Leonard Leo, who assumed control of a $1.6 billion slush fund in recent years. Although originalism was then a newly minted concept, which would have been inconceivable to the Founders, within 15 years it had managed to seize the political high ground and masquerade as history. Scalia, in a bit of originalist jiu-jitsu, flipped the 14th Amendment's “equal protection” clause to declare Bush the winner — a ruling Scalia reportedly confessed in private later was “as we say in Brooklyn, a piece of shit.” Contrary to the humbug of what originalists would have you believe, the Founders did not have a unified vision. But it's easy enough to manipulate historical sounding language into a single, clear-cut “original” meaning and then arrive at an interpretation of that meaning that justifies the desired conclusions. Intended to have a gravity not unlike fundamentalist Biblical exegesis, it more closely resembles three-card monte. Such historical distortion and falsehoods, for example, form the cornerstone of the court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the case that overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated federal protections for abortion rights. Historians quickly noted that Alito's claim was spurious: At least seven of the 28 states he claimed had completely banned all forms of abortion actually permitted them in some form. Roe finally fell in 2022, a victim of bad faith “originalist” history, and women were deprived of a basic right to reproductive freedom and health. At this point, one critic observes, “distorting the past to further his ideological agenda has become a trademark feature” of Justice Clarence Thomas. Thomas' majority decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, struck down a New York law that required persons to obtain an unrestricted license to carry a concealed firearm. Thomas dismissed these as “outliers” and placed far greater weight on how, he said, English peasants during the 1500s carried guns. Thomas' decision rested on Scalia's originalist formulation in District of Columbia v. Heller, in 2008, in which he extended the Second Amendment, applying to members of militias (today's National Guard), to an unqualified right for gun ownership for every individual. In 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, the Supreme Court showed just how far it is willing to go in ignoring the facts by fabricating the recent past as well as history. The majority ruling, written by Justice Gorsuch, held that a wedding website designer was entitled to discriminate against a gay couple because the Colorado law which prohibited her from doing so violated her First Amendment rights. Gorsuch's ruling, meanwhile rested on another assertion of false history: that religious speech has always occupied an unimpeachably privileged position in American law. With that, he stomped on the principle of the separation of church and state fervently advocated by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, and which is enshrined in the Constitution's “establishment clause” prohibiting government support for religion of any sort. Originalism has succeeded in insinuating itself into law and politics at every level. At least five of the nine Supreme Court justices explicitly espouse it, and the rest are required to engage it as legitimate legal theory. It has taken hold everywhere from the Courts of Appeal to state courts through appointments of right-wing judges. By now, any U.S. citizen engaged in civic life knows about Project 2025. The fingerprints of originalism are everywhere in this plan, which makes sense: Project 2025 aims to remake the whole of American law, politics, and social life in a radical right-wing mold. Originalism doesn't do what it claims to do, and some judges try to fight it on its own terms. Circuit recently used originalist reasoning to hold that the Trump administration's unitary executive theory is invalid — pitting originalism ironically against originalism. She wrote that “the Framers made clear that no one in our system of government was meant to be king — the President included — and not just in name only.” And yet Trump insists he can be a dictator. His originalist ideologues bestow on him vast and unchecked powers, the unitary executive. To help cut through the fog of originalist propaganda, too often taken at face value in news reporting and public debate, we established in 2023 what we call the Court of History, appealing to what is, after all, the highest court of all. We have exposed the originalist fraud, through news articles, webinars, and conferences. We have revealed the insidious use of this concocted doctrine to justify a far-right agenda. And we have unmasked the underlying theocratic movement of Christian Nationalism to leverage originalism for its cultish ambitions. It will take much more work before the curse of originalism is dispelled. Far from an abstract game of legal reasoning, originalism has real and devastating consequences. Donald Trump has become the essential implementer of their gameplan to force through Project 2025 and pack the courts with originalist judges.

Long before “I Know What You Did Last Summer” and “Godford's Park” made him a major big screen presence, Ryan Phillippe's “One Life to Live” character broke ground on television. Phillippe portrayed Billy Douglas between 1992-93, the first gay teenager depicted on daytime TV. In an interview with People, the “Cruel Intentions” star said that, among the large volume of fan mail he received during his time on the series, many came from parents writing that the character “gave [them] a way to connect with [their] LGBTQ child.” Kids, meanwhile, wrote, “I've never seen someone represent me in any entertainment before in my life.” “As that job progressed, I realized how important it was to some people,” Phillippe said. “And I was only 17 years old, so you don't really have a sense of that. Phillippe's character predated Tom Hanks' Oscar-winning performance in “Philadelphia,” radical comedies like “The Birdcage,” and Ellen's earth-shattering coming out episode on her self-titled sitcom. “I think there were some fears associated with the point in time that we were at and it being before so many walls and ceilings have been broken in that regard,” Phillippe recalled. When our show came on in his shop, it gave him some insight and understanding as to who his son was, so it opened up communication between them.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

The singer's 15-year-old son, Julian, whom he shares with his ex-wife Paula Patton, also served as a groomesman for his father's big day. In addition, Thicke paid tribute to his late father Alan Thicke with an empty chair that was decorated with a banner, per PEOPLE. “Although you cannot be here with us today, your love and light remain in our hearts.” While Thicke appeared on a April 2023 podcast of “We In Miami,” he dished on how the two became instant friends. A post shared by We In Miami Podcast (@weinmiamipodcast) We just really both love music, and we had the same influences growing up,” Thicke told the hosts. “He's just a really sweet, kind human being.” Thicke wrote “Can U Handle It?” off of Usher's 2004 album “Confessions” album and received a writing and producing credit for it. Academy Award winner Leo DiCaprio and comedian Ken Jeong were also in attendance for the nuptials, according to TMZ. Thicke and Geary first got engaged on Christmas Eve in 2018. After years of being engaged, Thicke proposed for a second time with a new ring for Geary, just days before they wed in Mexico. “Robin surprised me during our trip to Cannes by proposing to me again with a new ring that one of my best friends made,” she wrote. The couple share three children together — Mia Love, Lola Alain and Luca Patrick.</p>

These six actresses at the absolute top of their game may have recently found themselves in the zeitgeist for their dramatic work, but there was no shortage of levity when they sat down for THR's Drama Actress Roundtable. Kathy Bates (Matlock), Cristin Milioti (The Penguin and Black Mirror), Helen Mirren (1922 and Mobland), Niecy Nash-Betts (Grotesquerie), Parker Posey (The White Lotus) and Keri Russell (The Diplomat) swapped ware stories for an hour — talking about the worst advice they've gotten over the course of their careers, seeing too many “beautiful but she doesn't know it” parts in scripts and, for Bates and Posey, relishing in their recent returns to the center of attention. And my mom can feel fabulous with her friends.” ": Parker Posey, Kathy Bates, Niecy Nash-Betts Get Real on THR's Drama Actress Roundtable Bates says she was in a similar boat, frustrated by a recent string of films that either weren't seen or lost something in the edit. “Things were starting to wind down for me,” Bates said of her career before Matlock. “I just thought that maybe I ought to think about putting my house on the market and moving to France or something. A recurring theme over the hour was bad advice — some of which the women regret taking and much more of it they're glad they ignored. “There were people who were like, ‘Your fan base has known you to be a certain way, and you need to stay right there. “I was told to have a nose job in my 20s.” she recalled. Speaking of careers, Russell, an entertainment industry fixture since Felicity propelled her to fame at just 22, confessed she's still not 100 percent sold on being an actor. I still have to overcome the obstacle of being nervous, but this version of TV that we're in works for me.” Miliot, fresh off of her turn on The Penguin, said her own career prospects have changed dramatically over the last decade. “If I look back 10 years, I was often playing a version of ‘a girl of someone's dreams,'” she said. It's not a dig at any of those projects. I was auditioning to play sorority girls or a dead body in a trunk or someone who was in love with a 40-year-old and being like, ‘Have you ever tried dancing in the rain?' It should also be mentioned that Mirren also finally revealed the real reason why she so frequently mentions Kurt Cobain during interviews.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SUNDAY AM UPDATE: Saturday was kind to most movies in the top 10 and saw lifts over Friday, in particular Disney's Lilo & Stitch and Paramount's Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning which were respectively up 51% and 55%. Disney is the first studio to pass that milestone YTD. Excluding 2020, Disney has grossed $1B+ domestically for 20 consecutive years since 2005, the only studio to accomplish this. Sony is calling Karate Kid: Legends at $21M but others see it under $20M, like in the $19M range. I mean, if Sony called it at $20M given that everyone is in the high $19M range today, that's not a big deal. But nobody knows where the extra $1M+ is coming from. If you back out the $2.3M previews, Saturday was an up day for the Jackie Chan and Ralph Macchio team-up at +35%. I'm told that Karate Kid: Legends came on tracking at $35M and dropped to the mid-$20Ms before this weekend. Why wasn't there a big rush to this film? It's the Cobra Kai streaming Netflix effect, dummy. With the Karate Kid audience conditioned to stay at home, what's the big reason for them to run out and watch another fight tournament onscreen? Yes, as we said before, being in the shadow of Lilo & Stitch doesn't help given the overlap of certain demos. Families are on a budget and they're going to put their money toward the title that kids are nagging them to see (tracking does take this into consideration with kids under 12). Note that while it's under expectations, the picture will be somewhat profitable. It's an OK piece of business at a $45M net production cost, even though I'm sure Sony would have loved to see bigger numbers. Karate Kid: Legends was originally dated for June 7, 2024, before the strikes pushed it to December 13, 2024. When it came to business for this film, Sony had second thoughts and chose kids out of school for the summer over a crazy multiple over Christmas, thus moving Karate Kid: Legends back to a post-Memorial Day weekend slot. Elsewhere this weekend is A24's Bring Her Back — an excellent, original gross movie with great exits. Beyond the B+ CinemaScore, there's 80% audience on Rotten Tomatoes with a big hug from critics at 90% certified fresh. Though the movie is at the top of its forecasted range with $7M, it's a bit surprising it didn't overindex more and do a number beyond the Philippou brothers' first movie, Talk to Me ($10.4M), or at least on par. Remember that when it comes to these indie labels, it's a business of margins and slide rules in regards to P&A spend, from theatrical yield to profiting in the home windows. AMC Burbank was the pic's highest-grossing location with just under $30,000. As we said all weekend, even if the numbers for Karate Kid: Legends and Bring Her Back aren't dazzling, let's celebrate depth. All movies grossed an estimated $151M, up 130% from the same post-Memorial Day frame a year ago. I mean, Lilo & Stitch‘s second weekend at $63M reps 95% of what most movies grossed a year ago at $66M. Lilo & Stitch (Dis) 4,410 theaters, Fri $17M (-70%) Sat $25.6M Sun $20.4M 3-day $63M (-57%), Total $280.1M/Wk 2 Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning (Par) 3,861 (+4) Fri $7.5M (-70%) Sat $11.7M Sun $8.2M 3-day $27.3M (-57%), Total $122.6M/Wk 2Imax North American screens brought in $5.6M with a running cume just under $25M. Karate Kid: Legends (Sony) 3,809 theaters, Fri $7.7M, Sat $7.3M Sun $6M 3-day $21M/Wk 1 Final Destination: Bloodlines (NL) 3,134 (-389) Fri $3.2M (-43%) Sat $4.4M Sun $3.1M 3-day $10.8M (-43%), Total $111.7M/Wk 3 Sinners (WB) 2,138 (-494) theaters Fri $1.55M (-35%) Sat $2.1M Sun $1.5M 3-day $5.22M (-39%), Total $267M/Wk 7 Last Rodeo (Angel) 1995 (-210) theaters, Fri $642K Sat $876,5K Sun $620K 3-day $2.14M (-60%), Total $10.75M/Wk 2 J-Hope Tour: Hope on Stage (TRAF) 631 theaters Sat $789K Sun $150K, 2-day $939K/Wk 1 Busting into the top 10 is Trafalgar Releasing's live broadcast of the grand finale of j-hope's first solo world tour from Osaka Japan's Kyocera Dome. The concert was transmitted live to 2,700+ cinemas across 83 countries Saturday. Select encores are taking place today around the globe (64% encoring in North America, 46% worldwide). Global projection (sans Japan) for the weekend stands at $4.1M. The Accountant 2 (AMZ) 820 (-1182) theaters, Fri $214K (-56%) Sat $331K Sun $231K 3-day $776K (-62%), Total $65M/Wk 6 Movie is 77% certified fresh with critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Asteroid City, Focus Features' previous Cannes Film Festival premiere and theatrical release with Wes Anderson, had a RT critic score of 76% certified fresh and audience score of 66%. SATURDAY AM: It's a solid weekend following the Memorial Day holiday with all titles driving around $144M worth of business, +117% from the post-holiday doldrums a year ago. No, it's not the biggest for the post 4-day holiday during post pandemic times — that belongs to 2023 when Sony's all-pleasing fanboy animated movie, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse led all titles to a $205M+ marketplace. I'm sure those novelty popcorn buckets at the circuits are still flying off counters. Disney's Lilo & Stitch is still on track for a $60M-$64M second weekend, Paramount's Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning is showing that Imax makes a difference in weekend 2 with a -58% hold and $26.7M, and Sony's Karate Kid: Legends…the studio is forecasting $21M-$23M opening off a $7.5M Friday. Rivals see it lower in the high teens, however, as we said yesterday, it boils down to Saturday business and whether that tips more families into both Karate Kid, and Lilo & Stitch toward the higher end of its range. There is a bit of overlap between the two films demo wise, even though Lilo skews more female at 62% and Karate Kid: Legends more male at 59%. Their men under 25 demos are close (Legends is 22% to Lilo‘s 18%) and their women over 25 as well (Legends is 30% and Lilo 34%). Yes, of course, substantially more moms are taking kids to see Lilo. Net production cost on Karate Kid: Legends was $45M before P&A. It will be interesting to see how big overseas is. The franchise was born at a time in 1984 before studios relied on overseas. With Jackie Chan in the 2010 reboot, the foreign box office on that movie edged out domestic, $182.5M to $176.5M and that's without China, however, Japan made a great $17.4M. Men over 25 for Karate Kid were 37% and women under 25 the lowest turnout at 11%. Best grades for the crossover comes from women over 25 with 95%. Great exits though for Karate Kid: Legends with an A- CinemaScore, the same grade as the 1986 sequel, Karate Kid II. Of course, the biggest reason on Screen Engine/Comscore's PostTrak why people bought tickets to Legends is because it's part of a franchise they love (46%). Also interesting to note that of all the moviegoers going to see Karate Kid: Legends, 68% of them said they have Netflix as their leading streaming service. A24's Bring Her Back after a $3.1M Friday is looking at $7M-$8M in 5th place. For horror films, especially an A24 one, which typically divides audiences, the movie, wow, landed a B+ CinemaScore. Hopefully that all works in the film's favor throughout this weekend and leg-wise. Most influential forms of advertisement for Bring Her Back was social media at 21% per those polled by PostTrak which isn't surprising as it's an A24 movie, and that's where they focus most of their P&A spend. Positive word of mouth that RelishMix spotted included fans of the Philippou's Talk to Me, as well as excitement over their trailer, some horror fans remarking that the movie looks like a throwback to 1989's Pet Sematary. RELATED: ‘Bring Her Back' Review: Sally Hawkins Gaslights Kids & Channels Grief Into Terror In The Philippous' Trauma-Soaked Sophomore Feature A24 financed the movie for around $20M I hear, with foreign rights sold going to Sony for around $13M, I understand. Also, as expected, Focus Features' Wes Anderson movie, The Phoenician Scheme, is heading toward the best theater average of 2025 year to date with $95K from six NYC and LA theaters. Not as high as the director's Asteroid City two years ago ($142,2K), but robust enough for the specialty sector post pandemic which is desperate for dollars. The Angelika in NY led all theaters with $78K yesterday where they had a premium $62 ticket that included an “Immersive Experience” and popcorn. RELATED: Everything We Know About ‘The Phoenician Scheme' So Far The Phoenician Scheme (Foc) 6 theaters, Fri $270K, 3-day $570K, PTA $95K, Wk 1 FRIDAY AFTERNOON: Disney's Lilo & Stitch is coming in right where we were seeing it — at $60M in weekend 2, -59%, at 4,410 locations. That hold is similar to that of the second weekend of Little Mermaid, which was also a Memorial Day theatrical release. Today looks like $17M for Lilo‘s second Friday, -70%. Running total for the Dean Fleischer Camp directed movie by Sunday is $277M. However, Sony's Karate Kid: Legends is looking lighter than forecasts with a $20M opening after a $7M-$8M Friday that includes previews in 3,809 theaters. That would put the Ralph Macchio and Jackie Chan team-up in third place behind Paramount's second weekend of Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning, with a $7.7M second Friday and $27.3M second weekend, -57% at 3,861. That's better than Dead Reckoning‘s second weekend decline of -65% sans Imax screens. Running total for the Christopher McQuarrie directed, Tom Cruise title by Sunday looks like $122.6M. The anticipation is that Saturday will work in both Lilo and Karate Kid: Legends‘ favor. Fourth is New Line's Final Destination: Bloodlines with $2.8M today at 3,134 and a third weekend of $10M, -48%, for a running total by Sunday of $110.9M. Fifth is A24's Bring Her Back with $3M today (including previews), and $6M-$7M for the weekend at 2,409 sites. Even if Karate Kid: Legends comes in less than expected, we are in far better shape than a year ago when the post Memorial Day weekend only did $66M per Box Office Mojo (there weren't any major studio releases and Garfield Movie led with a second weekend take of $14M). PREVIOUS FRIDAY AM: Sony's Karate Kid: Legends grossed $2.3M from previews that began at 2 p.m. Thursday. The PG-13 movie is a vortex of old school and new school: Ralph Macchio's Daniel-san, Jackie Chan's Mr. Han and, shhhhh, the Cobra Kai gang (I mean, is it really a secret?). Forecast for the movie is $25M-$30M in a marketplace where Disney's Lilo & Stitch is overpowering with a potential $60M second frame. Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning also is hoping to hold with those Imax screens, around $32M or less. Critics like this Karate Kid a little less than the 2010 Chan one, 55% Rotten vs. 67% fresh. Karate Kid: Legends was made for $45M net before P&A; that's $5M more than the 2010 version cost (unadjusted for inflation). A24's Danny and Michael Philippou horror movie Bring Her Back made $850K in previews at 2,409 theaters that began at 4 p.m. Thursday. That figure is just under A24's fall sleeper Heretic, which made $1.2M in previews starting at 7 p.m. before turning into a $4.3M Friday and $10.8M opening. A good definite-recommend from the fanboy crowd last night for Bring Her Back at 58%, with women over 25 giving the movie its best positive score at 83%. The Thursday crowd was male-heavy at 57% to female's 43%. Women overall enjoyed it more than the guys, 83% to 77%. On Rotten Tomatoes, Bring Her Back has been stamped with 88% certified fresh. Lilo & Stitch ends its first week with $217M at 4,410 theaters, after $9.2M yesterday, -9% from Wednesday. The pic's first week is 15% behind that the $255M for  Inside Out 2, which ended its run at $652.9M, and it's 9% behind Moana 2‘s first seven days of $239.3M (final $460.4M). No, we're not saying the movie is doing badly, we're just trying to give you an idea of where Lilo & Stitch lives. While no one is forecasting this for Lilo & Stitch, sometimes these fan-fave Disney movies can go into overdrive, i.e. Inside Out 2 owns the best second weekend ever for a PG movie of $101.2M. Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning ends its first week with an estimated $95.3M at 3,857, which is 7% ahead of the first week of 2018's Mission: Impossible – Fallout ($220.1M final domestic) and 4.7% ahead of the first seven days of 2022's Dead Reckoning (final domestic B.O.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Netflix brought out Gaga to perform at the streamer's L.A. fan event Saturday (May 31). Netflix has confirmed Lady Gaga will appear in season two of Wednesday, the hit series starring Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Addams. Gaga will be “playing the mysterious and enigmatic Rosaline Rotwood, a legendary Nevermore teacher who crosses paths with Wednesday,” according to a company release on Netflix.com. Gaga marked the occasion by making an appearance herself, taking the stage for a Wednesday-themed set that had her “emerging from a coffin” while “backed by a cadre of Addams Family-esque dancers,” reports THR. The pop star performed Mayhem tracks “Zombieboy” and “Abracadabra” before returning to her coffin. Wednesday is the latest acting credit for the singer, who led the films Joker: Folie à Deux, A Star Is Born and House of Gucci, and was in two seasons of FX's American Horror Story. Though Gaga's Rosaline Rotwood isn't seen, a six-minute preview for season two of Wednesday arrived Saturday night, giving fans of the show a glimpse at how Wednesday Addams (Ortega) spent her summer: locked in a serial killer's (Haley Joel Osment) basement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"I don't think I'll put myself in a position that I add this much pressure to myself again," the artist said in a video published by The New York Times. Next year things might look a bit different for Miley Cyrus, who says in a conversation with The New York Times that she's looking forward to a “rebirth of how I look at my career.” When asked about her relationship with mainstream success, Cyrus, who just released her ninth studio album, Something Beautiful, spoke of what she sees next for herself as an artist. “I think it's winding down, my attachment to mainstream success,” Cyrus said in the video interview, published on Saturday, May 31. The singer announced Something Beautiful in March, when she gave fans a first listen to album track “Prelude” and the set's title track. She's since released two more singles, “End of the World” and “More to Lose,” and just before the album's release held a private concert hosted by TikTok at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. Still to come is a visual component to the project, a film set to show in theaters for one night only on June 12 in the United States and Canada, and internationally on June 27. Cyrus — whose previous full-length release, 2023's Endless Summer Vacation, reached No. There's a song on the album called ‘Reborn' and it's kind of about this. Among the many topics discussed with candor: her present-day relationship with each parent (Tish and Billy Ray Cyrus), whether she's interested in being a parent one day, what happened when she did E.M.D.R. therapy, growing up as a child star and why finally winning her first Grammy (for “Flowers,” in 2024) was so significant, and — when interviewer Lulu Garcia-Navarro brought up Cyrus' peers in the industry — her rapport with other female pop stars. “I find the relationship between female pop stars to be really interesting and often very fraught,” Garcia-Navarro suggested, to which Cyrus joked: “Divas.” “I mean, probably on my end,” the singer said, and then clarified, “I don't mind the word diva. The interviewer followed up by prompting, “You have said you don't feel part of the cohort of singers of your generation and age group … You've held yourself apart in a certain way.” She asked Cyrus why. “I don't think it's so much of a conscious choice,” Cyrus said. “I think for me, my persona — the public's idea of me — is ‘on,' in some way, but in my own time, I'm very off. I like no makeup, my hair up messy. I'm sure girls in my community are going like, ‘Well, that's me too and you haven't reached out.' “Maybe it's something subconsciously from the show, like from Hannah Montana where I think my famous person has one life and then as a regular person I have another life,” she explained. “I think maybe subconsciously it programmed me — not even joking — to think who I am at home and who I am as a performer are kind of like two separate identities, and actually they are.” I know what it feels like to fry yourself, and I don't want anyone else to get fried. I think they're all unique and are very found,” Cyrus said. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Disney's blockbuster 'Lilo & Stitch' earns a huge $63 million domestically in its second weekend for a jaw-dropping global haul of $610 million, while Tom Cruise's final 'M:I' movie also continues to impress. While its fate isn't yet sealed, Karate Kid: Legends opened behind expectations at the domestic box office, despite teaming original star Ralph Macchio and beloved action legend Jackie Chan, who starred in the 2010 redux. Sony is estimating a third-place North American opening of $21 million from 3,809 theaters for the male-fueled film (rival studios show it coming in closer to $20 million). 'Karate Kid: Legends' Director Jonathan Entwistle on Navigating 'Cobra Kai' and the Test Screening-Inspired Epilogue Ralph Macchio Insisted That 'Karate Kid: Legends' Delay Its Release Until After 'Cobra Kai' Regardless of a soft opening, Sony remains confident that the PG-13 film will sport strong chops, thanks to an A- CinemaScore and solid exits. And its net production budget was a modest $45 million before marketing. Critics are far more divided than audiences when it comes to Karate Kid: Legends, which features Ben Wang in the titular role. His character is mentored by both the characters played by Macchio, star of the classic 1984 movie and, far more recently, Netflix's acclaimed Cobra Kai series, which ran for six seasons and ended earlier this year. Box office pundits are already speculating that franchise fans may have been sated by Cobra Kai, at least for the time being. They add that middling reviews for Legends certainly aren't helping. Both movies continued to do strong business in their second outings after fueling a record Memorial Day weekend. Ditto for North America, where it has now passed up Ryan Coogler's sleeper hit Sinners ($350.1 million). Paramount and Skydance's Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning, starring Tom Cruise in his final turn as uber spy Ethan Hunt, remained squarely in second place with an estimated sophomore outing of $27.2 million from 3,861 theaters for a 10-day North American tally of $122 million. Final Reckoning is benefiting greatly from its exclusive Imax run. M:I has always done big business in China, and Final Reckoning is no exception, even if returns from the Chinese box office are far less than what they used to be. Danny and Michael Philippou's highly anticipated horror pic Bring Her Back, from A24 and starring Sally Hawkins, rounded out the top five with an estimated $7.1 million from 2,449 cinemas. The critically acclaimed film was graced with a B+ CinemaScore from audiences, which is like an A when it comes to the horror genre. Overseas, where Sony is assisting in releasing, it earned $1 million from its first eight markets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The news was announced at Netflix's Tudum fan event at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles Saturday, with stars Finn Wolfhard, Caleb McLaughlin and Noah Schnapp running through some look-back clips before revealing the dates for season five via a teaser (watch it below). Adam Sandler Swings Away in Full 'Happy Gilmore 2' Trailer -- With  One Classic Throwback Line 'One Piece' Introduces Key Character -- and the Actress Behind It Back in January, Ross Duffer said about the final episodes, “We spent a full year filming this season. By the end, we'd captured over 650 hours of footage. So, needless to say, this is our biggest and most ambitious season yet. Matt Duffer added, “At the same time, we think it's our most personal story. We've been making this show together for almost 10 years. “I'm sure we will do a time jump,” Ross told TVLine. So these are all discussions we're going to have with our writers when we start the room up.” Netflix has confirmed that the show would jump a little over a year to the fall of 1987, after season four took place in March 1986. “There are more Stranger Things stories to tell and in the works,” Matt said. “It's a bit early at this point to talk about them, but we're deeply involved in every one — it's very important to us that anything with the Stranger Things name on it is of the highest quality and not repetitive — that it has a reason to exist and always blazes its own path. Stranger Things stars Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Noah Schnapp, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Priah Ferguson, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Maya Hawke, Joe Keery, David Harbour, Winona Ryder and Brett Gelman.
