READ MORE: Piastri leads McLaren 1-2 from Norris in Spanish GP amid late-race drama for Verstappen and Russell Horner added: “I haven't had a chance to speak to Max from his side, but obviously the stewards deemed that he caused a collision and got 10 seconds and some penalty points, unfortunately. READ MORE: Piastri ‘proud' to bounce back with victory in Spain as he hails ‘weekend I've been looking for' Speaking in his post-race media session, with Russell winding up in fourth position, Wolff commented: “I just heard, actually, that Max had the call to let him pass, right? But the thing is, I don't know what he aimed for. But again, I don't know exactly what the motivations were, and I don't want to jump on it and saying, you know, this was road rage, et cetera. Pushed more on Verstappen's racecraft and approach, Wolff said: “You know, there's a pattern that I've read, the great ones, whether it's in motor racing or in other sports, you just need to have the world against you and perform at the highest possible level. “So, we haven't seen any of these moments with Max for many years now.
