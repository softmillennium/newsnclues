                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Spanish star beat Shelton in four sets, winning 7-6 6-3 4-6 6-4 at Roland Garros. That victory put the defending champion through to a quarter-final against another American, Tommy Paul. Shelton has not yet won a Grand Slam tournament but the 22-year-old still tested Alcaraz. Alcaraz did get himself to a break point in the seventh game but Shelton warded off the threat. With one point separating them, it was then Alcaraz who miscued the ball. Get Sky Sports or stream with NOW But then he couldn't return an Alcaraz serve and netted within a rally. The Spaniard squeezed him out 10-8 and then, in another decisive moment, managed to hold serve despite huge pressure from Shelton in the first game of the second set. Shelton secured six break points in that game, but Alcaraz conspired to defend them all. It was Alcaraz who went on to break Shelton's serve and win the second set 6-3. Alcaraz picked up two break points and, with Shelton striking the ball a fraction too far in a rally, Alcaraz pulled back that advantage. Shelton cannoned an ace past Alcaraz to stave off a break point in ninth game. A wayward forehand squandered the advantage point. He got through eventually, holding serve under pressure. He then snatched the third set away from Alcaraz with a timely break. But on the second, another huge forehand from Shelton saw Alcaraz over-hit to give up a break and the set. From 0-30 down Alcaraz found three quality points and then Shelton handed him the winner. The Spaniard got a match point against Shelton's serve, wearing the American down in a rally. Shelton clawed the game back to deuce though and blazed a mammoth ace through. They traded drop shots though before Alcaraz lobbed him to win a brilliant point. Shelton however took the advantage point once again and won through to force his opponent to serve for the match. A fantastic rally eventually brought Shelton up the court and he put too much on his backhand. That saw Alcaraz take a 30-0 lead in the game. "I tried to calm myself in those moments when I was down and tried to get going," Alcaraz said afterwards. "We stayed there in the whole match. "I think we both have huge respect for each other."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz reaches last eight by beating Ben Shelton After another sad second serve rebounded off the top of the net and floated out on a break point, Iga Swiatek turned to her support team and frantically gestured her rage. As Elena Rybakina bulldozed through the early stages of their highly anticipated fourth-round tussle, Swiatek trailed 6-1, 2-0 and her hopes of victory were fading. Five years since her first French Open title, Swiatek's era of dominance at Roland Garros now stands at 25 consecutive victories, the longest winning run here among female players in the 21st century. This win could have a transformative effect on the Pole's confidence as she tries to shake off her difficult run of form and recover self‑belief, in her attempt to become the first woman in history to win the French Open singles title four times in a row. “I think I needed that kind of win to feel these feelings that I'm able to win under pressure, and even if it's not going the right way, still turn the match around to win it,” Swiatek said. I for sure wanted to have a match like that. Obviously it's great to also have full control over the match, but against great players it's not always going to be possible. Although she avoided a fourth‑round meeting with her nemesis Jelena Ostapenko, who holds a 6-0 record against the five‑time grand slam title winner, Swiatek still found herself up against one of her toughest rivals. Rybakina's own recent struggles are reflected in her seeding of No 12. With her precise, destructive serve and the effortless power she generates with her groundstrokes, Rybakina's game also matches up extremely well against Swiatek's. The Kazakhstani played flawless attacking tennis for 45 minutes as she established a set and break lead: “In the first set it felt like I was playing Jannik Sinner,” Swiatek said. Despite her high-profile difficulties this year, Swiatek has still been more consistent than the vast majority of the tour this year. Her problems have arisen usually against the best players. This time, she continued to think clearly under pressure. After working through numerous tight games early on, Swiatek established greater momentum and forced a third set. In a tense final set that followed, there were numerous tight moments. Swiatek saved three break points at 2-3 then, after finally breaking serve to lead 4-3, she handed the momentum back with another double fault. Swiatek will next face the 13th seed, Elina Svitolina, who produced a brilliant comeback victory herself on a spectacular day in the women's draw. Despite facing three match points, Svitolina recovered to defeat Jasmine Paolini – the fourth seed, and runner‑up last year – to reach her fifth quarter‑final in Paris.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PARIS (AP) — Carlos Alcaraz called himself for breaking the rules at the French Open and conceded a point to Ben Shelton on Sunday during the defending champion's 7-6 (8), 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 victory in the fourth round. Early in the second set, Shelton whipped a passing shot well out of Alcaraz's reach up at the net. But he immediately went over to the chair umpire to admit that he wasn't holding his racket when it touched the ball. That's not allowed, so the point went to Shelton, an American seeded 13th. When the official informed the Court Philippe-Chatrier crowd what had happened, Alcaraz was given a round of applause. This all happened at what could have been a critical moment, because instead of leading 40-30 on his serve, Alcaraz was now down 30-40, giving Shelton his first break point of the match. But Alcaraz saved that one — and five others in that 20-point game — along the way to taking a two-set lead in an entertaining matchup between a pair of 22-year-olds who hit the ball hard. Alcaraz, already a four-time Grand Slam champion, showed off various parts of his repertoire. It was tighter than the score might indicate: Shelton held three opportunities to own the opening set, leading in the tiebreaker at 6-4, 6-5 and 7-6. Take any of the subsequent points, and Shelton would own that set. Shelton netted a backhand on the next. And the last ended with Shelton smacking a backhand right at the body of Alcaraz, who was up at the net and contorted himself in order to chop a drop volley winner. The fourth swung Alcaraz's way when he used a drop shot winner to set up a break point that he claimed for a 2-1 edge and, after a total of 3 hours, 19 minutes, he was able to finish off an 11th consecutive win at Roland-Garros.</p>

Shelton scrambled and fired a powerful crosscourt forehand, forcing Alcaraz to stretch fully for the reply. The Spaniard managed to make contact and appeared to hit a clean volley winner.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The American earned battling five-set wins against Marton Fucsovics and Karen Khachanov earlier this week but found the going easier against Alexei Popyrin, dispatching the Australian 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 in one hour and 52 minutes. "I'm enjoying it a lot," Paul said when asked about competing on clay. "It was nice to get a straight-sets win today, give the body a little rest. I am just excited for more matches." The 28-year-old is just the ninth American man in the Open Era and only active American to advance to Grand Slam quarter-finals on all three surfaces. He joins Andre Agassi, Michael Chang, Jimmy Connors, Jim Courier, Vitas Gerulaitis, Brian Gottfried, John McEnroe and Pete Sampras. Aiming to reach the last four in Paris, the 12th seed will next face defending champion Carlos Alcaraz or countryman Ben Shelton. Paul trails Alcaraz 2-4 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series and is tied at 2-2 with Shelton. Paul saved 90 per cent (9/10) of the break points he faced against Popyrin, stuck 27 winners to the Australian's 18 and committed 15 fewer unforced errors (22-37) than the World No. Paul is now 12-3 on clay this season, having reached the semi-finals at the ATP Masters 1000 in Rome last month. The four-time tour-level titlist is currently No. 8 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. The 25-year-old is up four spots to No. Paul is the first American man to reach the quarter-finals at Roland Garros since Agassi in 2003.

As soon as the Washington D.C. native stepped onto Court 14, she was swiftly pulled aside by chair umpire Aline Rocha of Brazil, who informed her that her all-black Nike outfit violated tournament regulations.The issue? Baptiste ran afoul of the ITF's Grand Slam rules, which state that logos are "not to exceed two (2) square inches. “I've already played three matches here with the same headband… Yeah, I was surprised,” Baptiste explained to Rocha as she argued her case.“We tried to cover it with a marker, but the material won't let it stay on… For my next match, I will get a new one with a smaller logo. Baptiste quickly turned it inside out, and was finally cleared to play. “We tried to cover it with a marker, but the material won't let it stay on… For my next match, I will get a new one with a smaller logo.

Baptiste quickly turned it inside out, and was finally cleared to play. According to the ITF's 2025 Official Grand Slam Rulebook, sponsor logos on players' attire have to be ‘minimal' in size: “One (1) manufacturer's identification not to exceed two (2) square inches (13 sq.cm) shall be permitted.” (Article III, Section C: Dress and Equipment, Sub-Section 2e: Hat, Headband, Wristband or Masks)At the Australian Open earlier this year, Baptiste wore a regulation headband during her first-round appearance. She then returned to her signature oversized look for WTA events, where logo restrictions are more relaxed. She sported the same exact black Nike headband in Madrid and Rome—but will now have to switch things up when she returns to face No. At the Australian Open earlier this year, Baptiste wore a regulation headband during her first-round appearance.

Rising star Carlos Alcaraz and several other players have been vocal about the demanding calendar, expressing concerns over the lack of breaks and the toll it takes on their physical and mental well-being. Last year, Alcaraz issued a stark warning, cautioning that the jam-packed schedule could ultimately “kill” players. For many players, prize money from tournaments serves as their sole income, leaving them with no option but to continue without respite. Speculation is rife about the logistics and repercussions of altering the tournament schedule, with talks of introducing a new major event in early January. The current structure of tennis, where players are only paid based on their tournament participation and performance, stands in stark contrast to other professional sports leagues that offer guaranteed contracts. This lack of financial security adds to the pressure on players to compete regularly, even at the cost of their well-being. Top players, while enjoying lucrative endorsement deals, are often bound by strict obligations to maintain their rankings and tournament appearances to secure their earnings. American tennis sensation Tommy Paul has etched his name in history by securing a spot in his first-ever Roland Garros quarter-final. In a stunning display of talent and skill, Jack Draper has left the tennis world in awe with his remarkable performance at Roland Garros.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tim Henman believes another Roland Garros title may be beyond Novak Djokovic in Paris next weekend – but he is convinced the Serbian legend can make another challenge to win a record-equalling eighth Wimbledon title. Djokovic is chasing a 25th Grand Slam singles title, as he looks to move ahead of Margaret Court and become the player with the most major titles in their collection. Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have shared the last five Grand Slam titles between them, with Djokovic's last major title coming at the 2023 US Open. He insists he is a contender to lift major title No 25 in Paris, but Henman suggests Djokovic's chance to complete his last great tennis dream at Wimbledon, with the grass court Grand Slam getting underway on the last day of June. Novak Djokovic makes ‘not getting much sleep' comment after French Open night session win World No 1 slams Novak Djokovic treatment and makes a big plea to his doubters “He wasn't my favourite to win coming into this event, but he was on my list as a potential winner if things went his way. “Sinner and Alcaraz have separated themselves from the rest at the moment, but Djokovic is in that next batch of half of dozen that could cause a surprise and win. “He had no clay court form ahead of that tournament in Geneva. He goes to play that tournament a week before a Slam and at his age, you look at that and question if he will be struggling for energy playing extra matches. He will now face Britain's Cameron Norrie in the next round and will be confident of getting through to the quarter-finals, where he might face No 3 seed Alexander Zverev.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Several players, including Carlos Alcaraz, have complained that they do not get enough of a break from the energy-sapping circuit. 2 Alcaraz warned bosses that they would ‘kill' players due to an ever-increasing schedule. Players compete all year round and many are often only paid if they enter competitions, with prize money their only source of income. That means they rarely get a break. You can check out at any time. To deal with the growing discontent, McEnroe says he has heard “rumblings” that the Australian Open could be pushed back by a month to February. Brother and seven-time Grand Slam champion John McEnroe said on TNT Sports: “If they moved the Australian to later, that would give more time, but they don't want to give that up. Patrick responded: “I'm hearing rumblings that it could move to February.” John said that would be “helpful”, and Patrick continued: “Of course, there'd probably be another big tournament put in in early January, that's part of potentially the plan. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. “It's pretty typical of all sports like in the NBA you see players taking nights off under contract. Top players have big endorsement deals but even those normally have stipulations that the players have to play certain events or be ranked at a certain spot to collect the money.” Speaking last September, the Spaniard said: “As I said many times, you know, the calendar is so tight, a lot of tournaments, no days off or not as much days off as I want. So, I mean, probably they are going to kill us in some way.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although we are currently mid-way through an enthralling French Open, for some, attention has already moved on down the tennis calendar. However, that is with good reason, as they are plotting something which could revolutionise one area of the sport that has been left dormant for far too long. After all, it's not a controversial opinion to state that singles tennis commands the bulk of attention not just from the tennis community, but from casual viewers too. It has the biggest names and the biggest prizes, with stars like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner likely already household names despite their youth. And they are following on from the success paved by the Big Four, with Roger Federer, Andy Murray, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic having all helped shine a light on a sport that has arguably fallen behind commercially in recent years. Still a few months away, but US Open is very, very excited about what they're cooking with their newfangled mixed doubles event.Player buy-in from singles stars has been *huge*: I've heard that 9 of WTA Top 10 are currently planning to play, as well as 10 of the ATP Top 10. That's without mentioning the women's game too, which reached new heights thanks to stars like Serena and Venus Williams, to name just two. With their Netflix documentary, Break Point, there was widespread scrutiny over their failure to promote the sport like Formula 1 did with Drive to Survive. It should surprise no one that the US Open, which builds its entire model around generating as much revenue as possible, are the trailblazer in this regard. To have already had such support from those major players is key, and it will be interesting to see how it pans out this September.</p>
