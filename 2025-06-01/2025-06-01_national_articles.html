David McCormick, R-Pa., discusses the Russia-Ukraine war, President Donald Trump's tariff policies and the Gaza humanitarian crisis on ‘Fox News Sunday.' Ukrainian forces destroyed dozens of Russian warplanes with a drone attack on air bases deep within Russian territory on Sunday. Ukrainian forces destroyed 40 aircraft in the attack, which an official says took more than a year to orchestrate. Russia's defense ministry confirmed the attack on Sunday, saying it struck five airfields. The operation saw drones transported in containers carried by trucks deep into Russian territory, he said. The drones reportedly hit 41 planes stationed at several airfields on Sunday afternoon, including A-50, Tu-95 and Tu-22M aircraft, the official said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy oversaw the drone strike inside Russia, sources say. The White House told Fox News that President Donald Trump and his administration were not warned of the attack ahead of time. Ukraine says President Volodymyr Zelenskyy personally oversaw the drone attack. President Donald Trump was not notified ahead of Sunday's drone strike, the White House says. The strike comes just a day before Ukrainian and Russian officials are set to meet for a second round of ceasefire talks in Istanbul, Turkey. A series of explosions also struck bridges in Russia near Ukraine's border on Saturday, though Ukraine has not taken responsibility for the attacks. Ukrainian soldiers from the 115th Brigade Mortar Unit conduct mortar training, as members of the Anti-UAV unit test an FPV drone inhibitor in Lyman, Ukraine. A highway bridge over a railway in the Bryansk region was blown up at 10:50 pm (1950 GMT) on Saturday night just as a passenger train carrying 388 passengers to Moscow was passing underneath, Russian investigators said. Just four hours later, a railway bridge over a highway was blown up in the neighboring Kursk region, showering the road with parts of a freight train, the investigators said.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C thumb up during a news event at the US embassy to France, Sunday, June 1, 2025 in Paris. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., right, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., left, speak during a press conference in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Friday, May 30, 2025. PARIS (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin is stalling at the peace table while preparing a new military offensive in Ukraine, two senior U.S. senators warned Sunday, arguing that the next two weeks could shape the future of a war that has already smashed cities, displaced millions and redrawn Europe's security map. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal spoke to The Associated Press in Paris after meeting President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and touring neighborhoods shattered by what they called the worst Russian bombardments since the full-scale invasion began. A sweeping U.S. sanctions bill could be the West's last chance to choke off the Kremlin's war economy, they said — adding that they hope their firsthand findings will shift momentum in Washington and help bring a skeptical President Donald Trump on board. “What I learned on this trip was he's preparing for more war,” Graham said of Putin. Blumenthal called the sanctions proposed in legislation “bone-crushing” and said it would place Russia's economy “on a trade island.” At the heart of their push is a bipartisan sanctions bill, backed by nearly the entire U.S. Senate but still facing uncertain odds in Washington. It would impose 500% tariffs on countries that continue buying Russian oil, gas, uranium and other exports — targeting nations like China and India that account for roughly 70% of Russia's energy trade and bankroll much of its war effort. “The world has a lot of cards to play against Putin,” he said. “We're going to hit China and India for propping up his war machine.” With peace talks yielding little and Trump's approach to Ukraine highly uncertain, Graham and Blumenthal have stepped into the breach — blunt emissaries on a lonely mission. Political opposites moving in lockstep, they're crossing Europe, and the aisle, with the moral urgency of two men trying to forestall another Russian offensive before it's too late. Peace talks are scheduled to resume Monday in Istanbul. Trump has yet to endorse the sanctions bill, telling reporters Friday: “I don't know. I'll have to see it.” Graham said the legislation was drafted in consultation with Trump's advisers. Graham backed the president's diplomatic instincts but said, “By trying to engage Putin — by being friendly and enticing — it's become painfully clear he's not interested in ending this war.” Graham pointed to what Ukrainian officials and Yale researchers estimate are nearly 20,000 children forcibly deported to Russia — calling their return a matter of justice, not diplomacy. Blumenthal described standing at mass grave sites in Bucha, where civilians were executed with shots to the head. Both said that failing to act now could pull the U.S. deeper into conflict later. If Putin isn't stopped in Ukraine, Blumenthal said, NATO treaty obligations could one day compel American troops into battle. After a one-hour meeting with Macron in Paris, both Graham, of South Carolina, and Blumenthal, of Connecticut, said they left convinced Europe was ready to toughen its stance. “There are very few causes that will take 41 Republicans and 41 Democrats and put them on record on a single piece of legislation,” he said. Ahead, Ukrainian military leaders are set to brief Congress and a sanctions vote could follow. “There will be more evidence of that from Russia on Monday.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meanwhile, a legal battle is unfolding over Trump's use of emergency powers to implement tariffs. • “Big, beautiful bill”: Senate Republicans will work this week on their version of the massive spending and tax cuts package advancing Trump's domestic policy agenda. • Foreign policy frustrations: Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff slammed Hamas' response to a US-backed ceasefire proposal for Gaza yesterday, and skepticism surrounds the latest round of Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul tomorrow. The Congressional Budget Office last month projected that House Republicans' changes to Medicaid, including work requirements for some recipients, would leave 7.6 million Americans uninsured by 2034. It is just an attempt to enrich Donald Trump's billionaire class, all his Mar-a-Lago friends, his corporate friends, at the expense of ordinary Americans. Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia criticized the work reporting requirements as an attack on the working class and said a similar program already failed in his home state. Here's why: Conservative senators like Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Rand Paul of Kentucky say the bill would increase deficits and does not contain enough spending cuts. “I would be very surprised if the bill, at least, is not modified in a good direction,” he said on CBS' “Face the Nation.” The Joint Committee on Taxation has since increased that estimate to $3.94 trillion. “Every single time when they project economic growth, they always underestimate the growth that will be brought about by tax cuts and reduction in regulations,” he said this morning. White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended President Donald Trump's recent doubling of steel tariffs to 50%, framing the measure as a critical step to ensuring the United States is prepared in the event of war. “Chinese steel production is something like double the global capacity,” Hassett said during an interview on ABC's “This Week.” The top White House economic adviser added a stark warning: “If we have cannons, but not cannonballs, then we can't fight a war.” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused the Trump administration of trying to intimidate Democrats as confrontations with federal officials have escalated in recent weeks. Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler made the same allegation after he said Department of Homeland Security officials entered his congressional office without a warrant Wednesday and handcuffed a member of his staff. The Justice Department also recently charged New Jersey Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver in connection with a tense and chaotic confrontation outside an ICE detention facility in Newark. It's unfortunate that our Republican colleagues continue to be nothing more than rubber stamps for Trump's reckless and extreme agenda,” the minority leader added. Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought distanced himself from suggestions that he is implementing elements of Project 2025, a sweeping conservative policy blueprint he helped craft, into the Trump administration's agenda. Pressed by CNN's Dana Bash this morning on whether he is enacting elements of the controversial document — which includes proposals like eliminating the Federal Reserve and banning medication abortion — Vought was quick to respond, “Of course not.” Some background: Democrats used Project 2025 as a major line of attack against Trump on the 2024 campaign trail. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping plan to speak “very soon,” but declined to set a date for the long-awaited, high-stakes conversation between the leaders as Trump and other top US officials appear to escalate tensions with Beijing. Trump has accused China of violating a trade agreement made weeks ago in Geneva. Bessent declined to say what consequences China would face but expressed optimism about the forthcoming call. Asked when that call would take place, he declined to set a specific date, saying, “I believe we will see something very soon.” Asked whether he or other Cabinet officials have spoken with their Chinese counterparts, Bessent deferred to the president, saying, “We're going to let the two principals have a conversation, and then everything will stem from that.” “The two of them will talk about the Geneva agreement, which we were all very favorably inclined towards, thinking this is a huge step forward,” Hassett said. Vought argued that critics, including Musk, are relying on flawed analyses rooted in the Congressional Budget Office's “artificial baseline,” which, he said, fails to account for the likely extension of key tax provisions from the 2017 tax law. The Joint Committee on Taxation has since increased that estimate to $3.94 trillion. Vought insisted that while the bill contains some new spending, primarily for border security and defense, it represents a net deficit reduction, not an expansion. Bessent defends the bill: Trump's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also sought to shore up support for the spending and tax cuts package in a TV news appearance this morning. “The United States of America is never going to default. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick emphasized today that President Donald Trump's 90-day pause for tariff negotiations is a hard deadline — and vowed that despite a federal court ruling earlier this week, tariffs “are not going away.” “I don't see today that an extension is coming. If they can't get a deal done, President Trump is going to determine what deal is going to be,” Lutnick said during an appearance on “Fox News Sunday with Shannon Bream.” Lutnick also weighed in on a Wednesday court ruling barring Trump's global tariffs. And after Trump threatened to reignite a trade war with the European Union last week, Lutnick suggested talks are back on track. “I think it cost us a week, maybe,” the commerce secretary said. President Donald Trump is urging the Senate to retain provisions from conservative hardliners in his expansive domestic policy bill. Hopefully, the Senate will be there with you!” Trump wrote on Truth Social yesterday, accompanied by a photo of a post outlining the House Freedom Caucus provisions added to his “big, beautiful bill.” House Republicans narrowly passed the president's sweeping tax and spending cuts package last week after staving off a rebellion by the Freedom Caucus. The hardline caucus secured additional adjustments to Medicaid and the repealing of former President Joe Biden's clean energy tax credits, among other provisions. Key promise: Later on Saturday, Trump returned to social media to spotlight a key tax cut promise from his campaign that was left out of the sweeping policy bill: no taxes on Social Security. Trump repeatedly pledged to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits while campaigning, but the House GOP-passed policy bill does not include any such provision. Instead, senior citizens would receive a $4,000 increase to their standard deduction from 2025 through 2028 under the bill. This measure is aimed at fulfilling Trump's promise, since lawmakers cannot include a more direct Social Security tax cut under the rules of budget reconciliation, which Republicans are using to advance the package without Democratic support in the Senate. The bill does fulfill Trump's campaign promises to cut taxes on tips and overtime, albeit temporarily. President Donald Trump made the latest move in his ever-evolving trade war Friday, announcing at a Pennsylvania steel plant that he plans to double tariffs on the alloy. If you're trying to make sense of last week's tariff news, start here: Trump said he was considering a 40% tariff, but industry executives told him to go even higher. More tariffs may give the moribund US steel business a much-needed boost, but they could also raise prices on a key component for construction companies and manufacturers. • Tough talk for China: The steel announcement came on the same day Trump vented frustration online about trade terms with China, claiming in a Truth Social post that China “HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,” and implying he would no longer play “Mr. Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, told reporters the administration is preparing new trade actions to target China, according to Reuters. •  Legal battles: A federal court blocked many of Trump's tariffs on Wednesday, but an appeals court quickly paused that ruling the next day. The legal battle — which centers on Trump's use of emergency powers to levy tariffs — will continue next month. The whiplash rulings underscore why, even when there's news of tariffs easing, retailers and ports cannot immediately adjust. Wall Street has started to bet that if Trump makes a trade war threat, he will eventually back down. Investors who sold at the start of May missed out on a historically strong month for markets. • Trump's “TACO” slight: Observers have coined a term for that assumption the president will eventually back down from trade threats: “TACO,” as in, “Trump Always Chickens Out.” Trump was caught off guard and angered by a reporter's question about the term this week, according to a senior White House official. Neither the Republican nor Democratic Party has consolidated a majority of the public behind its approach, with more than 4 in 10 saying neither party can get things done or has strong leadership, a new CNN survey conducted by SSRS finds. Despite those widespread doubts, Americans increasingly say they see meaningful differences between the two parties. President Donald Trump abruptly rescinded his nomination of tech billionaire Jared Isaacman to lead NASA yesterday. I will soon announce a new Nominee who will be Mission aligned, and put America First in Space,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. The shake-up comes just days before the Senate was expected to vote on the nomination of Isaacman, who has twice traveled to space on private missions and has close ties to SpaceX chief Elon Musk. Records on OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan organization that tracks money in politics, show Isaacman donated to Democrats as recently as the 2024 election cycle, though he donated to Republicans in prior years. During an April confirmation hearing, Isaacman said he has “been relatively apolitical.” That posture is in line with how past NASA administrators have sought to position themselves. Some background: Isaacman's appointment had been met with broad support in the space community, which viewed him as a passionate leader — and his spaceflight experience as a bonus. But Isaacman, the CEO of payments platform company Shift4, was viewed with deep skepticism by Democratic lawmakers concerned he would use his position at NASA to advance Musk's personal interests. President Donald Trump's special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, didn't hold back his frustration yesterday in reacting to Hamas' response to a US ceasefire proposal for Gaza. It is totally unacceptable and only takes us backward,” Witkoff said in a post on social media. “Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week.” Hamas has expressed reluctance to accept a deal without those terms. And an Israeli official told CNN they saw the militant group's proposal as having “effectively rejected the latest Witkoff proposal and put forward a new offer with its own conditions.” Hamas responds to criticism: A member of Hamas' political bureau told CNN the US had previously come to an understanding on a ceasefire proposal with the militant group, which was then amended by Israel in a way that clashed with the terms Hamas had agreed to. “We did not reject Mr. Witkoff's proposal,” the official, Basem Naim, said. CNN's Abeer Salman and Oren Liebermann contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump speaks during a swearing in ceremony for interim U.S. Attorney General for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro, Wednesday, May 28, 2025, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington. In this image from video with the final vote total, the House of Representatives passed President Donald Trump's big bill of tax breaks and program cuts after an all-night session at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Thursday, May 22, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump faces the challenge of convincing Republican senators, global investors, voters and even Elon Musk that he won't bury the federal government in debt with his multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package. The response so far from financial markets has been skeptical as Trump seems unable to trim deficits as promised. The White House has viciously lashed out at anyone who has voiced concern about the debt snowballing under Trump, even though it did exactly that in his first term after his 2017 tax cuts. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt opened her briefing Thursday by saying she wanted “to debunk some false claims” about his tax cuts. Leavitt said the “blatantly wrong claim that the ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill' increases the deficit is based on the Congressional Budget Office and other scorekeepers who use shoddy assumptions and have historically been terrible at forecasting across Democrat and Republican administrations alike.” In this image from video with the final vote total, the House of Representatives passed President Donald Trump's big bill of tax breaks and program cuts after an all-night session at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Thursday, May 22, 2025. House Speaker Mike Johnson piled onto Congress' number crunchers on Sunday, telling NBC's “Meet the Press,” “The CBO sometimes gets projections correct, but they're always off, every single time, when they project economic growth. They always underestimate the growth that will be brought about by tax cuts and reduction in regulations.” “We have to get a lot of votes,” Trump said last week. Most economists consider the non-partisan CBO to be the foundational standard for assessing policies, though it does not produce cost estimates for actions taken by the executive branch such as Trump's unilateral tariffs. This same tactic was used with Trump's 2017 tax cuts and it set up this year's dilemma, in which many of the tax cuts in that earlier package will sunset next year unless Congress renews them. But the debt is a much bigger problem now than it was eight years ago. Investors are demanding the government pay a higher premium to keep borrowing as the total debt has crossed $36.1 trillion. “I do want to assure everyone that the deficit is a very significant concern for this administration,” Miran said. White House budget director Russell Vought told reporters the idea that the bill is “in any way harmful to debt and deficits is fundamentally untrue.” Most outside economists expect additional debt would keep interest rates higher and slow overall economic growth as the cost of borrowing for homes, cars, businesses and even college educations would increase. “This just adds to the problem future policymakers are going to face,” said Brendan Duke, a former Biden administration aide now at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. Duke said that with the tax cuts in the bill set to expire in 2028, lawmakers would be “dealing with Social Security, Medicare and expiring tax cuts at the same time.” Kent Smetters, faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, said the growth projections from Trump's economic team are “a work of fiction.” He said the bill would lead some workers to choose to work fewer hours in order to qualify for Medicaid. “I don't know of any serious forecaster that has meaningfully raised their growth forecast because of this legislation,” said Harvard University professor Jason Furman, who was the Council of Economic Advisers chair under the Obama administration. “These are mostly not growth- and competitiveness-oriented tax cuts. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Rand Paul of Kentucky have both expressed concerns about the likely deficit increases, with Johnson saying there are enough senators to stall the bill until deficits are addressed. The White House is also banking that tariff revenues will help cover the additional deficits, even though recent court rulings cast doubt on the legitimacy of Trump declaring an economic emergency to impose sweeping taxes on imports. When Trump announced his near-universal tariffs in April, he specifically said his policies would generate enough new revenues to start paying down the national debt. His comments dovetailed with remarks by aides, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, that yearly budget deficits could be more than halved. The Trump administration is correct that growth can help reduce deficit pressures, but it's not enough on its own to accomplish the task, according to new research by economists Douglas Elmendorf, Glenn Hubbard and Zachary Liscow. Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale University, said additional “growth doesn't even get us close to where we need to be.”</p>

Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., left, speak during a press conference in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Friday, May 30, 2025. PARIS (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin is stalling at the peace table while preparing a new military offensive in Ukraine, two senior U.S. senators warned Sunday, arguing that the next two weeks could shape the future of a war that has already smashed cities, displaced millions and redrawn Europe's security map. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal spoke to The Associated Press in Paris after meeting President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and touring neighborhoods shattered by what they called the worst Russian bombardments since the full-scale invasion began. A sweeping U.S. sanctions bill could be the West's last chance to choke off the Kremlin's war economy, they said — adding that they hope their firsthand findings will shift momentum in Washington and help bring a skeptical President Donald Trump on board. “What I learned on this trip was he's preparing for more war,” Graham said of Putin. Blumenthal called the sanctions proposed in legislation “bone-crushing” and said it would place Russia's economy “on a trade island.” At the heart of their push is a bipartisan sanctions bill, backed by nearly the entire U.S. Senate but still facing uncertain odds in Washington. It would impose 500% tariffs on countries that continue buying Russian oil, gas, uranium and other exports — targeting nations like China and India that account for roughly 70% of Russia's energy trade and bankroll much of its war effort. “The world has a lot of cards to play against Putin,” he said. “We're going to hit China and India for propping up his war machine.” With peace talks yielding little and Trump's approach to Ukraine highly uncertain, Graham and Blumenthal have stepped into the breach — blunt emissaries on a lonely mission. Political opposites moving in lockstep, they're crossing Europe, and the aisle, with the moral urgency of two men trying to forestall another Russian offensive before it's too late. Peace talks are scheduled to resume Monday in Istanbul. Trump has yet to endorse the sanctions bill, telling reporters Friday: “I don't know. I'll have to see it.” Graham said the legislation was drafted in consultation with Trump's advisers. Graham backed the president's diplomatic instincts but said, “By trying to engage Putin — by being friendly and enticing — it's become painfully clear he's not interested in ending this war.” Graham pointed to what Ukrainian officials and Yale researchers estimate are nearly 20,000 children forcibly deported to Russia — calling their return a matter of justice, not diplomacy. Blumenthal described standing at mass grave sites in Bucha, where civilians were executed with shots to the head. Both said that failing to act now could pull the U.S. deeper into conflict later. If Putin isn't stopped in Ukraine, Blumenthal said, NATO treaty obligations could one day compel American troops into battle. After a one-hour meeting with Macron in Paris, both Graham, of South Carolina, and Blumenthal, of Connecticut, said they left convinced Europe was ready to toughen its stance. “There are very few causes that will take 41 Republicans and 41 Democrats and put them on record on a single piece of legislation,” he said. Ahead, Ukrainian military leaders are set to brief Congress and a sanctions vote could follow. “There will be more evidence of that from Russia on Monday.”</p>

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico held its first-ever judicial elections on Sunday, stirring controversy and sowing confusion among voters still struggling to understand a process set to transform the country's court system. Mexico's ruling party, Morena, overhauled the court system late last year, fueling protests and criticism that the reform is an attempt by those in power to seize on their political popularity to gain control of the branch of government until now out of their reach. “But it's a counter-balance, which exists in every healthy democracy.” Now, instead of judges being appointed on a system of merit and experience, Mexican voters will choose between some 7,700 candidates vying for more than 2,600 judicial positions. In a middle-class Mexico City neighborhood, poll workers organized the color-coded ballots by federal and local contests. Four people were waiting to vote when the location opened. At the same polling place, Octavio Arellano, a 67-year-old consultant, quickly made his selections, referring to handwritten notes he carried with him. He marked all the ballots in about five minutes, but even so, said, “the process is laborious because there are too many candidates and positions that they're going to occupy.” Hugo de León Roblero, 73, also a retired teacher, took about 20 minutes to fill out the ballots at the same polling place, but supported the process, which he said was a necessary change, “even though there's some confusion about how to vote.” Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum and party allies have said the elections are a way to purge the court system of corruption in a country that has long faced high levels of impunity. Critics say the vote could damage democracy and open the judicial system up further to organized crime and other corrupt actors hoping to get a grip on power. Civil society organizations like Defensorxs have raised red flags about a range of candidates running for election, including lawyers who represented some of Mexico's most feared cartel leaders and local officials who were forced to resign from their positions due to corruption scandals. Also among those putting themselves forward are ex-convicts imprisoned for years for drug-trafficking to the United States and a slate of candidates with ties to a religious group whose spiritual leader is behind bars in California after pleading guilty to sexually abusing minors. Voters often have to choose from sometimes more than a hundred candidates who are not permitted to clearly voice their party affiliation or carry out widespread campaigning. As a result, many Mexicans say they're going into the vote blind. Mexico's electoral authority has investigated voter guides being handed out across the country, in what critics say is a blatant move by political parties to stack the vote in their favor. “Political parties weren't just going to sit with their arms crossed,” Patin said. He was fiercely scribbling down their names on a small scrap of paper and said that he had traveled across Mexico City to try to inform himself ahead of the vote, but he couldn't find any information other than outside the courthouse. “In the neighborhood where I live, there's no information for us,” he said.</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on senators pushing to revise the House-passed Trump spending bill as it heads to the Senate for debate. House Republicans eked out a win in May with their advancement of President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill," filled with negotiations and compromises on thorny policy issues that barely passed muster in the lower chamber. Next week, Senate Republicans will get their turn to parse through the colossal package and are eying changes that could be a hard sell for House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who can only afford to lose three votes. President Donald Trump listens to a question during an event to present law enforcement officers with an award in the Oval Office at the White House on May 19. Congressional Republicans are in a dead sprint to get the megabill — filled with Trump's policy desires on taxes, immigration, energy, defense and the national debt — onto the president's desk by early July. Trump has thrown his support behind the current product, but said during a press conference in the Oval Office on Friday that he expected the package to be "jiggered around a little bit." "If it doesn't get approved, you'll have a 68% tax increase," the president continued. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has an identical margin to Johnson, and will need to cultivate support from a Senate GOP that wants to put its own fingerprints on the bill. Senators have signaled they'd like to make changes to a litany of House proposals, including reforms to Medicaid and the timeline for phasing out green energy tax credits, among others, and have grumbled about the hike to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap pushed for by moderate House Republicans. Senate Majority Leader John Thune speaks during a news conference following the Senate Republican policy luncheon at the U.S. Capitol on March 11. Thune said many Republicans are largely in favor of the tax portion of the bill, which seeks to make Trump's first-term tax policy permanent, and particularly the tax policies that are "stimulative, that are pro-growth, that will create greater growth in the economy." "There's just so many great things in this bill," Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., told Fox News Digital. "The only thing I would like to do is try to cut the spending, and I would love to take a little bit from a lot of places, rather than a lot from just one place." Johnson has remained unflinching in his opposition to the current bill, and warned that "no amount of pressure" from Trump could change his mind. "President Trump made a bunch of promises," Johnson said at an event in Wisconsin on Wednesday. "My promise has been, consistently, we have to stop mortgaging our children's future. OK, so I think there are enough [Republicans] to slow this process down until the president, our leadership, gets serious about returning to a pre-pandemic level." Others are concerned over the proposed slashes to Medicaid spending, which congressional Republicans have largely pitched as reform efforts designed to root out waste, fraud and abuse in the program used by millions of Americans. The House package would see a roughly $700 billion cut from the program, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and some Senate Republicans have signaled that they wouldn't support the changes if benefits were cut for their constituents. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., warned in an op-ed for The New York Times last month that cutting benefits was "both morally wrong and politically suicidal." Meanwhile, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, raised concerns about what proposed cuts to the program would do to rural hospitals in her state. "I cannot support proposals that would create more duress for our hospitals and providers that are already teetering on the edge of insolvency," she said.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth delivers his speech during the 22nd Shangri-La Dialogue summit in Singapore, Saturday, May 31, 2025. BEIJING (AP) — China on Sunday denounced U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for calling the Asian country a threat, accusing him of touting a Cold War mentality as tensions between Washington and Beijing further escalate. “No country in the world deserves to be called a hegemonic power other than the U.S. itself,” it said, alleging that Washington is also undermining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific. Hegseth said in Singapore on Saturday that Washington will bolster its defenses overseas to counter what the Pentagon sees as rapidly developing threats by Beijing, particularly in its aggressive stance toward Taiwan. China's army “is rehearsing for the real deal,” Hegseth said. “We are not going to sugarcoat it — the threat China poses is real. Spokesperson Zhang Xiaogang of China's defense ministry called Hegseth's comments a provocation and said they distorted China's policy positions. The U.S. and China had reached a deal last month to cut U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs from 145% to 30% for 90 days, creating time for negotiators from both sides to reach a more substantive agreement. China also reduced its taxes on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%. But it's uncertain if a trade war truce will last. Trump in a social media post on Friday said he would no longer be “nice” with China when it comes to trade and accused Beijing of breaking an unspecified agreement with the U.S. Tensions escalated anew after the U.S. said on Wednesday it would start revoking visas for Chinese students studying there. The Philippines has been involved in increasingly violent clashes with China over competing claims in the South China Sea. The Chinese Embassy in Singapore in separate Facebook posts described Teodoro's remarks as “groundless accusations” and argued that the South China Sea Islands are China's inherent territories. The “troublemaker” is not China, it said, and cited what it said were recent illegal intrusions by the Philippines into the waters adjacent to two reefs. “Some outside power” was posing the biggest threat to peace with the deployment of offensive weapons and roping in allies for frequent military drills, it said, without naming anyone. The answer is clear to all,” it said. Separately, the Chinese Embassy in Singapore on Saturday criticized attempts to link the issue of Taiwan with that of the war in Ukraine after French President Emmanuel Macron warned of a dangerous double standard in focusing on a potential conflict with China at the cost of abandoning Ukraine. “If one tries to denounce ‘double standards' through the lens of a double standard, the only result we can get is still double standard,” it said. China, which usually sends its defense minister to the Shangri-La forum, this time sent a lower-level delegation led by Maj. Gen. Hu Gangfeng, the vice president of the People's Liberation Army National Defense University.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For some small businesses, the last week brought even more twists and turns to the past two months of President Donald Trump's chaotic tariffs. The situation was already confusing, with stops and starts of tariffs at different levels. The confusion has made it challenging for some small companies to plan, business owners told CNN. In certain cases, they have had to consider changing their product strategy, looking into shifting their supply chains, reducing staff hours or delaying products. “My fear is, if this continues, there's going to be like the mass extinction of small businesses,” Julie Robbins, CEO of Ohio-based guitar pedal maker EarthQuaker Devices, told CNN. In early April, he issued a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs almost everywhere except China. The US and China agreed in May to roll back reciprocal tariffs for 90 days. He also agreed to push back levies on imports from the European Union until July 9. Related article ‘Chaotic' tariff regime and trade war are leaving small businesses in their wake Those are only some of his changes, which can come at any time of day via the White House, social media posts or other avenues. The whiplash has been hard for companies to keep up with. Even major brands like apparel giant Gap are feeling the impact of tariffs, but small companies with far fewer resources are in an even tougher spot. “It's the sort of more smaller, kind of more niche… brands that are going to really, really get hit by this,” Jack Leathem, an analyst at market research firm Canalys, told CNN in April. Some small business owners have had to make difficult decisions as they've grappled with the impact of tariffs. The reciprocal tariffs that China imposed on the US have been particularly challenging, she says, since China has become a major market for her business. Manley says it took “decades” for her to “get the best Chinese importers.” Overall, Manley Labs' sales are down more than 19% compared to last year, she told CNN, which has frozen the company's product development efforts. “It's just a freaking mess right now,” she said in late May, before this past week's court rulings on Trump's tariffs. “And I'm so angry that my own government has done this to me.” The best thing small businesses can do right now is to be flexible and diversify their sourcing and procurement strategies, says Tala Akhavan, chief operating officer of Pietra, a platform that helps brands with sourcing, production and logistics among other services. That's what Intuition Robotics, which makes a home robot designed to be a companion for older adults, is doing, according to chief strategy officer Assaf Gad. Trump's tariffs have encouraged Gad to think about expanding Intuition Robotics into international markets. “Maybe this is also a good time to say, ‘Let's not put all the eggs in one basket,'” he said, “and, you know, start looking on other kind of territories that will reduce the risk for us going forward.” But for some companies, finding a plan B isn't so easy. That's the case for Sarah O'Leary, CEO of Willow, which makes wearable breast pumps and accessories. As a medical device company, Willow can't simply just move its manufacturing, O'Leary told CNN. Any tariffs, even low ones, would be difficult for a small company like hers to absorb, she said in mid-May. “We don't build our products with that much margin,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States has sent its first nuclear deal proposal to Iran since negotiations began in April, a move that comes after a U.N. nuclear watchdog report indicated the Middle Eastern country significantly increased its uranium enrichment over a three-month span. On Saturday afternoon, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi acknowledged he received a U.S. proposal that was delivered by his Omani counterpart, Sayyid Badr al Busaidi, who has been mediating the nuclear negotiations between the two countries. “President Trump has made it clear that Iran can never obtain a nuclear bomb. Special Envoy Witkoff has sent a detailed and acceptable proposal to the Iranian regime, and it's in their best interest to accept it. Specifically, it calls for Iran to cease all uranium enrichment and proposes creating a regional trust to produce nuclear power that would involve Iran, Saudi Arabia, other Arab states, and the U.S., the report noted. The news of a U.S. nuclear deal proposal comes shortly after a new report by the International Atomic Energy Agency detailed a sharp spike in uranium enrichment by Iran, which the Vienna-based agency said was of “serious concern.” That amount was earlier  estimated to be at just over 605 pounds in February. Trump has recently been hopeful about the prospects of an Iranian nuclear deal. “They don't want to be blown up,” Trump added. “They would rather make a deal, and I think that could happen in the not-too-distant future.</p>

Footage shows the aftermath of a crash between a tour van and pickup along U.S. Highway 20 near Henrys Lake State Park in eastern Idaho. A driver who crashed a pickup into a tour van near Yellowstone National Park earlier this month, causing the death of seven people including himself, had a blood alcohol level more than twice the legal limit for driving, police said Friday. Isaiah Moreno, 25, of Humble, Texas, was operating a Dodge Ram pickup truck on U.S. Highway 20 in eastern Idaho when his vehicle crossed the center line and collided head-on with a Mercedes tour van carrying more than a dozen people. Both vehicles burst into flames, and Moreno, along with six people from China, Italy and California, were killed. Survivors were taken to nearby hospitals with injuries. The fatal crash happened in eastern Idaho, about 16 miles west of Yellowstone National Park. The deadly crash happened near Henrys Lake, about 16 miles west of Yellowstone in Wyoming. Yellowstone is one of the country's largest national parks and draws millions of visitors each year. "This tragedy should be a wake-up call," police Capt.
