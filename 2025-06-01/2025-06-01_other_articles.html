                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Humans are weird creatures and the rules of our societies can feel baffling, but there's a great TV series that approaches that theme through the eyes of an actual extraterrestrial. The SyFy original series "Resident Alien," which stars Alan Tudyk as an alien with a truly unpronounceable name that goes by the assumed name and identity of "Harry Vanderspeigle," shows us just how bizarre humans are by depicting life for an alien who's now stuck among us and doing his best to fit in. "Resident Alien" isn't the first movie or series to poke fun at humanity through the eyes of a space alien, with movies like the hilarious Nick Frost and Simon Pegg-starring "Paul" and even the Jeff Goldblum rom-com "Earth Girls are Easy" playing with the concept, but it does take it to its furthest and most ridiculous conclusions. "Resident Alien" is based on the comic book series of the same name by Peter Hogan and Steve Parkhouse, created by showrunner Chris Sheridan, who previously worked as a writer on shows like "Family Guy" and "Living Single." It features some great gross-out gags and a truly terrific turn by Tudyk, who has really made a name for himself as an actor who can do just about anything. Not only that, but for fans without access to SyFy, the show is available to stream on both Netflix and Peacock! This leads him to question whether or not he should destroy all humans and sends him on a quest to figure out exactly what his mission is on Earth. Over the show's three seasons things get progressively more wacky, and there's even kind of a mini-"Firefly" reunion because Tudyk is joined by the voice of Nathan Fillion as an octopus and in the upcoming fourth season, Jewel Staite will appear as an FBI agent investigating the strange happenings surrounding Harry's small Colorado town. Though "Resident Alien" has a pretty fantastic supporting cast, it's Tudyk's performance as an alien desperately trying to act human that really makes the series work. His running voice-over monologues are hilarious, and he's extremely capable of using his physicality for humor, showing us how an extraterrestrial in a human suit might really react to certain situations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Posted in: Amazon Studios, TV | Tagged: countdown, Jensen Ackles Showrunner/EP Derek Haas's Jensen Ackles (The Boys, Supernatural)-starring Countdown is previewed in Prime Video's June 2025 trailer. Shortly after we looked at what Showrunner/EP Derek Haas (NBC's "Chicago" franchise) had to share about the upcoming series, Prime Video dropped a new trailer previewing the main titles set to release this month. When an officer with the Department of Homeland Security is murdered in broad daylight, LAPD detective Mark Meachum (Ackles) is recruited to a secret task force, alongside undercover agents from all branches of law enforcement, to investigate. Ackles's Mark Meachum is described as a rogue L.A. detective, wrong-side-of-the-tracks kind of guy who takes risks that most people wouldn't take. That could make things difficult when Meachum finds himself part of an elite team that also includes Nathan Blythe (Eric Dane), Amber Oliveras (Jessica Camacho), Keyonte Bell (Elliot Knight), Evan Shepherd (Violett Beane), and Lucas Finau (Uli Latukefu). Speaking exclusively this week with EW, Haas noted that the show's drama won't just be about big action scenes, with Meachum involved in some romantic entanglements. "It's not going to be just one," Haas added about the potential romantic dynamics at play. And we're going to have a few of those." In addition, Ackles discussed what it was like working with the ensemble cast, how Supernatural fans might find similarities between Meachum and Dean Winchester, and how the series made him feel a bit like Tom Cruise: Ackles on Working with the "Countdown" Cast: "It's like every ingredient for a perfect dish. Everybody's so giving and happy to do whatever it takes for the team." Ackles on Fans Finding Similarities Between Mark Meachum & Dean Winchester: "There's probably going to be some familiarity from that fandom with this guy. It's not like I'm going so opposite spectrum with this character. He's going to be a familiar taste, which is good. I loved playing that kind of a character. Ackles on Getting "Getting My Tom Cruise On" with "Countdown": "I actually just did some ADR the other day for an action sequence.</p>

 DPM Dar, Afghan FM Muttaqi highlight importance of UAP railway link project

 They agreed to work closely for an early finalisation of the framework agreement

ISLAMABAD (APP) – Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar and Acting Foreign Minister of Afghanistan Amir Khan Muttaqi on Sunday emphasised the importance of Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Line Project for regional connectivity.

They agreed to work closely for an early finalisation of the framework agreement, Foreign Office Spokesperson said in a press release.

The DPM/FM held a telephone conversation with the FM Amir Khan Muttaqi who welcomed the decision of Pakistan to up-grade its diplomatic relations to the ambassador level and informed that Afghanistan has decided to reciprocate the same. He termed it a very positive development in bilateral relations.

Both leaders also reviewed implementation of decisions taken during DPM/FM's visit to Kabul on 19 April 2025 and vowed to continue working together to establish mutual trust between the two brotherly nations. 

Earlier this week, Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed to enhance diplomatic ties by exchanging ambassadors — a major move toward restoring normal relations after years of tension between Islamabad and the Taliban-led government in Kabul.

On Friday, Pakistan announced it would elevate its diplomatic mission in Afghanistan from Charge d'Affaires to Ambassador level, citing a “positive trajectory” in bilateral relations.

The Foreign Office also confirmed that Afghanistan has decided to reciprocate Pakistan's move by appointing its own ambassador.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is an easy, carefree pastime, but even at this young age, he knows that it will make him a better footballer; every touch and every shot strengthening his bond with the ball, sharpening his muscle memory. At Rennes and then Borussia Dortmund, he is the very epitome of footballing potential: a whirlwind of sidesteps and breezy dribbles, a broad smile forever stretched across his face, a trail of befuddled opponents forever floundering in his wake. At Barcelona, after a record-breaking €135million transfer, things get complicated: injuries, recurrent complaints about his time-keeping and professionalism, the fear that his potential is destined never to be truly fulfilled. But the planets have aligned at Paris Saint-Germain, where his abrupt transformation into a prolific goalscorer means that he approaches Saturday's Champions League final against Inter in Munich accompanied by a higher level of expectation than perhaps any other player. Should PSG prevail, the Ballon d'Or could well be his. As he stands on the brink of career-defining glory, this is his story so far. “We'd have kickabouts with friends at the foot of our building or we'd challenge a team from another neighbourhood to a game. He could already shoot with both feet and his dribbling was instinctive. A child of the 2000s, having been born in May 1997, Dembele grew up idolising players such as David Beckham, Steven Gerrard and Lionel Messi. The dream of following in their gilded footsteps took root at an early age. Dembele was seven years old when he and Diatta joined local club ALM Evreux (later to become Evreux FC), whose pitches lay a 10-minute walk away across the Boulevard du 14 Juillet. The first time Evreux youth coach Gregory Badoche laid eyes on him, he could scarcely believe them. He was a little shrimp, you know, a very slender guy with legs like toothpicks, but his dribbling ability was insane.” Interest from major local clubs did not take long to arrive. “There was a recruiter from Rennes called Armand Djire who used to come and watch him regularly,” says Badoche. “When Ousmane was still only 12, Armand said to me: ‘If he doesn't become a professional, I'll end my career'.” Amid interest from Red Bull Salzburg, he downed tools in the summer of 2015, sitting out a two-week training camp in Germany, before eventually putting pen to paper on a three-year professional contract. After making his debut off the bench in a 2-0 win at Angers in October 2015, the 18-year-old became a fixture in the starting XI and finished his maiden campaign with an excellent return of 12 goals and five assists from 26 Ligue 1 games. “He was very collective-minded,” says former Rennes head coach Philippe Montanier. I remember the derby against Lorient (a 2-2 draw in January 2016). The unintentionally comical effect of that interview created an impression of a young player whose head was tethered to his shoulders with less than customary tightness. But those who know him insist that behind the impression of absent-mindedness lies a keen intelligence. “Sometimes he'll seem a bit in his own world, then the next second he'll seem very switched on,” says a source close to Dembele, speaking anonymously to protect relationships. So in a conversation, you might think he's a bit lost, but then he'll suddenly start talking to you about the Bolsheviks. Before his first season in senior football had reached its conclusion, Dembele had been announced as a Dortmund player, joining the club from the Ruhr valley on a five-year contract for a fee of €15million. “We had a pretty simple life there,” Diatta recalls. “It was our first experience overseas, so we were discovering life abroad. We were lucky to find French players there like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who really took Ousmane under his wing.” The kind of football career that Dembele had pictured for himself in those kickabouts in La Madeleine was suddenly upon him: a gigantic stadium, packed to the rafters with 80,000 wildly cheering fans; glamorous Champions League ties against Real Madrid, Sporting CP, Benfica and Monaco; taut domestic tussles with Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig. Initially taken aback by the intensity of Dortmund's training sessions, Dembele soon got up to speed and credited head coach Thomas Tuchel with giving him the liberty to play his natural game. “When I have the ball, it's total freedom,” he told L'Equipe. It's gratifying to feel this confidence in me, as if I was 25.” Before joining Barcelona, Dembele had never sustained a serious injury. Within two weeks of being unveiled at a sun-soaked Camp Nou in August 2017, he ruptured the tendon in the femoral bicep of his left thigh, which sidelined him for nearly four months. It created an unfortunate template for what was to follow. In Dembele's early years at Barca, his body continually betrayed him. Further problems with his left hamstring came in January 2018 and March 2019. A muscle tear in his left thigh the following August. A knee tendon issue in June 2021 that forced him out of Euro 2020. It did not help that, even when he was fit, he did not always seem entirely present, with repeated instances of lateness driving the club's decision-makers to distraction. Dembele was living with Diatta and his uncle in a luxurious house in Barcelona's upmarket Pedralbes neighbourhood and the fear within the club was that he was spending too much time playing video games and not enough time focused on football. “In his early days, he didn't have the professional mindset of a Barca player,” says a source who worked with Dembele during his time at the club. Sometimes he'd fall asleep at home and that was it. Diatta puts Dembele's teething problems at Barca down to inexperience. Encouraged by his agent, Moussa Sissoko, Dembele took on a full-time personal chef, Anthony Audebaud, in the summer of 2019. A year later he started working with a personal fitness coach, former elite sprinter Salah Ghaidi, and physiotherapist Jean-Baptiste Duault, who was taken on after impressing Dembele's entourage with his analysis of the player's injury problems in an interview with L'Equipe. The feeling in Dembele's camp was that Barcelona's focus on patient, possession-dependent football meant that their training sessions were not sufficiently dynamic for him from a physical perspective. Backed by his new personal support staff, Dembele took physical preparation and injury prevention into his own hands, constructing a daily fitness schedule designed to strengthen and protect the muscles that had previously been his undoing. With his injury problems finally behind him, Dembele's last three seasons at Barcelona were much happier as he became a key figure under first Ronald Koeman and then Xavi. Although his attacking statistics remained largely underwhelming, he bowed out as a Barca player with three La Liga titles and two Copa del Rey wins to his name. “He eventually became a sort of veteran in the dressing room and his team-mates understood him better in his last years,” says the Barcelona source. “Dembele ended up being loved for how he was.” The turnaround in Dembele's Barca fortunes also permitted him to resurrect his international career. He played only a peripheral role in France's triumph at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, having lost his place after their opening game, and then went 860 days without playing for Les Bleus between November 2018 and March 2021. But although injury curtailed his involvement at Euro 2020, he was a first-choice pick on the right flank at both the 2022 World Cup and Euro 2024. “Some players understand things very quickly and are already mature at the age of 19 or 20, like Kylian,” says Ludovic Batelli, who coached both Dembele and Mbappe at under-19 level with France. “I think Ousmane needed a bit more time to understand that work, rigour and discipline would make him even more effective and successful. Having agreed to meet a €50million (£42.9m, $54.9m) release clause in Dembele's Barcelona contract, the PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi sold his club's project to the forward by vowing that he would be the homegrown figurehead of a young, hungry team with a strong French identity. Paris had been a 70-minute train ride from Evreux during Dembele's childhood and he had happy memories of going to watch games with his friends at the Parc des Princes. It helped, too, that Dembele already knew PSG's newly appointed coach. While coach of Barcelona, Luis Enrique had enquired about the winger's availability following his breakthrough at Rennes, only for Dembele to inform him that he had already given his word to Dortmund. “Luis Enrique was fiercely protective of him, right from day one,” says a source close to the PSG coach. After claiming a league and Coupe de France double alongside Mbappe in his maiden PSG season, Dembele was one of the players expected to step up to the plate when his long-time friend left the French capital for Real Madrid last summer. Things did not get off to the best start when he was dropped on disciplinary grounds for PSG's 2-0 defeat at Arsenal in the Champions League in October. Dembele had questioned Luis Enrique's possession-heavy tactics during a team briefing and subsequently reported late for a training session, although a source close to him suggests that he was primarily axed for the trip to the Emirates Stadium in order to send a message to the rest of the squad. Yet only two months later, Luis Enrique happened upon a tactical innovation that would reinvigorate PSG's season — and transform Dembele's career. The decision to deploy Dembele as a false nine for a 3-1 home win over Lyon in mid-December proved the spark for a stupendous run of goal-scoring form in which the France international racked up 27 goals in only 22 appearances. Amassed in the space of only three and a half months, it represented twice as many goals as he had ever previously mustered over the course of an entire season. Sources close to him additionally point to the hours of work he has spent on his finishing in training over the last 12 months, as well as input from a personal video analyst. As the deliberately elusive focal point of a deliberately loose-limbed starting XI, the super-fit Dembele also plays a pivotal role in PSG's build-up play and their formidable pressing game. Although grand speeches have never been his style (“a connector rather than a leader” is how one source describes him), he fulfils an important function in the club's youthful, multilingual changing room. “He speaks several languages, which facilitates links with his team-mates,” says a source close to the PSG squad. “He's also someone who's very jovial, who likes taking the mick, and that helps to create a good atmosphere and bind the squad together.” Dembele's performances have also benefited from the fact that, away from the pitch, he has moved into a more settled phase in his life. Though fatherhood and the demands of elite-level football have inevitably reduced the amount of free time on his hands, he remains a committed Football Manager player and watches as much live football as he can. “I watch practically every championship,” he confided to Le Parisien last year. But according to those who know him, until he has the Champions League trophy in his hands, thoughts of individual glory can wait. “For him, the most important thing is to win the Champions League with Paris Saint-Germain, because it would be something historic,” says best friend Diatta. “And it'd be deserved, when you look at his journey. He's been through tough times, people have spoken ill of him, about the injuries and things like that, but he's never complained.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With one repost from President Donald Trump, former president Joe Biden has joined a storied pantheon: public figures believed to have died and been replaced by clones. Not content with spreading conspiracy theories on Friday night, late on Saturday night, Trump shared a post by a supporter to his Truth Social page that claimed Biden was killed in 2020. The post reads, “There is no #JoeBiden - executed in 2020. #Biden clones doubles & robotic engineered soulless mindless entities are what you see. With this bizarre accusation, Biden joins such celebrities as The Beatles' Paul McCartney, who has been dodging rumors about his death since 1969, and Avril Lavigne, who has been plagued by a conspiracy theory involving her death and subsequent replacement by a clone since the 2000s. Trump's own wife Melania has also been the subject of similar conspiracy theories, with the idea that Melania had been replaced by a body double gaining credence during Trump's first term, prompting the White House to issue a statement dismissing the theories as a “non-story.” Trump supporters were quick to encourage the president's repost, sharing memes and “evidence” for the theory in the replies—one being that Biden's eye color allegedly changed in 2020, while another claims that Biden was replaced because his ear lobes suddenly appeared to be attached to his head, whereas prior to 2020 they were unattached. Other commenters pointed to side-by-side photos of Biden from the 1990s and the 2020s, as well as different signatures as further proof that Biden had been murdered, with some specifying that he had been executed by a military tribunal. It's been a conspiracy-filled weekend for Trump, with the president also reposting a conspiracy theory on Friday night that accused CBS of suppressing footage of his 2015 appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert (the footage is readily available on YouTube). Biden, who is still dealing with speculation about his fitness for office toward the end of his term, recently shared that he had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Out in the village of Agua Fría (which, although that sounds rural and out of town-ish, is actually well within what we all consider Santa Fe), they've got a little bit of everything. “Yesterday morning, a pheasant showed up on our property,” notes clairvoyant teacher and spiritual healer Lisa Pelletier, whose home and Deep Roots Psychic Studio are headquartered in this rural pocket. A pathway leads to the low-profile studio. But it's a studio, so people are very forgiving. They don't expect it to be diamond plaster walls or anything,” she figures. Best of all, “Combining with the land, it just feels very calming, harmonious, very generous as well. I bring to it a lot of my spiritual practice and psychic awareness. I'm working with all kinds of energies, working with the land and beings, on the healing I give to my clients and my students and the healing I do on myself. In fact, “It's revelatory, is what this studio feels like.” It has cement flooring but no insulation.” Lisa Pelletier, psychic, teacher and healer, inside her favorite room “It's a light, bright, healing spiritual studio. I do a lot of creating here. There's not a lot of color, but there are patches of aqua, teal and turquoise, including a turquoise ceramic dish with carved birds and inquiry cards. A giant plant that she identifies as a type of philodendron has been hers since she was 18. “I'm here whenever spirit calls—morning, day and night,” she details. “I do clairvoyant healings, whether live or remote. Before the clients show up for the session, I meditate to center myself and be in a neutral and compassionate place. I do energy work in the room. I do deep meditation.” With the five huge south-facing windows, “I have a wonderful view of the night sky, when I'm in here meditating at night. As soon as she found the property 10 years ago with her husband, actor/director Scott Harrison, Pelletier knew she would use this space for her practice. “I had a sense of all of it, the healing and spiritual work I would be doing in here. I had that kind of timeless feeling of, It's all right here already,” she comments. On a design level, “That sort of unfinished, crunchy quality, it's crafty, that's my and my husband's style. So just the style of it felt very lovely and familiar.” Lisa Pelletier, psychic, teacher and healer, stands at the entrance of her Deep Roots Psychic Studio. For folks who aren't clairvoyant, they can think of it as psychological space. What's more, “It has what feels like if we took our homes in Velarde and Cordova and moved them down here to Santa Fe. Which was sort of a wish we had when we first left northern New Mexico to come down here.” Pelletier grew up mostly in south-central Connecticut, spending summers on Cape Cod. She went to the University of Connecticut, earning a bachelor's degree in fine arts and becoming a graphic designer. She and Harrison were living in New York when, “We made a list of cities that were green—artistic and more natural.” Santa Fe was unknown to them when they visited in 2002. On their last day, she recalls, “We saw this very tiny listing that said: Small adobe. $900.” Two months later, they were living there. And a lot of the people who live here become proficient in healing themselves and sharing healing. A regular at Sweetwater Harvest Kitchen, Harry's Roadhouse and Iconik Coffee Roasters, Pelletier is a harmony-oriented Libra. “Because I'm an air sign,” she reasons, “I love the water and earth, perhaps to complete. What she values most about her favorite room? “It goes back to a giving and receiving quality. It's this wonderful flow of giving and receiving, involving even the plants and also the beings who are still on the property who have been here several millennia, and my own spirit guides who came with me.” Wolf Schneider, former editor of the Santa Fean and American Film, has written for many other publications--from New Mexico magazine and Southwest Art to Mademoiselle.

During his meetings with Acting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, Dar stressed the need to manage cross-border security, combat militancy, and strengthen bilateral trade.
