                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit This is CNBC's coverage of how U.S. trade partners, industries and employers respond to President Donald Trump's historic tariffs. Economists say that Trump's tariff formula is based on an underestimation of a key metric, which has resulted in inflated tariff rates for countries nationwide. But that formula assumes an elasticity of import prices with respect to tariffs of about 0.25, but the economists say that that number should be closer to 1.0 (0.945), according to senior fellows Kevin Corinth and Stan Veuger at the American Enterprise Institute. If Trump's formula reflected this, no country's tariff would exceed 14% and most would be at the 10% baseline established by the administration, according to AEI. A group of high-profile tech and finance leaders is making a trip to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, to "talk common sense" to the president about his sweeping tariffs, several sources told veteran tech journalist Kara Swisher. "Their million dollar donations to the inauguration is turning into billions and soon trillions in losses," Swisher said in a post on Threads, not indicating which leaders are part of the group. She added that de facto DOGE chief and Tesla CEO Elon Musk is "in their crosshairs too." Trump's tariffs sent global markets into a tailspin on Thursday and Friday, wiping out $30.9 billion in net worth for Musk, $23.49 billion for Amazon's Jeff Bezos and $27.34 billion for Meta's Mark Zuckerberg — the world's three richest people  — according to Bloomberg. The tariffs are battering tech stocks due to the industry's heavy dependence on manufacturing, computer chips and IT services from countries like China, India and Taiwan. Elon Musk took aim at Peter Navarro, as the top Trump trade advisor continues to defend the president's sweeping tariffs. It will be soon, and from there, we're going to have a bullish boom, and the Dow is going to hit 50,000 during Trump's term," Navarro said on CNN Saturday. Musk — whose DOGE team is engaged in a controversial effort to cut federal spending, including mass layoffs — also said that Navarro hasn't built "s--t." Jaguar Land Rover Automotive, one of Britain's biggest carmakers, said Saturday that the pause would take place this month. "As we work to address the new trading terms with out business partners, we are taking some short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid-to-longer term plans." "The industry is already facing multiple headwinds and this announcement comes at the worst possible time," Mike Hawes, chief executive of the U.K.'s Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said last week. "SMMT is in constant contact with government and will be looking for trade discussions to accelerate as we need to secure a way forward that supports jobs and economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic." More than 77% of those vehicles were destined for the export market. Top trade aide Peter Navarro downplayed the sharp market sell-off triggered by Trump's aggressive tariff rollout, vowing stocks will rebound and flourish soon. It will be soon, and from there, we're going to have a bullish boom, and the Dow is going to hit 50,000 during Trump's term," he claimed on CNN Saturday. This follows a 1,679-point decline on Thursday and marks the first time ever that it has shed more than 1,500 points on back-to-back days. President Donald Trump on Saturday claimed that China has been "hit much harder than the USA, not even close," in the escalating trade war. "They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly," Trump said in a post on Truth Social. "We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post,' but not any longer." He touted his sweeping new tariffs, saying, "We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before." "Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast! THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks warned that Trump's decision to impose broad tariffs could ultimately hurt drug research and development in the pharmaceutical industry. But industry leaders are still bracing for Trump's plans to impose pharmaceutical-specific tariffs sometime soon. "We can't breach those agreements, so we have to eat the cost of the tariffs and make trade-offs within our own companies," Ricks told BBC in an interview on Friday. "Typically, that will be in reduction of staff or research and development, and I predict R&D will come first. Eli Lilly has led the industry in building up its U.S. production capabilities, earmarking $50 billion to construct and upgrade new plants since 2020. Those facilities are key to manufacturing the company's blockbuster weight loss and diabetes drugs. But Eli Lilly also depends mainly on foreign manufacturing, most notably in Ireland, where it employs more than 3,000 and is constructing a new $800 million facility. Ford and Stellantis are offering employee-pricing programs, while Hyundai Motor said it would not raise prices for at least two months to ease consumer concerns. Automakers view the actions as a way to get vehicles off their lots and maintain or increase sales amid uncertain market conditions due to the tariffs. "We understand that these are uncertain times for many Americans. Whether it's navigating the complexities of a changing economy or simply needing a reliable vehicle for your family, we want to help," Ford said in a statement Thursday morning announcing the program. U.S. stock markets fell sharply for a second consecutive day on Friday, with all three major indexes dropping by more than 5% as part of a global rout. With one of the nastiest two-day selloffs in history following President Donald Trump's launch of punitive tariffs on most trading partners, the stock market is in one of those precarious spots: Both tightly coiled for a near-term bounce soon, but not quite priced for the full fundamental implications of this policy as now contemplated. Bespoke Investment Group gave voice to this uncomfortable moment, in which markets that are built to produce the "wisdom of crowds" through rational, collective price-setting are lashed to the whims a president channeling decades' worth of anti-trade feelings through the executive power to declare "emergency" tariffs. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to visit the White House on Monday to discuss recently announced tariffs with Trump, three Israeli officials and a White House official said on Saturday. Netanyahu's office has not confirmed the visit, that would likely also include discussions on Iran and Israel's war against Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza. As part of a sweeping new tariff policy announced by Trump, unspecified Israeli goods exports to the United States face a 17% tariff. The U.S. is Israel's closest ally and largest single trading partner. An Israeli finance ministry official said on Thursday that Trump's latest tariff announcement could impact Israel's exports of machinery and medical equipment. Before Wednesday, President Donald Trump's tariffs were expected to be a problem for markets and the economy, but a manageable one. What actually emerged, though, has been economic and geopolitical mayhem. It started with Trump's Rose Garden news conference Wednesday after the market close, when the president slapped 10% tariffs on every U.S. trading partner starting Saturday, with individualized rates for 60 other countries that would begin in a week. China retaliated with 34% tariffs on all goods, European Union leaders also are considering countermeasures. Markets recoiled at the developments, sending stocks into a vicious two-day sell-off that put the Nasdaq Composite, home to powerhouse Silicon Valley names that Trump has been courting in the early days of his second term, into a bear market. President Donald Trump's tariff plan sent shockwaves throughout global markets, leaving investors reeling and economists scratching their heads. Click here to read CNBC's previous Day 3 coverage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump announced his "Liberation Day" tariffs on Wednesday — and people have been reacting as global markets take a hammering. Here's what big names in business and economics have been saying: Joshua Bolten, the CEO of Business Roundtable, an association that represents more than 200 CEOs, said in a statement the tariffs "run the risk of causing major harm to American manufacturers, workers, families and exporters." He said the Business Roundtable "supports President Trump's goal of securing better and fairer trade deals with our trading partners" but called on him to introduce "additional reasonable exemptions" and a "transparent, predictable exclusion process." "Never before has an hour of Presidential rhetoric cost so many people so much," Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary, wrote on X. The estimates are between $1,700 to $5,000 per family in terms of the costs of these tariffs," Mariana Mazzucato, an economics professor at University College London, told ITV's "Peston" program. Boaz Weinstein, Saba Capital Management's founder, doesn't expect Trump to change course, posting on X: "I'm often wrong, but I don't see him doing a u-turn. "So, this tariff file is now being labeled 'Make America Wealthy Again'? The previous condition, I can tell you, was not nearly as good as the current condition, seeing as US net national net worth just reached a record level of $157 TRILLION (a cool $1.2 million per household … too bad we don't all live at the average! Nouriel Roubini, a professor emeritus of the NYU Stern School of Business, said the "Liberation Day" label was "Orwellian doublespeak." "Whatever the consequences of these tariffs will be — ie lower growth and higher inflation and how much of it depending on the eventual size of these tariffs post-negotiations that will be ugly and long-drawn. There is absolutely no 'liberation' at all in them: not for US consumers, workers and businesses, let alone for the rest of the world," he said on X. "I guess it's just possible that when we get details about the Trump tariffs they will be lower than what he just announced, but based on what he said, he's gone full-on crazy," Paul Krugman, a Nobel Memorial Prize-winning economist and former MIT and Princeton University professor, wrote in his Substack newsletter. "If you had any hopes that Trump would step back from the brink, this announcement, between the very high tariff rates and the complete falsehoods about what other countries do, should kill them," Krugman added. "March continued with President Trump's rapid executive orders and policy changes, as tariffs (along with their potential impact on the economy), inflation, employment and consumer spending became the main concerns of the market, which pulled back with increased trading on strong negative breadth," wrote Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst of S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a S&P Global column. "Adding to the concern were Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) government employment reductions, as well as US layoffs, which have increased (along with retail warnings)," he added. "True, the United States is a large and dominant country. And it is a relatively closed country, meaning we depend less on trade than most other countries," said Jared Bernstein, former chief economist, in his newsletter. He fails to give a coherent rationale for why we need to start a trade war with Canada, Mexico, Japan, Europe, and other traditionally reliable trading partners." "First, though they've been explicitly cavalier about the pain they're causing, higher inflation, slower growth, lower investment, falling stock prices — as of this moment, the Dow is down 1,200 points — and higher recession chances could force them to recant. But, at least so far, that may have been the way of Trump 1; it's not the way of Trump 2," he added. And the real tragedy is that they will hurt working Americans more than anyone else," said Justin Wolfers, economics professor at University of Michigan and public policy scholar, on BlueSky. "If these tariffs were more targeted and on specific goods, I wouldn't be so sure we would have stagflation. But these appear to be extremely broad, so I expect higher inflation and lower or even negative economic growth," said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin chief economist, on BlueSky. "Home construction was already going to be weak this year, but these tariffs (combined with labor problems from immigration policy) will mean fewer homes built," she added. It's not something where you can time quickly for a market bottom. It's something that we're going to have to live with as long as President Trump continues with this stance," Bill Gross, the cofounder of Pimco, told CNBC. "I don't think he's going to back down. President Trump, to be very blunt, is a macho male, and this macho male is not going to back down tomorrow simply because the Nasdaq's down 5%," said Gross, who's also known as "Bond King." Gross said it's not a time for investors to bottom fish, likening it to "catching a falling knife." "The 40-odd years of profits rising relative to GDP has ended. "Further exacerbating market volatility is redirection of foreign capital from the US to wherever multiple expansion appears more promising," Blitz wrote. Jim O'Neill, former chief economist at Goldman Sachs, told BBC News on Friday that the "sensible" thing to do would be for the UK to speak to other members of G7, aside from the US, about lowering trade barriers between each other, particularly for cross-border services. He said this would be "very healthy for all those countries because it's the one area of global trade that most countries haven't done enough in." "It is the US which is going to be hurt more, especially in the short-term, from these rather insane moves." "Just had a journalist ask me to explain "Liberation Day," Stephanie Kelton, author of The Deficit Myth, wrote in a post on X. "I told him it's about liberating Americans from some of the cash in their wallets." "This is a US-centric fiscal shock driven by the Trump administration and it is fiscal policy that can unwind it. "One last point: don't expect a reluctant-to-cut Fed to support the dollar. The euro sold-off regardless because real rates and growth expectations collapsed." Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that US tariffs posed a "significant risk" to the global economy. "We are still assessing the macroeconomic implications of the announced tariff measures, but they clearly represent a significant risk to the global outlook at a time of sluggish growth," she said in a statement on Thursday. She said Trump's move "will not be good for the global economy and it will not be good for those who inflict the tariffs and those who retaliate." The Prez said he'd make us tired of winning…I'm there now!" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday said that the scope of Trump's tariffs actions surpassed all expectations. "While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected," Powell said at a conference for business journalists. "We've taken a step back and we're watching to see what the policies turn out to be and the ways in which they will affect the economy, and then we'll be able to act, he said." Kevin Corinth, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning, DC-based think tank, wrote in an article published Friday that the formula behind Trump's tariffs, which puts heavy emphasis on trade deficits, makes "no economic sense." "The trade deficit with a given country is not determined only by tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers, but also by international capital flows, supply chains, comparative advantage, geography, etc," Corinth wrote. "But even if one were to take the Trump Administration's tariff formula seriously, it makes an error that inflates the tariffs assumed to be levied by foreign countries four-fold." In a post on X on Thursday, Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, warned that a recession could "hit imminently and extend until next year" should Trump continue with his tariffs and other countries retaliate. I attach a 15% probability to this dark scenario," he predicted. "The market is giving a big thumbs down to this tariff policy," he added. But fundamentally, this is a test of what you can and cannot do with tariffs, and there was very little restraint, I would say, apart for, strangely enough, Canada and Mexico, USMCA, on the level of the tariffs."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit President Donald Trump may hope his tariffs jump-start a renaissance in manufacturing in the United States, but the reality is not so simple, according to experts. Trump said "jobs and factories will come roaring back." "We will supercharge our domestic industrial base, we will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers and ultimately more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers," he said during his news conference. The U.S. has lost about 6 million jobs over the last four or five decades as companies moved operations overseas, largely because business could be done cheaper elsewhere, said Harry Moser, president of the nonprofit Reshoring Initiative. Moser said he would have preferred lower levies than those Trump announced. "As long as he convinces the other countries that he will keep attacking the problem until it's solved, then they will come forward and maybe let their currency go up a little bit," Moser said. "Maybe they'll lower their tariff barriers to our products. Maybe they'll encourage their companies to put factories here in the United States." Still, there are a number of issues to overcome to bring companies back to the United States, including uncertainty around the tariffs and how long they will stay in place, experts said. "Given the unpredictable nature of the path forward and the long lead times to build industrial capacity, we expect most businesses to proceed cautiously following this announcement," Edward Mills, Raymond James' Washington policy analyst, said in a note Wednesday. "New capacity can be added where feasible, but without certainty on longer-term policy, larger investments are more difficult." "If there's significant uncertainty, you might make some investments, but rather conservative, because you would like to see how it's going to play out." Kouvelis' research on Trump's 2018 targeted tariffs found that they did not have a big impact on reshoring or the return of jobs to the U.S. He said there was a negative effect for manufacturers, who had to pay more for raw materials, with reduced demand and capacity in some cases. Finished goods was a mixed story, depending on demand, he said. The latest levies are seen as "fluid and fickle" because they are based on executive orders from the president and were not done through Congress, said Christopher Tang, distinguished professor at the UCLA Anderson School of Management. Morgan Stanley analyst Chris Snyder said he thinks tariffs are a "positive catalyst" for reshoring but that he doesn't expect a massive wave of projects returning to the U.S. in the near term. "When we talk to corporations, there is a lot of uncertainty about what policy will be in three months," he said. In addition, consumer confidence has taken a hit — and that will be a factor in business' decisions on whether and when they will reshore, said Manish Kabra, Societe Generale's head of U.S. equity strategy. The Conference Board's monthly consumer confidence index hit a 12-year low in March. "When you have crisis of confidence, the confidence of global companies that have announced investments in the U.S., they are going to pause," Kabra said. A lot needs to happen before manufacturing can really ramp back up again in the U.S., experts said. "The United States is not ready to reshore. He said he expects some companies to return as a result of Trump's tariffs but that there are still a lot of barriers for many. Executives are under pressure to show short-term results in quarterly earnings, he said, and managing an American workforce can be complicated. There also needs to be a significant investment in training America's workforce, Moser said. Trump's tariff program "will fail unless the nation commits to a vastly increased recruiting and training program for skilled manufacturing workers and engineers," he said. Companies have announced investments worth $1.4 trillion since the election, according to Societe Generale's Kabra. That adds up to about 200,000 new jobs, he said. Automobile makers are likely among the industries that will reshore, experts said. Trump imposed a 25% tariff on imported cars and has also vowed to tax key auto parts. Manufacturers of gas-powered cars will have to weigh their options, since they already have a very streamlined supply chain, said University of Washington's Kouvelis. "The gas-powered car industry is in trouble with hard-to-adjust supply chains and not enough incentive to do it," he said. Electric vehicles are a different story, because they have fewer parts, the battery being the most important, so those companies are more likely to shift operations, he said. "Everybody understands the U.S. market is lucrative to lose, and the competitors with an advantage [such as Chinese companies] more or less are kept out," Kouvelis said. Snyder also said that EVs are among those likely to come to the U.S., but because they will need more capacity. While semiconductors and pharmaceuticals were exempt from the tariffs, they may still be targeted at a later date. Experts said they expect both industries to reshore. Semiconductor manufacturers got the incentive to return after Congress passed the CHIPS Act in 2022, which provided financial assistance and tax credits to those building and expanding facilities nationally. "Those are high tech, high-end technology and a lot of automation. They don't need that many workers," said Tang. With pharma companies, just some of the supply chain may come back, Kouvelis said. Formulation and packaging, however, can be done in the U.S., if that's enough to avoid tariffs, he said. Join us at the New York Stock Exchange!

The announcement sparked a stock market meltdown: The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each fell by more than 5% on Friday, following similar losses on Thursday. Collectively, the two-day drop wiped out $30.9 billion in net worth for Elon Musk, $23.49 billion for Jeff Bezos and $27.34 billion for Mark Zuckerberg — the world's three richest people, in that order — according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index. The newly announced tariffs are hitting tech stocks particularly hard, due to the industry's reliance on manufacturing, computer chips and IT services from countries like China, India and Taiwan. A decrease in American economic growth could also damage advertising revenue for Amazon and Meta, CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer noted on Thursday. Musk, who works closely with Trump as a senior advisor and de facto head of the administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), was already experiencing losses to his net worth in 2025. Tesla announced sales of 336,681 cars in this year's first quarter on Wednesday, a 13% drop compared to last year, marking its worst quarter since 2022. In total, Musk's fortune has taken a hit of $130 billion so far this year, the Bloomberg index says. Not all billionaires lost money on Thursday and Friday's rout. Rocket Mortgage co-founder and Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert gained $1.91 billion on Friday, giving him a net worth of $32.4 billion, according to Bloomberg's index. Slim, 85, who was named the world's richest person by Forbes from 2010 to 2013, got his start as a stock trader in Mexico in the 1960s. His estimated net worth of $80 billion comes primarily from holdings in his longtime industrial conglomerate Grupo Carso and Latin American telecom firm América Móvil, according to Forbes. Slim predicted that the Trump administration's tariffs will be temporary, and primarily used as a negotiation tactic, he told Bloomberg in an interview that published on Tuesday. On Thursday, Trump said he'd be open to negotiating tariff rates with other countries, despite White House aides insisting the opposite.

Shares are up more than 40% since the beginning of 2025. But perhaps more importantly, BYD has over the past several years released a slew of new technologies and features that are shifting its reputation from low-cost manufacturer to innovator. "When Western automakers talk about an existential threat coming out of China, they're definitely talking about this company called BYD," said Michael Dunne, a China auto market researcher, and CEO of Dunne Insights. "They have so many components in their arsenal. They're designing better-looking cars all the time. They have cars that are priced from $10,000 to $230,000. The latest of these is a platform that the company said can charge up to about 250 miles of range in about 5 minutes — only a bit longer than it takes to fill a gas tank. Part of what makes this potentially so threatening to rivals is BYD's history of delivering technology at low prices. This is in contrast to Tesla's "Full Self-Driving" system, which carries an extra charge. "Tesla, right now, it's definitely not for all. BYD is trying to do it for all," said Lei Xing, a China EV market analyst. If it pans out, BYD would be able to roll out cars that can charge in half the time of far more expensive vehicles, such as the rapidly charging Lucid Air. That model charges to about 200 miles of range in 12 minutes. But some EV analysts are skeptical of the new innovation, saying there are some technical hurdles, as well as potentially high costs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit Silicon Valley executives and financiers publicly opened their wallets in support of President Donald Trump's 2024 presidential run. The market can always turn around, but economists and investors aren't optimistic, and concerns are building of a potential recession. Apple slid 14% for the week, its biggest drop in more than five years. Tesla, led by top Trump adviser Elon Musk, plunged 9.2% and is now down more than 40% for the year. Nvidia, Meta and Amazon all suffered double-digit drops for the week. For Amazon, a ninth straight weekly decline marks its longest such losing streak since 2008. Online lender Klarna and ticketing marketplace StubHub delayed their IPOs due to market turbulence, just weeks after filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and fintech company Chime is also reportedly delaying its listing. CoreWeave, a provider of artificial intelligence infrastructure, last week became the first venture-backed company to raise more than $1 billion in a U.S. IPO since 2021. "You couldn't create a worse market and macro environment to go public," said Phil Haslett, co-founder of EquityZen, a platform for investing in private companies. CoreWeave investor Mark Klein of SuRo Capital previously told CNBC that the company could be the first in an "IPO parade." "It appears that the IPO parade has been temporarily halted," Klein told CNBC by email on Friday. "The current tariff situation has prompted these companies to pause and assess its impact." During last year's presidential campaign, prominent venture capitalists like Marc Andreessen backed Trump, expecting that his administration would usher in a boom and eliminate some of the hurdles to startup growth set up by the Biden administration. Andreessen and his partner, Ben Horowitz, said in July that their financial support of the Trump campaign was due to what they called a better "little tech agenda." A spokesperson for Andreessen Horowitz declined to comment. Venture capitalist Keith Rabois, a managing director at Khosla Ventures, posted on X on Thursday that "Trump Derangement Syndrome has morphed into Tariff Derangement Syndrome." He said tariffs aren't inflationary, are effective at reducing fentanyl imports, and he expects that "most other countries will cave and cave rapidly." At Sequoia Capital, which is the biggest investor in Klarna, outspoken Trump supporter Shaun Maguire, wrote on X, "The first long-term thinking President of my lifetime," and said in a separate post that, "The price of stocks says almost nothing about the long term health of an economy." However, Allianz Chief Economic Advisor Mohamed El-Erian warned on Friday that Trump's extensive raft of import tariffs are putting the U.S. economy at risk of recession. "You've had a major repricing of growth prospects, with a recession in the U.S. going up to 50% probability, you've seen an increase in inflation expectations, up to 3.5%," he told CNBC's Silvia Amaro on the sidelines of the Ambrosetti Forum in Cernobbio, Italy. Meanwhile, executives at tech's megacap companies were largely silent this week, and their public relations representatives declined to provide comments about their thinking. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was in the awkward position on Friday of celebrating his company's 50th anniversary at corporate headquarters in Redmond, Washington. Alongside Microsoft's prior two CEOs, Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, Nadella sat down with CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin for a televised interview that was planned well before Trump's tariff announcement. Ballmer, who was succeeded by Nadella in 2014, acknowledged to Sorkin that "disruption is very hard on people" and that, "as a Microsoft shareholder, this kind of thing is not good." C-suites may not be able to stay quiet for long, especially if the recent turmoil spills into next week. Lise Buyer, who previously helped guide Google through its IPO and now works as an adviser to companies going public, said there's no appetite for risk in the market under these conditions. But there is risk that staffers get jittery, and they'll surely look to their leaders for some reassurance. "Until markets settle out and we have the opportunity to access valuation levels, public company CEOs should work to calm potentially distressed employees," Buyer said in an email. "And private company managements should refine plans to get by on dollars already in the treasury." — CNBC's Hayden Field, Jordan Novet, Leslie Picker, Annie Palmer and Samantha Subin contributed to this report.

The vote, following an all-night legislative session, unlocks a maneuver that will allow Republicans to bypass the Senate's filibuster and pass the tax cuts later this year without Democratic votes. The measure also aims to raise the federal government's debt ceiling by $5 trillion, a move Congress has to make by summer or risk defaulting on $36.6 trillion in debt. It aims to partly offset the deficit-raising costs of tax cuts by cutting spending. Democrats have warned that Republican targets would imperil the Medicaid health insurance program for low-income Americans. Republican Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, warned that allowing the 2017 tax cuts to expire would hit Americans hard. "The average taxpayer would see a 22% tax hike. A family of four making $80,610, the median income in the United States, would see a $1,695 tax increase," Graham said. The 2017 cuts, Trump's signature legislative achievement in his first term, cut the top corporate tax cut to 21% from 35%, a move that is not set to expire. "The Republican bill that now sits before the Senate is poison," Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, said on Friday. "But as Americans learn that Republicans are doing it simply to give tax cuts to the ultra-rich, an electric shock is going to go through the American people." Hanging over the debate, which began late on Thursday, was a brutal stock market sell-off following Trump's sweeping new trade tariffs, which economists warned will drive up prices and could trigger a recession. Democrats offered dozens of amendments on matters ranging from protecting Social Security retirement benefits to shielding care for veterans. "On the one hand, it appears as if all this great savings is happening. The most controversial one, arguably, would be if Republicans end up including $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid. That, said independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, "would make a bad situation worse by throwing millions of kids off the health care that they have." Republicans have maintained that Medicaid would not be cut. If House Republicans get their way, there could be net spending cuts in the range of $2 trillion. The budget blueprint would also make room for increased security measures at the southwest border with Mexico and administration efforts to significantly ramp up immigrant deportations.

Beijing's response ratcheted up investor fears of inflationary, recessionary and global economic growth risks. "The market has spoken," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said in a post on Facebook on Saturday morning. He called on the White House to resolve differences with trading partners through "equal-footed consultation." A White House spokesperson was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC. U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced far-reaching new levies as part of a "reciprocal tariff" policy, including a 10% tariff on almost every country and much steeper duties on many. The U.S. president targeted China with 34% of additional reciprocal tariffs, bringing total U.S. tariffs against the world's second-largest economy to 54%. Trump on Friday appeared unfazed by the market backlash to his tariff rollout, posting on Truth Social that "big business" is not worried about the tariffs and that his "policies will never change."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Babies, homes, retirement, and business ventures — all major moves Americans have told BI they're putting on hold as the US reels from economic uncertainty. Federal student loan limbo is also leaving millions wondering how they will pay off their debt. "I feel like I just got done building a life out here," said a Washington DC 28-year-old who resigned from her government job and may have to move due to finances. "I was actually trying to own a home." While the US isn't in one yet, a major indicator of consumer sentiment hit a three-year low in March, and consumer spending was weaker than expected last month. Economists have said these conditions are making people less likely to make major purchases and take financial risks. While some Americans also told BI they support Trump's recent cost-cutting measures and don't plan to make any adjustments to their jobs or savings, six shared stories about holding off on major milestones. The 39-year-old wants to buy a home and have a baby, but she's not sure what her future monthly student-loan payments will look like. Thompson is enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of qualifying payments. Trump is taking steps to limit eligibility for the program, which could bar some borrowers from future relief. Thompson is also on the SAVE plan, created by President Joe Biden to give borrowers more affordable monthly payments. Thompson has not been able to make payments or earn PSLF credit while the lawsuit plays out. Now, Thompson isn't sure when she will have to add loan payments back into her budget — and how much those payments will be. "I have the money to pursue IVF, I have the money to buy a home," Thompson said. "But it's like the sword hanging above your head where you don't know when your monthly costs are going to increase and by how much. It's just a real uncertainty, and I know people are in much more difficult positions than myself. Until she knows what will happen with her student debt, Thompson is conflicted. Ashley Shannon submitted her resignation letter last month. But, as news flooded in about the firings of federal probationary workers, Shannon made the tough decision to leave her role. "Higher up in the agency, they pretty much told us it's either you leave or you're going to likely get fired and pushed out," she said. The career paths for Black women in private-sector law are more limited than in the federal workforce, and Shannon had been excited to build a career in the public interest. She had been making $100,000 a year and was building her life in Washington DC — hoping to buy her first home soon. "I would have to move back in with my family, find another job, and pretty much restart my entire life." Last fall, Bri O. moved back in with her parents. The 23-year-old works a finance job in Charlotte, North Carolina. Bri knew she wanted to live abroad at some point in her life — it's an opportunity to experience new cultures and she has her eyes set on Spain. As a young, queer woman, Bri said she doesn't feel safe living under the Trump administration, especially if she someday chooses to get married or start a family. The government "enacting policies against us in the queer community is having an effect on our lives," she said. She said she's sacrificing some of her independence by living with family right now, but it's worth it for her finances. Being at home is allowing her to put the money she would be spending on rent and other expenses into savings for her eventual move. "I'd love to stay in the country where all my friends and my family are," she said, adding, "It's disheartening that I'm leaving because of fear." Margarita Sdoukos, 49, thought she was going to retire early. She was confident that she and her husband would have a strong enough nest egg to stop working in six years. Due to living below their means, savvy investments, and careful saving habits, the couple felt financially comfortable. Now, Sdoukos isn't sure she will ever fully retire. The Illinois resident told BI that she and her husband have lost "tens of thousands" of dollars in the stock market since Trump took office in January, and they're shifting to safer investments for their 401(k), even if they are less lucrative. She's concerned about potential changes to Social Security, and now expects to continue working for as long as possible. "We don't even think about retirement right now," she said. Jessica Deseo, 40, has been in the design industry for nearly two decades. Deseo said she wants to put energy and money into growing her own business, but it comes with sacrifices. She's worried that potential clients won't have the extra budget to hire her as a freelancer and said that going out completely on her own would be an even bigger financial risk. Kathy Heller, 67, hoped to move out of her studio apartment in Pennsylvania and buy a new house. However, due to recent changes in the stock market and her fears about the future of Social Security, she said that may no longer be possible. Heller, who worked as a legal secretary, ate through some of her retirement savings while caring for her husband, who was ill for two decades. She works nearly full-time as a real estate agent to supplement her over $3,000 monthly Social Security survivor benefits. She said she's had to wait for four hours on the phone to contact a Social Security representative, and she said she's worried about what her finances may look like a few months from now, especially if Social Security is disrupted in any way.</p>
