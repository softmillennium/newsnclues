PayPal has added chainlink (LINK) and solana (SOL) to its growing list of supported cryptocurrencies, giving users of both PayPal and Venmo the ability to buy, hold, sell and transfer the tokens directly from their accounts.

The move reflects the payments giant's continued push into the cryptocurrency space after first launching crypto support in 2020. The new tokens will roll out to U.S. users over the next few weeks.

“Offering more tokens on PayPal and Venmo provides users with greater flexibility, choice, and access to digital currencies,” said May Zabaneh, PayPal's Vice President of Blockchain, Crypto, and Digital Currencies, in a press release.

The company, which has also launched its own U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, has last year moved to allow its business clients access crypto directly form their accounts in the U.S.

As the scandal continues to unfold and experts examine just how severely top officials have compromised US national security in that Signal chat leak—and embarrassed themselves through controversial post-statements—I want to take a closer look at one particular episode from the story.

At first, the White House denied that the chat ever existed. But when it became clear that there was too much evidence to refute, they shifted tactics, denying that the chat ever contained any classified information of national security significance. And indeed, what proof can journalist Jeffrey Goldberg present after leaving that chat? Moreover, the chat was set to self-destruct messages after a period of time. So imagine a court hearing where parties are required to present evidence, and the only available proof consists of screenshots—in other words, virtually nothing, as such evidence is almost impossible to verify.

The answer is rather simple—if the journalist had taken care to properly preserve such evidence. He could prove that he had access to sensitive information at a time when he should not have, by publishing cryptographic hash sums of that information. Had he not been in the chat, he would not have known when and where they were planning to strike Yemen, who the target was, and so forth. Certain details may become public later, but not at the time the chat occurred—correct?

The solution lies in a cryptographic method known as proof of existence without disclosure. It involves two basic elements: cryptographic hashes and reliable timestamps. This can be done on blockchain manually—if one knows the process—or through a variety of applications and services offering blockchain-based timestamping proofs.

Here's how it works: you write a message (for example, by copying and pasting from the chat), generate a hash sum of the message, publish it on a blockchain, and save the private key for the address used to publish it. You'll later need this private key to prove that it was your address (i.e., you personally) that published the hash, and thus that you had knowledge of the original message at that time. A social media account might also serve a similar function, but remember that social platforms are centralised systems—vulnerable and, unlike blockchains, not immutable.

So, there it is—a note for all journalists who may one day need to prove the existence of a fact without revealing its contents.

This process creates an undeniable, timestamped record confirming that a specific original message existed and was known to the publisher at the time the blockchain transaction was confirmed—all without revealing the content publicly until the journalist chooses to do so.

NEW YORK, April 5, 2025

NEW YORK, April 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- 



 



Why: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of Game of Silks non-fungible tokens ("NFTs"), including Silks Avatar NFTs, Silks Horse NFTs, and Silks Land NFTs, and who were damaged thereby, of the important April 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.

So what: If you purchased Game of Silks NFTs you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

What to do next: To join the Game of Silks class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=35918 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, Game of Silks created a metaverse game that brought real-life horse racing to the blockchain, allowing users to invest in virtual versions of real racehorses and earn money based on the real-world performance of those horses. The complaint further alleges that the Game of Silks NFTs, which were first sold beginning in April 2022, are securities as defined by the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"), and as such required registration statements, which were never filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Game of Silks violated the Securities Act by selling and soliciting the sale of unregistered Game of Silks NFT securities.

Further, the complaint also alleges that the defendants made material misstatements and omissions in connection with the sale of the Game of Silks NFTs, including failing to disclose critical financial information about Game of Silks' business model and sustainability.

To join the Game of Silks class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=35918 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Offering stability and long-term value growth, Bitcoin continues to remain the king of the crypto market, while Solana keeps its position as an excellent investment option due to its fast transactions, even more growing DeFi ecosystem, and high-speed Solana blockchain technology. The most important innovation in today's market is artificial intelligence and blockchain integration, a hybrid that receives the most attention and money from the institutions.

In the past few months, AI-powered crypto-assets have dominated other assets, outperforming them by far. Ozak AI is emerging among the spectrum of projects that are innovating and they clearly are doing something right. Ozak AI is taking the lead by using AI technology on multiple angles like enhancing crypto trading, smart contracts, predictive analytics and establishing itself as the most attractive crypto investment.

Ozak AI is currently in its presale stage, with its value pegged at $0.003 per $OZ token. This offers an unparalleled chance for early buyers to maximize their profits because even a small appreciation to $0.10 would return huge profits. In the instance Ozak AI hits its anticipated $1 mark with its planned listing price of $0.05, it would be considered one of the most opportunistic investments out in the market at the moment.

Ozak AI's impressive market reach is clear given that over $900,000 has already been raised during the presale phase. The project's unique approach has really served to grab the attention of casual investors and institutions alike and make sure that the AI-crypto space remains a strong investment. Ozak AI is still in its early stage and allows for early investment with massive growth potential, unlike Bitcoin and Solana, which have already been over-inflated.

Ozak AI blends traditional predictive market analytics with AI and decentralized network technologies for a groundbreaking solution. Ozak Stream Network (OSN) enables high-speed transmission of information, improving timely trading and investment decisions. Also, with the increase of security and resilience brought by the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN), Ozak AI has become one of the most dependable AI blockchain platforms offered.

The platform's advanced Prediction Agents (PAs) use sophisticated machine learning models that are capable of deriving accurate investment insights from real-time and historical data.

With secure data storage solutions provided by Ozak Data Vaults, investors benefit from enhanced data integrity and availability. These innovations cater to both retail and institutional markets, positioning Ozak AI as a leader in AI-powered financial analytics.

Apart from individual traders, Ozak AI assists companies in strategically predetermining and mitigating potential risks with advanced AI solutions. The businesses and financial companies that use Ozak's predictive instruments will create enormous demand for the $OZ token, which will further increase its value. Also, Ozak AI possesses far more tangible value in the realm of financial analytics as compared to Bitcoin, which serves primarily as a value holder, and Solana, which is the engine of DeFi applications.

To entice early adopters, Ozak AI is running a $1 million giveaway campaign, where 100 major prizes are awarded. To win, participants are required to take actions in the platform's marketing campaign while keeping at least $100 in $OZ Tokens. This project seeks to reward early adopters by increasing thrust in users that help propel the project.

Even though Bitcoin and Solana tend to remain powerful investment choices, Ozak AI stands out because of its unique blend of advanced AI implementation, tactical market placement, and lucrative price. What makes Ozak AI truly unique is its usage of artificial intelligence to augment blockchain structural functioning and financial market forecasting.

For those investors looking for limitless earning possibilities within the AI-crypto ecosystem, Ozak AI is the best bet right now. With its technological innovations, growing investor interest, and real-world applications, it has the potential to outperform both Bitcoin and Solana in terms of returns in the coming years.

 Bitcoin's resilience to the record $5 trillion sell-off signals an “evolution in Bitcoin's market positioning” that may fortify Bitcoin's status as a hedge against financial instability. 

Bitcoin is gaining renewed attention as a hedge against financial instability after holding relatively steady during a record-breaking stock market downturn that saw $5 trillion wiped from the S&P 500.

The S&P 500 posted a $5 trillion loss in market capitalization over two days, its largest drop on record, surpassing the $3.3 trillion decline in March 2020 during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an April 5 report by Reuters.

The record sell-off occurred after US President Donald Trump announced his reciprocal import tariffs on April 2. The measures aim to shrink the country's estimated trade deficit of $1.2 trillion in goods and boost domestic manufacturing.

Bitcoin's (BTC) dip after the tariff announcement was significantly smaller than traditional markets, proving Bitcoin's growing maturity as a global asset, according to Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder and chief operating officer of RedStone blockchain oracle firm.

“What we're potentially witnessing is an evolution in Bitcoin's market positioning,” the co-founder told Cointelegraph, adding:

“Bitcoin's fixed supply architecture inherently contrasts with fiat currencies that may face inflationary pressure under tariff-driven economic changes,” he added.

While stocks plunged, Bitcoin dipped just 3.7% over the same two-day period, trading at around $83,600 as of April 5, according to TradingView data.

Despite the $5 trillion sell-off in traditional markets, “BTC shows its worth, staying above its $82,000 key support level — a sign that structural demand remains intact even amid forced selling and elevated volatility,” Nexo dispatch analyst Iliya Kalchev told Cointelegraph.

Despite Bitcoin's decoupling from traditional stocks, its initial plunge in price signals that some investors still see Bitcoin as a risk asset, according to James Wo, the founder and CEO of venture capital firm DFG.

“With Bitcoin ETFs enabling greater institutional exposure, it is now even more influenced by macroeconomic trends,” Wo told Cointelegraph, adding:

Despite the current lack of momentum, analysts are confident in Bitcoin's upside potential for the rest of 2025.

The growing money supply could push Bitcoin's price above $132,000 before the end of 2025, according to estimates from Jamie Coutts, chief crypto analyst at Real Vision.

Bitcoin and crypto prices have been rocked by U.S. president Donald Trump's barrage of tariffs—with the Federal Reserve poised to blow up the bitcoin price.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!"

The bitcoin price dropped sharply after China sparked fears of a “crisis scenario” but has bounced back, breaking its correlation with the stock market.

Now, as the chief executive of BlackRock calls bitcoin potentially a “safer bet” than the U.S. dollar, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has declared bitcoin an emerging “store of value”—comparing it to gold.

“Bitcoin is becoming a store of value, gold's has historically been a store of value,” Bessent told podcaster Tucker Carlson, adding there are “a lot of different stores of value over time.”

Bessent's comments come as stock markets around the world fall sharply in the aftermath of Trump's so-called Liberation Day of trade tariffs that saw the U.S. implement a global baseline import tax of 10% and much higher rates for goods from dozens of countries.

“As risk assets continue to sell off, investors may increasingly rotate into traditional hedges like bonds and gold—or into bitcoin, which has shown notable resilience relative to equities in recent days," David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at bitcoin and crypto investment company 21Shares, said via email.

Gold, a traditional safe haven asset, is up around 15% so far this year as traders and central banks buy it to hedge against economic and geopolitical uncertainties.

“Bitcoin's price action this week has been a true testament to its investment case as an emerging store of value and potential for uncorrelated returns," Hernandez said.

The U.S. stock market has plummeted by around 10% since Trump followed through with his well-telegraphed global tariff regime that was more aggressive than traders had anticipated.

Trump himself shared a social media post with a caption reading: “Trump is purposely crashing the market."

The bitcoin price has, however, climbed over the course of the week, breaking its recent correlation with the stock market—specifically the tech heavy Nasdaq and the so-called Magnificent 7 stocks that includes Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, Nvidia and Tesla.

"What's happening with the market I'd say it's more a Mag 7 problem, not a MAGA problem," Bessent told Carlson, referring to the Trump administration's Make American Great Again series of policies that are focuses on rebuilding the country's manufacturing base.

“The Trump tariffs have unleashed volatility, notably shaking the U.S. equity markets, but with this, bitcoin's unique reaction deserves attention,” Joe Burnett, director of market research crypto financial company Unchained, said in emailed comments.

"Recalling March 2020, bitcoin rapidly bottomed and recovered first (before U.S. equities), a pattern potentially repeating today as bitcoin hasn't made new lows since March 11th. This resilience could signal a strategic entry point for long-term investors. Of course, if stocks continue falling aggressively over the coming weeks, it's reasonable to expect that bitcoin could experience another leg down too.”</p>

Crypto analyst and trader Ali Martinez is leaning bearish on one large-cap altcoin as he offers his outlook for Bitcoin (BTC) and the native token of the blockchain oracle Chainlink (LINK).

Martinez tells his 134,800 followers on the social media platform X that payments altcoin XRP (XRP) could plummet by around 37% from the current level after forming a head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily time frame.

A head-and-shoulders is a bearish pattern suggesting that an asset is losing bullish momentum after failing to print new highs with its right shoulder.

XRP, the fourth-largest crypto asset by market cap, is trading at $2.05 at time of writing.

Next up is Bitcoin. The analyst and trader says Bitcoin could flip bullish if the crypto king manages to retest a key price level as support. Specifically, Martinez says he's keeping a close watch on BTC's short-term holder (STH) realized price, a metric that tracks the average price at which all STHs acquired their coins.

STHs are defined as wallets that have held their coins for 155 days or less.

“The first signal that Bitcoin is ready to resume its bull run is reclaiming the short-term holder realized price at $90,570!”

Bitcoin is trading at $83,300 at time of writing.

The crypto analyst and trader also says that there are “signs of profit-taking” in the Bitcoin market as older coins return to crypto exchanges. Citing data from the blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant, Martinez says that more than 1,058 BTC, worth slightly over $88 million at the current price, were moved by long-term holders in just one day.

Long-term holders are entities that have kept their coins inactive for more than 155 days.

Looking at Chailink, Martinez warns that LINK could turn bearish as it tests an ascending trendline on the weekly chart that has kept the altcoin bullish since July 2023.

Chainlink is trading at $12.63 at time of writing.

Ethereum (ETH) showed resilience heading into the weekend, trading above $1,800 on Saturday despite the impact of Trump's tariff announcements sparking heavy losses across the stock market and in precious metals.

While ETH — like most top cryptos — held steady heading to the weekend, the S&P 500 fell nearly 6%, stretching its market capitalization decline to $5.06 trillion in the past two days. The Nasdaq-100 and Dow Jones saw heavy corrections, down 20% and 10%, respectively, from their all-time highs recorded in December. Gold and Silver also declined, dropping by 2.5% and 7.1%, respectively.

The losses across the financial market accelerated after Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Powell's hawkish statements at the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing conference in Virginia. Powell stated that the "larger-than-expected" tariffs could heighten inflation and slow growth, adding that the Fed will employ a "wait-and-see" approach to policy decisions.

"We are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance. It is too soon to say what will be the appropriate path for monetary policy," said Powell.

The statement increased expectations of recession, hence, the decline across stocks.

The resilience seen in Ethereum, and by extension, the crypto market, indicates investors are seeking a hedge for which crypto may be suited.

Ethereum was one of the top-performing assets in the brief COVID-induced recession of 2020, even outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) with a 460% gain. As a result, ETH could see a turnaround in the next few weeks if crypto holds steady amid global trade war tension — especially with the Pectra mainnet upgrade set for May 7.

ETH has been suffering from weak sentiments in the past months, underperforming top cryptos, including Bitcoin, XRP and Solana (SOL), during the recent post-election crypto rally. It also declined faster after the market saw a correction in late January, dropping nearly 55%, while BTC only declined by ~27%.

Ethereum saw $43.24 million in futures liquidations in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data. The total amount of long and short liquidations is $20.84 million and $22.41 million, respectively.

Buyers are attempting to defend the support level near $1,800, quickly pushing prices back above it within the past few hours after briefly dropping to $1,760.





ETH/USDT daily chart

If bulls continue defending this level, ETH could test a descending trendline resistance extending from March 24. A firm move above the trendline that establishes it as support could help ETH regain bullish momentum and test the $2,069 key resistance.

On the downside, ETH could fall to $1,500 if bulls fail to hold the $1,800 support.

The Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) is in the oversold region, indicating dominant bearish momentum and a potential for a reversal. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram is just above its neutral level. ETH could see a recovery if the Stoch exits oversold conditions and the histogram bars remain above their neutral level.

Ethereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain with smart contracts functionality. Its native currency Ether (ETH), is the second-largest cryptocurrency and number one altcoin by market capitalization. The Ethereum network is tailored for building crypto solutions like decentralized finance (DeFi), GameFi, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), etc.

Ethereum is a public decentralized blockchain technology, where developers can build and deploy applications that function without the need for a central authority. To make this easier, the network leverages the Solidity programming language and Ethereum virtual machine which helps developers create and launch applications with smart contract functionality.

Smart contracts are publicly verifiable codes that automates agreements between two or more parties. Basically, these codes self-execute encoded actions when predetermined conditions are met.

Staking is a process of earning yield on your idle crypto assets by locking them in a crypto protocol for a specified duration as a means of contributing to its security. Ethereum transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism on September 15, 2022, in an event christened “The Merge.” The Merge was a key part of Ethereum's roadmap to achieve high-level scalability, decentralization and security while remaining sustainable. Unlike PoW, which requires the use of expensive hardware, PoS reduces the barrier of entry for validators by leveraging the use of crypto tokens as the core foundation of its consensus process.

Gas is the unit for measuring transaction fees that users pay for conducting transactions on Ethereum. During periods of network congestion, gas can be extremely high, causing validators to prioritize transactions based on their fees.

Key Points

Do you experience FOMO, or the fear of missing out? I do, and I'm betting you do, too. It's a risky motivator that can have you doing things you wouldn't normally consider doing, and Wall Street is a treacherous place when it comes to FOMO. One of the big investing trends today is cryptocurrency, which is why I've had my eye on the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT 2.47%). But is this exchange-traded fund an easy way to crypto riches, or is it just too risky to bother with? I tried to clear away the FOMO and find out the answer for myself. 

The investment objective of the iShares Bitcoin Trust is to "reflect generally the performance of the price of Bitcoin." Its largest holding is, as you would expect given the exchange-traded fund's (ETF) name, Bitcoin. There's a little bit of cash on the ledger, too, but it isn't material. The iShares Bitcoin Trust is an easy way for people to invest in Bitcoin without having to go through the headaches of directly owning cryptocurrencies.

Image source: Getty Images.

If you have been thinking about jumping into crypto, this is a pretty attractive way to do it. That said, the expense ratio is a bit high for an ETF at 0.25%. But given the specialization of the product, that cost probably isn't unreasonable. And investors have been rewarded well, with the iShares Bitcoin Trust rising roughly 85% since its inception in early 2024. That, however, is where the problem comes in for an investor like me.



IBIT data by YCharts.

The chart above looks fairly reasonable. There are ups and downs, but the trend is generally higher and to the right. However, if you switch the chart to look at the drawdowns, you can see that there are some pretty sizable performance swings going on here. The chart below highlights that fact pretty clearly.

However, the swings aren't really the biggest problem with this graph. It is the time period. The graph covers the iShares Bitcoin Trust since it was created on Jan. 5, 2024. All that volatility occurred over a period of just 15 months or so. That's a shocking amount of volatility, but it's pretty much normal for the crypto market.



IBIT data by YCharts.

That is why I simply don't have what it takes to buy the iShares Bitcoin Trust. I am a conservative, income-oriented investor. I like stocks that are boring and reliable and that reward me for sticking around with regular, and preferably growing, dividend checks. None of that is on offer from the iShares Bitcoin Trust.

While I feel the pangs of missing out on big gains, I recognize that I wouldn't be able to sleep at night if I owned the iShares Bitcoin Trust. Buying it would go against just about every investment principle I hold dear. I'm sure there are a lot of people who have made a lot of money with this type of investment. Good for them; I wish them well, and I hope a deep drawdown doesn't wipe out all of their gains. But the iShares Bitcoin Trust doesn't have a place in my portfolio. It's simply too volatile, and it doesn't fit with my income goals.

Although the iShares Bitcoin Trust makes it easy to invest in Bitcoin, investors need to think carefully about what they are actually getting. Is buying the iShares Bitcoin Trust in keeping with your long-term investment plan, or are you thinking of buying it just because you're worried you're missing out? If the answer is FOMO, you probably shouldn't buy it. That's my plan with this strongly performing ETF.

Crypto whales have begun to quietly shift their altcoin positions following Trump's Liberation Day tariffs. Uniswap (UNI), Chainlink (LINK), and Ondo Finance (ONDO) have all seen declines in the number of wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 tokens.

While the sell-off hasn't been dramatic, the timing and consistency across multiple tokens suggest growing caution or short-term repositioning. As these altcoins face key support and resistance levels, whale behavior could continue to shape their price trajectories in the coming days.

The number of Uniswap (UNI) addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 tokens has been steadily declining, a trend that began before Trump's so-called Liberation Day and has continued in its aftermath. 

Between April 2 and April 3 alone, this group of crypto whales dropped from 825 to 821, signaling a slight but notable reduction in confidence or positioning from a segment often seen as strategically reactive. 

While this decline may seem modest, it reflects a broader sentiment of caution among larger UNI holders, which often precedes or reinforces price weaknesses.

Currently, UNI price remains in a clear downtrend, with growing risks of a drop toward the $5.50 level or even below it if bearish momentum continues. However, if the trend begins to reverse, the token could first test resistance at $5.97. 

A successful breakout from there could push Uniswap higher toward $6.23, a level that would suggest a stronger recovery is underway. 

For now, though, the decrease in whale-sized wallets and prevailing bearish momentum place the asset in a vulnerable technical position.

While the number of Chainlink (LINK) whale addresses—those holding between 10,000 and 100,000 LINK—only slightly declined after Trump's Liberation Day, falling from 2,859 to 2,855, the context leading up to that matters more. 

From March 29 to April 1, this group was actively accumulating, with the number of crypto whales rising from 2,852 to 2,860. This short burst of accumulation suggested growing confidence in LINK's upside potential heading into the month. 

The recent dip may simply reflect mild profit-taking or caution during the current correction rather than a broader shift in sentiment.

Technically, LINK is at a critical point. If the ongoing correction deepens, the token could fall below $12 for the first time since November 2024, with $11.85 as the key support to watch. 

However, if the trend shifts and buyers regain control, LINK could first test resistance at $13. A break above that level would likely open the door for a move toward $13.45. 

ONDO is showing a trend similar to Chainlink, with whale accumulation taking place between March 26 and March 29 as the number of addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ONDO grew from 376 to 390. 

This wave of accumulation pointed to growing interest and confidence from larger holders. However, after peaking, the number of whales started to drop, falling from 374 to 371 following Trump's Liberation Day. 

This decline, while subtle, may indicate a pause in optimism or a cautious shift in positioning among key players.

From a price perspective, ONDO now sits at an important moment. If it can regain the bullish momentum seen last month, it could push through the resistance at $0.82, with the potential to climb further toward $0.90 or even $0.95 if strength persists. 

However, if momentum continues to fade, downside risks increase, with support levels around $0.76 and $0.73 likely to be tested.
