                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new pilot study from UBC Okanagan and Thompson Rivers University examined how medically supervised cannabis use in a residential recovery home may support people in treatment for substance use challenges. Our findings suggest medical cannabis could play a meaningful role in reducing cravings and improving retention in recovery programs. Participants clearly indicated benefits in managing both physical and psychological challenges during recovery." Dr. Zach Walsh, psychology professor at UBC Okanagan and co-lead researcher However, stigma surrounding cannabis use remains a significant barrier, according to the research. Staff interviews revealed a need for increased education and better integration into the cannabis treatment approach. "Reducing stigma through targeted education for program staff is critical," says Dr. Florriann Fehr, co-lead researcher and nursing professor at Thompson Rivers University. "Staff skepticism often comes from misunderstandings about cannabis as a legitimate medical treatment, highlighting a clear opportunity for improvement in recovery support." The study, recently published in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs, was conducted by researchers from UBC Okanagan and Thompson Rivers University. This collaboration between institutions in Kelowna and Kamloops sought to better understand patient and staff experiences with medically supervised cannabis use in a supportive recovery environment. It examined patient and staff experiences at Maverick Supportive Recovery, a residential recovery centre in the BC interior. Residential recovery centres provide structured, live-in environments where people receive treatment and support to manage substance use disorders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a federally funded study, researchers from Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah (the U) found that 7% of Medicare patients cross state borders for cancer care, and rates were nearly double for those who lived in rural areas. This has important implications for telehealth policies and physician licensure, says Tracy Onega, PhD, MA, MPAS, MS, senior author of the study, senior director of population sciences at Huntsman Cancer Institute, and professor of population sciences at the U. A key research priority at Huntsman Cancer Institute is working to enhance access to care for cancer patients who live far from a major medical center. But there are limitations on how physicians can follow up with their patients and practice across state lines, virtually, with telehealth. The team-whose research results were published in JAMA Network Open-surveyed over 1 million Medicare beneficiaries with cancer. Those figures were much higher for rural patients. Onega says telemedicine, the delivery of health-related care through virtual conversations with a health care professional, can't replace these types of services provided in a clinical setting. "Patients are traveling across state lines for specialized cancer treatment services that need to be done in a brick-and-mortar clinic-but surgical assessment and follow-ups could be offered by telehealth. "This would reduce additional travel burdens for all patients and their caregivers, especially those in rural and frontier areas." Telehealth in cancer care can also be used to manage treatment-related side effects, clinical trial check-ins, and prevention services. Onega says access to this service is particularly important for Huntsman Cancer Institute, whose clinicians provide comprehensive cancer care to five largely rural Mountain West states: Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming. Many patients travel far distances to access health care, in particular the kind of specialized care that's needed for cancer treatment. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, 37% of adults over the age of 18 were found to have used telehealth in 2022. The practice of medicine is governed by individual state medical boards and the cross-state licensure policies vary by state. Some states have more favorable telehealth policies, encouraging connected care regardless of location, while others have retained decades-old policies predating telehealth technologies. Unfortunately, for many rural patients, antiquated medical licensure governance prohibits their providers from engaging with them through telehealth. "Some states have reciprocity, meaning that a doctor licensed in Utah may also be automatically licensed in the next state over. "It would be great to expand those options so that we don't have so many of these barriers for physicians to be able to provide services across state lines by telehealth." Onega says an altered policy could mean better outcomes for patients, their caregivers, provider teams, and insurers. People are living longer and better lives after a cancer diagnosis," says Onega. "We want to make sure that people who live far away from an urban area can have all the same benefits."
