                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica Tuesday afternoon as a catastrophic Category 5 storm with an estimated maximum sustained winds of 185 mph. The storm landed in southwestern Jamaica near New Hope and is expected to exit around St. Ann parish in the north, forecasters said. Landslides, fallen trees and numerous power outages were reported ahead of Melissa's landfall, with officials in Jamaica cautioning that the cleanup and damage assessment would be slow. “There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5,” Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said Monday. The U.S. State Department is telling citizens in the path of Hurricane Melissa to “depart ASAP if still possible.” It says they should prepare to shelter in place if they can't. Experts say Hurricane Melissa's 185 mph winds and 892 millibars of central pressure on landfall tied two different records for the strongest Atlantic storm upon hitting land. Colin Bogle is a Mercy Corps adviser based near Kingston. “People are anxious and just trying to hold on until the storm passes.” United Nations spokesperson Stephane Dujarric has told reporters that authorities in Cuba “plan to evacuate about half a million people to safer ground.” Melissa is expected to make landfall in eastern Cuba late Tuesday or early Wednesday. The U.N. says it is preparing humanitarian aid for Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti. The National Hurricane Center says Melissa made landfall in southwestern Jamaica near New Hope and was moving north-northeast at 9 mph (15 kph). That's according to Jamaica's Meteorological Service and other experts. Melissa is the strongest Atlantic hurricane to make landfall since Hurricane Dorian made landfall on Abaco Island in the Bahamas in 2019 with 185 mph winds. That's according to Philip Klotzbach, a Colorado State University hurricane researcher. Reports on social media and state television showed blue-and-white buses ferrying evacuees to shelter. “This phenomenon is very dangerous,” Deputy Prime Minister Eduardo Martínez said in a statement from Banes, where he was located in what appeared to be a shelter. “It's going to be a very dangerous scenario,” said Michael Brennan, director of the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami, warning that there would be “total building failures.” Brennan said Jamaica's highest mountains could see wind gusts of up to 200 mph (321 kph). “It's just a catastrophic situation playing out here for Jamaica,” he said. Brennan noted that Melissa would make landfall in eastern Cuba overnight Tuesday or early Wednesday. “We have boats, helicopters, you name it,” he said. They included a new reggae jam that referenced Melissa. A man walks in Kingston, Jamaica, as Hurricane Melissa approaches, Tuesday, Oct. 28, 2025.

Meanwhile, the nonprofit Direct Relief said it has two packages with enough medications to treat 3,000 people in one month staged in Panama and ready to deploy. It also will send a shipment of 100 field medic packs from its warehouse in California as soon as the island's main airport reopens. Some 200 people crowded in its shelter by late Monday. “It's definitely more than last time,” said Jason Fuller, a firefighter and shelter volunteer, referring to the number of people that sought shelter from Hurricane Beryl last year. Hurricane Melissa has intensified into a Category 5 storm as it draws closer to Jamaica, where forecasters say it will unleash catastrophic flooding, landslides and widespread damage. (AP video shot by: Matias Delacroix, Jordany Junior Verdieu) Melissa is forecast to make landfall in Jamaica on Tuesday before crossing Cuba and the Bahamas through Wednesday. Scientists said this is the fourth storm in the Atlantic this year to undergo rapid intensification of its wind speed and power. “That part of the Atlantic is extremely warm right now — around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 2 to 3 degrees Celsius above normal,” said Akshay Deoras, a meteorologist at the University of Reading, in the United Kingdom. Deoras, who has tracked the impact of climate change on weather phenomena for decades, said scientists are seeing storms intensify quickly. Anything in the backyard that isn't tied down, such as furniture and barbecue grills, should be secured or brought inside so it doesn't become a projectile that can come through a window, said Shawn Schulze, regional CEO for the American Red Cross Texas Gulf Coast Region. If possible, board up windows and place important documents such as passports and birth certificates in a waterproof case or even a Ziploc bag, Schulze said. That will prevent damage and make documents easier to locate in a quick evacuation. Some preparation needs to happen well before a storm is imminent. That includes trimming or removing dead or weakened tree limbs and shrubs that hang over homes to lessen potential damage from high winds, said Mistie Hinote, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Insurance. Read more about how to prepare for a hurricane The U.S. National Hurricane Center warned Monday that Hurricane Melissa could cause catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides in parts of Jamaica, Cuba and Hispaniola. Earthquakes, heavy rain and changes to the soil, such as construction or agricultural practices, can trigger landslides. Melissa's relatively slow movement, path over mountainous terrain and “tremendous” rainfall amounts up to 40 inches (102 centimeters) in certain localities are ingredients that are contributing to a “worrisome” landslide risk, said Brian Tang, a professor of atmospheric science at University at Albany. It really runs very quickly down the hillsides,” said Tang. According to Jamaica's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, landslides are the most common natural hazard in the island nation. Melissa was also expected to make landfall in eastern Cuba late Tuesday as a powerful hurricane. A hurricane warning was in effect for Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantánamo and Holguin provinces, while a tropical storm warning was in effect for Las Tunas. Up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain were forecast for parts of Cuba, along with a significant storm surge along the coast. Melissa has also drenched the southern regions of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, with a tropical storm warning still in effect for Haiti. On Tuesday morning, Melissa was centered about 55 miles (90 kilometers) south-southeast of Negril, Jamaica, and about 265 miles (430 kilometers) southwest of Guantánamo, Cuba. The system had maximum sustained winds of 175 mph (280 kph) and was moving north-northeast at 7 mph (11 kph), according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. Colin Bogle, a Mercy Corps advisor based near Kingston, said most families are sheltering in place despite the government ordering evacuations in flood-prone communities. Necephor Mghendi, the international Red Cross' regional head of delegation for the English- and Dutch-speaking Caribbean, said that an estimated 1.5 million people in the storm's path will be affected, but many others as well. U.N. agencies and dozens of nonprofits had food, medicine and other essential supplies prepositioned as they awaited a distribution rush after the storm. Matthew Samuda, Jamaica's water and environment minister, said he had more than 50 generators available to deploy after the storm, but warned people to set aside clean water and use it sparingly. People take shelter at a school ahead of Hurricane Melissa's forecast arrival in Old Harbour, Jamaica, Monday, Oct. 27, 2025. Hurricane Melissa was set to pummel Jamaica on Tuesday as a catastrophic Category 5 storm, the strongest to lash the island since recordkeeping began 174 years ago. “There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5,” Prime Minister Andrew Holness said.</p>

On Monday, Walz announced a plan to provide $4 million in emergency funding to support food shelves while blaming President Donald Trump and Republicans for the ongoing shutdown. He cited comments made by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. "They are choosing not to fund these programs … and when the White House press secretary said the top priority is the ballroom, we could not disagree more," Walz said. However, Leavitt's remarks came when a reporter asked whether Trump was considering other renovations or major projects at the White House aside from the ballroom and Rose Garden patio. "Not to my knowledge, no, but he's a builder at heart — clearly — and so his heart and his mind are always churning about how to improve things here on the White House grounds," Leavitt said. "But at this moment in time, of course, the ballroom is really the president's main priority." The Republican National Committee said Walz was "shamelessly continuing Democrats' lie about Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt."

(Eric Lee/Getty Images) Fox News Digital has reached out to Walz's office for comment. Other Democrats have also accused Trump of prioritizing the ballroom rather than issues important to voters. "The Trump administration just declared that erecting a ballroom is the President's main priority," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., wrote on X in response to Leavitt's remarks. The cost of living is way too high and the Republican healthcare crisis threatens millions of Americans." PolitiFact, a fact-checking website that rates the accuracy of claims by elected officials, noted that his statement was false. The construction of a new formal ballroom has become a political lightning rod, despite the cost being financed jointly by Trump and private donors, not taxpayers. The new ballroom will accommodate approximately 650 seated guests and will stay true to the White House's classical design, Leavitt said in July. Louis Casiano is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The White House's East Wing is gone. With its demise, President Donald Trump continues to rewrite history, including the traditions of how a US president can take a bulldozer to the “people's house.” It's a massive $350 million project he said will be paid for by private donors. The viral images of the demolition awakened intense emotions ranging from horror to celebration, and stirred questions of what this new White House means for everyday Americans. “[There are] those that do see it representing prosperity; that certainly can be aspirational,” said Debbie Millman, designer and educator at the School of Visual Arts in New York City. “But that's not the status of most Americans.” We spoke with Millman about Trump's legacy of destroying historical artifacts and enraging the public. It's a legacy that began with his father Fred Trump, and shares a throughline with the architectural visions of monarchs and dictators. Below is an excerpt of the conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify. Oh, my gut reaction is one of heartbreak. He's not gotten any, at all, to do something like this. If you go to the White House website, they very craftily put up a historical list of other renovations that have occurred. But those were always done with the permission of historians, preservationists, architects that were quite open about what was being done, with blueprints and so forth. And so it's a little bit of a game of hide and seek here, where there seems to be an openness to what's being done. There are no floor plans that have been shared. There's a couple of nondescript drawings that have been shared, but [they] don't in any way feature what's happening on the inside of the building more than just a footprint. President Trump is not known for his restraint. He likes things that some people might call tacky or gaudy. If you look at what Americans are saying about this remodel, some people see those visual choices as representative of prosperity, as representative of success. The answer to that is very much about what you believe to be true about representation. This is the “people's house.” It's not one person's house. President Trump has long treated architecture as his tool of identity, as has his father in 1966. [Fred Trump] tore down a 19th-century amusement park in Coney Island and promised that he would preserve some of the historical elements, but they didn't. Instead they threw a party at the demo site. Believe it or not, there were bikini-clad, hard-hat wearing models, and Fred Trump handed out bricks for people to throw at the glass front of the historic pavilion there, to dismantle and destroy it, as opposed to preserve it for historical purposes. And then [Donald] Trump followed suit in 1980; he demolished the Bonwit Teller building on Fifth Avenue to be able to make way for Trump Tower, and he promised the limestone art deco reliefs to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but he destroyed them. And when asked about that later, he shrugged his shoulders and provided a sense of disdain for them as opposed to respect. This is not something that he hasn't done before. And it shows a lack of respect for history. It shows a lack of respect for preserving artifacts that have value and meaning to create something that is benefiting only really himself. Well, the new ballroom is estimated at 90,000 square feet. He created gardens that reflected his ideals. But a lot of that was because of what seemed to be imminent collapse of parts of the building that were so unsafe that there was really no other recourse but to do that. Of course, Jacqueline Kennedy — her restoration project in general emphasized historical continuity. She also obviously created the Rose Garden. She did a lot to the grounds, all of which had been demolished. [Editor's note: In July, Trump paved over the Rose Garden to create a tiled patio.] So this is not the first destruction of pieces of the White House that Trump wants to remake as a zone for primarily celebratory or party reasons, as opposed to [for] reasons that reflect more safety or preservation or augmentation for the people, as opposed to [for] billionaire donors. All right, so other presidents have changed the White House, but you're saying this sort of belies comparison. If there's no real comparison in the US, are there comparisons elsewhere, other world leaders who have done this sort of thing? Louis XIV's decision for the design of Versailles transformed what was a royal residence into a stage on which his reign would be essentially performed. The current ballroom holds, I think, about 250 people. And that was not always a feasible or comfortable situation. If it was raining, people had to walk on plastic. But that doesn't mean we need to have the over-the-top showpiece that does not reflect the soul of this country. You are an expert in your field. And President Trump has done this thing in America that's very interesting: He's cast a lot of doubt on experts in favor of regular people, ordinary folk. I have those regular people on my side, and if I choose to remake the White House in my image or the image of something else, that's what ordinary Americans voted for.” Madam Expert, what do you think about that argument? Well, this is not a reflection of or for the people. And the fact that this has been funded by and hosted for billionaires in exchange for recognition of their own brands as part of this really refutes that statement. In my opinion, one of the great tenets of a brand is: Can you remove the logo and still identify what it is? It will be defined by over-the-top opulence — truly exaggerated and cumbersome scale. And I think it's converting what is considered to be, and has always been considered to be and described as, “the house of the people” into a stage for Trump's personal aggrandizement. The surprising path to more truly personal medicine. Officers shot his friend and fellow pastor with a pepper bullet. In his second term, Trump's rhetoric and policies regarding the trans community have become far more menacing.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MIAMI (AP) — The federal agent had a daring pitch for Nicolás Maduro's chief pilot: All he had to do was surreptitiously divert the Venezuelan president's plane to a place where U.S. authorities could nab the strongman. Over the next 16 months, even after retiring from his government job in July, Lopez kept at it, chatting with the pilot over an encrypted messaging app. The untold, intrigue-filled saga of how Lopez tried to flip the pilot has all the elements of a Cold War spy thriller — luxury private jets, a secret meeting at an airport hangar, high-stakes diplomacy and the delicate wooing of a key Maduro lieutenant. More broadly, the scheme reveals the extent — and often slapdash fashion — to which the U.S. has for years sought to topple Maduro, who it blames for destroying the oil-rich nation's democracy while providing a lifeline to drug traffickers, terrorist groups and communist-run Cuba. Stay up to date with the latest news from AP. Since returning to the White House, Donald Trump has taken an even harder line. This month, Trump authorized the CIA to conduct covert actions inside Venezuela, and the U.S. government has also doubled the bounty for Maduro's capture on federal narco-trafficking charges, a move that Lopez sought to leverage in a text message to the pilot. “I'm still waiting for your answer,” Lopez wrote the pilot on Aug. 7, attaching a link to a Justice Department press release announcing the reward had risen to $50 million. Details of the ultimately unsuccessful plan were drawn from interviews with three current and former U.S. officials, as well as one of Maduro's opponents. All spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were either not authorized to discuss the effort or feared retribution for disclosing it. In this image made from a video posted on the Facebook account of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Dec. 15, 2023, Maduro stands behind pilot Gen. Bitner Villegas in the cockpit of an airplane. Attempts to locate the pilot, Venezuelan Gen. Bitner Villegas, were not successful. The Venezuelan government did not respond to a request for comment. Lopez, 50, was then an attaché at the embassy and agent for Homeland Security Investigations, a part of the Department of Homeland Security. A wiry former U.S. Army Ranger from Puerto Rico, Lopez was leading the agency's investigations into transnational criminal networks with a presence in the Caribbean, after a storied career taking down drug gangs, money launderers and fraudsters. His work dismantling an illicit money-changing operation in Miami even earned him a public rebuke in 2010 from Hugo Chávez, Maduro's predecessor. The embassy assignment was to be his last before retirement. He was handed a 3x5 index card with the tipster's name and phone number. When he called, the tipster claimed that two planes used by Maduro were in the Dominican Republic undergoing costly repairs. Lopez was intrigued: He knew that any maintenance was most likely a criminal violation under U.S. law because it would've involved the purchase of American parts, prohibited by sanctions on Venezuela. The planes were also subject to seizure – for violating those same sanctions. Tracing them to Maduro would take federal investigators months. As they built that case, they learned that the Venezuelan president had dispatched five pilots to the island to retrieve the multimillion-dollar jets – a Dassault Falcon 2000EX and Dassault Falcon 900EX. Maduro had been indicted in 2020 on federal narco-terrorism charges accusing him of flooding the U.S. with cocaine. At the airport hangar, a short distance from the jet, Lopez and fellow agents asked each pilot to join them individually in a small conference room. The agents pretended not to know that the pilots spent their time jetting around Maduro and other top officials. They spoke to each airman for about an hour, saving their biggest target for last: Villegas, who the agents had determined was Maduro's regular pilot. A former Venezuelan official who regularly traveled with the president described him as friendly, reserved and trusted by Maduro. The planes he flew were used to shuttle Maduro across the globe –- often to U.S. adversaries like Iran, Cuba and Russia. In a December 2023 video posted online by Maduro, Villegas can be seen holding up a radio in the cockpit as the president trades patriotic slogans with the pilot of a Russian Sukhoi fighter jet. Villegas at first tried to dodge the questions, but eventually admitted he had been a pilot for both leaders. Unbeknownst to Villegas, one of Lopez's colleagues recorded the conversation on a cell phone. As the conversation wrapped up, the two people said, Lopez made his pitch: In exchange for secretly ferrying Maduro into America's hands, the pilot would become very rich and beloved by millions of his compatriots. Yet, before departing, he gave Lopez his cell number. It seized one, registered in the European microstate of San Marino to a shell company from St. Vincent and the Grenadines, in September 2024. Lopez told Rubio that the plane contained a “ treasure trove of intelligence,” including the names of Venezuelan air force officers and detailed information about its movements. Lopez affixed a seizure warrant to the jet. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, right, listens to Edwin F. Lopez, the attaché for DHS Homeland Security Investigations, second from left, next to the Venezuelan government airplane that Rubio announced is being seized by the U.S. during a news conference at La Isabela International Airport in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, Feb. 6, 2025. At left is Dominican Public Prosecutor Enmanuel Ramirez, and holding the “seized” sign is Robert Cunniff from the U.S. Department of Commerce. Maduro's government reacted angrily, releasing a statement that accused Rubio of “brazen theft.” As he assembled the forfeiture in concert with other federal agencies, Lopez focused on coaxing Villegas to join his plot. Maduro had made it exceedingly costly for anyone who turns against him. Since taking office in 2013, he has brutally repressed protests, leading to scores of arrests, while jailing even once-powerful allies suspected of disloyalty. The pair texted on WhatsApp and Telegram about a dozen times. One described the former agent as obsessed with bringing Maduro to justice. “He felt he had an unfinished mission to complete,” said an exiled member of Maduro's opposition who spoke on the condition of anonymity over concerns about his safety. That commitment, he added, makes Lopez “more valuable to us than many of Maduro's biggest opponents inside Venezuela.” After the August text about the $50 million reward, Lopez sent another saying there was “still time left to be Venezuela's hero and be on the right side of history.” But he did not hear back. “Where are you heading?” wrote Lopez, using a new number. “Who is this?” responded Villegas, either not recognizing the number or feigning ignorance. “We Venezuelans are cut from a different cloth,” Villegas wrote. Lopez sent him a photo of them talking to each other on a red leather couch at the airplane hangar the previous year. Two hours later, Lopez tried one last time, mentioning Villegas' three children by name and a better future he said awaited them in the U.S. “The window for a decision is closing,” Lopez wrote, shortly before Villegas blocked his number. The day after the testy WhatsApp exchange between Lopez and Villegas, Marshall Billingslea – a close ally of Venezuela's opposition – took action. A former national security official in Republican administrations, Billingslea had for weeks been trolling Maduro. President Nicolas Maduro flashes victory signs during Indigenous Day in Caracas, Venezuela, Oct 12, 2025. “Feliz cumpleanos ‘General' Bitner!” he wrote in a mocking birthday wish on X the day Villegas turned 48. Billingslea included side-by-side photographs that would be sure to raise eyebrows. The other was an official air force photo with a gold star denoting his new rank affixed to the shoulder epaulet. The X post was published at 3:01 p.m. — a minute before another sanctioned Airbus that Maduro has been known to fly took off from Caracas' airport. The birthday wish, seen by almost 3 million people, sent shockwaves across Venezuelan social media, as Maduro's opponents speculated the pilot had been ordered to return to face interrogation. Nobody saw or heard from Villegas for days. Then, on Sept. 24, the pilot resurfaced, in an air force flight suit, on a widely followed TV show hosted by Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello. Cabello laughed off any suggestion that Venezuela's military could be bought. As he praised Villegas' loyalty, calling him an “unfailing, kick-ass patriot, ” the pilot stood by silently, raising a clenched fist in a display of his loyalty.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For example, Gates wrote, “If a pregnant woman is already malnourished and then has her food supply cut off because of a flood, she's even more likely to give birth prematurely, and her baby is more likely to start life underweight. “I'm not saying we should ignore temperature-related deaths because diseases are a bigger problem, “ he continued. “What I am saying is that we should deal with disease and extreme weather in proportion to the suffering they cause, and that we should go after the underlying conditions that leave people vulnerable to them. While we need to limit the number of extremely hot and cold days, we also need to make sure that fewer people live in poverty and poor health so that extreme weather isn't such a threat to them,” he said. His evaluation is in line with Energy Secretary Chris Wright's, who has said that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. However, he says climate change as an issue should not be prioritized over poverty and human health. “However, representing it as the most urgent threat to humanity today displaces concerns about more pressing threats of malnutrition, access to clean water, air pollution, endemic diseases, and human rights, among others.” However, this week, Gates reframed the debate, warning against “focusing too much on near-term emissions goals.” People will be able to live and thrive in most places on Earth for the foreseeable future. Emissions projections have gone down, and with the right policies and investments, innovation will allow us to drive emissions down much further,” he wrote. “Unfortunately, the doomsday outlook is causing much of the climate community to focus too much on near-term emissions goals, and it's diverting resources from the most effective things we should be doing to improve life in a warming world,” he added. The biggest problems are poverty and disease, just as they always have been,” he said. Gates' evolution of thought on the climate debate comes after his long history of seeking to lower temperatures, including by founding Breakthrough Energy with the goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. He has conducted similar efforts to combat climate change through his charitable organization, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It is causing a tragic number of deaths, making people afraid to leave home, and leading to economic hardship not seen in many generations. Its effects are rippling across the world.… Obviously, I am talking about COVID-19. But in just a few decades, the same description will fit another global crisis: climate change.” “I knew, as I traveled to Africa and saw that there were no lights at night and no power lines, that electrification is a necessary step in terms of economic growth, and so we had to somehow figure out a cheap way to get electricity into at least African cities. Because, particularly in equatorial regions, towards late this century, the effect on subsistence farmers was going to be horrific. That is, there will be millions of deaths caused by climate [change] — and for exactly the people who caused it the least,” Gates said. “And when I would meet with smart people who aren't full-time on climate, they would ask, ‘Come on, what about this climate thing? Isn't there some [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] guy who says the clouds will stop it? This week, Gates pivoted, arguing that existential questions shouldn't center around the climate, but about creating opportunity for human flourishing that allows people to escape the immediate and looming consequences of climate change. “Make a strategic pivot,” he urged ahead of the COP30 summit. It's the best way to ensure that everyone gets a chance to live a healthy and productive life, no matter where they're born, and no matter what kind of climate they're born into.” He discussed his vaccine-related work and sat next to first lady Melania Trump.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Los Angeles Dodgers outlasted the Toronto Blue Jays with a 6-5, 18-inning win in Game 3 of the World Series on Monday night, producing a lengthy list of records topped by Shohei Ohtani as they took a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven matchup. Ohtani was the Dodgers' designated hitter a day before he is to pitch in Game 4 and had one of the most memorable games at the plate in World Series history. Los Angeles Dodgers' Freddie Freeman celebrates his walk off home run against the Toronto Blue Jays during the 18th inning in Game 3 of baseball's World Series, Monday, Oct. 27, 2025, in Los Angeles. Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto celebrates their win against the Toronto Blue Jays during the 18th inning in Game 3 of baseball's World Series, Monday, Oct. 27, 2025, in Los Angeles. Winning Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Will Klein (61) celebrates with Blake Treinen (49) and Alex Call (12) during 18th inning Game 3 World Series playoff MLB baseball action in Los Angeles on Monday, Oct. 27, 2025. Seven years and one day after outlasting the Boston Red Sox over 18 innings in Game 3, Los Angeles did it again, beating the Toronto Blue Jays 6-5 Monday night on Freddie Freeman's 18th-inning home run off Brendon Little to take a two games to one lead in the best-of-seven matchup. Dodgers rookie reliever Justin Wrobleski, having gotten five outs in the sixth and seventh innings, was astonished at what he saw. He tied the record of reaching base nine times. He even stayed in the game after being stricken by a leg cramp while he was caught stealing in the ninth inning. A night to remember saw 609 pitches thrown over 6 hours, 39 minutes. The Dodgers outhit the Blue Jays 16-15 in a game that included a 10-inning double shutout — no runs were scored from innings eight through 17. Los Angeles went 2 for 14 with runners in scoring position and stranded 18 runners, and Toronto was 2 for 12 RISP with 19 left on base. “It takes everybody to win a World Series,” said the Dodgers' Max Muncy, who hit the winning 18th-inning homer against Nathan Eovaldi in 2018 — the only LA win in that Series. In an array of defensive gems, right fielder Addison Barger cut down Freeman at the plate with a 98.5 mph missile, Toronto first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. threw out Teoscar Hernández at third with an 87.6 mph rocket, Dodgers second baseman Tommy Edman gunned down Isiah Kiner-Falefa from short right field and Hernández relayed to Edman to throw out Davis Schneider at the plate. Sandy Koufax, a three-time World Series champion two months shy of his 90th birthday, stayed until the end. Nathan Lukes fouled off Kershaw's second full-count pitch, a 91.9 mph offering that was his fastest since July 31, 2024, then grounded to second. Kershaw had “51” written on his cap like other Dodgers relievers in a tribute to Alex Vesia, who is missing the Series because of what the team said was a “deeply personal family matter.” “I was warming up for like four innings,” Kershaw said. Los Angeles set a Series record by using 10 pitchers. Rookie Will Klein got the win with 72 pitches over four scoreless innings, both double his previous big league highs. “There were times when you're starting to feel down and you feel your legs aren't there or your arm's not there, and you just got to be like, well, who else is going to come save me?” Klein said. “So I had to dig deep, do it myself.” Game 1 starter Blake Snell had thrown a bullpen and was unavailable. Yoshinobu Yamamoto approached manager Dave Roberts and pitching coach Mark Prior volunteering to relieve, two days after throwing 105 pitches to win Game 2 in his second consecutive complete game. Yamamoto was warming up while Klein pitched the 18th. “He was in the next inning,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. Second baseman Miguel Rojas, who made four mop-up pitching appearances during the season, entered the game as a pinch hitter in the 13th and realized a few innings later he might be called on to pitch on 115 days' rest and become the first position player to take the mound in a World Series. Rojas threw 120 big league pitches over the past three seasons and mentally readied his arsenal, which ranged from 36.6 mph to 69.8 mph during this year's outings. “I was the only one who had done it before and feel like I had the best chance to kind of get outs if I needed to be out there for the boys,” he said. As each extra inning unfolded and platters of pineapple and watermelon were being passed in the dugout, Wrobleski kept leaving the bench for the clubhouse and joined Michael Conforto, Michael Kopech and Kirby Yates, a trio of inactive teammates, in trying to will a victory. The third pair of shoes finally worked,” he said, proudly pointing out white Skechers. Kershaw's kids have their own locker next to his in the Dodgers clubhouse, but as he spoke to reporters there was no sign of the four, who range in age from 3 to 10.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the final days of New York City's mayoral race, Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani has faced pushback over a story he told about his aunt being afraid to wear her hijab while riding the subway after the September 11, 2001, attacks. National Republicans including Vice President JD Vance mocked Mamdani's story, which the nominee told during a Friday speech criticizing his rival Andrew Cuomo for appearing to laugh along with a radio host who suggested Mamdani would cheer another 9/11. Accounts on X flagged a LinkedIn profile belonging to Mamdani's father's sister in which she is not wearing a head covering. Mamdani told reporters Monday that he was speaking about “Zehra fuhi, my father's cousin, who passed away a few years ago.” (Fuhi is a term in Urdu and Hindi that means paternal aunt. Mamdani was born in Uganda to parents of Indian origin.) That led to a New York Post headline referring to Mamdani's “aunt” in quotation marks – and sharp questioning during a Tuesday morning radio interview. That is how I referred to her all my life.” Mamdani has accused right-wing media and his opponents of trying to discredit his story instead of focusing on Cuomo's attacks on his faith and the suggestions that Mamdani would be soft on terrorism or crime. “It just shows the idea of a Muslim woman wearing a hijab and feeling uncomfortable after 9/11 is so foreign to the right wing in this city and this country that the only answer to them is that it must be a lie,” Mamdani said. Still, the hosts Tuesday morning weren't ready to back down. “The reason I am being so hard on you is because you're going to be the mayor of the biggest city in the United States and we need to know that our politicians that we are electing (are) truthful,” Molina said. Mamdani responded by saying he understood New Yorkers who read the New York Post, one of the city's daily newspapers that has long been critical of him, would be confused. He then ended the interaction by teasing Molina for pressing him about the type of mayor he would be even though the host doesn't live in New York and was not sitting in the studio to question him in person. “I don't even take this as you coming at me hard – these are the questions you should be asking, I understand if you're opening up the New York Post and this is what you read, many New Yorkers will say well how am I supposed to feel about it, so you're giving the opportunity to tell the truth and correct the record,” Mamdani said.</p>

NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — A plane crash killed 11 people, mostly foreign tourists, in Kenya's coastal region of Kwale early Tuesday while they were en route to the Maasai Mara National Reserve in heavy rain. The airline, Mombasa Air Safari, said in a statement that eight Hungarian and two German passengers were on board, and the Kenyan pilot was also killed. The plane crashed in a hilly, forested area about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Diani airstrip, authorities said. The aircraft burst into flames, leaving charred wreckage, officials said. Witnesses told the AP they heard a loud bang and found unrecognizable human remains at the scene. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said on social media that the foreign ministry had been in contact with Kenyan authorities. Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said on social media that the Hungarian victims were two families and an acquaintance, with two children among the dead. It did not give a reason for revising the number to 11. The Mombasa Air Safari airline operates 13-passenger Cessnas to many tourist destinations. The Maasai Mara National Reserve, in western Kenya, is a two-hour direct flight from Diani, a popular town on the Indian Ocean. One of Kenya's most visited areas, the reserve features an annual wildebeest migration from the Serengeti in Tanzania. AP journalist Justin Spike contributed from Budapest, Hungary.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE — Trumpworld allies are preparing to launch a targeted campaign against a Biden-era labor rule in hopes of boosting Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections. The Washington Examiner reviewed a memo produced by veteran Trump campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio outlining a September survey of “1,000 voters nationally on the topic of labor unions, workers and unionization.” Fabrizio found broad bipartisan support for union workers, collective bargaining, and expanded worker protections, even though union leadership registered mixed support: 29% favorable compared to 31% unfavorable. However, the poll registered overwhelming (+85) support among respondents for “requiring a secret ballot for union elections,” including 70% “strongly in support of this and high backing across party lines.” Back in 2023, former President Joe Biden's National Labor Relations Board issued a rule granting unions significant leverage over employers while organizing, specifically undermining the importance of so-called secret ballot elections in the process. Only 22% of respondents in Fabrizio's poll supported the NLRB's 2023 rule “that allowed unions not to use secret ballots,” with 64% opposed. Fabrizio wrote that Republican Congressional candidates “would benefit significantly from supporting overturning this unpopular rule.” Coalition to Protect American Workers, a conservative activist group launched by veteran Republican operative Marc Short after departing his post as former Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff in 2021, commissioned the Fabrizio Ward poll. “Americans back American workers—but they're done with union politics,” Hamilton told the Washington Examiner in a statement. People familiar told the Washington Examiner that CPAW will soon begin running a six-figure ad campaign, specifically targeting policymakers in digital and cable television formats, touting Trump's labor policies ahead of the midterm elections. Good unions stand up for workers, for fairness, transparency, and better pay, but bad unions like the CWA and SEIU spend money from your paycheck on politics,” a narrator states in CPAW's ad. That's why they don't want your employer to tell you where your money really goes, but President Trump is putting a stop to it. In 2016, Trump was able to pull away a sizable number of union members in Rust Belt swing states — the so-called Obama-Trump voters — and placed an even greater emphasis on courting labor during his 2024 campaign against Biden, and later, former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump entered office promising that his tariff and economic policies would usher in an American manufacturing boom. “There have been a lot of people fearmongering about inflation in this room, but it just has not come to fruition on a monthly basis. CPI inflation has now come in at or below the market's expectation for six consecutive months.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US military conducted strikes against four more boats in the eastern Pacific Ocean on Monday, killing 14 people on board the vessels, with one survivor, according to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. It marked the first time multiple strikes were conducted on the same day as part of the Trump administration's accelerating campaign against boats allegedly involved in drug trafficking. There were three strikes in the Pacific on Monday — with one hitting two boats at once — and bringing the number of known strikes carried out by the US military on alleged drug-smuggling vessels to 13 since the start of September. To date, those operations have destroyed 14 boats and killed 57 people — with three survivors. Earlier this month, a US strike against a vessel in the Caribbean also did not kill everyone on board. In that case, the US Navy initially detained two survivors, but the Trump administration quickly repatriated the two men back to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia. The president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, said during her daily news conference Tuesday that her government was informed about the Monday strike and about the potential survivor this morning. She added that the events occurred in international waters. The Trump administration has produced a classified legal opinion seeking to justify lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers, CNN has reported. The opinion is significant, legal experts previously told CNN, because it treats drug traffickers as enemy combatants who can be summarily killed without any kind of judicial review. “The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics,” Hegseth added. “All strikes were in international waters with no U.S. forces harmed.” This story has been updated with additional information.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US military conducted strikes against four more boats in the eastern Pacific Ocean on Monday, killing 14 people on board the vessels, with one survivor, according to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. It marked the first time multiple strikes were conducted on the same day as part of the Trump administration's accelerating campaign against boats allegedly involved in drug trafficking. There were three strikes in the Pacific on Monday — with one hitting two boats at once — and bringing the number of known strikes carried out by the US military on alleged drug-smuggling vessels to 13 since the start of September. To date, those operations have destroyed 14 boats and killed 57 people — with three survivors. Earlier this month, a US strike against a vessel in the Caribbean also did not kill everyone on board. In that case, the US Navy initially detained two survivors, but the Trump administration quickly repatriated the two men back to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia. The president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, said during her daily news conference Tuesday that her government was informed about the Monday strike and about the potential survivor this morning. She added that the events occurred in international waters. The Trump administration has produced a classified legal opinion seeking to justify lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers, CNN has reported. The opinion is significant, legal experts previously told CNN, because it treats drug traffickers as enemy combatants who can be summarily killed without any kind of judicial review. “The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics,” Hegseth added. “All strikes were in international waters with no U.S. forces harmed.” This story has been updated with additional information.

Speaking to troops aboard the USS George Washington during a visit to Japan Tuesday morning, President Donald Trump hinted that the U.S. could send "more than the National Guard" into crime-plagued cities. New York City police have a man in custody in connection with a public transit slashing — and he's accused of two dozen more crimes, many of them violent — as President Donald Trump signals plans to step up his federal crackdown on blue-city crime. Around 6:30 a.m. Saturday, a 37-year-old man suffered a cut on the left side of his face while sitting on a Q train car in Brooklyn's Flatbush neighborhood, according to the NYPD. On Tuesday morning, police announced the arrest of 27-year-old Brooklyn resident Odyssey Head on more than two dozen charges, including three of attempted murder. The NYPD did not immediately release further details explaining the full list of allegations beyond Saturday's Q train assault. The NYPD released this surveillance image of a man suspected of slashing a traveler on a Q train in Brooklyn's Flatbush neighborhood Saturday morning. Other charges include multiple counts of burglary, assault, menacing and criminal possession of a weapon. FOX 5 New York reported that police were looking into a potential connection between the Q train slashing and two more that took place over the weekend, citing law enforcement sources. Trump, speaking to American troops stationed in Japan Tuesday during a visit to the U.S. ally, said that he is considering stepping up his federal response to blue-city crime. So far, his plans have involved sending the National Guard into problematic areas. We can't have cities that are troubled, and we're sending in our National Guard," Trump told an assembly of U.S. sailors and Japanese allies. "And if we need more than the National Guard, we'll send more than the National Guard, because we're going to have safe cities. We're not going to have people killed in our cities." U.S. President Donald Trump speaks as Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi looks on aboard the aircraft carrier USS George Washington, during their visit to the U.S. Navy's Yokosuka base in Yokosuka, Japan, October 28, 2025. J.B. Pritzker for failing to curb gun violence in Chicago, blasted South American drug traffickers and credited his aggressive policies for a drop in crime in Washington, D.C., where he first deployed the National Guard to assist local police earlier this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As a federal appeals court mulls whether to reconsider its decision allowing President Donald Trump to federalize and send the Oregon National Guard to Portland, his administration on Monday made what local leaders fighting a deployment are casting as a remarkable admission: Part of its testimony justifying the need for troops was wrong. “We deeply regret these errors,” wrote Justice Department attorney Andrew M. Bernie in a letter to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals filed in the court record. The admission comes as the Trump administration faces a series of legal challenges in its efforts to deploy guard troops in Portland, Los Angeles and Chicago, Democratic-led cities where it has intensified immigration enforcement and crowd control tactics by federal agents. In Oregon, “115 (Federal Protective Service) officers have had to deploy to Portland” due to monthslong protests outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility there, an official with that agency – which provides security to government-owned properties – said earlier this month in an affidavit in support of a troop deployment. “The continued deployment of FPS officers in response to the immigration protests stretches an already thin force beyond what is safe and effective,” Regional Deputy Director Robert Cantu said in the affidavit. Those 115 officers amounted to “nearly a quarter of the agency's entire FPS capacity,” Trump administration attorneys originally said. However, this “statement was incorrect,” Bernie acknowledged in the Monday letter, noting only about half that number were agents sent out to provide security. A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit, in a 2-1 decision this month, stayed a restraining order by US District Court Judge Karin Immergut, who said it appeared Trump overstepped his authority with the guard call-up. Late last week, the appeals court temporarily suspended the panel's own decision while it decides whether to rehear the case “en banc,” with 11 judges considering it instead of three. “Our colleague in dissent and the district court cannot summarily dismiss Director Cantu's sworn and undisputed statements,” the majority wrote. Now, the Trump administration says many of the 115 agents cited by Cantu were effectively double counted, with some deployed more than once. The actual number of FPS agents sent to Portland was 86, and only 65 were “inspectors” whose primary job is providing security, Bernie's letter says. In her dissent, US Appeals Court Judge Susan Graber said she was unimpressed with Cantu's affidavit, considering it vague. “But it cannot submit an ambiguous assertion and then ask us to interpret that assertion in its favor.” “The statute … does not limit the facts and circumstances that the President may consider” in deciding whether ordinary agents cannot enforce federal law without military help, judges wrote. The Department of Justice only discovered the mistake after it was raised by attorneys for plaintiffs Oregon and Portland, Bernie's Monday letter says. “This Court must act swiftly to prevent defendants from attempting to benefit from their own material mistake to deploy military forces to peaceful civilian streets, contravening the rule of law and our nation's history and traditions,” Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield wrote. Following a hearing last week on the federal request to end that restraining order, the judge has not yet made a decision.</p>

DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin weighs in on members of the Democratic Party who are pushing for I.C.E. tracking apps and more on 'The Big Weekend Show.' FIRST ON FOX: Republican Sen. Jim Banks of Indiana is calling on U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel to close "critical gaps" in crime reporting that he says obscures a "serious and growing problem with immigrant crime" in America, according to a letter that was obtained by Fox News Digital. Banks suggested that a lack of immigration status reporting by local and state authorities has resulted in the amount of crime committed by illegal aliens being drastically underreported, according to the letter that was sent to Bondi and Patel on Tuesday. As such, he urged the FBI and DOJ to encourage local and state law enforcement to collect arrestees' immigration status, national origin and ethnicity by reforming the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), in which most agencies participate. Currently, the NIBRS only includes ethnicity as an optional element, and it does not require law enforcement to collect an arrestee's immigration status or national origin. Banks also pointed out that though the DOJ collects some aggregate statistics about the citizenship of state prison populations, it does not distinguish between noncitizens with legal status and illegal aliens. He said it also generally leaves out offenders in local jails, who make up approximately one-third of the inmate population. Kash Patel outlines message evidence in the Charlie Kirk assassination case. Closing these gaps in reporting, Banks said, would be in line with President Donald Trump's April executive order, "Strengthening and Unleashing America's Law Enforcement to Pursue Criminals and Protect Innocent Citizens," which directed the DOJ and appropriate federal agencies to "increase the investment in and collection, distribution, and uniformity of crime data across jurisdictions." He pointed out that while the Bureau of Prisons and U.S. Sentencing Commission track the national origin of federal offenders, local and state authorities, who respond and track the vast majority of crime happening across the country, largely do not track that information. Most violent crimes, most property crimes, and many drug offenses fall under local jurisdiction," he went on, adding that "the responsibility for reporting the citizenship status of offenders falls largely on states and localities—but they generally do not track this data," he wrote. Aurora, Colorado, police prepare to search the scene of a reported home invasion, Dec. 17, 2024. Banks wrote that "even though many individuals entering the country have a violent past, critical gaps in crime data reporting keep the American people from understanding when and how often these individuals and other aliens commit crimes once they are here." Sen. Jim Banks, R-Ind., listens during the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee confirmation hearing for Secretary of Education nominee Linda McMahon in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Thursday, Feb. 13, 2025. "The United States has a serious and growing problem with immigrant crime. Of course, every person who enters the United States illegally commits a crime. But those who cross our borders are increasingly likely to threaten the lives and safety of American citizens," wrote Banks. "Any crime committed by an illegal alien is one crime too many, but the American people and their elected representatives deserve to know how many of these crimes are happening, and to set immigration policy accordingly."

Plus, they discuss the Philadelphia Eagles beating... The Washington Commanders' early turnover against the Kansas City Chiefs on Monday night was enough for NFL legend Peyton Manning to shriek during the game's "ManningCast." Manning and every other NFL fan watching the game saw Marcus Mariota's pass to Deebo Samuel go off his intended target's facemask and into the hands of Chiefs defensive end Mike Danna for an opening-drive interception. Chiefs defensive end Mike Danna intercepts a pass intended for Washington Commanders wide receiver Deebo Samuel Sr. on Monday, Oct. 27, 2025, in Kansas City, Missouri. Get it out of your hand, hit Deebo. "He took his eye off of it.… Sick." The two teams were tied at seven apiece going into halftime. Washington Commanders quarterback Marcus Mariota throws against the Chiefs Monday, Oct. 27, 2025, in Kansas City, Missouri. "It was a tale of two halves," Commanders wide receiver Terry McLaurin said. The defense did a great job of getting us the ball back twice. We've got to capitalize on that. The second half, they executed a lot better than us." Mariota was 21-of-30 with 213 yards, a touchdown pass to McLaurin and two interceptions. "We came out well," Mariota said, "but when we're not converting our drives against this type of team, it's tough, because they'll get going. I thought our defense did a good job of holding them up, making plays, creating turnovers."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Scientists who study wildlife are often the bearers of bad news — this species or that is headed for extinction for the usual reasons, like deforestation or climate change. Just last week, for example, I wrote about new science showing that two valuable coral species in Florida were mostly killed off by global warming. But earlier this month, researchers announced something overwhelmingly positive: Green sea turtles, the iconic marine species made famous by Finding Nemo that were once at risk of extinction, have bounced back. IUCN reclassified the sea turtles from “endangered” to “least concern,” a category reserved for species that are not threatened with extinction and plentiful in the wild. Scientists measure sea turtle populations by counting their nests on beaches. In the 1980s, for example, researchers detected only around 40 nests each year in and around Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge, a protected area along Florida's east coast. Now, they're consistently counting more than 20,000 of them, said Kate Mansfield, a professor at the University of Central Florida who runs the monitoring program. “The green turtles have just gone absolutely, wonderfully, exponentially higher,” Mansfield told me. What's so remarkable about the recovery is that it shows conservation efforts can actually work, said Nicolas Pilcher, a sea turtle expert. These animals didn't recover by sheer chance, said Pilcher, who formerly co-chaired the group at IUCN that determines the status of marine turtles. Their population boom followed decades of projects to minimize threats, including by restricting certain kinds of fishing gear and turning nesting beaches into protected parks. “We can do this, we can save a species,” said Pilcher, who also runs a nonprofit in Malaysia called the Marine Research Foundation. But there are a few glaring caveats with what is otherwise great news. Plus, sea turtles live long lives, in some cases reaching 70 or more years old. Until recently — and still today, in many places — the biggest threat to green sea turtles was the consumption of turtle meat. These iconic marine reptiles were actually a popular food in the US through the early 20th century, according to food writer and historian Becky Diamond. “Since just one turtle could feed quite a crowd (some weighed over three hundred pounds), turtle soup was frequently the featured dish on inn menus and at large feasts or festivals,” Diamond wrote in 2018. “Demand for turtle was so high that hosts would advertise these upcoming events in the city's newspapers and sometimes even sell tickets in advance.” But even as consumption of sea turtles waned in some countries — in part because the animals became rare and thus harder to find — other human actions continued to erode their population. Sea turtles would get caught in fishing nets, for example, and eventually drown. The construction of hotels, fancy homes, and other buildings along coastlines, meanwhile, destroyed nesting grounds and polluted them with artificial light. (Nighttime lights tend to disorient sea turtles and their hatchlings, making it harder for them to navigate and avoid danger.) A few years later, IUCN listed them as endangered globally. Since then, however, the US government and a number of large conservation organizations — which tend to be especially focused on big, charismatic species — jumped into high gear to save green sea turtles. There were three main conservation approaches that worked, experts told me, starting with simply protecting the beaches where green sea turtles nest. Florida's Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge is a good example. That means sea turtles can use beaches in the refuge without much disturbance. Many other nesting beaches in the North Atlantic are similarly protected, Mansfield says. Thousands of sea turtles are accidentally caught each year by trawls and other fishing nets that target seafood, such as shrimp. To solve this problem, scientists and fishermen developed modifications for trawl nets — known as turtle excluder devices — that give large marine animals a way out. At the same time, regulations in the US required that fishermen use circle hooks instead of J hooks for line fishing in some regions. Circle hooks are harder for turtles to fit in their mouths and swallow. The third approach sought to limit turtle poaching for meat, still common in parts of Asia, Central America, and Africa. Often, the people who harvest turtles are simply trying to make a living. And so, what's worked to lower hunting in these communities, Pilcher says, is when organizations provide them with an alternative source of income. In Fiji, for example, people who once collected sea turtle eggs to eat or sell are now enlisted by a conservation NGO to protect them. Not everyone was thrilled with the announcement that green sea turtles are no longer endangered. “I don't like it,” said Roldán Valverde, a sea turtle researcher at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. The takeaway that these species have recovered overshadows a much bleaker picture in one of his key research areas: Tortuguero, a national park along the northern Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. Since 2010, the turtle population has quickly declined, dipping below 50,000 nests in recent years. People have hunted green sea turtles in Nicaragua for generations, he said, but in the past, their fishing gear was more rustic: boats without motors, for example, and harpoons instead of nets. Now, equipped with more advanced gear, they're able to collect a larger number of sea turtles. And while harvesting turtles is illegal in most cases, officials don't adequately enforce the law. “The impact is significant and now beginning to show in Tortuguero,” Valverde said. This is to say: Not all green turtles are doing well. Neither are other kinds of sea turtles, for that matter. That raises an important question: Why haven't they recovered, too? Many of the beaches that green sea turtles nest on happen to be in countries with stronger governance and more funding for conservation, like the US and Australia. “You go somewhere like Australia — places where the legal infrastructure is strong, robust, enforced — and those populations are massive and they have a massive impact on the overall survival of the species,” Pilcher said. Certain sea turtle species, like the leatherback, also spend more time wandering out at sea, Pilcher said, which could leave them more exposed to fishing. And there are newer, complex threats, too, like plastic pollution. — which turtles sometime mistake for food or eat accidentally. That's probably going to emerge as a major challenge in the coming years.” Yet now, long after people stopped killing them for their baleen and blubber, new threats, such as ship strikes and ropes from crab and lobster fishing, are jeopardizing their existence — a reminder that the job of protecting species is never really finished. Two incredibly valuable animals are now “functionally extinct” in Florida. But there's another problem that no one's talking about. Consumers are finally pushing back on AI-driven data expansion.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Jan. 19 episode detailed in the report describes a “game of telephone” in which chief of staff Jeff Zients authorized the autopen for a final batch of pardons, including for his son Hunter Biden and four other family members, as well as Anthony Fauci and Gen. Mark Milley, based only on secondhand accounts of a meeting he never attended. An aide emailed approval from Zients's account, initialed “JZ,” without confirming with Biden directly, according to the report. The report further cites testimony that then-Staff Secretary Neera Tanden saw the president only “every six to eight weeks,” leaving little oversight of official signatures. Investigators concluded there was no proper chain of custody for decision memos and that even residence staff had access to presidential materials. The report's authors say these lapses “compromised the constitutional chain of command” and call into question whether dozens of executive orders, pardons, and agency directives issued in Biden's name remain legally valid. The report singles out former White House physician Kevin O'Connor, Biden's longtime doctor, noting that he had “business dealings with and financial connections to President Biden's family.” Investigators said those ties, combined with political incentives to keep Biden viable for reelection, created “a motive to conceal the president's decline while running the government in his stead.” According to testimony cited in the report, senior advisers Mike Donilon and Anita Dunn opposed a cognitive exam despite public calls for one. Former chief of staff Jeff Zients corroborated that consensus and later requested a full cognitive workup, but only after Biden's faltering debate performance against then-candidate Donald Trump in June 2024. O'Connor, Dunn, and Donilon each refused to answer certain questions under oath; O'Connor, Annie Tomasini, and Anthony Bernal all invoked the Fifth Amendment. “These steps ranged from addressing President Biden's makeup, clothing, schedule, the number of steps President Biden could walk or climb, the amount of time President Biden needed to read and to spend with his family,” the report states. Former communications aides described a system of pre-scripted press cards, controlled reporter questions, and constant teleprompter use, even at small events, to maintain an image of command. Meanwhile, donors privately expressed alarm at Biden's visible frailty, with one telling Zients the president's reliance on a teleprompter at a private fundraiser was concerning. Comer has referred O'Connor, Tomasini, and Bernal to the Justice Department for further review and asked the D.C. Board of Medicine to examine O'Connor's conduct. He also urged a full DOJ audit of all executive actions taken during Biden's tenure to determine their legality. Legal experts who spoke to the Washington Examiner said it could be an uphill battle to undo actions taken during Biden's first term, aside from reversing executive orders, many of which Trump did during his first week back in the Oval Office. Additionally, the president's ability to pardon and commute sentences for individuals has routinely been held as a sacred tradition, and no subsequent president has ever undone pardons or commutations by their predecessors. A 2005 DOJ memo found that presidents can use the autopen for official documents, though it was previously rarely used by presidents until former President Barack Obama used it to sign legislation in 2011 while he was abroad on a trip. Biden himself has rejected claims that he was unaware of his administration's decisions, claiming earlier this year that he was deeply involved in the pardon process. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false,” Biden said at the time.</p>
