                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>KSHB 41 reporter Tod Palmer covers sports business and eastern Jackson County. Fan Fest will be situated on the south lawn and built around a 65-foot-tall heart-shaped entrance, opening into an event organizers say will be free and offer activities for the entire family. Organizers provided details during a press conference on Tuesday. KC2026 CEO Pam Kramer says the design — created by teams at Kansas City-based Populous — was “intentional about creating a distinctly Kansas City experience.” Fan Fest will be open during all six matches hosted by Kansas City at Kansas City Stadium (GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium) and will serve as the region's official watch party for at least three matches with the U.S. national team. Organizers plan to announce additional dates in the future. “This is our time to shine as a region, and I can tell you with confidence that we are ready," Kramer said. Fan Fest will offer visitors and locals alike a chance to connect with Kansas City-area cuisine, culture, entertainers and people. The tailgating experience will be front and center, as will lots of shade, misting fans, and a misting tunnel to keep fans cool during the event. The city will also host a Round of 32 match on July 3 and a quarterfinal match on July 11. Sign up for our Morning E-mail Newsletter to receive the latest headlines in your inbox.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's the first midweek round of Serie A action this season, and while Milan travels to Bergamo to face an unbeaten Atalanta, one notable name is missing from the Rossoneri squad sheet. Christian Pulisic, Milan's standout performer so far this season, has been ruled out of the crucial clash. After a frustrating 2-2 draw against Pisa at San Siro last Friday, Massimiliano Allegri's Rossoneri now find themselves chasing Napoli in the Serie A standings. The American winger, who has been directly involved in eight goals this season (six goals and two assists), was not included in the matchday squad. In fact, Pulisic is sidelined due to a low-grade hamstring injury picked up during the October international window. Milan's medical staff later confirmed that the injury was mild but required careful management. Could Christian Pulisic return from injury this weekend against Roma? Milan boss Massimiliano Allegri drops new comeback date hint Head coach Massimiliano Allegri provided an update in his pre-match press conference, ruling out any possibility of Pulisic featuring against Atalanta or Roma in the coming days. “Absolutely not against Roma,” Allegri said when asked about a possible early return. “We hope to have him on the bench against Parma.” That timeline suggests that Pulisic will miss at least 10 more days of action, sitting out the club's next fixtures against Atalanta and Roma, before potentially returning for the Parma clash on November 8, just before the international break. How will Milan line up without Christian Pulisic in Serie A?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you're planning on visiting the U.S., Canada, or Mexico in June or July 2026, you're going to be timing your visit with the FIFA World Cup. This is one of the biggest sporting events on the planet, and it hasn't been without controversy already. Despite this, these countries are gearing up to host the massive sporting event, with anticipation building fast as fans across the globe prepare for a summer of packed stadiums and celebrations that will transform entire cities into buzzing hubs of soccer fever. The City of Angels already has a strong soccer presence, due to being home to Angels FC, the women's soccer team backed by numerous A-list celebrities. So, if you're heading to LA for the World Cup, this guide has everything you need to know. If you're planning a trip to Los Angeles for the FIFA World Cup, there are a few things you need to know. Here are all the World Cup travel tips you need. To get the official FIFA World Cup tickets for 2026, you need to purchase them through the FIFA website. Here you can find tickets and hospitality packages. This is where you should buy World Cup tickets, as there are already touts and scalpers selling them for well over the designated prices. There is an official resale portal with a 15% fee for sellers and buyers; however, you may be able to find cheaper tickets as the initial demand drops. The tickets are being released in phases to avoid overloading the system, and this is being done on a blend of lottery and first-come, first-served basis. Prices start at $60, but this is expected to skyrocket. Official travel packages are available through FIFA's official hospitality packages, where you can follow your team around the country or see multiple games in one city, complete with hotel options. In terms of entry rules for 2026 into the U.S., you need to stay on top of any newly announced travel restrictions. While many countries can enter the U.S. for up to 90 days on an ESTA, paying just $21 for 2 years of validity, some will need a more formal tourist visa, which can take months to process. U.S. World Cup visa procedures have been allocated more capacity by the Trump administration to prevent bottlenecks. However, with the government shutdown, it's unclear how well this will work in practice. ESTAs usually take up to 72 hours to approve, while short-term tourist visas can take several months and may require interviews at your local consulate, so start the process now. Of course, there are a few countries competing in the FIFA World Cup that are currently on the U.S.'s banned entry list. In this case, it's worth checking to see if your team will be playing in Canada or Mexico instead. When building your World Cup travel itinerary, aim to arrive a couple of days before the game to get over any jet lag and get your bearings in the city. When thinking about how many days for a World Cup trip, it depends on how many games you're going to see. There are just three days in between some of the 8 LA-hosted games, so you can see a couple in one trip. Often, these stadiums aren't in the city center, so you may need to use the Los Angeles metro system or find other methods of World Cup transportation. Of course, the main way into Los Angeles is through LAX airport. For a smaller airport experience, you can also fly into: This connects all across the country, so if you want to enjoy a sleeper train experience before heading to the World Cup, traveling by Amtrak is a great experience. If you're on a budget, FlixBus recently announced that it'll be running services to all the World Cup host cities across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. You can get a Los Angeles Metro card, called a TAP card, at hundreds of locations across the region, as well as from the TAP vending machines. You can preload these cards and tap-and-go across the city. You can download this and use it in the same way for ease. This way, you can also connect it directly to your Google Wallet or Apple Pay. However, it's always worth having some cash for smaller vendors and tips. You can also buy a local SIM card at many bodegas across Los Angeles, or you can opt for an e-SIM from a provider like Airalo. You can get the LA Metro C Line (Green) to Hawthorne/Lennox, and then jump on a free game-day shuttle or Metro Micro to the stadium. If you're staying in the Inglewood neighborhood, you can also walk to the stadium or use a rental bike. While the World Cup shuttles haven't been announced yet, there's an expectation that LA will put on extra transportation for game days to alleviate traffic. However, it's also super close to LAX, so the airport hotels are a great option if you're just flying in for the World Cup. It's relatively trendy and central, and is still close to the SoFi Stadium, so it ticks a lot of boxes. Alternatively, if you want a quintessential LA experience, stay in Santa Monica or Marina del Rey. These oceanside neighborhoods are still relatively close to the stadium, but have a relaxing vibe with decent nightlife districts. Neighborhoods like Downtown LA and West Hollywood are both great for nightlife and tourist attractions, but they are pretty far from the stadium, especially on public transport. However, the main fan park for LA's World Cup is going to be in Exposition Park, near the university district and a stone's throw from Downtown. If you're looking for World Cup hotels or where to book World Cup lodging, this is the section for you. If you're staying near LAX, the 4-star Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport is an excellent option, and it connects directly to the airport, meaning you can take advantage of the new Metro link. For a more budget-friendly option, check out the 3-star TownePlace Suites by Marriott Los Angeles LAX/Hawthorne. This way, you have more space for cooking your own meals, to keep costs low. For a 4-star option, check out the Marina del Rey Hotel, with prime positioning and excellent amenities. If you're looking for hostel vibes, check out Samesun Venice Beach for dorm accommodations, right off Venice Beach. In Santa Monica, the 5-star boutique hotel of choice is Shutters on the Beach, with an incredible spa and ocean views. On the budget end of things, the HI Los Angeles Santa Monica Hostel is an affordable spot with plenty of shared social areas and a great location near the beach. Of course, when you're not at the World Cup games, there are plenty of things to do in Los Angeles. Enjoy classic Los Angeles attractions in the downtown area, or check out day trips from LA to spots up and down the Pacific Coast. There are so many must-see places in Los Angeles, it can be difficult to cram them all into one trip. In terms of Los Angeles sightseeing, there are a few big-hitters that first-timers will probably want to see, including: For more local experiences, head to Grand Central Market for delicious street food, wander around the Street Art District, or relax on the less-crowded beaches around El Matador. While the tourist attractions are popular for a reason, it's worth getting out of Downtown or Santa Monica for a day to explore more of LA. It's no secret that LA is a foodie city. You'll find local dishes from all around the world here. Make sure you spend some time dining in Koreatown with its flavorful barbecue, grab a few delicious shrimp tacos at Mariscos Jalisco, and get a mountain of mouth-watering seafood delights at Malibu Seafood. If you're on a budget, head to Grand Central Market, where you can enjoy world-class street food from all around the world in one place. This doubles as a cultural experience for World Cup fans, as you could probably eat your way around the entire draw in Los Angeles! Some great day trips from Los Angeles, including weekend escapes up and down the Pacific Coast, and to nearby destinations throughout California. From LA, you can reach the Denmark of America, Solvang. If you prefer more mountainous day trips, head to Big Bear Lake. It's surrounded by the San Bernardino National Forest and is an outdoor-lover's heaven. Known for its mid-century architecture and laid-back vibes, it's a perfect antidote to the hectic pace of downtown LA. With over 70,000 seats, it's a cathedral for sporting events and headlining concerts. It's worth noting that FIFA World Cup guidelines state that stadiums need a minimum capacity of 40,000 seats and have to have at least 60,000 to host a semi-final or final. If you're looking for fan experience tips for attending a World Cup match, you need to pay attention to any announcements coming out of the LA World Cup committee. Bring breathable layers and an empty water bottle to stay hydrated. You'll also want to bring plenty of clothes in your team colors. For stadium entry tips, sign up for alerts from SoFi Stadium and read any emails from your ticket provider carefully. These will tell you what you can and can't bring into the stadium, including soft drinks, the maximum size of your bag, whether you can bring flags with flagpoles, and more. Any World Cup trip cost is going to be a premium experience, even if you're going for budget accommodation and the lowest tier of ticket. The cheapest ticket for an LA group match is $60; however, due to dynamic pricing and multi-tier ticket structures, the average ticket price for a group game in LA is $615.50. This is heavily weighted with the opening U.S. game, which has a starting price of over $500. Los Angeles is also a notoriously expensive city for accommodation. In terms of World Cup budget tips, it's worth trying to stay in a slightly cheaper hotel or hostel, especially if you're going to be out exploring the city, rather than having a resort-style trip. As with any major city, you need to keep your wits about you when it comes to travel safety in Los Angeles. While World Cup fan safety is going to be a priority during the event, you still need to be aware of your surroundings, especially in neighborhoods you're unfamiliar with, or if you're traveling around after dark. Try to explore in a group, either with friends or with other fans, and stick to well-lit areas of the city. During the World Cup, there will probably be a lot of scammers trying to sell fake tickets, as there have been at every tournament. It's also a highly multicultural city, so be respectful of other people's customs and cultures. Here you can find the answers to your Los Angeles World Cup questions. So, without further ado, here's what to know before the World Cup. How many World Cup games are being held in Los Angeles? There are 8 World Cup games being held in Los Angeles. Which LA Stadium is being used for the FIFA World Cup? Is Los Angeles a good city for watching soccer? Yes, Los Angeles is a good city for watching soccer, with the LA Galaxy being in the MLS and Angel FC being a popular NWSL team. While LA is a car-heavy city, you don't need to drive while in LA for the World Cup. Public transport across the city is great and affordable. In terms of a fan travel checklist, don't forget to pack plenty of light layers, comfortable shoes for exploring, and your team jersey. Remember, this is a global event, so if you're a domestic fan, try and travel sustainably, utilizing LA's metro system and traveling via Amtrak or Flixbus where possible. Also, bring a reusable water bottle to stay hydrated in the LA heat and keep trash to a minimum. This is an incredible event, and will be considered a dry run for the LA Olympics in 2028, so let's get excited! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since then, she has been on the pitch for both the Current and US Women's National Team. She has not disappointed either club. On September 20, she had seven tackles in an impressive victory for the Current against the Seattle Reign. She also connected on over 83% of her passes in the 2-0 win. The Reign could be one of the teams that could be a matchup issue for the Current, although if Sentnor performs as strongly, they could find a way to break through. The US lost on Thursday to Portugal 2-1. The team appeared fired up and ready on Sunday. Sentnor was instrumental in two goals during the match. The World Cup is just two years away. Now, coach Emma Hayes has a tough decision to make as to who will make the final roster. Sentnor proved that she should be a name to remember for the next World Cup. She should be called for another camp towards the end of this year. If she comes on strong and adds a goal or two, it could continue to give Hayes something to consider. Either Sentnor's year should continue to be monumental as she becomes one of the faces of women's soccer in the United States.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inter Miami star Lionel Messi says MLS needs to loosen its restrictions on how clubs build their rosters in order to grow soccer's footprint in the United States. "I think growing soccer in the United States is possible," Messi said in a recent interview with NBC News' Tom Llamas (translation h/t the NBC News broadcast). When asked what changes he wanted to see, Messi answered, "Well, for starters, every team should have the opportunity to bring in players and sign whoever each team wants, without limitations or rules for players to bring them in. I don't think that today all teams in the United States, all clubs, have the power to do that. The changes also increased how many players clubs can buy out during the season as well as how much transfer or loan revenue could be used for general allocation money, per Tenorio. The league added further roster-building changes ahead of the 2025 season by allowing clubs to use unlimited cash to acquire players in a method similar to the international transfer market, per ESPN's Jeff Carlisle. Clubs still remain capped by overall salary and roster spot restrictions spelled out in the league's current collective bargaining agreement, which kicked in ahead of the 2021 season and runs through 2027. MLS commissioner Don Garber has recently indicated the league is considering changing that structure. He said in July the MLS is planning "a review of our entire roster strategy," per Tenorio. Tenorio noted that the current CBA would need to be reworked in order to institute entirely new roster rules, and that the relationship between the MLS and its players' association "feels strained" after both sides expressed frustration over negotiations regarding Club World Cup bonuses. MLS clubs currently have a salary budget of $5.95 million to build their first 20 roster spots. Outside of three designated players, who can sign for any salary amount without costing more than the MLS maximum salary charge of $743,750, these salary cap requirements have exercised strict control over how much teams can pay players. That made sense for a league that, according to estimates published in February by Forbes, features more than half of its teams operating at a loss.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>KANSAS CITY (Oct. 28, 2025) — The Kansas City Current and U.S. Soccer's Soccer Forward Foundation celebrated a multifaceted community activation at Kansas City Girls Preparatory Academy (KCGPA) Monday afternoon. United States Women's National Team (USWNT) players Emma Sears and Kennedy Wesley, USWNT and Kansas City Current player Ally Sentnor and Olympic gold medalist Staci Wilson, a USWNT alum, joined the festivities to lead an inspiring day of soccer, health and empowerment. The event at KCGPA featured interactive stations focused on the holistic well-being of over 100 fifth through eighth grade KCGPA students. The students also helped pack hundreds of hygiene kits in collaboration with Giving the Basics, a Kansas City-based nonprofit that provides personal care products to those in need. Participants received giveaways tied to the theme of the event, including sports bras and menstrual health products. “Partnering with Soccer Forward for this community activation at Kansas City Girls Prep was a powerful way to highlight the power of sport for all,” said Ben Aken, Vice President of Community Relations for the Kansas City Current. “With the USWNT making its first visit to CPKC Stadium, we wanted to ensure local students had the chance to engage with these elite athletes and showcase KC Current's newest mini-pitch in Kansas City.” Over 800 mini-pitches have already been built nationally, providing children with safe, accessible places to play in their own neighborhoods. Monday's event featured small-sided soccer games led by Kansas City Current representatives and a feminine hygiene education session with Giving the Basics. “When girls have access to the game, they gain more than just soccer skills; They gain confidence, belonging, and belief in what's possible,” said Lex Chalat, Executive Director of the Soccer Forward Foundation. “Partnerships like this one with the Kansas City Current and Kansas City Girls Preparatory Academy show how we can use soccer to empower the next generation and help every girl feel strong, seen, and supported on and off the field.” The USWNT faces New Zealand Wednesday night at 7 p.m. CT.

Soccer Forward Community Spotlight. // Photo by Tarik Sykes

The U.S. Women's National Soccer Team is set to play New Zealand at CPKC Stadium on Wednesday, Oct. 29. But, before the best soccer players around the nation take the field, they decided to get involved in the local youth soccer scene. Partnering with the KC Current, on Monday, Oct. 27, the team ventured out to Kansas City Girls Preparatory Academy for a day of fun with the students through an event they call the Soccer Forward Community Spotlight. The students at KCGPA got a chance to meet some of the stars and participate in different activities revolving around the sport and women's hygiene during their Monday school day.

Our photographer Tarik Sykes captured the fun:

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With two matches of a three-match camp in the books, the USWNT now faces New Zealand in Kansas City, Mo. This fall camp came after a long hiatus with a 113-day gap separating the July 2 win vs. Canada from this week's first match against Portugal on Oct. 23. GOALKEEPERS (3): Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC; 3) Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals; 4), Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United, ENG; 4) DEFENDERS (8): Jordyn Bugg (Seattle Reign FC; 3/0), Emily Fox (Arsenal FC, ENG; 69/1), Eva Gaetino (Paris St-Germain, FRA; 1) Tara McKeown (Washington Spirit; 9/0), Avery Patterson (Houston Dash; 8/1), Lilly Reale (Gotham FC; 3/0), Emily Sams (Orlando Pride; 5/0), Emily Sonnett (Gotham FC; 112/2), Kennedy Wesley (San Diego Wave; 0/0) MIDFIELDERS (8): Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns FC; 40/5), Lindsey Heaps (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 168/38), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current; 8/1), Lo'eau LaBonta (Kansas City Current; 3/0), Rose Lavelle (Gotham FC; 114/26), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC; 10/4), Jaedyn Shaw (Gotham FC; 28/8), Lily Yohannes (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 10/1) FORWARDS (6): Michelle Cooper (Kansas City Current; 9/1), Catarina Macario (Chelsea FC, ENG; 25/11), Yazmeen Ryan (Houston Dash; 14/2), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville; 10/1), Ally Sentnor (Kansas City Current; 13/4), Alyssa Thompson (Chelsea FC, ENG; 24/3) In the last FIFA window, Emma Hayes gave five players their first caps – goalkeeper Claudia Dickey, defenders Jordyn Bugg, Lilly Reale and Izzy Rodriguez and midfielder Sam Meza. All but Rodriguez and Meza are back on this roster, which features just one first-time call-up in Kennedy Wesley. Rodriguez and Meza, who started on June 29 vs. Ireland, became the 23rd and 24th players to debut under Hayes in her 27 games at the helm, a remarkable ratio for the Olympic champion head coach. Hayes has given 28 total players their first USWNT call-ups, but she also gave a first cap to a player who did not get a first call-up under her, as Lily Yohannes earned her first call-up under former interim head coach Twila Kilgore but did not see action under Kilgore. The 24 players who have earned their first USWNT caps under Emma Hayes are: Sam Staab, Lily Yohannes, Croix Bethune, Yazmeen Ryan, Hal Hershfelt, Emily Sams, Emma Sears, Mandy McGlynn, Alyssa Malonson, Eva Gaetino, Ally Sentnor, Tara McKeown, Michelle Cooper, Gisele Thompson, Claire Hutton, Phallon Tullis-Joyce, Avery Patterson, Lo'eau LaBonta, Kerry Abello, Claudia Dickey, Lilly Reale, Jordyn Bugg, Sam Meza and Izzy Rodriguez. Defender Eva Gaetino, who was participating in U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team Training Camp this week outside of Philadelphia, has been called up to the U.S. Women's National Team roster and joined the U.S. camp ahead of the final two matches of the FIFA window. After Trinity Rodman's withdrawal from the October camp roster due to injury, the USWNT entered camp with 25 players. With all this in mind, Hayes attended U-23 trainings to assess the players, and, with all of her U-23 teammates looking on, informed Gaetino after one of those trainings that she would be joining the senior team for the rest of camp. The 5-foot-11 central defender is in her second full season, with Paris Saint-Germain in France's Première Ligue after a banner college career at Notre Dame. Ater the 3-0 opening game win over Zambia at the Olympics, Hayes became the first USWNT head coach to win their first major tournament match by a margin of three or more goals and joined Anson Dorrance as the only head coaches in USWNT history to win their first six matches at a major tournament. Hayes joins three other USWNT head coaches of the last eight in USWNT history who won their first major competition (Anson Dorrance – 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup, Pia Sundhage – 2008 Olympics, Jill Ellis – 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup). France Football, the top soccer magazine in France and one of the most reputable in Europe, has been awarding the Ballon d'Or to men's players since 1956 and to women's players since 2018, but 2024 was the first year it has given out awards to coaches of men's and women's soccer. Hayes then followed that up by winning The Best FIFA Women's Coach award. Of the players who scored those nine goals over those two games, only Rose Lavelle, who scored twice in Auckland (while wearing the captain's armband) is on this roster. The USA won 5-0 in a match that featured a highly unusual and painful to watch three own goals from one player – defender Meikayla Moore who currently plays for Calgary Wild FC in Canada – along with scores from Ashley Hatch and Mallory Pugh. In Brazil, the USA picked up a 2-0 win behind first-half goals from Carli Lloyd and Alex Morgan. In England, the USA won 2-0 on goals from Abby Wambach and Sydney Leroux. In China, the USA won 4-0 on goals from Heather O'Reilly, Amy Rodriguez, Lindsey Tarpley and Angela Hucles. Record vs. USA: 1W-1D-19L (GF: 7; GA: 82)Head Coach: Michael Mayne (NZL) Goalkeepers (3): 21-Victoria Esson (Wellington Phoenix FC), 37-Alina Santos (University of Denver, USA) Defenders (9): 2-Kate Taylor (Dijon FCO, FRA), 3-Claudia Bunge (Melbourne Victory, AUS), 5-Meikayla Moore (Calgary Wild FC, CAN), 14-Katie Bowen (Inter Milan, ITA), 15-Grace Neville (Ipswich Town, ENG), 19-Elizabeth Anton (Kolbotn IL, NOR), 25-Mackenzie Barry (Wellington Phoenix FC), 27-Michaela Foster (Durham FC, ENG), 28-Lara Wall (Wellington Phoenix FC), 39-Rebecca Lake (Vancouver United, CAN) Forwards (5): 9-Milly Clegg (Halifax Tides FC, CAN), 16-Jacqui Hand (Kolbotn IL, NOR), 17-Gabi Rennie (Eskilstuna United DFF, SWE), 20-Indiah-Paige Riley (Crystal Palace, ENG), 34-Kelli Brown (Newcastle Jets, AUS)</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Football fans have been left stunned by a video circulating on social media that appears to show plans for the world's first ever 'sky stadium' set to open in time for the 2034 World Cup in Saudi Arabia. The footage - which could be merely an AI hoax - shows the Gulf state's Neom Sky Stadium, expected to sit more than 1,000 feet above ground level in a city which is yet to be built called The Line. According to reports from various publications, it will only be accessible via high-speed lifts. They've questioned how exactly tens of thousands of fans could all gain access via lifts, the safety issues surrounding a venue situated 1,000 feet in the sky and, incredibly, what would happen if a ball flew out of the stadium. One posted on X: 'Thousands going up elevators and then down after the game? 🚨 Saudi Arabia is set to construct the world's first "sky stadium”. 'This is truly a thing of beauty and elegance to imagine, however this project should never be allowed to happen,' another quipped. 'The potential risks in this sky stadium's security, health and safety challenges are deeply interconnected.' One added: 'Imagine being on the street below and all of a sudden out of nowhere you're attacked by a rogue football from the sky.' A final fan simply wrote: 'This seems cool yet totally unnecessary and pretentious. Just because something can exist doesn't mean it should.' Images posted to Neom's official Facebook page last year show an original concept of the ground, which looks a far cry from the video that emerged on Tuesday. Works on the Neom Sky Stadium are expected to begin in 2027 and be completed in 2032, two years before the tournament begins. Viewers are however sceptical that the video could be merely an AI hoax, citing a host of reasons why the stadium could not feasibly host major sporting events The ground is part of a Saudi Arabian project called 'The Line', a smart city in the region of Neom which is expected to be car-free and only as long as the Empire State Building is high. When the Middle-Eastern nation were controversially awarded the tournament at a FIFA Congress late last year, they promised 'one of a kind' venues. One of those includes the 92,760 capacity King Salman International Stadium where the opening game and final will be played. Other venues include the Qiddiya Coast Stadium and the Prince Mohammed bin Salman Stadium, which will be located on a rooftop. Images which emerged last year on Neom's official Facebook page showed a very different design of the sky stadium Neom Sky Stadium will boast some 46,000 seats, according to plans It will also feature more than 2,000 box seats and four 'training sites' And it was revealed earlier this month that the Saudi World Cup could too be held between the months of November and December, when temperatures are considerably lower than those of the summer months. Speaking in early October, FIFA President Gianni Infantino claimed football fans need to have an 'open mind' about when the sport's most highly anticipated event takes place. 'It's not just about one World Cup, it's a general reflection, even to play in some European countries in July is very, very hot, so maybe we have to think,' he said. 'We need to consider all these elements when we speak about national team competitions, national team release, about club competitions, and see how we can make it better for the benefit of everyone.' Gianni Infantino suggested there needs to be an 'open mind' over when World Cups are held Kick off times are expected to be 5pm BST, 8pm, 11pm and 2am, mirroring this summer's FIFA Club World Cup. Speaking about what the World Cup could learn from the Club World Cup, FIFA vice president Victor Montagliani admitted it was 'kick-off times'. 'We're having conversations daily with European media and other world media, in terms of what's best and which are the stadiums that you can play at 3pm. 'Once the actual schedule comes out after the draw, we will do our best to ensure it's taken into consideration. Will it be that every game will be absolutely perfect from a kick-off time, from a TV perspective? Morocco, Portugal and Spain have been confirmed as co-hosts of the 2030 tournament.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saudi Arabia has unveiled plans to build the world's first Sky Stadium, named ‘NEOM,' ahead of the 2034 FIFA World Cup. The stadium is expected to have a seating capacity of 46,000 spectators to accommodate fans and officials involved in the matches. Reports indicate that the stadium will be suspended 1,150 feet above the ground and powered by wind and solar energy instead of conventional electricity. A promotional video showcases the stadium perched atop a skyscraper, illuminated by vibrant lights surrounding the structure. 'You remember what happened during the 2014 World Cup?' – Dede Ayew advises Black Queens Construction of the Sky Stadium is expected to begin in 2027, with completion anticipated by 2032, assuming all goes according to plan. Saudi Arabia has submitted a bid to host the 2034 World Cup, which will feature 48 countries competing for football's most prestigious trophy. The bid has been accepted and acknowledged by the Federation of International Football Association (FIFA), with formal steps yet to be taken to finalise the host nation.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was a weekend of very contrasting fortunes for American players in Europe, featuring giddy highs at Bournemouth and steep learning curves in the Bundesliga. It has rarely been better for Tyler Adams in England. Despite selling some of their best talent again in the summer, the south-coast club have relied on ever-smart recruitment to recalibrate and go again in their indefatigable style under manager Andoni Iraola. Now Adams, who missed the U.S.'s October international window as he and his wife expected their second child, can take double satisfaction from Bournemouth's 2-0 win over Nottingham Forest on Sunday. Not only did it push them up to second in the top flight, remarkably just four points behind leaders Arsenal, but he played a pivotal part in his team's second goal. It's all the more impressive because Bournemouth had to effectively replace their entire back line during the transfer window, meaning Adams' experience and ability to screen the new unit has been needed more than ever. Iraola will at least be pleased that Adams' quality is staying somewhat under the radar, because chances are richer clubs could start to sniff around him if he continues this form in USMNT colours this summer. For now, though, Bournemouth and Mauricio Pochettino will be glad they have a model of consistency to call upon who, at 26 years old, can keep improving. It's not been quite so upbeat for Josh Sargent at Norwich City lately. Manager Liam Manning is under pressure and the club's American majority shareholder Mark Attanasio is due to fly over to meet with the board this week. For Sargent, who created Norwich's goal in the 2-1 defeat by Swansea City, and worked unselfishly to get his side back level, it might lead to a period of introspection. Of course, with much of the season to go, anything is still possible, but he could not have predicted such a difficult start. Despite injury problems that required a groin operation, causing him to miss 14 league games, he scored 15 goals last season. He started the current campaign in rich form, with five goals in four games, but since then Norwich's results have gone downhill and the 25-year-old's form has suffered. Sargent was left out of the most recent USMNT roster and is struggling badly for goals for his country, with his last in 2019. It hasn't been a barrel of laughs for Weston McKennie in Turin either. After performing his annual trick of convincing another Juventus manager of his worth and getting back into the team, Igor Tudor was sacked on Monday after seven months in charge, with Massimo Brambilla — who coaches the club's reserve team Juventus Next Gen in Serie C — taking interim charge. Juventus haven't won in five Serie A games, seven in all competitions, and while McKennie was getting the chance to settle into a midfield role (he was deployed often as a wing-back last term) it remains to be seen who will replace Tudor on a permanent basis and how that will affect the 27-year-old after Sunday's 1-0 defeat at Lazio. Aidan Morris' form remains strong and Middlesbrough are second in the Championship. Morris had a strong game in Saturday's 1-1 draw with Wrexham at the Riverside Stadium. But things don't always go smoothly for young players thrust into the senior set-up in one of Europe's big leagues. The 18-year-old has started his team's last three games, but Saturday was a tough lesson. “Defensively, we didn't do well,” manager Sandro Wagner told the club's website. “Against a team with such individual quality as Leipzig, you get punished ruthlessly for that. Today we got a real slap in the face, but that's part of our development.” Banks can only learn from what team-mate Robin Fellhauer described as a “brutal” game and will hopefully have the chance to bounce back when Augsburg play Bochum in the DFB-Pokal tomorrow. In the Netherlands, it was a cheerier game for Sergino Dest at PSV. He was dropped from the squad after turning up late for a pre-game meeting ahead of their Champions League win over Napoli last week. But manager Peter Bosz was willing to forgive him and restored the full-back to the team for their game at Feyenoord on Sunday. See whether McKennie and Juventus can get back to winning ways in Serie A against Udinese on Wednesday (1:30pm ET, Paramount+). Then on Sunday, Adams and Bournemouth's strong start will be tested by a trip to Pep Guardiola's Manchester City. Chris Richards and Crystal Palace have been flying this term but came unstuck against table-topping Arsenal on Saturday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saudi Arabia has unveiled plans to construct the world's first “Sky Stadium”, a groundbreaking sports arena that will soar 350 metres above ground as part of the $500 billion NEOM megacity project. Officially called the NEOM Stadium, this futuristic venue marks another bold step in the kingdom's Vision 2030 agenda — an initiative aimed at transforming Saudi Arabia's economy through innovation, sustainability, and global sports leadership. Designed to accommodate 46,000 spectators, the Sky Stadium will combine architectural brilliance with next-generation technology, including AI-powered systems, augmented reality, and advanced acoustics to enhance the live sports experience.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MOENCHENGLADBACH, Germany (AP) — Gio Reyna went into the 2022 World Cup as one of United States' brightest young soccer stars. “I do obviously think about (the World Cup) pretty often as it's somewhere where I need and want to be,” he said. Then-U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter said after the tournament that an unnamed player, later identified as Reyna, was nearly sent home for a lack of effort in training. Reyna's parents — Claudio and Danielle Reyna, both former national team players — lobbied the U.S. Soccer Federation for more playing time for Gio and contacted the USSF about a three-decades-old domestic violence allegation involving Berhalter and the woman who later became his wife — Danielle's former college roommate. Asked if he'd do things differently if he had that chance again, Reyna told the AP: “Maybe in certain ways, but I'm not just going to sort of sit here and take all the blame for something that was made out to be completely my fault, which I believe it wasn't, and also my family's, too.” Reyna added the tensions “stemmed from” unhappiness with his game time. It's so far removed now and so far in the past, I don't even really want to talk about it any more.” Joining up there with his friend and U.S. teammate Joe Scally was “the cherry on top.” A litany of muscle injuries have stopped Reyna building momentum. His last three years at Dortmund saw him used as an impact substitute, loaned to Nottingham Forest, then benched for much of last season. Fitness issues have limited him to playing four of eight Bundesliga games at Gladbach so far. Even coming off the bench for Gladbach, Reyna said, is “still better than what I was doing last season most of the time.” With only four planned U.S. friendlies before the team's pre-World Cup camp, Reyna's main chance to impress is with Gladbach. Dortmund is known for developing talented youngsters but Reyna now wonders if he should have moved “a little bit earlier” for more game time. Reyna has had at least eight distinct injuries in the last five years. Most were soft tissue and muscle problems, with one leg fracture. Fitness issues have also limited his role with Bundesliga struggler Gladbach. “I've learned a lot about my body,” said Reyna. That means treating fitness work as more of a dialog with the club's athletic coaches and finding new ways to deal with the mental strain of yet another setback. “What I've learned now is, after those one or two days where (there's) obviously a lot of pain, a lot of downtime, down energy, you just have to get on with it. Reyna says he's taking on more responsibility on and off the field as he tries to fulfil his potential as a player. “I would love to look back in the future and say that it was a pivotal year, few years here,” he said. You have to turn the talking into action.” This material may not be published, broadcast, written or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>October 28 – FIFA has launched the second sales phase of World Cup tickets, with another one million tickets up for sale. Once the domestic exclusivity time slot ends, more fans will be eligible to obtain a buying slot starting on November 17. “This second phase, with its host country domestic exclusivity time slot, will allow us to say ‘thank you' to these local fans, while ensuring global opportunity as well.” The first sales phase – a Visa Presale Draw for qualifying Visa cardholders – drew worldwide interest with more than 4.5 million applicants. Even so, residents of the host countries bought more tickets than any other nation. FIFA has received heavy criticism for setting sky-high ticket prices and applying dynamic ticketing, a strategy where prices shift based on demand. The model was previously tested at the Club World Cup and means that ticket prices can climb as sales progress. On top of that, RTB (right to buy tickets) holders were mostly forced to purchase category one and category two tickets. FIFA expects to sell more than 6.5 million tickets for the tournament and generate $3 billion from ticket sales, including from the hospitality segment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Al Hilal, who opened their Club World Cup account with a brilliant performance against Real Madrid, will now take on Brazil's Fluminense in the last eight at the same venue on Friday. However, Simone Inzaghi's men should be allowed to enjoy the historic result in Orlando, where they rebounded from Bernando Silva's ninth-minute opener to completely turn the game on its head in a blitz right after half-time. First, Leonardo drew Al Hilal level with a headed rebound, before Joao Cancelo set Malcom free with a delicious through-ball for the Brazilian to race clear and finish expertly past compatriot Ederson in the City goal. The lead lasted only three minutes, though, Erling Haaland bundling home from Silva's corner. Remarkably, Al Hilal were back in front early into extra-time, when defender Kalidou Koulibaly rose highest to meet Ruben Neves' corner to head into the City net. Not to be deterred, Al Hilal then clinched the victory eight minutes from time. This time, a counter-attack ended with Ederson saving from Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, leaving Leonardo to prod home the winner. Al Hilal celebrated wildly after the final whistle and once progression was confirmed – as well they might. تشكيل أبطال أوروبا - هالاند يقود هجوم مانشستر سيتي أمام فياريال.. ومرموش بديل تشكيل أبطال أوروبا - هالاند يقود هجوم مانشستر سيتي أمام فياريال.. ومرموش بديل</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lionel Messi wants to play for Argentina in next year's World Cup, but he says he will listen to his body before deciding whether he can make that dream come true. Eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi told NBC News in an interview broadcast on Monday that he will see next year how his body feels before deciding on whether or not he can play in the World Cup co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. "And I'm going to assess that on a day-to-day basis when I start preseason next year with Inter and see if I can really be 100%, if I can be useful to the group, to the national team, and then make a decision." Messi, who has been playing professionally since 2004, wants the chance for one more star turn on football's biggest stage. "I'm really eager because it's a World Cup. We're coming off winning the last World Cup and being able to defend it on the field again is spectacular because it's always a dream to play with the national team, especially in official competitions." "The truth is that I like everything about living here," Messi said of Miami. "I spent a lot of time in Barcelona, which for me is an extraordinary city, where I grew up and had many spectacular moments, and which we miss a lot. Messi has 195 appearances for the Argentine national team, scoring 114 goals. (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</p>
