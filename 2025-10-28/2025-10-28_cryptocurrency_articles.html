                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two Massachusetts women recently lost a combined $6,700 to a "missed jury duty" phone scam that utilized Bitcoin ATMs, Norfolk County Sheriff Patrick McDermott said. According to the sheriff, there's been an increase in calls from scammers who claim to work for local law enforcement and demand money from residents who have supposedly missed jury duty. "The Norfolk County Sheriff's Office never makes calls like this, and neither do local police departments," McDermott said in a statement Wednesday. "Just hang up on anyone who is demanding money and acting like they are from our office, or another law enforcement agency, threatening you with arrest or detainment for things like 'missed jury duty' or an 'outstanding warrant.'" "She told our officer she was there to clear up an issue about missing jury duty after transferring the money as demanded," the sheriff said. Just 90 minutes later, the sheriff said a woman from Dedham came into the office to report that she paid a $1,450 "bond" through a Roslindale Bitcoin kiosk. The scammer reportedly sent her a "fraudulent court document to back up his claims," the sheriff said, and threatened that she'd be arrested and detained for 72 hours unless she paid immediately. The city of Gloucester recently banned Bitcoin ATMs, saying they're concerned the machines could be used by scammers to prey on elderly victims. And in Waltham this summer, a police officer stopped an elderly man from sending $12,000 to scammers via a Bitcoin machine. In August, the Federal Trade Commission warned that scammers pretending to be police are calling up Americans and directing them to fake websites to pay a fine for missing jury duty. "But every bit of this is a scam."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Consensys-backed Ethereum treasury firm SharpLink (ticker SBET) will deploy $200 million worth of its ETH stockpile into onchain strategies to generate yield. SharpLink's qualified custodian, Anchorage Digital, will oversee the deployment. "As a public entity operating at the forefront of Digital Asset Treasury ("DAT") innovation, SharpLink is leveraging Linea's institutional-grade infrastructure to make its ETH even more productive by unlocking scalable, secure, and composable ways to optimize onchain yield," the firm wrote. Ether.fi will act as SharpLink's primary staking solution while EigenCloud, a pioneer in the emerging restaking sector that allows secured assets to backstop multiple protocols, will enable the firm to participate in sectors like "verifiable AI, insured DeFi, and trustless infrastructure." "As this economy grows, so do yield opportunities for the institutional capital securing these apps, agents and services," Eigen Labs founder Sreeram Kannan said. We've created infrastructure for a new class of applications that couldn't be built without this combination of platforms." SharpLink is a frontrunner among ETH treasuries with approximately 860,000 tokens, according to The Block's data. The Minnesota-based firm also stacks LINEA tokens and plans to tokenize its SBET shares on Ethereum. Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

Opponents cite high energy consumption and noise pollution as major concerns, while supporters argue that mining brings jobs, investment, and tax revenue. “Some concerns are absolutely valid,” Stadelmann previously told Decrypt. “The industry hasn't always communicated well about its energy mix or community impact." He argued the key is to stop operating in isolation and start showing tangible local benefits like jobs, tax revenue, and support for renewable build-outs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SharpLink Gaming, one of the largest publicly traded holders of Ethereum, announced Tuesday that it plans to deploy $200 million in ETH from its treasury onto the Linea layer-2 network. The deployment will occur over multiple years using risk-managed strategies, the firm said in a statement, and will take place in collaboration with Linea creator Consensys. (Disclaimer: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.) The initiative enables SharpLink to generate enhanced yields on its ETH holdings through multiple sources: Native Ethereum staking rewards, restaking rewards from securing EigenCloud Autonomous Verifiable Services, and incentives from Linea and partner Ether.fi. SharpLink said that all operations will maintain institutional-grade security through its ETH custodian, Anchorage Digital Bank. “As one of the largest public holders of ETH, we manage our treasury with institutional rigor and discipline,” said SharpLink Co-CEO Joseph Chalom, in a statement. Chalom previously told Decrypt that the firm was weighing how best to tap into Linea for yield ahead of last month's launch of the LINEA token. SharpLink Makes First Ethereum Buy in Over a Month as ETH Holdings Top $3.5 Billion SharpLink is currently the second-largest publicly traded holder of Ethereum with nearly 860,000 ETH, or about $3.56 billion worth. Users on Myriad—a prediction market created by Decrypt's parent company, Dastan—remain bullish on ETH's next step, giving a nearly 79% chance of ETH rising to a price of $4,500 sooner than it can plunge to $3,100.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto analysts are calling Mine 2 Earn the next explosive meta after new mining crypto Pepenode slammed $1.96 million in its presale, inching closer to the $2 million milestone. PepeNode continues to gain strong traction among early investors who see it as the next big concept in crypto. The project reimagines the traditionally capital-intensive and highly competitive mining process as a strategic game, allowing users to earn passive yield by optimizing their virtual mining setups. Early supporters now have the chance to secure their stake in what could become the next major trend in crypto, with PEPENODE tokens currently priced at $0.0011227. However, in just two days, the price will increase as the project advances to its next funding stage, marking another step forward in its rapidly growing presale. P2E games were among the biggest trends in crypto during the pandemic era, when everyone was stuck at home and seeking new ways to earn while traditional work was on hold. For many, especially in countries like the Philippines, games like Axie Infinity have even become a source of livelihood, allowing players to convert their in-game tokens into fiat income through the daily grind. However, most of these ecosystems were built solely around earning and liquidating rewards, rather than sustaining long-term value. As a result, token prices often deflated, interest faded, and only those who genuinely loved the games remained active. To most observers, it may seem that the P2E movement has already faded after its glory days, but in reality, it has matured into an established sector within the broader cryptocurrency gaming space. And this is where PepeNode's tokenomics could give the P2E model, which once defined an era, a much-needed reboot, turning it into something sustainable, competitive, and fun again. With PepeNode, it's not about constant grinding or repetitive gameplay, as earnings depend on how well each player optimizes their virtual mining setup. Each node carries unique characteristics, and combining the right ones boosts a player's potential to earn more crypto. Upgrading facilities, like expanding the virtual mining room, can further increase yield. Now here's where PepeNode addresses the tokenomics problem that previous P2E projects struggled with. For every upgrade or node purchase, 70% of the tokens used are permanently burned. Additionally, tokens are recycled back into the system rather than being cashed out. They are the very tokens required for further upgrades and expansions, encouraging continued participation instead of mass sell-offs. Once a player's virtual mining setup reaches top-tier performance, it can even begin generating top meme coins such as Pepe (PEPE), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), and others as rewards. Early adopters can already generate yield, compounding their holdings long before the game goes live, giving them a solid stash of tokens to power up their virtual mining facilities once the ecosystem launches. So far, more than 1.2 billion PEPENODE tokens, or approximately 68% of all presale allocations, have been staked, demonstrating the confidence early supporters have in the project's long-term potential. Visit the official site to purchase today using ETH, BNB, USDT (ERC-20 and BEP-20), or credit/debit cards. To start earning PEPENODE tokens passively, you can stake with the project's native staking protocol, as mentioned.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The long-awaited approval of altcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) may not bring the massive inflows investors expect without participation from asset management giant BlackRock, according to market data. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF received $28.1 billion in investments in 2025, as the only fund with positive year-to-date (YTD) inflows, pushing total spot Bitcoin ETF inflows to a cumulative $26.9 billion. Without BlackRock's fund, the spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a cumulative net outflow of $1.27 billion year-to-date, according to K33's head of research, Vetle Lunde. The inflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs were the primary driver of Bitcoin (BTC) price momentum in 2025, Standard Chartered's global head of digital assets research, Geoff Kendrick, told Cointelegraph recently. BlackRock's absence may burst the bubble at altcoin ETF party “BlackRock is absent from the imminent altcoin ETF wave.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While panic dominates headlines, seasoned investors see opportunity: quality projects “on sale.” Digitap's live presale has positioned it as one of the best crypto presales in 2025. The project offers a true “omni-bank” solution, combining fiat banking, crypto payments, and global transfers under one roof. With more than $1 million raised in early rounds, Digitap's blend of fintech integration and blockchain transparency makes it one of the best cheap cryptos to buy now. Chainlink remains the leading decentralized oracle network, enabling smart contracts to access off-chain data securely. With over 98% of LINK held by long-term holders and exchange balances declining, analysts anticipate upside toward the $40–$45 range. It's a steady pick among the top 10 altcoins 2025, showing strength in both fundamentals and community trust. Polkadot continues to lead in blockchain interoperability, allowing seamless communication between networks. Recent on-chain data shows $172 million in DOT purchased over the past 24 hours, indicating renewed investor interest. As DeFi and Web3 ecosystems evolve, DOT's parachain structure could prove critical to cross-chain development. Formerly MATIC, Polygon (POL) continues to dominate Ethereum Layer-2 scaling, processing millions of transactions at minimal fees. Recently, Santander's Openbank launched regulated crypto trading in Germany using Polygon infrastructure, reaffirming its enterprise relevance. The project's consistent delivery and cross-chain compatibility give it resilience through market downturns. XRP has weathered regulatory storms to emerge as a compliant, scalable settlement network for cross-border payments. As tokenization of real-world assets gains traction, XRP remains one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in 2025 for exposure to fintech and payments infrastructure. The project's vision is ambitious: to build the future of money, a single app where users can hold, send, spend, and grow both cash and crypto seamlessly. Digitap combines bank-grade security with blockchain-level efficiency, positioning itself at the intersection of traditional finance and decentralized innovation. The app's upcoming Visa card, global payment tools, and multi-currency wallets target a market comprising over 560 million crypto users, 1.4 billion unbanked individuals, and the $250 trillion cross-border payments sector, as expected by 2027. As adoption of mobile-first finance accelerates, Digitap is tapping into what's next — a unified ecosystem where cash and crypto coexist without borders. Its mission is clear: bridge global finance, expand inclusion, and build the $TAP economy, a utility-driven network that powers real-world transactions, from freelancers to SMEs. With the crypto market down roughly 20%, investors have a window to accumulate quality projects before sentiment turns bullish. However, $TAP adds a powerful utility-driven edge, bridging traditional finance and DeFi, together with scheduled 600% growth during the presale.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Reliance Jio users head to the payment checkout page for bill settlement or recharge, they now see (Digital Rupee) listed as one of the payment options alongside conventional choices like credit/debit cards, wallets, net banking, and UPI-linked methods. This addition means that millions of Jio subscribers can now directly use the RBI-issued digital currency for everyday telecom transactions. The move is not just about adding one more payment channel. It signals the beginning of mainstream CBDC adoption in India, where a large private sector player like Jio has created a direct on-ramp for customers to use Digital Rupee seamlessly. It is designed to be used for retail and wholesale payments, offering faster settlement, reduced dependency on intermediaries, and greater efficiency for the financial system. With multiple pilot programs already underway in retail and wholesale markets, the RBI has been working with select banks and partners to test real-world use cases. However, its presence in consumer-facing transactions has remained limited so far. Jio's acceptance of Digital Rupee now changes that narrative by making it accessible to everyday users at scale. Reliance Jio has over 500 million subscribers, making it the largest telecom operator in India by user base. By enabling Digital Rupee payments across such a wide customer base, Jio effectively brings CBDC into the daily financial lives of a huge segment of Indians. Mass Awareness: Telecom payments are frequent and recurring, ensuring that users encounter the Digital Rupee option regularly. Scalability: With India's mobile-first economy, introducing CBDC through telecom payments can help the RBI test, track, and scale its rollout efficiently. Ecosystem Readiness: As other industries watch Jio's adoption, it may encourage e-commerce, retail, OTT, and fintech platforms to follow suit. In short, Jio's early integration could set the benchmark for CBDC use cases across sectors. Globally, countries from China to Nigeria are experimenting with Central Bank Digital Currencies to modernise payment infrastructure and reduce reliance on cash. India's Digital Rupee effort is particularly significant given the country's size, digital penetration, and the scale of its payment ecosystem dominated by UPI. Also Read: UPI Payment Limit Per Day Increased: Check Details While UPI remains the backbone of digital payments in India, the Digital Rupee is envisioned as a complementary alternative that offers greater security, instant settlement, and reduced costs for banks and merchants. For Reliance Jio, adopting Digital Rupee fits neatly into its broader digital-first strategy. The company has consistently positioned itself as a technology leader from pioneering affordable 4G, to driving 5G rollouts, to integrating cutting-edge payment options. If Jio's rollout sees traction, it could accelerate Digital Rupee adoption across utilities, retail chains, and even government services. As India continues to explore the future of money, Reliance Jio's latest move is not just about telecom payments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CLEVELAND, Ohio - The U.S. government is taking the final legal step to take ownership of $325,060 worth of cryptocurrency that was stolen in a scam that cost an elderly man and his sister from Bristolville over $1.6 million. Tether is a type of digital currency designed to keep a steady value, usually matching the U.S. dollar one-to-one. This stability makes it act like a digital dollar. These digital funds were traced to an address on the public digital ledger, or decentralized record book, that keeps track of where all the cryptocurrency goes. Federal officials argue the funds must be seized because they are the profits of wire fraud and were used in money laundering. The victims are identified in court documents by their initials: J.K., the elderly man from Trumbull County, and his sister, L.D. The fraud started in November 2024 with a text message to J.K. Using the username "Shaw Goddess," the scammer cultivated J.K.'s trust and persuaded him to invest in a fake cryptocurrency platform. He also convinced his sister, L.D., to invest an additional $600,000 in the same scheme. was told she had to pay a 10% tax upfront to get her money, J.K. became suspicious and realized they had been victims of a massive fraud. They successfully traced about 198,950 USDT of J.K.'s lost funds to the cryptocurrency address in question. The government argues the total balance of 325,060 USDT should all be seized because J.K.'s stolen money was mixed, or commingled, with other illegal funds, which counts as money laundering. The 325,060 USDT was frozen late last year by the company that issues Tether and was later formally seized by law enforcement. The Bristolville victims, J.K. and L.D., will not be able to directly object to the forfeiture, but they have a clear path to get their money back through the U.S. Department of Justice's remission process.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yesterday, leading credit rating agency S&P Global revealed its ‘B-' rating for Strategy, the world's largest Bitcoin treasury company. While the rating still falls under the agency's ‘speculative grade' investment, it establishes Strategy's status as a legitimate investment, although slightly riskier than those with higher ratings. And for the more risk-on retail investors, this also boosts attention on some of the best altcoins, particularly Bitcoin-related ones like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER). S&P released its ‘B-' credit rating for Strategy on October 27, citing its ‘high Bitcoin concentration, narrow business focus, weak risk-adjusted capitalization, and low US dollar liquidity,' as weaknesses. However, the agency added that it's confident that the Michael Saylor-led treasury company will continue to manage its debt well and finance payments of its debt and stock dividends. As such, the news has huge potential to pump $BTC. This institutional spotlight doesn't just benefit Strategy and Bitcoin, though, but could spill over to the broader crypto market. Bitcoin-related projects in particular, including those looking to expand the Bitcoin ecosystem, could attract more players looking for wider crypto exposure. Having recently surpassed $25M in presale, this crypto is proof of bubbling enthusiasm among retail investors. While crypto-related investments are deemed high-risk compared to more stable ones like bonds, they continue to attract investors because of their high yield potential. And no crypto has grabbed the headlines more than Bitcoin. But as the world's most valuable crypto, Bitcoin is not without its drawbacks. For one, it can only handle seven transactions per second (TPS), resulting in high transaction costs. In contrast, Solana can theoretically handle up to 65K TPS. $BTC's use is also limited to being a store of value. This means that you can't, for example, use your $BTC freely across programmable smart contracts and DeFi platforms — the type of utility that the best altcoins usually provide. It will also enable Solana-style smart contracts for various use cases, from lending platforms to meme coin launchpads. The new ecosystem will also feature a canonical bridge, which will enable you to send your $BTC from the main Bitcoin blockchain to the L2 and use it for things like staking, trading, and interacting with dApps. When the L2 launches, you'll be able to use $HYPER to pay for transaction fees, get perks like governance rights, and access exclusive early dApp rollouts. The token costs $0.013185, and still comes with dynamic staking rewards of up to 47% p.a. Our Bitcoin Hyper buying guide has easy step-by-step instructions. To date, this crypto fundraiser has received over $25M from early adopters. The project has even recorded massive whale buys of up to $379.9K, making it one of this year's best crypto presales if we're talking community trust and bullish momentum. A presale price increase is also due in less than two days.

While his position as a senior writer at PrivacyAffairs thought him valuable lessons about the power of self-management, his entire writing career was and is an exercise in self-improvement. Now, he's ready to sink his teeth into crypto and teach people how to take control of their own money on the blockchain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ferrari has just unveiled the world's first digital hypercar – a car that lives solely as an NFT, a digital file permanently embedded in the blockchain. It commemorates 76 years since Luigi Chinetti and Lord Selsdon won the 24 Hours of Le Mans with their 1949 166 MM Barchetta. Then, another “wing” connects the two tail fins, allowing wind to rush in and feed into a diffuser that has been painstakingly sculpted out to resemble a canyon. Classic Ferrari-style, four circular taillights sit right in the center of that bridge, glowing against a matte red background.

A thin band hovers above the splitter, with no evident means of support. The retractable headlights are scarcely visible beneath this band; when needed, they flip up in pairs. Then there are these vertical slashes etched into the sides, similar to those found on the new F80 hypercar, but they are deeper and expose the underlying structure, similar to staring at exposed bone. Ferrari built this special F76 just for a bunch of its Hyperclub members – a private group that's pretty keen on following the 499P Le Mans racing effort. These buyers get to choose from a few different liveries, wheels and interior trim options – but only at set times. Once they make their selection, the digital file gets locked down as a unique NFT. The dashboards in the images are quite plain, with no fancy screens or gauges to be found – just waiting for a game engine that may never be built. Algorithms grew the structure outward from a skeleton of requirements: minimum drag, maximum downforce, cooling for invisible engines. The result carries patents Ferrari plans to file. Metal versions of those ideas could appear on road cars within a decade. The result is a car that's got a whole bunch of patents waiting to be filed – and who knows, maybe one day we'll see some of these ideas turn up on road cars. Owners can keep it locked away safely in a digital wallet alongside their cryptocurrency, sell it to someone else on the secondary market or just park it in a virtual garage. The company's not saying how many of these things are out there, or what they cost either. Membership to the Hyperclub is by invitation only – and it looks like getting invited is a bit of a tricky business.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Asia seems to have definitely shifted into second gear in terms of crypto adoption. Today, it is a small Central Asian country, often discreet but strategically positioned, that marks its presence on the global digital map. Kyrgyzstan, with its majestic mountains and digital ambitions, has just taken a giant step into the world of crypto assets. In 2023, Kyrgyzstan had already surprised by supporting crypto mining despite a persistent energy crisis. This initiative is part of a broader strategy integrating a CBDC – the “digital som” – which will be tested in three phases, notably for social, state payments, and then offline mode. CBDC will be used for gov related payments, etc” This project is accompanied by a clear political will. President Sadyr Japarov, during the second National Council on Digital Assets, set an ambitious roadmap, ranging from blockchain infrastructure to legislation. Another major Kyrgyz innovation is based on the creation of a national crypto reserve, including BNB, but also potentially other tokens in the future. This reserve could well become a strategic pillar, complementing traditional monetary policies. The government has signed a partnership with Binance Academy to integrate blockchain into 10 local universities. Maximize your Cointribune experience with our "Read to Earn" program!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat representative from California's 17th Congressional District and vice-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, used an appearance on MSNBC to raise concerns around Trump's apparent conflict of interest with crypto via his son's crypto project World Liberty Financial (WLFI), alleging the recent pardoning of Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao was “blatant corruption.” “You've got a foreign billionaire who was basically engaged in money-laundering,” Khanna said of CZ, adding, “then he petitions for a pardon from Donald Trump after basically funneling money to terrorists.” However, CZ recently fired back at similar accusations from Senator Elizabeth Warren, claiming she “can't get her facts right.” CZ pleaded guilty to a single felony count of violating the US Bank Secrecy Act after failing to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program at Binance. Khanna alleged that the Binance co-founder was being let off the hook due to Binance's financial backing of WLFI — echoing recent sentiments from US Representative Maxine Waters. Khanna did not go into specific details of his legislative proposal, but did not mince his words, concluding by calling for a ban on “any elected official from having cryptocurrency and accepting foreign money.” According to government records, Khanna's latest bill has not yet been officially introduced. To provide context on how muddied the waters are, while Khanna has called out Trump's ties to crypto, he also has some vested interests of his own in the stock market, highlighting some potential hypocrisy.
